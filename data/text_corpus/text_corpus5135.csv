25675,quantifying hydrologic exchange fluxes hef at the river and subsurface interface and their residence times rt in subsurface are important for managing the water quality and ecosystem health in dynamic river corridor systems in this study a modeling framework is developed for coupling the three dimensional 3d multi phase surface subsurface flow transport and numerical tracer model for rt in a large scale river section over a long period the framework is utilized to evaluate the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rt for a 30 km section of the columbia river in washington state over a three year period based on comparisons between model simulations with and without considering hydrodynamic pressure we found that hydrodynamic pressure increases the net hefs by 7 with river gaining water from the subsurface domain and leads to slight reduction of rt keywords computational fluid dynamics cfd river flow model subsurface flow model subsurface residence time distribution rtd 1 introduction along a river corridor hydrologic exchanges move water between the river and the saturated and unsaturated sediments beneath the stream channel harvey and gooseff 2015 these hydrologic exchanges play an important role in river ecosystems because the mixing of the groundwater and river water supplies nutrients and substrate that drive biogeochemical reactions boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 gomez velez et al 2015 quantifying hydrologic exchange fluxes hef in a large river reach however is challenging given the size of the domain existing field measurement methods include direct measurements and inferences based on darcy s law mass balances and or heat transport equations kalbus et al 2006 however these measurement methods usually provide data limited to a single point or over a very small area and much of a large river channel cannot be accessed practically to obtain such measurements therefore to attain adequate representation of a reach a very large number of measurements must be taken which is extremely labor intensive and physically challenging subsurface residence time rt is the interval between the time when river water flows into the subsurface domain and then flows back into river in this study the name rt and rt distributions rtd all refer to the subsurface rt for short the rt and corresponding rtd of the water have been used widely as a master variable to evaluate the biochemical potential of groundwater river water mixing boano et al 2010 briggs et al 2014 gomez velez et al 2015 harvey et al 2013 zarnetske et al 2011 through stream tracer experiments rt can be measured quantitatively and the corresponding rtd can be derived statistically however the time measured through stream tracer is very hard to distinguish between subsurface and surface transient storage additionally similar as conducting hef measurements measuring rts and statistically determining rtds are extremely difficult for large scale natural rivers therefore the use of numerical modeling for both surface subsurface water and tracer transport has become a necessary alternative for studying hefs and rtds in large scale natural river sections tian et al 2015 hwang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 for kilometer scale river reaches and simulations of transient flows over long time periods limitations in computational resources steer most studies to the use of a one dimensional 1d cross section averaged river model or a two dimensional 2d depth averaged river model saint venant 1871 to model transient transport of surface water both 1d and 2d river models can provide only the hydrostatic pressures on the riverbed banda and seaid 2012 perkins and richmond 2004 which depends only on the water depth the hydrostatic pressure on the riverbed determined from a surface water model is used as a boundary conditions to drive subsurface flow transport simulations in these studies the non hydrostatic component of pressure induced by fluid dynamics were neglected chen et al 2012 2013 for simplicity in this paper the non hydrostatic component of pressure is called hydrodynamic pressure however laboratory scale experiments and their corresponding simulations have demonstrated that hydrodynamic pressure could lead to enhanced subsurface flow transport zhou and endreny 2013 sawyer et al 2011 endreny et al 2011a 2011b suggesting that hydrodynamic pressure or dynamical effects should not be neglected additionally the impacts of neglecting hydrodynamic pressure on estimations of rtd song et al 2019 are not clear for a large scale river section in previous work bao et al 2018 we explored an alternate approach for studying the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs for a large scale river in that approach we used a river subsurface three dimensional 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd model for simulations of 50 different steady state cases and transient behavior of the hefs on the riverbed was interpolated based on the steady state results however that approach is not appropriate for investigating the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on rtds because the transient subsurface 3d flow field cannot be accurately interpolated from steady state cases therefore a full 3d multi phase cfd river model hirt and nichols 1981 bayon et al 2016 that can determine the transient hydrodynamic pressure distribution is critical for evaluating the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtds our recent work chen et al 2021 has demonstrated a computationally efficient 3d multi phase cfd river modeling approach the model has been applied in a transient river flow simulation of a 30 km river section of the columbia river in washington state over a 5 year period and validated with onsite water surface elevation wse and velocity measurements in this study we developed a modeling framework that couples the new 3d transient surface river modeling approach chen et al 2021 with the pflotran subsurface transport model and particle tracking model this modeling framework was applied to investigate hefs and the rtd in a 6 km 7 5 km subdomain within the 30 km river section over a 3 year period to quantitatively identify the impact of the hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtd we conducted a reference simulation using only hydrostatic pressure to drive the subsurface flow transport simulation in the same domain and time period to our knowledge this is the first documented modeling approach and quantitative evaluation of the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtd for large scale natural river section over a long time period in section 2 we introduce the study domain and the modeling methodology including the surface and subsurface numerical simulation methods the coupling strategy and the particle tracking method to estimate the rtd the simulation results together with the comparison against the hydrostatic pressure driven subsurface flow transport simulation results are discussed in section 3 this study shows that without considering hydrodynamic pressure of the surface water flow the residence time is overestimated and this would impact the river carbon and nitrogen cycling therefore applying the model that considers the hydrodynamic pressure is important to accurate estimation of the residence times and the cumulative effect of hydrologic exchange fluxes on biogeochemical processes in river corridors additionally this study derived the primary relationship between the rtds and hydromorphic units hu hou et al 2020 for the investigated river section this may help the researchers to quickly identify the rtds according to the hu map in similar river reaches in the future 2 study domain and methodology 2 1 study domain the study domain is located along the columbia river the largest river in the pacific northwest region of the united states the drainage area is around 668 000 km2 and extends into seven u s states and one canadian province the location of the study domain is shown in fig 1 the columbia river section is at southeast of washington state as shown in the upper left corner of fig 1 and the lower left corner of fig 1 shows the section of the river known as the hanford reach which flows through the u s department of energy hanford site the study domain with the bathymetry and ground elevation is shown in the right part of fig 1 the bathymetry and ground elevation are from the lidar cracknell and hayes 2007 measured digital elevation model dem combined with columbia river bathymetry data coleman et al 2010 the horizontal resolution is 1 m and the vertical accuracy can reach 3 4 cm more details about the equipment methods of measurement and validation are available in coleman s reports coleman et al 2010 coleman 2009 the elevation is based on the north american vertical datum of 1988 nad88 the red block is the domain for openfoam opencfd 2017 river water modeling and the yellow block is the domain for pflotran hammond et al 2014 bisht et al 2017 lichtner et al 2017 subsurface water and transport modeling the river section in the red block is about 30 km and the subsurface modeling focuses on the 6 km 7 5 km domain yellow block there are six onsite measuring locations in this study domain to record the river wse as marked in fig 1 they are named as 100b 100n 100d locke island li 100h and 100f the measured wses were used for the river water modeling calibrations and validations 2 2 openfoam cfd for river surface water simulations we used the open source cfd software openfoam opencfd 2017 for the multi phase 3d transient river water flow simulations the numerical model solves the mass and momentum conservation equations for fluid dynamics the mass conservation equation is 1 ρ t ρ u 0 where ρ is the fluid density u is the velocity vector and t is time we used the volume of fluid method to track the water air interface of the river flow hirt and nichols 1981 deshpande et al 2012 yazdi et al 2010 the volume of fluid method uses a scalar field α to represent the fraction of liquid in each simulation grid in the scalar field α 1 means the grid cell is fully filled with water and α 0 means the grid cell is fully filled with air therefore the density and viscosity of each simulation grid cell can be calculated by ρ α ρ l 1 α ρ g and μ α μ l 1 α μ g ρ l and ρ g are the density of liquid and gas phases respectively the terms μ l and μ g are the viscosity of liquid and gas phases respectively the transportation of α is governed by 2 α t α u α 1 α u r 0 where u r is an artificial velocity used to reduce numerical diffusion and computational costs deshpande et al 2012 in this study we solved turbulent flow using a time averaged navier stokes equation with k ω shear stress transport model menter et al 2003 wilcox 2006 reynolds 1895 liu et al 2012 versteeg and malaasekera 1995 3 ρ u t ρ u u σκ α g ρ p t μ μ t u μ μ t u t 2 3 u i where σ is surface tension coefficient κ α α is the water air interface curvature and g is gravity acceleration ρ is the fluid density the term p t is the actual pressure in the fluid that can be directly measured by piezometer and is called total pressure in this study hydrostatic pressure is calculated by ρ g z where z is the water depth which is defined as the vertical distance from water free surface if the fluid is completely still the total pressure p t is equal to hydrostatic pressure ρ g z if the fluid is not still the fluid dynamics causes the pressure p t measured by piezometer not equal to hydrostatic pressure ρ g z and the difference p hd p t ρ g z is denoted as hydrodynamic pressure which is the non hydrostatic component of the pressure the term μt in the expression μ t a 1 ρk max a 1 ω b 1 f 2 2 s 2 is the dynamic turbulent eddy viscosity where in the expression k is turbulent kinetic energy and ω is specific dissipation rate the values of k and ω are determined through a k ω shear stress transport model menter et al 2003 wilcox 2006 reynolds 1895 liu et al 2012 versteeg and malaasekera 1995 for the boundary conditions on the solid surface riverbed the velocity in the first simulation grid next to the riverbed is estimated according to turbulence boundary layer theory for rough surfaces schlichting 1979 chen et al 2021 the inlet and outlet boundaries are marked with black arrows in fig 1 for this study we derived the inlet and outlet boundary conditions for the velocity and river stage from a previously calibrated cross section averaged river model 1d modular aquatic simulation system mass1 simulation richmond and perkins 2009 the inlet and outlet river flow velocity and stage boundary conditions for the openfoam transient full 3d river flow simulations are shown in fig 2 simulation between january 20 and february 16 in year 2011 period between dashed blue lines are used to calibrate openfoam surface water model for the riverbed roughness openfoam surface water model simulations for years 2013 2015 are used for generating the transient pressure and wetting information on the riverbed for the subsurface flow transport simulations there is no simulation for year 2014 so it is gray in fig 2 we provide more details about the methods used for the investigated river section simulations in our previous work chen et al 2021 2 3 pflotran for subsurface flow and transport simulations pflotran is an open source state of the art massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code hammond et al 2014 bisht et al 2017 lichtner et al 2017 subsurface variably saturated flow is governed by richard s equation richards 1931 4 φαη t ρ q q w 5 q kk r μ p t ρgz where φ is porosity α is the volume fraction of water or called as saturation similar as the surface flow model α 1 stands for full saturation α 0 stands for completely dry and the value between 0 and 1 stands for partial saturation ρ is water density and q is fluid velocity in the subsurface or darcy velocity the term k is the intrinsic saturated permeability and k r is the relative permeability the term g is acceleration of gravity z is height and q w is the source sink term in this study we used van genuchten capillary properties to estimate the relative permeability according to the relationships shown below genuchten 1980 6 k r s e 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 7 s e 1 p i p g 0 p n m 8 s e α s r 1 s r where s e is effective saturation p g 0 is the atmospheric pressure s r is the residual saturation p i is the inverse of air entry pressure and m and n are shape factors of the soil water characteristics which are related by m 1 1 n finite volume discretization method is used to solve all the governing equations more detailed explanations about governing equations and numerical approaches in pflotran subsurface model are in the theory guide which is available at www pflotran org the top boundary of the subsurface simulation domain is the riverbed matching the one used in the surface river water modeling described in section 2 3 therefore the total pressure p t and volume fraction of water α were imported from openfoam surface river water modeling more details about the surface and subsurface water simulation coupling and the boundary conditions are discussed in section 2 4 2 4 coupling of river surface water and subsurface water simulations in this study we modeled the surface and subsurface as two separate domains as shown in fig 3 a for the surface water subdomain we used openfoam to simulate the transient full 3d river flow by solving the equations introduced in section 2 2 which model both the water phase and air phase the surface modeling domain is in region defined by dotted lines as shown in fig 3 a pressure outlet boundary condition is applied on the side and top boundary of the surface modeling domain as marked in fig 3 a the river surface water cross section is shown in light blue and the air above is depicted in light gray the bottom boundary riverbed for the surface water simulation domain is fluid non slip boundary condition with calibrated surface roughness more details about the calibration of surface roughness on the riverbed for the surface water model is reported in our previous work chen et al 2021 as discussed in section 2 2 we used the full 3d multi phase cfd model to simulate the surface domain over the 2013 2015 time period the total pressure p t and volume fraction of water α distribution on the riverbed coupling boundary see the red line in fig 3 a was extracted from the simulation results on an hourly time interval the subsurface subdomain was modeled by pflotran as described in section 2 3 the subsurface domain is bounded by the solid black line in fig 3 a the dark blue area represents the saturated zone and the dark gray area represents the unsaturated subsurface region the land surface of the investigated area is barren land with limited buildings the atmospheric pressure boundary is applied on the dry soil surface and precipitation is neglected the four side walls boundary conditions ambient ground water are derived from the reach scale subsurface simulation shuai et al 2019 and the bottom boundary is no flux boundary as marked in fig 3 a for the top boundary riverbed of subsurface domain we used the hourly total pressure p t and volume fraction of water distribution α on the riverbed extracted from openfoam simulation to assign the total pressure as boundary conditions for pflotran riverbed cells that have surface water on top assuming α 0 8 for the simulation we used linear interpolation to estimate the pressure and volume fraction of the water values between the two imported distributions at intermediate time steps the surface domain covers a much larger area than the subsurface domain the red and yellow blocks shown in fig 1 we used this coupling strategy to avoid influence of inlet and outlet boundary effects in the surface water flow simulation on the subsurface flow transport simulation the strategy therefore is a one way coupling approach because fluxes on the riverbed do not feed back into the surface flow region the strategy is based on the assumption that the magnitude of the hef volumetric flux 0 075 m3 s is negligible compared to the river discharge 1000 7000 m3 s chen et al 2021 in the investigated river channel during 2013 2015 this is common for the large scale river reach if using the two way coupling strategy it means the hefs on the riverbed derived from subsurface flow simulation will be deployed as wall flux boundary condition for the surface flow simulation because this flux is very slow which is around 1 10 5 m s or even slower bao et al 2018 it is supposed to have very limited effects on the surface flow simulation in this situation the pressure distribution which is derived from the surface flow simulation would be almost the same as the no flux wall boundary condition and then there should be no further impact on the subsurface flow simulation additionally the two way couple for the surface and subsurface flow simulation can be very computationally expensive it is usually only applicable for small scale less than 10 m and fully saturated domain which simplifies the simulation to water only single phase flow simulation li et al 2020 shows the two way coupling approach for a small flow domain and studied the hefs in very shallow subsurface region which is around 20 cm deep the flow path in the subsurface region is also at the 10 cm scale therefore for the large scale river reach surface subsurface flow simulation the two way coupling is still not affordable and also not necessary if the study focuses on the reach scale flow transport to quantitatively identify the effects of the hydrodynamic pressure on subsurface flow transport the hydrostatic pressure ρ g z is extracted from the same openfoam 3d multi phase transient river water flow simulation instead of using the total pressure p t the extracted hydrostatic pressure is assigned as boundary conditions for pflotran riverbed cells that have surface water on top assuming α 0 8 this scenario is called hydrostatic pressure openfoam pflotran simulation and is noted as ofpstatic for short correspondingly the subsurface flow transport simulation driven by the total pressure is called total pressure openfoam pflotran simulation and is noted as ofptotal for short 2 5 particle tracking model for subsurface water transport to quantify the rtd we adopted a classical semi analytical particle tracking scheme pollock 1994 to simulate the hydrological exchange pathways this forward particle tracking scheme tracks particles from one cell to the next until the particle satisfies a termination criterion e g a particle reaches a model boundary or the vadose zone to reduce the sensitivity of results to the spatial and temporal sampling 100 million numerical particles were released from 100 thousand locations on the riverbed over 1000 times from october 2013 to october 2014 we conducted convergence tests to ensure that the number of released particles were large enough to provide consistent results we defined the particle rt as the period that elapsed between the time a particle entered the riverbed and then exited back into the river channel particle rts were weighted by the fluxes corresponding to the location and time when it was released to estimate the cumulative rtd crtd as 9 f rt t f ˆ rt t i 1 n v i l t i t i 1 n v i where f ˆ rt t is the empirical cumulative distribution n is the number of particles v i is the darcy flux when and where the particle i is released t i is the particle rt l t i t is the indicator of event t i t the crtd f rt t then was used to derive the rtd f rt t as 10 f rt t d dt f rt t 3 results 3 1 river surface water simulations and validation the horizontal dimension of the river surface water simulation domain is 20 km 12 km with a water depth ranging from 0 m to 20 m to balance the computational costs and accuracy of transient cfd simulation for long time periods i e years in the large river reach we used uniform structured rectangular hexahedron cells to mesh the study domain two mesh resolutions for openfoam surface water simulation have been tested one fine mesh is 20 20 0 5m and one coarse mesh is 20 20 1m between the two mesh resolution simulation results the mean difference root mean square difference and corresponding correlation coefficients r2 are 0 03 m 0 1 m and 0 9987 respectively the uncertainty of the observation data for water stage is 0 032 m so the uncertainty attributed from mesh resolution is of the similar order of observation data more details about the mesh resolution are in our previous work chen et al 2021 therefore all the simulation in this study adopted the mesh resolution of 20 m in the horizontal directions 1 m in the vertical direction a totally 1 2 million grids are used for the whole surface water simulation domain a distributed roughness field on the riverbed was calibrated to match modeled wses with observed wses at six locations as shown in fig 1 we used observations of wse data in 2011 fig 2 regions between dashed blues lines january 20 to february 16 2011 to calibrate the openfoam surface water cfd model through adjustments of riverbed roughness parameters the comparison of the wse time series in 2011 is shown in fig 4 a the colored solid lines are openfoam simulated wses at different observation locations and the black doted lines are the observed wses only wses from january 20 to february 16 were used for riverbed roughness calibrations we used wses from may to december 2011 to validate the short term predictions which used the same calibrated roughness values without further adjustments the relative mean error to water depth at each measuring location i e 100b 100n li 100h and 100f are 2 3 2 3 2 13 2 6 and 1 44 respectively to clearly show the comparison between the openfoam surface water simulation and on site observation two zoom in time periods may 15 may 25 2011 and nov 15 nov 25 2011 are shown in the inserted sub figures in fig 4 a the openfoam surface water simulation can match the on site observation very well with the same calibrated roughness the model simulated the surface water flow for the long term period spanning 2013 to 2015 for this long term prediction the observation data is available at location 100b for only the limited duration shown by the black line shown in fig 4 b the wse simulated by the openfoam can match the available observation data very well and the relative mean error to is 4 6 two zoom in time periods may 15 may 25 2013 and nov 15 nov 25 2013 are shown in the inserted sub figures in fig 4 b additionally the model prediction was also compared with boat towed acoustic doppler current profiler adcp measurements niehus et al 2014 the adcp data recorded the short term velocity profile at 12 cross sections in the river on march 4th and april 1st 2011 the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 between the simulated velocity and the adcp measurement is around 0 7 0 8 at the 9 cross sections out of 12 in the river the r2 for the 3 rest of the cross sections is around 0 5 considering the adcp measurements contains a lot of noise induced by small scale turbulence measurement uncertainty from boat movement le et al 2019 khosronejad et al 2016 the cfd simulation results are reliable for this investigated river section and time period we provide detailed discussions about model implementation calibration and validation in our previously work chen et al 2021 3 2 subsurface water and transport after validating the surface river water simulation for years 2013 2015 as discussed above we extracted the hourly total pressures p t hydrostatic pressure ρ g z and volume fractions of water α on the riverbed and imported the data into pflotran as described in section 2 4 the modeled subsurface domain includes four main soil types as shown in fig 5 a four main soil types comprise the subsurface hanford taylor flats ringold e and ringold lm the permeability and porosity for these four soil types are listed in table 1 newcomb and brown 1961 newcomb et al 1972 thorne et al 2006 zachara et al 2012 usdoe 2010 the pflotran subsurface simulation used structured grid the sensitivity of pflotran simulated hefs to model grid resolution has been studied and discussed in shuai et al work shuai et al 2019 for the similar modeling domain in that study shuai et al 2019 various grid resolutions were tested under the same boundary and river flow conditions it was found that the simulation results are more sensitive to the vertical grid resolution than the horizontal resolution and 100 m horizontal resolution and 2 m vertical resolution already can provide reliable hefs estimation for the same investigated river section in this study a higher resolution is used 10 m horizontal and 1 m vertical resolution to better capture the pressure distribution on the riverbed from surface flow simulation and there are totally about 15 million cells for the study domain pflotran subsurface simulations were implemented on 1536 cores of high performance computing hpc cluster on the cascade supercomputer at the william r wiley environmental molecular sciences laboratory emsl 2020 24 h wall clock computational time can complete approximately 1 month of solution time for validating the pflotran subsurface flow transport simulation of the investigated area the model predictions on ground water elevations are compared to fifteen in land well observations the locations and the names of the fifteen in land wells are marked on fig 5 a the comparison between the pflotran subsurface flow transport simulation predicted in land water elevation and the well observations for four example in land wells are shown in fig 5 b the simulation results include both ofptotal and ofpstatic scenarios the pflotran simulated in land well water elevation can match the observations red lines in fig 5 b fairly well the in land ground water elevation from ofptotal is noted as h g w o f p t o t a l for short and ground water elevation from ofpstatic is noted as h g w o f p s t a t i c h g w o f p t o t a l as the blue lines shown in fig 5 b is more accurate than h g w o f p s t a t i c black lines especially in well 199 h4 13 h g w o f p s t a t i c causes more overestimated in land well water elevation than h g w o f p t o t a l the root mean square errors rmses between h g w o f p t o t a l and the in land well observation for all the fifteen wells are marked in fig 5 a in green color and the averaged rmse for all the fifteen wells is 0 4 m the rmses for h g w o f p s t a t i c for the fifteen wells are marked in fig 5 a in orange color and the averaged rmse for all the fifteen wells is 0 5 m the ratio between hydrodynamic pressure and hydrostatic pressure on riverbed which is the relative differences between the total pressure and hydrostatic pressure p hd ρ g z p t ρ g z ρ g z are shown in fig 6 a for three time snapshots jun 2nd 2014 1 00 low stream flow sep 22nd 2014 high stream flow and sep 28th 2014 19 00 medium stream flow the positive value red color represents the total pressure is higher than the hydrostatic pressure and the negative value blue color represents the total pressure is lower than the hydrostatic pressure in the center of main river channels the ratio is about 1 which means that the total pressure is almost the same as hydrostatic pressure near the shoreline or in the secondary channels the ratio is around 10 to 40 which means that the total pressure is 10 40 lower than the hydrostatic pressure hefs on the riverbed are compared between the two simulation scenarios for the same three snapshots as shown in fig 6 b and c hefs estimations from ofpstatic simulation are shown in fig 6 b and hefs on the riverbed using ofptotal simulation are shown in fig 6 c negative values represent downwelling fluxes on the riverbed which means river water is moving into the subsurface domain positive flow values represent upwelling fluxes which means subsurface water is flowing back into the river in the center of river channels the upwelling fluxes estimated by ofptotal simulation fig 6 c is lower than the ofpstatic simulation fig 6 b though the total pressure is very similar to hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 6 a this is mainly due to the ground water elevation from the ofpstatic simulation is higher than the ofptotal simulation the differences of ground water head δ h g w h g w o f p t o t a l h g w o f p s t a t i c between ofptotal and ofpstatic are shown in fig 6 d in most areas the ground water head difference δ h g w is less than zero which means h g w o f p t o t a l h g w o f p s t a t i c this is consistent with the comparison to the in land well observation as discussed and shown in fig 5 b near the shoreline or shallow area the hydrodynamic pressure makes total pressure lower than the hydrostatic pressure which leads to the downwelling fluxes in those areas estimated by ofptotal simulation fig 6 c to be lower than the ofpstatic simulation fig 6 b as well the spatial averaged hefs time series for ofptotal and ofpstatic simulations are shown in fig 7 the inserted figures in fig 7 are the zoom in time period june 1st june 30th 2014 for clearly showing the differences between ofptotal and ofpstatic simulations the downwelling and upwelling hefs are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the temporal average of the downwelling hefs is 0 0048 m h for ofpstatic and 0 0041 m h for ofptotal which means that considering hydrodynamic pressure reduces the downwelling hefs by 15 the temporal average of the upwelling hefs is 0 0061 m h for ofpstatic and 0 0055 m h for ofptotal which means that considering hydrodynamic pressure reduces the upwelling hefs by 10 therefore for the net hefs as shown in fig 7 c considering hydrodynamics increase net hefs by 7 from 0 00137 m h ofpstatic to 0 00146 m h ofptotal which means the investigated subsurface domain loses 7 more water estimated by ofptotal this is also the reason why the ground water elevation is lower in ofptotal simulation and it makes the estimated ground water elevation slightly matches the in land well observation data better as shown in fig 5 b 3 3 particle tracking and rtd using the transient subsurface water transport simulation results discussed in section 3 2 we extracted all hourly subsurface flow velocity data and then imported it into the particle tracking model as described in section 2 5 all trajectories in the subsurface domain for particles released during the simulated time period are shown in fig 8 a trajectories represented by cold colors i e dark purple represent shorter rts while warm colors i e yellow represent longer rts to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of the hydrodynamic pressure on the rt we used the rtd as discussed in section 2 5 to summarize all trajectories between 2014 and 2015 statistically additionally based on the work of hou et al 2020 the investigated river section can be divided into several sub domains according seven hydromorphic units hu classes that include run fast glide pool slow glide riffle transition slack water and riffle the distribution of these hus in the investigated domain are shown in fig 8 b the impacts of the hydrodynamic pressure also are evaluated for each hu the rtds of each hu and the whole study domain for the hydrostatic pressure openfoam pflotran and total pressure openfoam pflotran simulated subsurface flows are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively the gray areas are the original probability distributions to more clearly illustrate the mostly likely rts we used a gaussian mixture model santosh 2013 to decompose the original probability distributions into three modes shown as the green blue and red dashed lines please note that all the differences on the rtds shown in fig 9 a and b are caused by the hydrodynamic pressure on the riverbed generally the hydrodynamic pressure in ofptotal simulation shorten the rts as shown in whole reach subplot in fig 9 a and b with considering the hydrodynamic pressure in ofptotal simulation the probability for rt around less than 1 day is higher red dash line and the probability for rt around 10 days is lower blue dash line this is mainly due to the hydrodynamic pressure causes more frequent local pressure variations due to small riverbed concaveness convexness and turbulence vortexes for each hu class hydrodynamic pressure has more impact on certain hu classes for example in the hu slack water class hydrodynamic pressure reduces the mostly likely rt from hundreds of days to a few hours this is mainly because the locations of the slack water class in the investigated river reach has suppressed downwelling fluxes by hydrodynamic pressure particles released in the slack water regions do not flow fast enough and were easier to be pulled back to nearby upwelling fluxes river channels and flow back to the river stream in other hu class the hydrodynamic pressure does not significantly decrease the rt of the highest peak probability but increase the probability at the short rt areas which is captured by the red dash line in fig 9 a and b especially for hu classes pool and slow slide another impact from the hydrodynamic pressure is increase the area that has very short rt as shown in riffle transition hu class without considering hydrodynamic pressure there is almost no area has the rt shorter than 0 1 day as shown in fig 9 a riffle transition subplot however with hydrodynamic pressure there is noticeable area has rt shorter than 0 1 day as shown in fig 9 b riffle transition subplot 4 conclusions and discussion in this study we demonstrated the one way coupled river and subsurface water transport models to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtds for a large scale river section over a long time period the main challenges for using total pressure as boundary conditions for subsurface simulation is calculating the total pressure from surface flow simulation to accurately obtain both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure the surface flow simulation needs to be the fully 3 dimensional and multi phase flow cfd model which can explicitly capture the sharp liquid air interface for the river modeling for capturing the sharp liquid air interface the flow simulation needs relatively fine mesh and the time step also needs to be very short to avoid numerical diffusion on the liquid air interface in this study the time step interval for the surface flow simulation is around 1 s considering simulating the years of the river flow this is very computational expansive to our knowledge this is the first reporting of results that conduct years of river flow simulation using the fully 3 dimensional and multi phase flow cfd model for getting both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure we used river and subsurface water transport models both of which are full 3d transient multi phase models the river surface water flow model can provide detailed transient hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the riverbed for a high resolution bathymetry covering a long section of river 30 km over a long period 3 years although still computationally expensive using the capacity of an hpc cluster makes running the model computationally affordable for the investigated domain and period the computational cost of the surface water simulation was approximately 1 million cpu core hours on the hpc cluster used in this study on the cascade supercomputer at the william r wiley environmental molecular sciences laboratory emsl 2020 the parallel computational speedup can keep almost linear with number of cpu cores when it is equal or less than 256 when increase the number of cpu cores from 256 to 512 the simulation speed is increased around 50 the speedup for further increasing the number of cpu cores decrease rapidly therefore all the surface flow simulation cases are implemented on 512 cpu cores and one day of wall clock computing time can simulate about one month solution time for larger simulation river domain which may involve more simulation grids linear speedup regime can be further improved to over 1000 cpu cores please note that the parallel computation speedup or scalability may vary on different hpc cluster systems the subsurface flow model used the 3 year transient pressure and saturation distribution as boundary conditions to drive the subsurface transport simulation to our knowledge this is the first reporting of results that used the total pressure including both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure as boundary conditions for a long 3 year period subsurface simulation the computational cost of the subsurface simulation was approximately 1 3 million cpu core hours on the hpc cluster used in this study the subsurface flow simulator pflotran provides very high efficiency on parallel computing it has been applied in an extended river reach area for approximately 75 km columbia river shuai et al 2019 it can keep near linear speedup until 3000 cpu cores hammond et al 2014 in this study the simulated subsurface domain only covers around 10 km so about 1500 cpu cores were used in the subsurface simulation cases to balance the computational efficiency and the job queuing time in the hpc system as discussed about the subsurface flow simulation mesh resolution in section 3 2 the simulated hefs are more sensitive to the vertical grid resolution than the horizontal resolution therefore with sacrificing of certain detailed pressure variation on the riverbed in finer scale coarsening the horizontal resolution from current 10 m to 20 or even 40 m would significantly reduce the computational cost for the subsurface flow simulation such adjustment should be considered when adopt this simulation framework to larger investigated river reach domain and or longer time period the main goal of implementing the high fidelity 3 d multi phase flow cfd simulation for the surface flow is deriving the pressure distribution and variation on the riverbed to drive subsurface flow simulation this computational expensive effort potentially can be replaced by the machine learning ml based approach that couples the auto encoder decoder networks and recurrent neural network kim et al 2019 the ml based approach could generate and synthesis pressure distribution and variation on the riverbed according to given reverbed geometry and river flow rate without running complex cfd simulation the networks in the ml based approach could be trained by the existing short term cfd results in 2011 cfd simulation data in this study and then the trained ml approach can efficiently predict the pressure distribution and variation in 2012 2015 which can significantly reduce the computational cost based on our simulation results hydrodynamic pressure slightly increases the net flux into river by 7 for the investigated time period the slightly increased net flux leads to lower ground water level 10 cm on average in ofptotal simulations which is more consistent with the in land well observation data the particle tracking model provides for direct measurement of the rt of the water in the subsurface domain by tracking 100 million particles rtds were derived for the simulations both with ofptotal and without ofpstatic considering hydrodynamic pressure the hydrodynamic pressure shortens the overall rts in the investigated domain comparing to the ofpstatic simulation results with considering the hydrodynamic pressure the probability for rt around less than 1 day is increased from 0 2 to 0 25 and the probability for rt around 10 days is decreased from 0 5 to 0 4 for the slack water hu class the hydrodynamic pressure reduces the mostly likely rt from a few hundred days to a few hours in the area of riffle transition hu class the hydrodynamic pressure increases noticeable region that the rt short than 0 1 day this indicates that for the river section we investigated the hydrodynamic pressure should not be neglected and future subsurface reaction transport studies should consider the reduced rt as the control factor in the reach scale modeling the detailed flow and transport cannot be captured so the rtd and or mean of rt from this work can be directly used in the reach scale flow and reactive transport modeling additionally the rtd is related to the hydromorphic units so it is possible that the rtd can be applied to the different river reach for the corresponding hu without running such computationally expensive simulations the transferability of rtd will be investigated in our future study please note that one of the main goals of this study is designed to provide upscaling information such as rtd to reach scale modeling so it cannot include all the small scale hyporheic zone flow transport munz et al 2011 in small scale such as less than 10 by 10 m area the morphology of sediments may lead to strong and high frequent hefs in the shallow hyporheic zone which may further lead to very short rts availability of data and software the surface water cfd

25675,quantifying hydrologic exchange fluxes hef at the river and subsurface interface and their residence times rt in subsurface are important for managing the water quality and ecosystem health in dynamic river corridor systems in this study a modeling framework is developed for coupling the three dimensional 3d multi phase surface subsurface flow transport and numerical tracer model for rt in a large scale river section over a long period the framework is utilized to evaluate the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rt for a 30 km section of the columbia river in washington state over a three year period based on comparisons between model simulations with and without considering hydrodynamic pressure we found that hydrodynamic pressure increases the net hefs by 7 with river gaining water from the subsurface domain and leads to slight reduction of rt keywords computational fluid dynamics cfd river flow model subsurface flow model subsurface residence time distribution rtd 1 introduction along a river corridor hydrologic exchanges move water between the river and the saturated and unsaturated sediments beneath the stream channel harvey and gooseff 2015 these hydrologic exchanges play an important role in river ecosystems because the mixing of the groundwater and river water supplies nutrients and substrate that drive biogeochemical reactions boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 gomez velez et al 2015 quantifying hydrologic exchange fluxes hef in a large river reach however is challenging given the size of the domain existing field measurement methods include direct measurements and inferences based on darcy s law mass balances and or heat transport equations kalbus et al 2006 however these measurement methods usually provide data limited to a single point or over a very small area and much of a large river channel cannot be accessed practically to obtain such measurements therefore to attain adequate representation of a reach a very large number of measurements must be taken which is extremely labor intensive and physically challenging subsurface residence time rt is the interval between the time when river water flows into the subsurface domain and then flows back into river in this study the name rt and rt distributions rtd all refer to the subsurface rt for short the rt and corresponding rtd of the water have been used widely as a master variable to evaluate the biochemical potential of groundwater river water mixing boano et al 2010 briggs et al 2014 gomez velez et al 2015 harvey et al 2013 zarnetske et al 2011 through stream tracer experiments rt can be measured quantitatively and the corresponding rtd can be derived statistically however the time measured through stream tracer is very hard to distinguish between subsurface and surface transient storage additionally similar as conducting hef measurements measuring rts and statistically determining rtds are extremely difficult for large scale natural rivers therefore the use of numerical modeling for both surface subsurface water and tracer transport has become a necessary alternative for studying hefs and rtds in large scale natural river sections tian et al 2015 hwang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 for kilometer scale river reaches and simulations of transient flows over long time periods limitations in computational resources steer most studies to the use of a one dimensional 1d cross section averaged river model or a two dimensional 2d depth averaged river model saint venant 1871 to model transient transport of surface water both 1d and 2d river models can provide only the hydrostatic pressures on the riverbed banda and seaid 2012 perkins and richmond 2004 which depends only on the water depth the hydrostatic pressure on the riverbed determined from a surface water model is used as a boundary conditions to drive subsurface flow transport simulations in these studies the non hydrostatic component of pressure induced by fluid dynamics were neglected chen et al 2012 2013 for simplicity in this paper the non hydrostatic component of pressure is called hydrodynamic pressure however laboratory scale experiments and their corresponding simulations have demonstrated that hydrodynamic pressure could lead to enhanced subsurface flow transport zhou and endreny 2013 sawyer et al 2011 endreny et al 2011a 2011b suggesting that hydrodynamic pressure or dynamical effects should not be neglected additionally the impacts of neglecting hydrodynamic pressure on estimations of rtd song et al 2019 are not clear for a large scale river section in previous work bao et al 2018 we explored an alternate approach for studying the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs for a large scale river in that approach we used a river subsurface three dimensional 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd model for simulations of 50 different steady state cases and transient behavior of the hefs on the riverbed was interpolated based on the steady state results however that approach is not appropriate for investigating the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on rtds because the transient subsurface 3d flow field cannot be accurately interpolated from steady state cases therefore a full 3d multi phase cfd river model hirt and nichols 1981 bayon et al 2016 that can determine the transient hydrodynamic pressure distribution is critical for evaluating the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtds our recent work chen et al 2021 has demonstrated a computationally efficient 3d multi phase cfd river modeling approach the model has been applied in a transient river flow simulation of a 30 km river section of the columbia river in washington state over a 5 year period and validated with onsite water surface elevation wse and velocity measurements in this study we developed a modeling framework that couples the new 3d transient surface river modeling approach chen et al 2021 with the pflotran subsurface transport model and particle tracking model this modeling framework was applied to investigate hefs and the rtd in a 6 km 7 5 km subdomain within the 30 km river section over a 3 year period to quantitatively identify the impact of the hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtd we conducted a reference simulation using only hydrostatic pressure to drive the subsurface flow transport simulation in the same domain and time period to our knowledge this is the first documented modeling approach and quantitative evaluation of the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtd for large scale natural river section over a long time period in section 2 we introduce the study domain and the modeling methodology including the surface and subsurface numerical simulation methods the coupling strategy and the particle tracking method to estimate the rtd the simulation results together with the comparison against the hydrostatic pressure driven subsurface flow transport simulation results are discussed in section 3 this study shows that without considering hydrodynamic pressure of the surface water flow the residence time is overestimated and this would impact the river carbon and nitrogen cycling therefore applying the model that considers the hydrodynamic pressure is important to accurate estimation of the residence times and the cumulative effect of hydrologic exchange fluxes on biogeochemical processes in river corridors additionally this study derived the primary relationship between the rtds and hydromorphic units hu hou et al 2020 for the investigated river section this may help the researchers to quickly identify the rtds according to the hu map in similar river reaches in the future 2 study domain and methodology 2 1 study domain the study domain is located along the columbia river the largest river in the pacific northwest region of the united states the drainage area is around 668 000 km2 and extends into seven u s states and one canadian province the location of the study domain is shown in fig 1 the columbia river section is at southeast of washington state as shown in the upper left corner of fig 1 and the lower left corner of fig 1 shows the section of the river known as the hanford reach which flows through the u s department of energy hanford site the study domain with the bathymetry and ground elevation is shown in the right part of fig 1 the bathymetry and ground elevation are from the lidar cracknell and hayes 2007 measured digital elevation model dem combined with columbia river bathymetry data coleman et al 2010 the horizontal resolution is 1 m and the vertical accuracy can reach 3 4 cm more details about the equipment methods of measurement and validation are available in coleman s reports coleman et al 2010 coleman 2009 the elevation is based on the north american vertical datum of 1988 nad88 the red block is the domain for openfoam opencfd 2017 river water modeling and the yellow block is the domain for pflotran hammond et al 2014 bisht et al 2017 lichtner et al 2017 subsurface water and transport modeling the river section in the red block is about 30 km and the subsurface modeling focuses on the 6 km 7 5 km domain yellow block there are six onsite measuring locations in this study domain to record the river wse as marked in fig 1 they are named as 100b 100n 100d locke island li 100h and 100f the measured wses were used for the river water modeling calibrations and validations 2 2 openfoam cfd for river surface water simulations we used the open source cfd software openfoam opencfd 2017 for the multi phase 3d transient river water flow simulations the numerical model solves the mass and momentum conservation equations for fluid dynamics the mass conservation equation is 1 ρ t ρ u 0 where ρ is the fluid density u is the velocity vector and t is time we used the volume of fluid method to track the water air interface of the river flow hirt and nichols 1981 deshpande et al 2012 yazdi et al 2010 the volume of fluid method uses a scalar field α to represent the fraction of liquid in each simulation grid in the scalar field α 1 means the grid cell is fully filled with water and α 0 means the grid cell is fully filled with air therefore the density and viscosity of each simulation grid cell can be calculated by ρ α ρ l 1 α ρ g and μ α μ l 1 α μ g ρ l and ρ g are the density of liquid and gas phases respectively the terms μ l and μ g are the viscosity of liquid and gas phases respectively the transportation of α is governed by 2 α t α u α 1 α u r 0 where u r is an artificial velocity used to reduce numerical diffusion and computational costs deshpande et al 2012 in this study we solved turbulent flow using a time averaged navier stokes equation with k ω shear stress transport model menter et al 2003 wilcox 2006 reynolds 1895 liu et al 2012 versteeg and malaasekera 1995 3 ρ u t ρ u u σκ α g ρ p t μ μ t u μ μ t u t 2 3 u i where σ is surface tension coefficient κ α α is the water air interface curvature and g is gravity acceleration ρ is the fluid density the term p t is the actual pressure in the fluid that can be directly measured by piezometer and is called total pressure in this study hydrostatic pressure is calculated by ρ g z where z is the water depth which is defined as the vertical distance from water free surface if the fluid is completely still the total pressure p t is equal to hydrostatic pressure ρ g z if the fluid is not still the fluid dynamics causes the pressure p t measured by piezometer not equal to hydrostatic pressure ρ g z and the difference p hd p t ρ g z is denoted as hydrodynamic pressure which is the non hydrostatic component of the pressure the term μt in the expression μ t a 1 ρk max a 1 ω b 1 f 2 2 s 2 is the dynamic turbulent eddy viscosity where in the expression k is turbulent kinetic energy and ω is specific dissipation rate the values of k and ω are determined through a k ω shear stress transport model menter et al 2003 wilcox 2006 reynolds 1895 liu et al 2012 versteeg and malaasekera 1995 for the boundary conditions on the solid surface riverbed the velocity in the first simulation grid next to the riverbed is estimated according to turbulence boundary layer theory for rough surfaces schlichting 1979 chen et al 2021 the inlet and outlet boundaries are marked with black arrows in fig 1 for this study we derived the inlet and outlet boundary conditions for the velocity and river stage from a previously calibrated cross section averaged river model 1d modular aquatic simulation system mass1 simulation richmond and perkins 2009 the inlet and outlet river flow velocity and stage boundary conditions for the openfoam transient full 3d river flow simulations are shown in fig 2 simulation between january 20 and february 16 in year 2011 period between dashed blue lines are used to calibrate openfoam surface water model for the riverbed roughness openfoam surface water model simulations for years 2013 2015 are used for generating the transient pressure and wetting information on the riverbed for the subsurface flow transport simulations there is no simulation for year 2014 so it is gray in fig 2 we provide more details about the methods used for the investigated river section simulations in our previous work chen et al 2021 2 3 pflotran for subsurface flow and transport simulations pflotran is an open source state of the art massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code hammond et al 2014 bisht et al 2017 lichtner et al 2017 subsurface variably saturated flow is governed by richard s equation richards 1931 4 φαη t ρ q q w 5 q kk r μ p t ρgz where φ is porosity α is the volume fraction of water or called as saturation similar as the surface flow model α 1 stands for full saturation α 0 stands for completely dry and the value between 0 and 1 stands for partial saturation ρ is water density and q is fluid velocity in the subsurface or darcy velocity the term k is the intrinsic saturated permeability and k r is the relative permeability the term g is acceleration of gravity z is height and q w is the source sink term in this study we used van genuchten capillary properties to estimate the relative permeability according to the relationships shown below genuchten 1980 6 k r s e 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 7 s e 1 p i p g 0 p n m 8 s e α s r 1 s r where s e is effective saturation p g 0 is the atmospheric pressure s r is the residual saturation p i is the inverse of air entry pressure and m and n are shape factors of the soil water characteristics which are related by m 1 1 n finite volume discretization method is used to solve all the governing equations more detailed explanations about governing equations and numerical approaches in pflotran subsurface model are in the theory guide which is available at www pflotran org the top boundary of the subsurface simulation domain is the riverbed matching the one used in the surface river water modeling described in section 2 3 therefore the total pressure p t and volume fraction of water α were imported from openfoam surface river water modeling more details about the surface and subsurface water simulation coupling and the boundary conditions are discussed in section 2 4 2 4 coupling of river surface water and subsurface water simulations in this study we modeled the surface and subsurface as two separate domains as shown in fig 3 a for the surface water subdomain we used openfoam to simulate the transient full 3d river flow by solving the equations introduced in section 2 2 which model both the water phase and air phase the surface modeling domain is in region defined by dotted lines as shown in fig 3 a pressure outlet boundary condition is applied on the side and top boundary of the surface modeling domain as marked in fig 3 a the river surface water cross section is shown in light blue and the air above is depicted in light gray the bottom boundary riverbed for the surface water simulation domain is fluid non slip boundary condition with calibrated surface roughness more details about the calibration of surface roughness on the riverbed for the surface water model is reported in our previous work chen et al 2021 as discussed in section 2 2 we used the full 3d multi phase cfd model to simulate the surface domain over the 2013 2015 time period the total pressure p t and volume fraction of water α distribution on the riverbed coupling boundary see the red line in fig 3 a was extracted from the simulation results on an hourly time interval the subsurface subdomain was modeled by pflotran as described in section 2 3 the subsurface domain is bounded by the solid black line in fig 3 a the dark blue area represents the saturated zone and the dark gray area represents the unsaturated subsurface region the land surface of the investigated area is barren land with limited buildings the atmospheric pressure boundary is applied on the dry soil surface and precipitation is neglected the four side walls boundary conditions ambient ground water are derived from the reach scale subsurface simulation shuai et al 2019 and the bottom boundary is no flux boundary as marked in fig 3 a for the top boundary riverbed of subsurface domain we used the hourly total pressure p t and volume fraction of water distribution α on the riverbed extracted from openfoam simulation to assign the total pressure as boundary conditions for pflotran riverbed cells that have surface water on top assuming α 0 8 for the simulation we used linear interpolation to estimate the pressure and volume fraction of the water values between the two imported distributions at intermediate time steps the surface domain covers a much larger area than the subsurface domain the red and yellow blocks shown in fig 1 we used this coupling strategy to avoid influence of inlet and outlet boundary effects in the surface water flow simulation on the subsurface flow transport simulation the strategy therefore is a one way coupling approach because fluxes on the riverbed do not feed back into the surface flow region the strategy is based on the assumption that the magnitude of the hef volumetric flux 0 075 m3 s is negligible compared to the river discharge 1000 7000 m3 s chen et al 2021 in the investigated river channel during 2013 2015 this is common for the large scale river reach if using the two way coupling strategy it means the hefs on the riverbed derived from subsurface flow simulation will be deployed as wall flux boundary condition for the surface flow simulation because this flux is very slow which is around 1 10 5 m s or even slower bao et al 2018 it is supposed to have very limited effects on the surface flow simulation in this situation the pressure distribution which is derived from the surface flow simulation would be almost the same as the no flux wall boundary condition and then there should be no further impact on the subsurface flow simulation additionally the two way couple for the surface and subsurface flow simulation can be very computationally expensive it is usually only applicable for small scale less than 10 m and fully saturated domain which simplifies the simulation to water only single phase flow simulation li et al 2020 shows the two way coupling approach for a small flow domain and studied the hefs in very shallow subsurface region which is around 20 cm deep the flow path in the subsurface region is also at the 10 cm scale therefore for the large scale river reach surface subsurface flow simulation the two way coupling is still not affordable and also not necessary if the study focuses on the reach scale flow transport to quantitatively identify the effects of the hydrodynamic pressure on subsurface flow transport the hydrostatic pressure ρ g z is extracted from the same openfoam 3d multi phase transient river water flow simulation instead of using the total pressure p t the extracted hydrostatic pressure is assigned as boundary conditions for pflotran riverbed cells that have surface water on top assuming α 0 8 this scenario is called hydrostatic pressure openfoam pflotran simulation and is noted as ofpstatic for short correspondingly the subsurface flow transport simulation driven by the total pressure is called total pressure openfoam pflotran simulation and is noted as ofptotal for short 2 5 particle tracking model for subsurface water transport to quantify the rtd we adopted a classical semi analytical particle tracking scheme pollock 1994 to simulate the hydrological exchange pathways this forward particle tracking scheme tracks particles from one cell to the next until the particle satisfies a termination criterion e g a particle reaches a model boundary or the vadose zone to reduce the sensitivity of results to the spatial and temporal sampling 100 million numerical particles were released from 100 thousand locations on the riverbed over 1000 times from october 2013 to october 2014 we conducted convergence tests to ensure that the number of released particles were large enough to provide consistent results we defined the particle rt as the period that elapsed between the time a particle entered the riverbed and then exited back into the river channel particle rts were weighted by the fluxes corresponding to the location and time when it was released to estimate the cumulative rtd crtd as 9 f rt t f ˆ rt t i 1 n v i l t i t i 1 n v i where f ˆ rt t is the empirical cumulative distribution n is the number of particles v i is the darcy flux when and where the particle i is released t i is the particle rt l t i t is the indicator of event t i t the crtd f rt t then was used to derive the rtd f rt t as 10 f rt t d dt f rt t 3 results 3 1 river surface water simulations and validation the horizontal dimension of the river surface water simulation domain is 20 km 12 km with a water depth ranging from 0 m to 20 m to balance the computational costs and accuracy of transient cfd simulation for long time periods i e years in the large river reach we used uniform structured rectangular hexahedron cells to mesh the study domain two mesh resolutions for openfoam surface water simulation have been tested one fine mesh is 20 20 0 5m and one coarse mesh is 20 20 1m between the two mesh resolution simulation results the mean difference root mean square difference and corresponding correlation coefficients r2 are 0 03 m 0 1 m and 0 9987 respectively the uncertainty of the observation data for water stage is 0 032 m so the uncertainty attributed from mesh resolution is of the similar order of observation data more details about the mesh resolution are in our previous work chen et al 2021 therefore all the simulation in this study adopted the mesh resolution of 20 m in the horizontal directions 1 m in the vertical direction a totally 1 2 million grids are used for the whole surface water simulation domain a distributed roughness field on the riverbed was calibrated to match modeled wses with observed wses at six locations as shown in fig 1 we used observations of wse data in 2011 fig 2 regions between dashed blues lines january 20 to february 16 2011 to calibrate the openfoam surface water cfd model through adjustments of riverbed roughness parameters the comparison of the wse time series in 2011 is shown in fig 4 a the colored solid lines are openfoam simulated wses at different observation locations and the black doted lines are the observed wses only wses from january 20 to february 16 were used for riverbed roughness calibrations we used wses from may to december 2011 to validate the short term predictions which used the same calibrated roughness values without further adjustments the relative mean error to water depth at each measuring location i e 100b 100n li 100h and 100f are 2 3 2 3 2 13 2 6 and 1 44 respectively to clearly show the comparison between the openfoam surface water simulation and on site observation two zoom in time periods may 15 may 25 2011 and nov 15 nov 25 2011 are shown in the inserted sub figures in fig 4 a the openfoam surface water simulation can match the on site observation very well with the same calibrated roughness the model simulated the surface water flow for the long term period spanning 2013 to 2015 for this long term prediction the observation data is available at location 100b for only the limited duration shown by the black line shown in fig 4 b the wse simulated by the openfoam can match the available observation data very well and the relative mean error to is 4 6 two zoom in time periods may 15 may 25 2013 and nov 15 nov 25 2013 are shown in the inserted sub figures in fig 4 b additionally the model prediction was also compared with boat towed acoustic doppler current profiler adcp measurements niehus et al 2014 the adcp data recorded the short term velocity profile at 12 cross sections in the river on march 4th and april 1st 2011 the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 between the simulated velocity and the adcp measurement is around 0 7 0 8 at the 9 cross sections out of 12 in the river the r2 for the 3 rest of the cross sections is around 0 5 considering the adcp measurements contains a lot of noise induced by small scale turbulence measurement uncertainty from boat movement le et al 2019 khosronejad et al 2016 the cfd simulation results are reliable for this investigated river section and time period we provide detailed discussions about model implementation calibration and validation in our previously work chen et al 2021 3 2 subsurface water and transport after validating the surface river water simulation for years 2013 2015 as discussed above we extracted the hourly total pressures p t hydrostatic pressure ρ g z and volume fractions of water α on the riverbed and imported the data into pflotran as described in section 2 4 the modeled subsurface domain includes four main soil types as shown in fig 5 a four main soil types comprise the subsurface hanford taylor flats ringold e and ringold lm the permeability and porosity for these four soil types are listed in table 1 newcomb and brown 1961 newcomb et al 1972 thorne et al 2006 zachara et al 2012 usdoe 2010 the pflotran subsurface simulation used structured grid the sensitivity of pflotran simulated hefs to model grid resolution has been studied and discussed in shuai et al work shuai et al 2019 for the similar modeling domain in that study shuai et al 2019 various grid resolutions were tested under the same boundary and river flow conditions it was found that the simulation results are more sensitive to the vertical grid resolution than the horizontal resolution and 100 m horizontal resolution and 2 m vertical resolution already can provide reliable hefs estimation for the same investigated river section in this study a higher resolution is used 10 m horizontal and 1 m vertical resolution to better capture the pressure distribution on the riverbed from surface flow simulation and there are totally about 15 million cells for the study domain pflotran subsurface simulations were implemented on 1536 cores of high performance computing hpc cluster on the cascade supercomputer at the william r wiley environmental molecular sciences laboratory emsl 2020 24 h wall clock computational time can complete approximately 1 month of solution time for validating the pflotran subsurface flow transport simulation of the investigated area the model predictions on ground water elevations are compared to fifteen in land well observations the locations and the names of the fifteen in land wells are marked on fig 5 a the comparison between the pflotran subsurface flow transport simulation predicted in land water elevation and the well observations for four example in land wells are shown in fig 5 b the simulation results include both ofptotal and ofpstatic scenarios the pflotran simulated in land well water elevation can match the observations red lines in fig 5 b fairly well the in land ground water elevation from ofptotal is noted as h g w o f p t o t a l for short and ground water elevation from ofpstatic is noted as h g w o f p s t a t i c h g w o f p t o t a l as the blue lines shown in fig 5 b is more accurate than h g w o f p s t a t i c black lines especially in well 199 h4 13 h g w o f p s t a t i c causes more overestimated in land well water elevation than h g w o f p t o t a l the root mean square errors rmses between h g w o f p t o t a l and the in land well observation for all the fifteen wells are marked in fig 5 a in green color and the averaged rmse for all the fifteen wells is 0 4 m the rmses for h g w o f p s t a t i c for the fifteen wells are marked in fig 5 a in orange color and the averaged rmse for all the fifteen wells is 0 5 m the ratio between hydrodynamic pressure and hydrostatic pressure on riverbed which is the relative differences between the total pressure and hydrostatic pressure p hd ρ g z p t ρ g z ρ g z are shown in fig 6 a for three time snapshots jun 2nd 2014 1 00 low stream flow sep 22nd 2014 high stream flow and sep 28th 2014 19 00 medium stream flow the positive value red color represents the total pressure is higher than the hydrostatic pressure and the negative value blue color represents the total pressure is lower than the hydrostatic pressure in the center of main river channels the ratio is about 1 which means that the total pressure is almost the same as hydrostatic pressure near the shoreline or in the secondary channels the ratio is around 10 to 40 which means that the total pressure is 10 40 lower than the hydrostatic pressure hefs on the riverbed are compared between the two simulation scenarios for the same three snapshots as shown in fig 6 b and c hefs estimations from ofpstatic simulation are shown in fig 6 b and hefs on the riverbed using ofptotal simulation are shown in fig 6 c negative values represent downwelling fluxes on the riverbed which means river water is moving into the subsurface domain positive flow values represent upwelling fluxes which means subsurface water is flowing back into the river in the center of river channels the upwelling fluxes estimated by ofptotal simulation fig 6 c is lower than the ofpstatic simulation fig 6 b though the total pressure is very similar to hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 6 a this is mainly due to the ground water elevation from the ofpstatic simulation is higher than the ofptotal simulation the differences of ground water head δ h g w h g w o f p t o t a l h g w o f p s t a t i c between ofptotal and ofpstatic are shown in fig 6 d in most areas the ground water head difference δ h g w is less than zero which means h g w o f p t o t a l h g w o f p s t a t i c this is consistent with the comparison to the in land well observation as discussed and shown in fig 5 b near the shoreline or shallow area the hydrodynamic pressure makes total pressure lower than the hydrostatic pressure which leads to the downwelling fluxes in those areas estimated by ofptotal simulation fig 6 c to be lower than the ofpstatic simulation fig 6 b as well the spatial averaged hefs time series for ofptotal and ofpstatic simulations are shown in fig 7 the inserted figures in fig 7 are the zoom in time period june 1st june 30th 2014 for clearly showing the differences between ofptotal and ofpstatic simulations the downwelling and upwelling hefs are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the temporal average of the downwelling hefs is 0 0048 m h for ofpstatic and 0 0041 m h for ofptotal which means that considering hydrodynamic pressure reduces the downwelling hefs by 15 the temporal average of the upwelling hefs is 0 0061 m h for ofpstatic and 0 0055 m h for ofptotal which means that considering hydrodynamic pressure reduces the upwelling hefs by 10 therefore for the net hefs as shown in fig 7 c considering hydrodynamics increase net hefs by 7 from 0 00137 m h ofpstatic to 0 00146 m h ofptotal which means the investigated subsurface domain loses 7 more water estimated by ofptotal this is also the reason why the ground water elevation is lower in ofptotal simulation and it makes the estimated ground water elevation slightly matches the in land well observation data better as shown in fig 5 b 3 3 particle tracking and rtd using the transient subsurface water transport simulation results discussed in section 3 2 we extracted all hourly subsurface flow velocity data and then imported it into the particle tracking model as described in section 2 5 all trajectories in the subsurface domain for particles released during the simulated time period are shown in fig 8 a trajectories represented by cold colors i e dark purple represent shorter rts while warm colors i e yellow represent longer rts to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of the hydrodynamic pressure on the rt we used the rtd as discussed in section 2 5 to summarize all trajectories between 2014 and 2015 statistically additionally based on the work of hou et al 2020 the investigated river section can be divided into several sub domains according seven hydromorphic units hu classes that include run fast glide pool slow glide riffle transition slack water and riffle the distribution of these hus in the investigated domain are shown in fig 8 b the impacts of the hydrodynamic pressure also are evaluated for each hu the rtds of each hu and the whole study domain for the hydrostatic pressure openfoam pflotran and total pressure openfoam pflotran simulated subsurface flows are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively the gray areas are the original probability distributions to more clearly illustrate the mostly likely rts we used a gaussian mixture model santosh 2013 to decompose the original probability distributions into three modes shown as the green blue and red dashed lines please note that all the differences on the rtds shown in fig 9 a and b are caused by the hydrodynamic pressure on the riverbed generally the hydrodynamic pressure in ofptotal simulation shorten the rts as shown in whole reach subplot in fig 9 a and b with considering the hydrodynamic pressure in ofptotal simulation the probability for rt around less than 1 day is higher red dash line and the probability for rt around 10 days is lower blue dash line this is mainly due to the hydrodynamic pressure causes more frequent local pressure variations due to small riverbed concaveness convexness and turbulence vortexes for each hu class hydrodynamic pressure has more impact on certain hu classes for example in the hu slack water class hydrodynamic pressure reduces the mostly likely rt from hundreds of days to a few hours this is mainly because the locations of the slack water class in the investigated river reach has suppressed downwelling fluxes by hydrodynamic pressure particles released in the slack water regions do not flow fast enough and were easier to be pulled back to nearby upwelling fluxes river channels and flow back to the river stream in other hu class the hydrodynamic pressure does not significantly decrease the rt of the highest peak probability but increase the probability at the short rt areas which is captured by the red dash line in fig 9 a and b especially for hu classes pool and slow slide another impact from the hydrodynamic pressure is increase the area that has very short rt as shown in riffle transition hu class without considering hydrodynamic pressure there is almost no area has the rt shorter than 0 1 day as shown in fig 9 a riffle transition subplot however with hydrodynamic pressure there is noticeable area has rt shorter than 0 1 day as shown in fig 9 b riffle transition subplot 4 conclusions and discussion in this study we demonstrated the one way coupled river and subsurface water transport models to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hefs and rtds for a large scale river section over a long time period the main challenges for using total pressure as boundary conditions for subsurface simulation is calculating the total pressure from surface flow simulation to accurately obtain both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure the surface flow simulation needs to be the fully 3 dimensional and multi phase flow cfd model which can explicitly capture the sharp liquid air interface for the river modeling for capturing the sharp liquid air interface the flow simulation needs relatively fine mesh and the time step also needs to be very short to avoid numerical diffusion on the liquid air interface in this study the time step interval for the surface flow simulation is around 1 s considering simulating the years of the river flow this is very computational expansive to our knowledge this is the first reporting of results that conduct years of river flow simulation using the fully 3 dimensional and multi phase flow cfd model for getting both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure we used river and subsurface water transport models both of which are full 3d transient multi phase models the river surface water flow model can provide detailed transient hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the riverbed for a high resolution bathymetry covering a long section of river 30 km over a long period 3 years although still computationally expensive using the capacity of an hpc cluster makes running the model computationally affordable for the investigated domain and period the computational cost of the surface water simulation was approximately 1 million cpu core hours on the hpc cluster used in this study on the cascade supercomputer at the william r wiley environmental molecular sciences laboratory emsl 2020 the parallel computational speedup can keep almost linear with number of cpu cores when it is equal or less than 256 when increase the number of cpu cores from 256 to 512 the simulation speed is increased around 50 the speedup for further increasing the number of cpu cores decrease rapidly therefore all the surface flow simulation cases are implemented on 512 cpu cores and one day of wall clock computing time can simulate about one month solution time for larger simulation river domain which may involve more simulation grids linear speedup regime can be further improved to over 1000 cpu cores please note that the parallel computation speedup or scalability may vary on different hpc cluster systems the subsurface flow model used the 3 year transient pressure and saturation distribution as boundary conditions to drive the subsurface transport simulation to our knowledge this is the first reporting of results that used the total pressure including both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure as boundary conditions for a long 3 year period subsurface simulation the computational cost of the subsurface simulation was approximately 1 3 million cpu core hours on the hpc cluster used in this study the subsurface flow simulator pflotran provides very high efficiency on parallel computing it has been applied in an extended river reach area for approximately 75 km columbia river shuai et al 2019 it can keep near linear speedup until 3000 cpu cores hammond et al 2014 in this study the simulated subsurface domain only covers around 10 km so about 1500 cpu cores were used in the subsurface simulation cases to balance the computational efficiency and the job queuing time in the hpc system as discussed about the subsurface flow simulation mesh resolution in section 3 2 the simulated hefs are more sensitive to the vertical grid resolution than the horizontal resolution therefore with sacrificing of certain detailed pressure variation on the riverbed in finer scale coarsening the horizontal resolution from current 10 m to 20 or even 40 m would significantly reduce the computational cost for the subsurface flow simulation such adjustment should be considered when adopt this simulation framework to larger investigated river reach domain and or longer time period the main goal of implementing the high fidelity 3 d multi phase flow cfd simulation for the surface flow is deriving the pressure distribution and variation on the riverbed to drive subsurface flow simulation this computational expensive effort potentially can be replaced by the machine learning ml based approach that couples the auto encoder decoder networks and recurrent neural network kim et al 2019 the ml based approach could generate and synthesis pressure distribution and variation on the riverbed according to given reverbed geometry and river flow rate without running complex cfd simulation the networks in the ml based approach could be trained by the existing short term cfd results in 2011 cfd simulation data in this study and then the trained ml approach can efficiently predict the pressure distribution and variation in 2012 2015 which can significantly reduce the computational cost based on our simulation results hydrodynamic pressure slightly increases the net flux into river by 7 for the investigated time period the slightly increased net flux leads to lower ground water level 10 cm on average in ofptotal simulations which is more consistent with the in land well observation data the particle tracking model provides for direct measurement of the rt of the water in the subsurface domain by tracking 100 million particles rtds were derived for the simulations both with ofptotal and without ofpstatic considering hydrodynamic pressure the hydrodynamic pressure shortens the overall rts in the investigated domain comparing to the ofpstatic simulation results with considering the hydrodynamic pressure the probability for rt around less than 1 day is increased from 0 2 to 0 25 and the probability for rt around 10 days is decreased from 0 5 to 0 4 for the slack water hu class the hydrodynamic pressure reduces the mostly likely rt from a few hundred days to a few hours in the area of riffle transition hu class the hydrodynamic pressure increases noticeable region that the rt short than 0 1 day this indicates that for the river section we investigated the hydrodynamic pressure should not be neglected and future subsurface reaction transport studies should consider the reduced rt as the control factor in the reach scale modeling the detailed flow and transport cannot be captured so the rtd and or mean of rt from this work can be directly used in the reach scale flow and reactive transport modeling additionally the rtd is related to the hydromorphic units so it is possible that the rtd can be applied to the different river reach for the corresponding hu without running such computationally expensive simulations the transferability of rtd will be investigated in our future study please note that one of the main goals of this study is designed to provide upscaling information such as rtd to reach scale modeling so it cannot include all the small scale hyporheic zone flow transport munz et al 2011 in small scale such as less than 10 by 10 m area the morphology of sediments may lead to strong and high frequent hefs in the shallow hyporheic zone which may further lead to very short rts availability of data and software the surface water cfd

algorithm nhi is a multichannel fixed threshold algorithm a detailed description of different hot spot detection methods can be found in steffke and harris 2011 developed to identify and map thermal anomalies through mid high spatial resolution satellite data the algorithm uses two normalized indices analyzing swir and nir radiances for this purpose 1 n h i s w i r l swir 2 l swir 1 l swir 2 l swir 1 2 n h i s w n i r l swir 1 l nir l swir 1 l nir in equation 1 l swir 1 and l swir 2 are the toa top of the atmosphere radiances w m2 sr μm measured at 1 6 μm swir1 and 2 2 μm swir2 in equation 3 l nir is the toa radiance measured in the near infrared nir band at around 0 8 μm as shown in previous studies e g marchese et al 2019 the nhi swir index in equation 1 assumes positive values in presence of volcanic thermal features emitting more strongly at 2 2 μm than at 1 6 μm and negative values over background surfaces and clouds however the aforementioned index is less suited to identify thermal anomalies of a high intensity level for temperature size which frequently lead to the swir2 channel saturation see table 1 the index in equation 2 shows a sort of complementary behavior with the previous one increasing up to positive values in areas where volcanic thermal emissions are particularly intense hence pixels having positive values of one or both indices i e n h i s w i r 0 o r n h i s w n i r 0 are considered hot by the algorithm in this way nhi is capable of detecting thermal anomalies including fires and gas flares with good performance e g genzano et al

sistematically provides notifications about volcanic thermal anomalies detected over the past 48 h https sites google com view nhi tool the nhi tool includes a spectral test to detect extremely hot pixels leading to pixel saturation in both swir bands see table 1 while a spectral filter is used to minimize false detections caused by multispectral misregistration of s2 msi imagery genzano et al 2020 in this work we show the results achieved using the nhi tool to investigate map and monitor the kilauea s lava lake in addition we assess for the first time performance of the nhi algorithm in mapping thermal anomalies through nighttime l8 oli data this implementation was carried out after converting from dn digital numbers to radiance and using the rescaling factors i e calibration coefficients stored in the metadata file e g young et al 2017 finally an initial test on swir radiance was used before computing the two normalized indices described above to map the lava lake at the halema uma u crater 2 2 lava lake temperature and radiant flux estimation to characterize the kilauea s lava lake from a quantitative point of view using l8 oli and s2 msi data we estimated the temperature distribution of the lava lake and the released radiant flux first hot pixels detected by the nhi algorithm cf section 2 1 were used as a mask for the further processing steps which are based on the data of the nir swir1 and swir2 channels of the oli and msi sensors day and nighttime imagery were handled slightly different in the following processing steps for daytime imagery one has to consider the influence of the solar irradiation on the signal we estimated this influence of the solar irradiation and then subtracted it from the signal to be able to estimate the radiance signal of the active lava lake following wooster and kaneko 2001 i e the herein described per pixel method of oppenheimer 1991 the relationship x between the radiance in the swir1 and the nir were investigated for an area close to the hot pixels but outside the thermal feature with index b referring to cold background pixels equation 3 3 x s w i r 1 b n i r b x can then be used to estimate the influence of the solar irradiation in the swir1 channel swir1 sol for each hot pixel by analyzing the corresponding nir radiance nir h equation 4 as the nir channel is in contrast to the swir1 channel not influenced by the hot lava exceptions are only very hot surfaces which is assumed to be not the case here 4 s w i r 1 s o l x n i r h this estimated influence of the solar irradiation was then subtracted from the swir1 data of the hot pixels swir1 h to correct for the influence of the solar irradiation and get the final swir1 h corr radiance equation 5 5 s w i r 1 h c o r r s w i r 1 h s w i r 1 s o l as during nighttime there is no influence of the solar irradiation no corresponding correction was necessary we performed two different analysis approaches for l8 oli nighttime data firstly the swir1 data were used for all detected hot pixels to be more comparable with the analysis of the daytime images which were based on swir1 data as well in contrast to daytime when there is influence of the solar irradiation during nighttime also the nir channel clearly shows a strong signal over the hot pixels detected with the nhi algorithm therefore in a second analysis approach of the nighttime data swir and nir data were combined we noted saturation of a high percentage of the swir2 pixels in the hot pixel area with radiance values 24 3 w m2 sr μm some swir1 pixels were saturated as well saturation of swir1 appears at values 71 3 w m2 sr μm see table 1 to consider only the unsaturated information the following was applied in this second nighttime data processing approach within the detected hot pixels mask firstly all unsaturated pixels of the swir2 channel were selected next swir2 pixels that showed saturation were replaced by swir1 pixels finally those swir1 pixels that showed saturation too were replaced by nir pixels which showed no saturation in any of the analyzed scenes the result is a radiance l λ composite of unsaturated hot pixels the following processing steps were applied to all daytime and nighttime data for both nighttime data processing approaches the radiance l λ corrected for the solar irradiation in case of daytime imagery or the swir1 nighttime data or the composite of unsaturated hot pixels respectively was converted to temperature t in kelvin following planck s function and assuming an emissivity ε 0 95 typical value for basaltic lava cf study of lombardo et al 2020 who analyzed in the swir range the emissivity of molten basalt at magmatic temperatures considering the different central wavelength λ of the corresponding bands nir swir1 and swir2 in case of the unsaturated composite equation 6 6 t c 2 ln ε c 1 l λ 1 with the constants c 1 and c 2 as described in equations 7 and 8 7 c 1 2 h c 2 λ 5 8 c 2 h c k λ with planck s constant h the boltzmann gas constant k and the velocity of light c next the radiant heat flux φ rad over the hot pixels was calculated for each hot pixel equation 9 9 φ r a d ε

and t b being the temperature of the cold background information about the surrounding air temperature t b were derived from weather stations according to the date and time of the satellite acquisitions https www worldweatheronline com volcano weather history hawaii us aspx the total radiant heat flux φ per satellite acquisition was then computed by summing up φ rad over all hot pixels in the satellite scene equation 10 10 φ φ r a d for comparison we collected the thermal hot spots detected by modis and viiirs over the kīlauea s lava lake national aeronautics and space administration 2019 and computed the total radiant heat flux of the modis and viirs acquisitions with the shortest time gap to the analyzed s2 msi and l8 oli scenes 3 results 3 1 mapping the kīlauea lava lake fig 2 displays a time sequence of thermal anomaly maps generated through the nhi tool and referring to the period december 2020 february 2021 maps display hot pixels in three different colors providing information about areas where volcanic thermal emissions were particularly strong yellow pixels intense red pixels or weaker violet pixels in presence of positive values of both nhi indices pixels were marked in red outputs of the nhi tool including plots of number of hot pixels total swir radiance and total hotspot area show that the kīlauea activity was detected by satellite starting from december 23 2020 clouds masked the crater area at the time of eruption start fig 2 shows however that only a small portion of the lava lake was mapped by the tool due to a steam plume dispersing in the nw direction as indicated by the rgb red swir2 green swir1 blue nir product shown in fig 3 on the other hand when steam plumes clouds did not affect the halema uma u crater the tool provided more accurate information about the lava lake as for map of december 28 2020 the latter shows the identification of a number of extremely hot pixels in yellow just in correspondence of the w fissure feeding the lava lake and the presence of an island of warm pixels in violet within the crater this information is consistent with the thermal map from an helicopter overflight performed on december 28 2020 united states geological survey 2020b regarding the pixels flagged at the crater rim mostly in violet they were associated with image artifacts emphasized in fig 3 and probably related to the smearing of the lava lake emitted radiance across the adjacent pixels e g murphy et al 2011 schroeder et al 2016 fig 2 then shows that in early january 2021 the larger island of cooler solidified lava floating in the lava lake rotated in front of the w lava source in agreement with information provided by usgs united states geological survey 2020a the different portions of the lava lake marked by the tool were then consistent with an aerial survey performed on january 5 2021 showing temperatures at the w fissure up to about 809 c united states geological survey 2021c finally thermal anomaly maps of middle end january 2021 indicate that the eastern portion of the lava lake cooled becoming less radiant in the swir bands see also rgb maps in fig 3 fig 4 displays the thermal anomaly maps generated from l8 oli nighttime data which are not ingested in gee the comparison with maps in fig 2 revealed a lower geolocation accuracy in nighttime than daytime conditions in addition some thermal anomaly maps show that nhi flagged a number hot pixels outside the crater rim which were not in spatial continuity with the main region of the lava lake e g see cluster of hot pixels flagged southern of the halema uma u crater on january 7 2021 therefore we can speculate that also other factors e g blurring due to data resampling discussed in previous studies see wooster and kaneko 2001 murphy et al 2011 schroeder et al 2016 kato et al 2018 affected the lava lake mapping this hypothesis seems to be corroborated by the analysis of tir data at 100 m spatial resolution from tirs thermal infrared sensor which did not reveal any discontinuity in the shape of lava lake hence although the nhi algorithm mapped the lava lake in a more efficient way than a simple fixed threshold test on swir radiance e g schroeder et al 2016 we decided to discard the aforementioned hot pixels flagged outside the crater rim before estimating the radiant flux from nighttime l8 oli data 3 2 estimates of total hot spot area the nhi tool integrates daytime l8 oli and s2 msi observations through the plot of total hot spot area since the tool considers each pixel affected only by the hot component the total hot spot area generally overestimates the area of hot targets genzano et al 2020 at kīlauea the total hot spot area estimated by satellite at the end of december 2020 ranged in between 65 and 70 ha while according to usgs the active lava lake covered an area of 28 33 ha united states geological survey 2020c however by considering only the hottest pixels flagged by the tool i e yellow and red ones the hot spot area better approximated the area of the active lava lake this is shown in fig 5 indicating that in absence of clouds steam plumes over the halema uma u crater i e apart from satellite scenes of december 23 2020 and january 2 2021 the hot spot area ranged in between 30 and 33 ha see blue bars a drastic reduction of this parameter was then recorded since mid end january 2021 around 10 ha since early february when the inactive portion of the lava lake was larger in size it is worth noting that the hot spot area retrieved from nighttime l8 oli data was systematically higher than daytime estimations red bars because of above mentioned factors the maximum value of this parameter around 70 ha was retrieved on january 23 2021 when the nhi algorithm flagged several hot pixels outside the crater rim despite those differences the hot spot area estimated by satellite was fairly well correlated with the lava lake area from temporally close usgs measurements see fig 6 apart when clouds and other features e g image artifacts affected thermal anomaly identification 3 3 analysis of the total swir radiance the nhi tool provides information about volcanic thermal anomalies also through the total swir radiance which is calculated by summing radiances of hot pixels at the relative swir wavelengths since the tool does not perform any correction for solar irradiation and owing to differences in saturation radiance and to pixels exceeding the nominal saturation resulting in radiometric artifacts e g schroeder et al 2016 the plot of total swir radiance tswr requires a careful analysis and interpretation e g plank et al 2020 nonetheless this plot may provide better information about changes of thermal volcanic activity than that of hot pixels number as shown in fig 7 the latter shows that values of total swir1 radiance retrieved from s2 msi data tswr1 were systematically higher than swir2 tswr2 see fig 7a mainly because of differences in swir channel saturation e g genzano et al 2020 however both curves marked the peak of volcanic thermal emissions in early january 2021 better emphasizing the increase of thermal activity occurring in early january 2021 than the plot of hot pixel number after a first reduction of total swir radiance recorded on january 7 2021 meteorological clouds strongly affected the halema uma u crater completely obscuring the lava lake satellite data acquired in the following days in cloud free conditions showed the reduction of total swir radiance indicating that volcanic thermal emissions were less intense than early january see fig 7a afterwards meteorological clouds masked once again the halema uma u crater did not enabling the lava lake identification and mapping by satellite 3 4 estimates of the lava lake temperature and radiant flux fig 8 shows the temperature and derived radiant flux for the l8 oli nighttime imagery based on the approach of the combination of unsaturated swir2 swir1 nir hot pixels cf section 2 2 the maximum estimated temperature value of single pixel ranges between 719 k and 1105 k the derived maximum radiant flux of single pixels ranges between 13 mw and 72 mw these maximum temperature radiant flux values were derived with the swir1 or nir band in case of saturation of swir1 cf section 2 2 figs 9 and 10 display the estimated temperature and radiant flux for the daytime l8 oli and s2 msi imagery this analysis was based on swir1 data which was corrected for the influence of the solar irradiation cf section 2 2 the maximum of the estimated temperature of single pixels reaches between 764 k and 777 k the derived maximum radiant flux ranges between 7 mw and 17 mw the temporal evolution of the total radiant flux per scene φ is shown in fig 11 a and b for the nighttime and daytime imagery respectively the l8 oli nighttime observations show high φ values with φ 6908 mw or 5575 mw on december 31 2020 and 8234 mw or 6227 mw on january 7 2021 based on the composite of unsaturated swir2 swir1 nir data or the swir1 data only the next three nighttime landsat 8 acquisitions from mid of january 2021 onwards showed lower φ values between ca 2100 mw and ca 3700 mw the daytime acquisitions of sentinel 2 and landsat 8 show a similar trend fig 11b from the first satellite observation on december 23 2020 onwards φ retrieved considering all nhi pixels dashed line increased and showed high values from december 28 2020 to january 7 2021 with maximum values of φ 5677 mw on january 2 2021 measured by s2 msi then φ decreased until january 22 2021 φ 2734 mw after that the average φ value was about 2300 mw with a minimum of φ of 1313 mw estimated on february 6 2021 the trend of φ is similar when considering the high intensity nhi pixels only or all nhi pixels respectively with the latter showing higher values for φ finally values of φ retrieved from l8 oli and s2 msi data were higher than those estimated from modis and viirs data while the temporal trends were similar see black and gray curves in fig 11a and b factors affecting those differences are analyzed in detail in the next section 4 discussion results shown in previous section demonstrate that the nhi tool may provide relevant information about thermal volcanic activity also in well monitored areas such as kilauea the efficiency of the tool in mapping active lava lakes is corroborated by fig 12 displaying the thermal anomaly map from s2 msi scene of february 11 2021 fig 12a and the kīlauea contour map of the same day from usgs fig 12b the figure shows that the thermal anomaly identified by satellite was consistent for both shape and size with information provided by the contour map in more detail based on information provided by the tool the lava lake had a characteristic c shape and covered an area of about 9 ha when only the hottest pixels were considered fig 12b shows that the active region of the lava lake in red had a similar shape and covered almost the same area 8 ha therefore while the total hot spot area estimated by satellite including also warm pixels mostly associated with islands of solidified lava was about half of total lava lake area from usgs 42 ha the area from hottest pixels was comparable to the area of active lava lake see section 3 2 the tool then provided accurate time series information in cloud free conditions about the lava lake activity the latter appeared more intense in late december 2020 early january 2021 and weaker in the following weeks when the inactive portions of the lava lake became larger in size this temporal trend was however less evident when nighttime l8 oli data were analyzed indeed the lava lake identification was less accurate in nighttime than in daytime conditions probably due to factors mentioned in previous section on the other hand although the nhi algorithm was used with good results to map lava flows lakes also through nighttime aster imagery acquired before april 2008 it was designed and extensively tested to run on daytime data marchese et al 2019 mazzeo et al 2021 further analyses are then required to better assess the nhi performance on nighttime l8 oli scenes whose usage is limited by a reduced availability e g schroeder et al 2016 regarding the estimates of radiant flux in spite of differences in the values of this parameter estimated from infrared modis and viirs data the temporal trend was similar corroborating changes of thermal activity inferred from the nhi tool it is worth mentioning that the assumed value of the emissivity used in our analysis ε 0 95 corresponds well with the findings of lombardo et al 2020 which analyzed within the swir range the emissivity of molten basalt at magmatic temperatures lee and ramsey 2016 pointed out that molten basalt has a lower emissivity than crusted basaltic lava their analysis was performed in the tir wavelengths range a lower emissivity value would decrease the estimated radiant flux cf equation 9 on the other hand the effective emissivity of the kīlauea lava lake is a mixture of the emissivity of crusted and molten lava radiant flux estimations performed in this study indicate that l8 oli and s2 msi data may be used to characterize volcanic thermal anomalies from a quantitative point of view starting from information provided by the nhi tool the latter will benefit from the recent launch of landsat 9 satellite national aeronautics and space administration 2021 whose observations integrated with those analyzed in this work are expected to improve the monitoring of kilauea and other active volcanoes through mid high spatial resolution satellite data e g li and chen 2020 5 conclusions in this work we have investigated the kīlauea s thermal activity of late december 2020 february 2021 from space using s2 msi daytime and l8 oli daytime nighttime satellite data by analyzing outputs of the nhi tool we retrieved information about the space time evolution of the lava lake at halema uma u crater in daylight conditions in good agreement with usgs measurements accuracy in the lava lake mapping was lower when the nhi algorithm was applied to nighttime l8 oli data due to a combination of factors e g geolocation accuracy blurring regarding the estimates of radiant flux values retrieved from daytime s2 msi and l8 oli data e g 1 5 gw from high intensity hot spots were higher than those derived from modis and viirs 0 8 3 4 gw while the temporal trend of this parameter was comparable the following conclusions can be then drawn nighttime imagery revealed higher radiant flux φ values than daytime observations this is true over the entire observation period cf figs 10 and 11 for example for the image pair with the shortest time gap of 12 h and 35 min between a daytime and a nighttime acquisition both on january 7 2021 the value of φ was by 17 35 for the high intensity nhi pixels or 37 51 lower at daytime than during nighttime depending on the processing method used for the analysis of the nighttime data this underestimation of φ recorded during daytime is in line with the findings of wooster and kaneko 2001 who reported that the correction of the solar radiation in the swir band is not perfect and leads to an underestimation of the thermal spectral radiance by 28 59 directly influencing φ using the per pixel correction method of the solar irradiation influence proposed by oppenheimer 1991 which is applied here as the shortest time gap between a daytime and a nighttime acquisition is 12 h it is not meaningful to correct the φ daytime estimates by using nighttime observations the composite approach of unsaturated swir2 swir1 and nir nighttime data shows in most cases higher φ values than the approach based on swir1 data only the partly saturation of the swir1 channel leads to an underestimation of φ compared to the composite of unsaturated data an exception is the l8 oli nighttime image of january 23 2021 showing a higher φ value in the swir1 data only approach than in the unsaturated composite approach as shown in fig 4 the nhi algorithm overestimated the lava lake in that scene detecting a large number of hot pixels the comparison with the nir band data showed that the detected hot spot area is larger than that visible in the nir band this explains the overestimation of φ when applying the swir1 data only approach in comparison to the unsaturated composite approach a comparison with φ measurements of modis and viirs shows a similar trend of the temporal evolution for all the observations based on l8 oli and s2 msi data however compared to the modis and viirs measurements msi and oli data analysis shows about 3 times higher values of φ for nighttime data for the daytime oli and msi data φ is about 1 7 times higher compared to modis and viirs when considering the high intensity nhi pixels only while oli and msi φ estimates are about 2 6 times higher compared to modis and viirs when considering all nhi pixels oli and msi observed the active lava lake at shorter wavelengths swir or nir than modis and viirs which use the mid infrared band 4 μm the φ values measured by modis and viirs were derived using the mir band approach proposed by wooster and zhukovoertel 2003 it is well known that this approach underestimates φ at 600 k wooster and zhukovoertel 2003 especially for the less intense nhi pixels at the rim of the active lava lake minimum temperatures down to 398 k at daytime and to 470 k at nighttime were observed further reasons for the differences of φ estimations from oli and msi data compared to modis and viirs ones are i the higher spatial resolution of oli and msi data which enables a more detailed and complete identification of the hot pixel area ii the overestimation of the hot pixel area on nighttime l8 oli scenes which yielded the increase of the estimated φ iii the circumstance that at the time of writing this manuscript only near real time nrt data and not the final re processed data of modis and viirs hot spots were available at nasa firms despite the impact of above mentioned factors on estimates of volcanogenic

algorithm nhi is a multichannel fixed threshold algorithm a detailed description of different hot spot detection methods can be found in steffke and harris 2011 developed to identify and map thermal anomalies through mid high spatial resolution satellite data the algorithm uses two normalized indices analyzing swir and nir radiances for this purpose 1 n h i s w i r l swir 2 l swir 1 l swir 2 l swir 1 2 n h i s w n i r l swir 1 l nir l swir 1 l nir in equation 1 l swir 1 and l swir 2 are the toa top of the atmosphere radiances w m2 sr μm measured at 1 6 μm swir1 and 2 2 μm swir2 in equation 3 l nir is the toa radiance measured in the near infrared nir band at around 0 8 μm as shown in previous studies e g marchese et al 2019 the nhi swir index in equation 1 assumes positive values in presence of volcanic thermal features emitting more strongly at 2 2 μm than at 1 6 μm and negative values over background surfaces and clouds however the aforementioned index is less suited to identify thermal anomalies of a high intensity level for temperature size which frequently lead to the swir2 channel saturation see table 1 the index in equation 2 shows a sort of complementary behavior with the previous one increasing up to positive values in areas where volcanic thermal emissions are particularly intense hence pixels having positive values of one or both indices i e n h i s w i r 0 o r n h i s w n i r 0 are considered hot by the algorithm in this way nhi is capable of detecting thermal anomalies including fires and gas flares with good performance e g genzano et al

sistematically provides notifications about volcanic thermal anomalies detected over the past 48 h https sites google com view nhi tool the nhi tool includes a spectral test to detect extremely hot pixels leading to pixel saturation in both swir bands see table 1 while a spectral filter is used to minimize false detections caused by multispectral misregistration of s2 msi imagery genzano et al 2020 in this work we show the results achieved using the nhi tool to investigate map and monitor the kilauea s lava lake in addition we assess for the first time performance of the nhi algorithm in mapping thermal anomalies through nighttime l8 oli data this implementation was carried out after converting from dn digital numbers to radiance and using the rescaling factors i e calibration coefficients stored in the metadata file e g young et al 2017 finally an initial test on swir radiance was used before computing the two normalized indices described above to map the lava lake at the halema uma u crater 2 2 lava lake temperature and radiant flux estimation to characterize the kilauea s lava lake from a quantitative point of view using l8 oli and s2 msi data we estimated the temperature distribution of the lava lake and the released radiant flux first hot pixels detected by the nhi algorithm cf section 2 1 were used as a mask for the further processing steps which are based on the data of the nir swir1 and swir2 channels of the oli and msi sensors day and nighttime imagery were handled slightly different in the following processing steps for daytime imagery one has to consider the influence of the solar irradiation on the signal we estimated this influence of the solar irradiation and then subtracted it from the signal to be able to estimate the radiance signal of the active lava lake following wooster and kaneko 2001 i e the herein described per pixel method of oppenheimer 1991 the relationship x between the radiance in the swir1 and the nir were investigated for an area close to the hot pixels but outside the thermal feature with index b referring to cold background pixels equation 3 3 x s w i r 1 b n i r b x can then be used to estimate the influence of the solar irradiation in the swir1 channel swir1 sol for each hot pixel by analyzing the corresponding nir radiance nir h equation 4 as the nir channel is in contrast to the swir1 channel not influenced by the hot lava exceptions are only very hot surfaces which is assumed to be not the case here 4 s w i r 1 s o l x n i r h this estimated influence of the solar irradiation was then subtracted from the swir1 data of the hot pixels swir1 h to correct for the influence of the solar irradiation and get the final swir1 h corr radiance equation 5 5 s w i r 1 h c o r r s w i r 1 h s w i r 1 s o l as during nighttime there is no influence of the solar irradiation no corresponding correction was necessary we performed two different analysis approaches for l8 oli nighttime data firstly the swir1 data were used for all detected hot pixels to be more comparable with the analysis of the daytime images which were based on swir1 data as well in contrast to daytime when there is influence of the solar irradiation during nighttime also the nir channel clearly shows a strong signal over the hot pixels detected with the nhi algorithm therefore in a second analysis approach of the nighttime data swir and nir data were combined we noted saturation of a high percentage of the swir2 pixels in the hot pixel area with radiance values 24 3 w m2 sr μm some swir1 pixels were saturated as well saturation of swir1 appears at values 71 3 w m2 sr μm see table 1 to consider only the unsaturated information the following was applied in this second nighttime data processing approach within the detected hot pixels mask firstly all unsaturated pixels of the swir2 channel were selected next swir2 pixels that showed saturation were replaced by swir1 pixels finally those swir1 pixels that showed saturation too were replaced by nir pixels which showed no saturation in any of the analyzed scenes the result is a radiance l λ composite of unsaturated hot pixels the following processing steps were applied to all daytime and nighttime data for both nighttime data processing approaches the radiance l λ corrected for the solar irradiation in case of daytime imagery or the swir1 nighttime data or the composite of unsaturated hot pixels respectively was converted to temperature t in kelvin following planck s function and assuming an emissivity ε 0 95 typical value for basaltic lava cf study of lombardo et al 2020 who analyzed in the swir range the emissivity of molten basalt at magmatic temperatures considering the different central wavelength λ of the corresponding bands nir swir1 and swir2 in case of the unsaturated composite equation 6 6 t c 2 ln ε c 1 l λ 1 with the constants c 1 and c 2 as described in equations 7 and 8 7 c 1 2 h c 2 λ 5 8 c 2 h c k λ with planck s constant h the boltzmann gas constant k and the velocity of light c next the radiant heat flux φ rad over the hot pixels was calculated for each hot pixel equation 9 9 φ r a d ε σ α t h 4 t b 4 with σ being the stefan boltzmann constant a being then area covered by the pixel 400 m2 in case of s2 msi and 900 m2 in case of l8 oli data t h being the temperature of the hot pixel and t b being the temperature of the cold background information about the surrounding air temperature t b were derived from weather stations according to the date and time of the satellite acquisitions https www worldweatheronline com volcano weather history hawaii us aspx the total radiant heat flux φ per satellite acquisition was then computed by summing up φ rad over all hot pixels in the satellite scene equation 10 10 φ φ r a d for comparison we collected the thermal hot spots detected by modis and viiirs over the kīlauea s lava lake national aeronautics and space administration 2019 and computed the total radiant heat flux of the modis and viirs acquisitions with the shortest time gap to the analyzed s2 msi and l8 oli scenes 3 results 3 1 mapping the kīlauea lava lake fig 2 displays a time sequence of thermal anomaly maps generated through the nhi tool and referring to the period december 2020 february 2021 maps display hot pixels in three different colors providing information about areas where volcanic thermal emissions were particularly strong yellow pixels intense red pixels or weaker violet pixels in presence of positive values of both nhi indices pixels were marked in red outputs of the nhi tool including plots of number of hot pixels total swir radiance and total hotspot area show that the kīlauea activity was detected by satellite starting from december 23 2020 clouds masked the crater area at the time of eruption start fig 2 shows however that only a small portion of the lava lake was mapped by the tool due to a steam plume dispersing in the nw direction as indicated by the rgb red swir2 green swir1 blue nir product shown in fig 3 on the other hand when steam plumes clouds did not affect the halema uma u crater the tool provided more accurate information about the lava lake as for map of december 28 2020 the latter shows the identification of a number of extremely hot pixels in yellow just in correspondence of the w fissure feeding the lava lake and the presence of an island of warm pixels in violet within the crater this information is consistent with the thermal map from an helicopter overflight performed on december 28 2020 united states geological survey 2020b regarding the pixels flagged at the crater rim mostly in violet they were associated with image artifacts emphasized in fig 3 and probably related to the smearing of the lava lake emitted radiance across the adjacent pixels e g murphy et al 2011 schroeder et al 2016 fig 2 then shows that in early january 2021 the larger island of cooler solidified lava floating in the lava lake rotated in front of the w lava source in agreement with information provided by usgs united states geological survey 2020a the different portions of the lava lake marked by the tool were then consistent with an aerial survey performed on january 5 2021 showing temperatures at the w fissure up to about 809 c united states geological survey 2021c finally thermal anomaly maps of middle end january 2021 indicate that the eastern portion of the lava lake cooled becoming less radiant in the swir bands see also rgb maps in fig 3 fig 4 displays the thermal anomaly maps generated from l8 oli nighttime data which are not ingested in gee the comparison with maps in fig 2 revealed a lower geolocation accuracy in nighttime than daytime conditions in addition some thermal anomaly maps show that nhi flagged a number hot pixels outside the crater rim which were not in spatial continuity with the main region of the lava lake e g see cluster of hot pixels flagged southern of the halema uma u crater on january 7 2021 therefore we can speculate that also other factors e g blurring due to data resampling discussed in previous studies see wooster and kaneko 2001 murphy et al 2011 schroeder et al 2016 kato et al 2018 affected the lava lake mapping this hypothesis seems to be corroborated by the analysis of tir data at 100 m spatial resolution from tirs thermal infrared sensor which did not reveal any discontinuity in the shape of lava lake hence although the nhi algorithm mapped the lava lake in a more efficient way than a simple fixed threshold test on swir radiance e g schroeder et al 2016 we decided to discard the aforementioned hot pixels flagged outside the crater rim before estimating the radiant flux from nighttime l8 oli data 3 2 estimates of total hot spot area the nhi tool integrates daytime l8 oli and s2 msi observations through the plot of total hot spot area since the tool considers each pixel affected only by the hot component the total hot spot area generally overestimates the area of hot targets genzano et al 2020 at kīlauea the total hot spot area estimated by satellite at the end of december 2020 ranged in between 65 and 70 ha while according to usgs the active lava lake covered an area of 28 33 ha united states geological survey 2020c however by considering only the hottest pixels flagged by the tool i e yellow and red ones the hot spot area better approximated the area of the active lava lake this is shown in fig 5 indicating that in absence of clouds steam plumes over the halema uma u crater i e apart from satellite scenes of december 23 2020 and january 2 2021 the hot spot area ranged in between 30 and 33 ha see blue bars a drastic reduction of this parameter was then recorded since mid end january 2021 around 10 ha since early february when the inactive portion of the lava lake was larger in size it is worth noting that the hot spot area retrieved from nighttime l8 oli data was systematically higher than daytime estimations red bars because of above mentioned factors the maximum value of this parameter around 70 ha was retrieved on january 23 2021 when the nhi algorithm flagged several hot pixels outside the crater rim despite those differences the hot spot area estimated by satellite was fairly well correlated with the lava lake area from temporally close usgs measurements see fig 6 apart when clouds and other features e g image artifacts affected thermal anomaly identification 3 3 analysis of the total swir radiance the nhi tool provides information about volcanic thermal anomalies also through the total swir radiance which is calculated by summing radiances of hot pixels at the relative swir wavelengths since the tool does not perform any correction for solar irradiation and owing to differences in saturation radiance and to pixels exceeding the nominal saturation resulting in radiometric artifacts e g schroeder et al 2016 the plot of total swir radiance tswr requires a careful analysis and interpretation e g plank et al 2020 nonetheless this plot may provide better information about changes of thermal volcanic activity than that of hot pixels number as shown in fig 7 the latter shows that values of total swir1 radiance retrieved from s2 msi data tswr1 were systematically higher than swir2 tswr2 see fig 7a mainly because of differences in swir channel saturation e g genzano et al 2020 however both curves marked the peak of volcanic thermal emissions in early january 2021 better emphasizing the increase of thermal activity occurring in early january 2021 than the plot of hot pixel number after a first reduction of total swir radiance recorded on january 7 2021 meteorological clouds strongly affected the halema uma u crater completely obscuring the lava lake satellite data acquired in the following days in cloud free conditions showed the reduction of total swir radiance indicating that volcanic thermal emissions were less intense than early january see fig 7a afterwards meteorological clouds masked once again the halema uma u crater did not enabling the lava lake identification and mapping by satellite 3 4 estimates of the lava lake temperature and radiant flux fig 8 shows the temperature and derived radiant flux for the l8 oli nighttime imagery based on the approach of the combination of unsaturated swir2 swir1 nir hot pixels cf section 2 2 the maximum estimated temperature value of single pixel ranges between 719 k and 1105 k the derived maximum radiant flux of single pixels ranges between 13 mw and 72 mw these maximum temperature radiant flux values were derived with the swir1 or nir band in case of saturation of swir1 cf section 2 2 figs 9 and 10 display the estimated temperature and radiant flux for the daytime l8 oli and s2 msi imagery this analysis was based on swir1 data which was corrected for the influence of the solar irradiation cf section 2 2 the maximum of the estimated temperature of single pixels reaches between 764 k and 777 k the derived maximum radiant flux ranges between 7 mw and 17 mw the temporal evolution of the total radiant flux per scene φ is shown in fig 11 a and b for the nighttime and daytime imagery respectively the l8 oli nighttime observations show high φ values with φ 6908 mw or 5575 mw on december 31 2020 and 8234 mw or 6227 mw on january 7 2021 based on the composite of unsaturated swir2 swir1 nir data or the swir1 data only the next three nighttime landsat 8 acquisitions from mid of january 2021 onwards showed lower φ values between ca 2100 mw and ca 3700 mw the daytime acquisitions of sentinel 2 and landsat 8 show a similar trend fig 11b from the first satellite observation on december 23 2020 onwards φ retrieved considering all nhi pixels dashed line increased and showed high values from december 28 2020 to january 7 2021 with maximum values of φ 5677 mw on january 2 2021 measured by s2 msi then φ decreased until january 22 2021 φ 2734 mw after that the average φ value was about 2300 mw with a minimum of φ of 1313 mw estimated on february 6 2021 the trend of φ is similar when considering the high intensity nhi pixels only or all nhi pixels respectively with the latter showing higher values for φ finally values of φ retrieved from l8 oli and s2 msi data were higher than those estimated from modis and viirs data while the temporal trends were similar see black and gray curves in fig 11a and b factors affecting those differences are analyzed in detail in the next section 4 discussion results shown in previous section demonstrate that the nhi tool may provide relevant information about thermal volcanic activity also in well monitored areas such as kilauea the efficiency of the tool in mapping active lava lakes is corroborated by fig 12 displaying the thermal anomaly map from s2 msi scene of february 11 2021 fig 12a and the kīlauea contour map of the same day from usgs fig 12b the figure shows that the thermal anomaly identified by satellite was consistent for both shape and size with information provided by the contour map in more detail based on information provided by the tool the lava lake had a characteristic c shape and covered an area of about 9 ha when only the hottest pixels were considered fig 12b shows that the active region of the lava lake in red had a similar shape and covered almost the same area 8 ha therefore while the total hot spot area estimated by satellite including also warm pixels mostly associated with islands of solidified lava was about half of total lava lake area from usgs 42 ha the area from hottest pixels was comparable to the area of active lava lake see section 3 2 the tool then provided accurate time series information in cloud free conditions about the lava lake activity the latter appeared more intense in late december 2020 early january 2021 and weaker in the following weeks when the inactive portions of the lava lake became larger in size this temporal trend was however less evident when nighttime l8 oli data were analyzed indeed the lava lake identification was less accurate in nighttime than in daytime conditions probably due to factors mentioned in previous section on the other hand although the nhi algorithm was used with good results to map lava flows lakes also through nighttime aster imagery acquired before april 2008 it was designed and extensively tested to run on daytime data marchese et al 2019 mazzeo et al 2021 further analyses are then required to better assess the nhi performance on nighttime l8 oli scenes whose usage is limited by a reduced availability e g schroeder et al 2016 regarding the estimates of radiant flux in spite of differences in the values of this parameter estimated from infrared modis and viirs data the temporal trend was similar corroborating changes of thermal activity inferred from the nhi tool it is worth mentioning that the assumed value of the emissivity used in our analysis ε 0 95 corresponds well with the findings of lombardo et al 2020 which analyzed within the swir range the emissivity of molten basalt at magmatic temperatures lee and ramsey 2016 pointed out that molten basalt has a lower emissivity than crusted basaltic lava their analysis was performed in the tir wavelengths range a lower emissivity value would decrease the estimated radiant flux cf equation 9 on the other hand the effective emissivity of the kīlauea lava lake is a mixture of the emissivity of crusted and molten lava radiant flux estimations performed in this study indicate that l8 oli and s2 msi data may be used to characterize volcanic thermal anomalies from a quantitative point of view starting from information provided by the nhi tool the latter will benefit from the recent launch of landsat 9 satellite national aeronautics and space administration 2021 whose observations integrated with those analyzed in this work are expected to improve the monitoring of kilauea and other active volcanoes through mid high spatial resolution satellite data e g li and chen 2020 5 conclusions in this work we have investigated the kīlauea s thermal activity of late december 2020 february 2021 from space using s2 msi daytime and l8 oli daytime nighttime satellite data by analyzing outputs of the nhi tool we retrieved information about the space time evolution of the lava lake at halema uma u crater in daylight conditions in good agreement with usgs measurements accuracy in the lava lake mapping was lower when the nhi algorithm was applied to nighttime l8 oli data due to a combination of factors e g geolocation accuracy blurring regarding the estimates of radiant flux values retrieved from daytime s2 msi and l8 oli data e g 1 5 gw from high intensity hot spots were higher than those derived from modis and viirs 0 8 3 4 gw while the temporal trend of this parameter was comparable the following conclusions can be then drawn nighttime imagery revealed higher radiant flux φ values than daytime observations this is true over the entire observation period cf figs 10 and 11 for example for the image pair with the shortest time gap of 12 h and 35 min between a daytime and a nighttime acquisition both on january 7 2021 the value of φ was by 17 35 for the high intensity nhi pixels or 37 51 lower at daytime than during nighttime depending on the processing method used for the analysis of the nighttime data this underestimation of φ recorded during daytime is in line with the findings of wooster and kaneko 2001 who reported that the correction of the solar radiation in the swir band is not perfect and leads to an underestimation of the thermal spectral radiance by 28 59 directly influencing φ using the per pixel correction method of the solar irradiation influence proposed by oppenheimer 1991 which is applied here as the shortest time gap between a daytime and a nighttime acquisition is 12 h it is not meaningful to correct the φ daytime estimates by using nighttime observations the composite approach of unsaturated swir2 swir1 and nir nighttime data shows in most cases higher φ values than the approach based on swir1 data only the partly saturation of the swir1 channel leads to an underestimation of φ compared to the composite of unsaturated data an exception is the l8 oli nighttime image of january 23 2021 showing a higher φ value in the swir1 data only approach than in the unsaturated composite approach as shown in fig 4 the nhi algorithm overestimated the lava lake in that scene detecting a large number of hot pixels the comparison with the nir band data showed that the detected hot spot area is larger than that visible in the nir band this explains the overestimation of φ when applying the swir1 data only approach in comparison to the unsaturated composite approach a comparison with φ measurements of modis and viirs shows a similar trend of the temporal evolution for all the observations based on l8 oli and s2 msi data however compared to the modis and viirs measurements msi and oli data analysis shows about 3 times higher values of φ for nighttime data for the daytime oli and msi data φ is about 1 7 times higher compared to modis and viirs when considering the high intensity nhi pixels only while oli and msi φ estimates are about 2 6 times higher compared to modis and viirs when considering all nhi pixels oli and msi observed the active lava lake at shorter wavelengths swir or nir than modis and viirs which use the mid infrared band 4 μm the φ values measured by modis and viirs were derived using the mir band approach proposed by wooster and zhukovoertel 2003 it is well known that this approach underestimates φ at 600 k wooster and zhukovoertel 2003 especially for the less intense nhi pixels at the rim of the active lava lake minimum temperatures down to 398 k at daytime and to 470 k at nighttime were observed further reasons for the differences of φ estimations from oli and msi data compared to modis and viirs ones are i the higher spatial resolution of oli and msi data which enables a more detailed and complete identification of the hot pixel area ii the overestimation of the hot pixel area on nighttime l8 oli scenes which yielded the increase of the estimated φ iii the circumstance that at the time of writing this manuscript only near real time nrt data and not the final re processed data of modis and viirs hot spots were available at nasa firms despite the impact of above mentioned factors on estimates of volcanogenic radiant flux this study opens new and challenging scenarios about the quantitative characterization of volcanic thermal anomalies through s2 msi and l8 oli data processed with the nhi tool under the

25677,accurately quantifying and assessing the flood risks is critical for flood hazard mitigation and prevention this study proposed a new integrated flood risk assessment framework to map flood risk hazard and vulnerability by coupling the hec hms hydrological model the hec ras 1d and 2d hydraulic models and a bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis the old brahmaputra river floodplain of bangladesh a flood prone region was chosen as a case study the coupled hydrological hydraulic model shows a comparable robust performance in both calibration and validation periods with nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient 0 93 0 81 coefficient of determination 0 95 0 89 and percent bias 1 17 2 40 for the calibration validation period our results indicate that the assessed risk levels are roughly consistent with the overall property distribution and flood hazard potential in the study area the proposed framework and associated findings are valuable for developing adaptation strategies and early warning systems to reduce flood impacts in the future keywords bottom up hazard vulnerability coupled hydrological hydraulic model flood frequency analysis flood risk assessment old brahmaputra river floodplain 1 introduction as one of the most common natural disasters around the world flood often destroys the physical environment and damages the local economy and societal well beings liu et al 2016 tingsanchali 2012 leskens et al 2014 parvin et al 2016 petit boix et al 2017 chao et al 2019 sun et al 2020 rapid population growth and land use land cover change patterns have increased human vulnerability to floods all over the world forzieri et al 2020 schwalm et al 2013 zang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 floods can lead to mortality displacement of community and damage of crops and infrastructure parry et al 2007 doocy et al 2013 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 dolatabadi and ahmadzadeh 2019 chao et al 2020 apparently flooding is a global phenomenon in particular it has caused devastating consequences in south asia including bangladesh india myanmar and nepal leskens et al 2014 dewan 2015 halgamuge and nirmalathas 2017 khaing et al 2019 the great devastating impacts of floods in south asia and the other regions requires a deep understanding of the flood risks in these regions flood risk assessment is a key component of flood risk management and aims to investigate the high risk area of flood occurrence chen et al 2011 yamanashi et al 2016 mojaddadi et al 2017 zeleňáková et al 2019 rezende et al 2020 a comprehensive flood risk assessment requires a wide range of analyses such as technical cost problem policy and loss analyses chen et al 2011 hence comprehensive flood risk analysis by detecting hazardous and risky areas is an essential part of estimating the extent of damages due to flooding meyer et al 2009 mojaddadi et al 2017 chan et al 2018 basturk et al 2021 developing accurate flood risk assessment techniques and improving our knowledge of flood vulnerability can assist law makers and decision makers to minimize damages and mortalities nasiri et al 2016 badakhshan et al 2019 as a result flood risk assessment serves as an important tool for mitigation and prevention of the flood disasters recently remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technologies have been used for flood prediction preparation prevention and risk assessment around the world tehrany et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 most studies applied hydrologic and hydraulic models to simulate flood runoff and runoff in low lying and flood prone areas anselmo et al 1996 smithers et al 1997 booij 2005 montanari et al 2013 ahmadisharaf and kalyanapu 2019 nogherotto et al 2019 besides flood risk can also be assessed with multi criteria analysis of inundation depth generated by hydraulic and hydrologic models such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp and multi attribute utility theory maut methods zhang et al 2002 meyer et al 2009 chen et al 2011 recently ahmadisharaf and kalyanapu 2019 applied coupled a semi distributed hydrologic model and a 2d unsteady hydraulic model to estimate the uncertainty of flood loss in the swannanoa river watershed north carolina united states besides ahmadisharaf et al 2018 represented a generic probabilistic framework that couples a hydrological model with an unsteady hydraulic model to estimate the uncertainty of flood characteristics moreover new advances in the rs and gis provide new data and ways to improve the simulation accuracy of the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling grimaldi et al 2016 2018 therefore the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling equipped with the rs and gis provides us a new tool to conduct the flood risk assessment application of the hec ras model is gaining popularity for flood routing and flood level forecasting due to its capability to route simple open water floods and produce water level forecasts simultaneously hicks and peacock 2005 the hec hms model is recently applied for analyzing flood frequency and flood warning system oleyiblo and li 2010 halwatura and najim 2013 further researchers have also started to use the coupled hydrological hydraulic model for future flood plain mapping as well as risk assessment in different parts of the world van nguyen et al 2016 thakur et al 2017 van popering verkerk and van buuren 2017 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 abdessamed and abderrazak 2019 blöschl et al 2019 cowles et al 2019 clearly the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling also plays an important role on flood risk assessment the ever increasing population ill planned infrastructural development and massive flood control interventions in a floodplain environment have led to flood disasters becoming more extensive and frequent in recent years rahman and salehin 2013 ahmadzadeh and dolatabadi 2018 dolatabadi et al 2020 flood occurs every year in bangladesh with the recorded most devastating floods in 1974 1984 1988 1998 2004 2007 2015 2016 and 2017 which caused severe damages to people and properties dewan 2013 biswas et al 2018 adnan et al 2019 old brahmaputra river obr is a left bank distributary of the brahmaputra river and the off take of obr is at bahadurabad point causes of flood risks in the obr basin include geographic location geological and geomorphological formation and excessive rainfall during the monsoon and river siltation the decreasing trend of the average annual discharge and gradual silting at the mouth of obr is obstructing smooth flow from the brahmaputra to downstream reaches ali 2010 noor 2013 hossain and meng 2020 additionally rapid urbanization of the flood plain has also contributed to the increased magnitude and frequency of floods in recent years the dramatic change of land use reduces soil water storage capacity and increases direct surface runoff that can easily form flooding considering the above discussed factors coupling hydrological model hydraulic model and risk assessment model for flood risk assessment can provide early warning and support the development of flood prevention system to relief the impacts of possible flood events in the old brahmaputra river watershed tehrany et al 2013 many studies have been devoted to identifying the prime causes and impacts of floods in bangladesh tingsanchali and karim 2005 carrel et al 2010 bhuiyan and dutta 2012 haque and jahan 2015 however flood risk assessment using the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling is still unavailable in the obr basin area of bangladesh besides a vulnerability analysis by bottom up hazard in this region could provide guidelines to the decision makers to estimate the damages caused by floods each year this study aims a to carry out a flood frequency analysis of the flood discharge data using

conclusions are given in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area namely the old brahmaputra river obr watershed geographically ranges between 24 21 6 25 40 9 n in latitude and between 89 45 30 90 30 10 e in longitude the river main branch of the study area has a length of 138 km located in northeastern parts of bangladesh fig 1 a and spans three districts of the mymensingh division i e mymensingh jamalpur and sherpur that are further composed of 13 upazilas fig 1 b upazila is a small administrative region or known as a sub district in bangladesh obr originates from the left bank of the brahmaputra river to the north of bahadurabad and meets with the meghna river at bhairab bazar the width of obr is around 200 m with channel sinuosity of 1 24 average bed slope of obr is 6 cm km expanding to 5 6 m in breadth in many places the common land use types in this region include agriculture land fallow land and vegetation as a distributary of the brahmaputra river obr suffers seasonal riverine floods the jinjirum river a tributary of obr flows from the indo bangladesh border and acts as the primary source of dry season flow of obr precipitation has a strong seasonality in this watershed four prominent seasons are recognized in bangladesh i e pre monsoon march to may monsoon or rainy monsoon june to september post monsoon october and november and dry winter season december to february ahasan et al 2010 mullick et al 2019 in bangladesh floods frequently occur in the monsoon season while occasionally excessive rainfall during the pre monsoon season may also cause flash floods inhabitants in this region are mainly dependent on conventional agricultural production and primarily live along the riverbank increasing the risk of flooding 2 2 data

economic data are collected from the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs http www bbs gov bd to assess the socio economic vulnerability to flooding in the study area the sources and other information of these datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 methodology the framework to assess the flood risk developed in this study involves several major procedures pre process of basic data such as hydrometeorology land use land cover and dem data watershed delineation flood frequency analysis hydrological hydraulic modeling flood hazard and risk assessment fig 2 hydrometeorological data such as precipitation discharge and water level are directly used for hydrological modeling and flood frequency analysis flood frequency analysis uses a long term record of streamflow data to compute the flood frequencies of historical flood events and determine a typical flood event for further modeling and risk assessment the coupled hec hms and hec ras 1d 2d modeling simulate the hydrological processes and inundation of the selected typical flood event the outputs of the coupled hec hms and hec ras 1d 2d model such as flood depth flood velocity inundated area and other socio economic data including population density educational status economic conditions and housing and infrastructure are used as input for the flood hazard vulnerability and risk assessment analysis fig 2 in this advanced integrated method we coupled the united states army corps of engineers usace hec hms version 4 3 https www hec usace army mil software hec hms with the usace hec ras version 5 0 3 https www hec usace army mil software hec ras to do the simulation of the hydrological and hydraulic processes the hec ras model is a hydraulic model software that models the 1 dimensional 1d and 2 dimensional 2d hydraulics of water flow through natural rivers and other channels the relevant outputs of the hec hms and hec ras coupled system are then used as inputs of the bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis to quantify flood risk and its components 3 1 flood frequency analysis in this study the purpose of the flood frequency analysis is to determine the return period exceedance probability of the historical typical flood events so that we can conduct flood risk assessment based on the typical flood events to this end three flood frequency probability distributions including the log normal ln2 log pearson type iii lp3 and gumbel gev distributions were adopted to fit the streamflow data flood frequency analysis was conducted using annual maximum series of discharges data of 30 years 1988 2017 the observed annual maximum streamflow discharge for each year of the observation period is selected from a discharge time series to derive flood events recurrence intervals the recurrence intervals t r of a given streamflow discharge in the time series is obtained using the weibull formula chow et al 1988 ehiorobo and izinyon 2013 1 t r n 1 m where n is the number of years of the observation period and m is the rank of this given streamflow discharge which is obtained by arranging the data series in the descending order and assigning the highest value with a rank of 1 and the lowest value with a rank of n the corresponding design discharge q t of a given recurrence interval t can be computed by equation 2 ghosh and guchhait 2016 2 q t q k σ where q is the mean of the discharge data k is the frequency factor corresponding to each return period and σ is the standard deviation for the discharge data that is calculated as 3 σ q q 2 n 1 3 2 coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling hec ras hydraulic model version 5 0 3 was set up as a coupled 1d 2d model in which river flow was modeled in one dimension and floodplain flow was modeled in two dimensions to couple the hec ras with hec hms we first used the arcgis tool hec geohms to derive the hydrological physical conditions such as the main river channels and the delineation of the associated sub basin then the hec hms hydrologic model is applied to simulate the outflows of all subbasins which serve as the inflows and boundary conditions for the main river channels and the lateral flows of the main river channels in addtion the water level data at the mymensingh station fig 1 serve as the input downstream boundary condition in the hec ras model for this study the preprocessing needed by the hec ras simulation was conducted using the hec georas software and arcgis the monsoon seasons june september of 2004 were selected as calibration periods and the monsoon season of 2007 as validation periods in this study the hec geohms and arcgis platforms were used to process the dem to derive the topographic land surface river network and geographical data required by the hec hms model the soil conservation service scs curve number cn unit hydrograph and muskingum routing methods were selected for computing runoff generation hill slope flow concentration and channel routing respectively to verify the reliability and robustness of the hec hms model we further divided the simulation periods 2003 2017 into the calibration 2003 2006 and validation 2014 2017 periods the input data for the hec hms model include the 3 hourly rainfall data and monthly evapotranspiration data to evaluate the capability of the model a set of commonly used goodness of fit indicator i e the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e and the percentage of deviation from observed streamflow p b i a s were calculated the r 2 metric is an indicator of the strength of the relationship between the observed and simulated values when the r 2 value is close to 0 or the n s e value is less than or close to 0 the model prediction is considered unacceptable the value of r 2 can be calculated by equation 4 4 r 2 i n q i o q o q i s q s 2 i n q i o q o 2 i n q i s q s 2 where q i o is the i t h observed value q i s is the corresponding i t h simulated value q o is the mean of observed data q s is the mean of the simulated data and n is the total number of observations the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e value can be calculated by equation 5 5 n s e 1 i 1 n q i s q s 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 the n s e value ranges from to 1 with n s e 1 as the most optimum value the optimal value of percent bias pbias is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate underestimation by model while negative values indicate overestimation by model gupta et al 1999 the value of p b i a s can be calculated by equation 6 6 p b i a s i 1 n q i o q i s 100 i 1 n q i o where p b i a s is the deviation of data being evaluated expressed as a percentage 3 3 flood risk hazard and vulnerability analysis the total risk of flood r i s k i with a two dimensional index i e hazard and vulnerability to a given location i is assessed by equations 7 and 8 7 r i s k i h i v i 8 v i e i where h i is the hazard index and v i is the vulnerability index at location i which is the combination of multiple socio economic exposure indicators e and impact indicators i by following jahan 2018 and rahman 2019 for the bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis the hazard value of each administrative region upazila was evaluated according to geographic coverage of flood percentage of inundation area and propagation flow velocity vulnerability was evaluated considering population based eight different indicators table 2 based on rahman 2019 and principal component analysis pca recommended by jahan 2018 risk assessment was calculated based on the degree of exposure to floods and the possibility of floods occurring in the study area the risk was evaluated by four risk levels based on the criteria set by the project risk manager prm using the 5 by 5 risk matrix evaluation method fig 3 following ryu et al 2017 the scores of hazard h and vulnerability v are ranked from 1 to 5 according to the criteria proposed by jahan 2018 thus the multiplied value of hazard and vulnerability ranges between 1 and 25 the value of r i s k o b r j level was derived for the thirteen upazila as denoted by j under the districts of mymensingh jamalpur and sherpur of the study area using equation 9 9 r i s k o b r j h j v j with h j 1 2 3 4 5 v j 1 2 3 4 5 1 j 13 and r i s k o b r j s a f e m o d e r a t e m a j o r s e v e r e in this study three indicators were used to quantify the flood hazard i e flood depth percentage of inundation area and flow velocity to calculate the hazard index h its indicators need to be standardized considering that different indicators have different units and magnitudes the hazard and vulnerability scores are calculated as a weighted mean of their respective indicators and then normalized for hazard and vulnerability analysis to bring all values into the range a b or 1 100 equation 10 is used to achieve the normalization process 10 x a b a x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 1 n o r m a l i z e d x 100 where xi is the original value xmin is the minimum value and xmax is the maximum value of normalization after deriving the normalized values of the indicators and corresponding weights hazard and vulnerability score at the upazila level can be calculated using equation 11 11 d j w j 1 d i 1 w j 2 d i 2 w j 3 d i 3 w j n d i n where d j is hazard or vulnerability of an individual upazila d i 1 to d i n is the hazard or vulnerability indicator for an upazila j and w is the corresponding weight assigned to the individual indicator of that upazila j 3 4 calibration and validation strategies of coupled model in this study the hec hms model was run for a warming up period of six months prior the continuous simulation to limit the impacts of uncertainty in the manually assigned initial conditions the hec hms model was calibrated and validated using three different calibration strategies we chose the three different strategies to assess whether the optimized model parameters are location dependent and to avoid the selection of the localized parameter values the first strategy is to calibrate the model parameters subbasin wise from upstream to downstream the second strategy is to calibrate the model parameters subbasin wise from downstream to upstream the third strategy is to calibrate the model parameters subbasin wise using a random order in theory the first strategy will cause that the calibrated parameter values of the downstream subbasins are dependent on the calibrated values of the upperstream subbasins in constrast the second strategy will lead to that the calibrated parameter values of the upperstream subbasins rely on the calibration results of the downstream subbasins the third strategy will make the calibration dependency in a random order however if all of the three strategies can lead to a similar preformance it will prove that the model calibration is location independent 4 results and discussions 4 1 results of calibration and validation the rainfall runoff hec hms model was calibrated and validated using the observed discharge at the mymensingh and jamalpur stations of the obr watershed the coupled hydrological hydraulic model was calibrated for 2004 and validated for 2007 for both of these stations as shown in fig 4 the simulated flows agree well with the observed values for both calibration and validation periods at the mymensingh outlet similarly the simulated water level at the jamalpur point also matches very well with the observations during both calibration and validation periods fig 5 as mentioned above the hec hms model was calibrated using three calibration strategies first model shows trivial difference between the results using the three calibration strategies indicated by the close nse values 0 795 0 798 and 0 665 0 674 for calibration and validation respectively and r2 values 0 805 0 806 and 0 707 0 709 for calibration and validation respectively table 3 second the model performance in the validation is generally similar to that in the calibration but is slightly downgraded 0 665 0 674 validation vs 0 795 0 798 calibration and 0 707 0 709 validation vs 0 805 0 806 calibration for the nse and r2 metrics respectively table 3 the above results indicate that the hec hms model is well optimized in this study and that the hec hms model is overall reliable and robust for flood simulation in this study area 4 2 flood frequency analysis results frequency analysis gives the probability of flood occurrences based on the annual maximum series of discharges of the obr for several return periods 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 and 500 years flood as shown in table 4 the percentage deviation of ln2 distribution based values from the gev distribution based values ranges from 11 82 at tr 500 years to 4 66 at tr 2 years indicating that the fitted results based on these two distributions are very close to each other apart from this at 2 year return period both the lp3 and ln distributions predicted higher discharge values than the gev distribution table 4 our analysis suggests that log normal distribution is more suitable for the design of flood control structures as the design of these structures requires larger return periods to mitigate against the effect of floods for a long period and save the cost of rebuilding the event of failures the percentage deviations of the lp distribution from the gev distribution are generally small and range from 6 39 at 2 years to 0 72 at 500 years table 4 for the high frequency periods up to 5 years the ln distribution based values are higher than the gev results this implies that if a lower design value is required for up to 5 years ln2 is suitable but not economical the results show that the ln2 distribution appears to be the most appropriate flood frequency distribution for this region due to the largest discharge values among the three distributions tested on the sample data and the most consistent with the return periods more important the log normal distribution has a better goodness of fit r2 0 94 than the lp3 r2 0 92 and gev r2 0 90 distributions similar to our findings alam et al 2018 also identified that the ln2 distribution provided the best fitted results for northeastern region of bangladesh which is close to our study area therefore we adopted the ln2 distribution for the computation of flood return periods in this study to militate against the effect of floods for an extended period and save the cost of rebuilding in the event of failures our study provides an inundation map based on the 2004 flood event as it is one of the most devastating floods in the history of bangladesh the floods of 2004 lasted from july to september and covered 50 of the country of their peak besides the rainfall totals of over 300 mm in just seven days resulted in extensive flooding across the country notably in the northeast region www coolgeography co uk fig 6 shows the map of flood inundation based on the 2004 flood event with a recurrence interval of 15 50 years the results show that a total area of 757 90 km2 about 58 42 of the total area is at risk of flooding the upstream regions such as dewanganj baksiganj and sreebardi have a relatively low flood depth ranging from 0 30 m to 0 90 m fig 4 whereas downstream areas of the obr face high inundation varying between 1 80 m and 3 60 m fig 4 these areas with high flood depths are also the highly populated areas such as jamalpur sadar and mymensingh sadar making them under the highest inundation risk among the thirteen upazilas this analysis agrees with the flood susceptibility map drawn by recent peer studies in bangladesh adnan et al 2019 uddin et al 2019 uddin and matin 2021 specifically uddin and matin 2021 observed that northeastern parts of bangladesh including the greater mymensingh and sylhet divisions were inundated to the maximum extent during the recent monsoonal flood of 2020 it is worth of noting that analysis of flood events may involve multiple variables such as flood peak discharge flood volume and flood water level brunner et al 2016 uddin and matin 2021 although univariate probability distribution functions are usually used to estimate the occurrence probability or magnitude of the flood peak or volume in a particular region in flood frequency analysis zhang et al 2018 to more accurately estimate the probability of flooding one needs to know not only the high and extreme values of each variable but also the likelihood of their coinciding brunner et al 2017 the main issue of the univariate models is their difficulties in capturing the underlying joint probability among multiple physical processes which will lead to underestimation of the associated occurring probability fiorentino et al 2011 brunner et al 2016 4 3 risk and hazard analysis based on our flood risk assessment we derived the maps of hazard score vulnerability score and risk level for the whole region fig 7 similar to the spatial pattern of the simulated inundation map fig 6 the hazard level generally increases from the upstream northwest to the downstream southeast fig 7 a the upazilas with higher hazard levels are generally located in the lowland areas and along the obr river fig 7 a for the vulnerability the upazilas that are most vulnerable to floods are also located in the downstream areas fig 7 b these observations are in good agreement with a previous study by gain et al 2013 which also found that the lower part of the brahmaputra river has a high flood vulnerability this spatial pattern of hazard and vulnerability analyses is mainly related with the spatial distributions of population economy livelihood and land use regarding the resultant flood risk no upazila in the study area is under severe risky conditions with respect to the 2004 flood event fig 7 c the upazilas with the highest risks are jamalpur s mymensingh s and ishwarganj fig 7 c and table 5 although the three upazilas have a similar level of risk they have different compositions of hazard and vulnerability scores for example ishwarganj upazila has a low vulnerability to flood but has a very high hazard score table 5 and fig 8 in contrast phulpur is highly vulnerable to flood but has a very low flood danger table 5 and fig 8 among the thirteen upazila alongside the obr jamalpur sadar and mymensingh sadar are the most risky to floods with a risk level of 3 this study also predicts that sherpur sadar falls under the upper limit of moderate risk condition i e level 2 due to the medium level of hazard and vulnerability on the other hand dewanganj and sreebardi are relatively safe and classified as regions with a risk level of 1 since the two upazilas have both low levels of flood danger and vulnerability fig 8 and table 5 the remaining seven upazilas face a relatively moderate risk condition i e risk level of 2 details of the hazard score and rank vulnerability score and rank and risk level of the obr upazilas are summarized in table 5 based on the flood risk map corresponding to the 2004 flood event with flood depth and risk level overlapping the buildings communities and infrastructures fig 8 our results show that 46 48 of the study area will be inundated if flood depth is greater than 0 30 m and less than 3 60 m as a result many important places and points at risk including approximately 55 609 built ups such as residential buildings factories hospitals and markets 46 dwellings such as villages and towns and 144 important locations such as educational institutes cyclone shelters and other infrastructures this study also shows that the population of major cities and municipalities is much higher than that of the highland area which makes these area most vulnerable and at the highest risk fig 8 the above results are also supported by the previous studies by bhuiyan and al baky 2014 and adnan et al 2019 in the context of flood susceptibility zoning mapping of flood hazard and vulnerability in bangladesh our results clear implicate that further urban planning in this region or any other region should pay more attention to the potential flood hazard risk to achieve a sustainable urban planning although availability of natural resources and transportation convenience are key limiting factors for the urban planning finally there are a couple of uncertainties in this study which need be pointed out first we only applied the univariate probability distribution function to fit the discharge series rather than a bivariate or multivariate approach as a result the derived flood return period may be underestimated second uncertainty in the input data such as precipitation model parameters and model structure may also introduce uncertain in the resultant hazard maps despite these uncertainties our study has shown reasonablly well results and is supported by the other independent relevant studies more importantly our proposed framework could be easily applied to the other regions especially in the data scarce areas because this framework provides a comprehensive methods and tools to conduct the necessary analyses for flood risk assessment and can be easily implemented using the public available data such as the long term satellite observed rainfall data 5 conclusions this study provides a framework for assessing flood risk based on the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling and bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis for the old brahmaputra river watershed our study finds that most of the flooding areas have a water depth greater than 0 30 m figs 6 and 8 the area under cultivation has a flood depth of more than 3 6 m implying a significant impact on agriculture due to the flooding and livelihood fig 8 approximately 46 48 of this region will be under hazardous conditions given a flood event with a recurrence interval of 15 50 years our results also indicate that the estimation of flood discharges from the log normal distribution is more reliable for the design and operation of vital infrastructures flood risk management and flood hazard mapping besides the computed risk levels were reasonably consistent with the overall property distribution and flood hazard potential in the study area the findings of this study are in good agreement with previous studies but provide a better understanding about the integrated flood risk and vulnerability assessment the outcomes of this study would help minimize the impacts of flooding and assist in an early warning of future flooding in the context of bangladesh the developed coupling strategy also provides a valuable tool for flood mapping and risk assessment in the south asian regions credit authorship contribution statement ke zhang conceptualization data curation investigation

25677,accurately quantifying and assessing the flood risks is critical for flood hazard mitigation and prevention this study proposed a new integrated flood risk assessment framework to map flood risk hazard and vulnerability by coupling the hec hms hydrological model the hec ras 1d and 2d hydraulic models and a bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis the old brahmaputra river floodplain of bangladesh a flood prone region was chosen as a case study the coupled hydrological hydraulic model shows a comparable robust performance in both calibration and validation periods with nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient 0 93 0 81 coefficient of determination 0 95 0 89 and percent bias 1 17 2 40 for the calibration validation period our results indicate that the assessed risk levels are roughly consistent with the overall property distribution and flood hazard potential in the study area the proposed framework and associated findings are valuable for developing adaptation strategies and early warning systems to reduce flood impacts in the future keywords bottom up hazard vulnerability coupled hydrological hydraulic model flood frequency analysis flood risk assessment old brahmaputra river floodplain 1 introduction as one of the most common natural disasters around the world flood often destroys the physical environment and damages the local economy and societal well beings liu et al 2016 tingsanchali 2012 leskens et al 2014 parvin et al 2016 petit boix et al 2017 chao et al 2019 sun et al 2020 rapid population growth and land use land cover change patterns have increased human vulnerability to floods all over the world forzieri et al 2020 schwalm et al 2013 zang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 floods can lead to mortality displacement of community and damage of crops and infrastructure parry et al 2007 doocy et al 2013 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 dolatabadi and ahmadzadeh 2019 chao et al 2020 apparently flooding is a global phenomenon in particular it has caused devastating consequences in south asia including bangladesh india myanmar and nepal leskens et al 2014 dewan 2015 halgamuge and nirmalathas 2017 khaing et al 2019 the great devastating impacts of floods in south asia and the other regions requires a deep understanding of the flood risks in these regions flood risk assessment is a key component of flood risk management and aims to investigate the high risk area of flood occurrence chen et al 2011 yamanashi et al 2016 mojaddadi et al 2017 zeleňáková et al 2019 rezende et al 2020 a comprehensive flood risk assessment requires a wide range of analyses such as technical cost problem policy and loss analyses chen et al 2011 hence comprehensive flood risk analysis by detecting hazardous and risky areas is an essential part of estimating the extent of damages due to flooding meyer et al 2009 mojaddadi et al 2017 chan et al 2018 basturk et al 2021 developing accurate flood risk assessment techniques and improving our knowledge of flood vulnerability can assist law makers and decision makers to minimize damages and mortalities nasiri et al 2016 badakhshan et al 2019 as a result flood risk assessment serves as an important tool for mitigation and prevention of the flood disasters recently remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technologies have been used for flood prediction preparation prevention and risk assessment around the world tehrany et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 most studies applied hydrologic and hydraulic models to simulate flood runoff and runoff in low lying and flood prone areas anselmo et al 1996 smithers et al 1997 booij 2005 montanari et al 2013 ahmadisharaf and kalyanapu 2019 nogherotto et al 2019 besides flood risk can also be assessed with multi criteria analysis of inundation depth generated by hydraulic and hydrologic models such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp and multi attribute utility theory maut methods zhang et al 2002 meyer et al 2009 chen et al 2011 recently ahmadisharaf and kalyanapu 2019 applied coupled a semi distributed hydrologic model and a 2d unsteady hydraulic model to estimate the uncertainty of flood loss in the swannanoa river watershed north carolina united states besides ahmadisharaf et al 2018 represented a generic probabilistic framework that couples a hydrological model with an unsteady hydraulic model to estimate the uncertainty of flood characteristics moreover new advances in the rs and gis provide new data and ways to improve the simulation accuracy of the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling grimaldi et al 2016 2018 therefore the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling equipped with the rs and gis provides us a new tool to conduct the flood risk assessment application of the hec ras model is gaining popularity for flood routing and flood level forecasting due to its capability to route simple open water floods and produce water level forecasts simultaneously hicks and peacock 2005 the hec hms model is recently applied for analyzing flood frequency and flood warning system oleyiblo and li 2010 halwatura and najim 2013 further researchers have also started to use the coupled hydrological hydraulic model for future flood plain mapping as well as risk assessment in different parts of the world van nguyen et al 2016 thakur et al 2017 van popering verkerk and van buuren 2017 ahmadisharaf et al 2018 abdessamed and abderrazak 2019 blöschl et al 2019 cowles et al 2019 clearly the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling also plays an important role on flood risk assessment the ever increasing population ill planned infrastructural development and massive flood control interventions in a floodplain environment have led to flood disasters becoming more extensive and frequent in recent years rahman and salehin 2013 ahmadzadeh and dolatabadi 2018 dolatabadi et al 2020 flood occurs every year in bangladesh with the recorded most devastating floods in 1974 1984 1988 1998 2004 2007 2015 2016 and 2017 which caused severe damages to people and properties dewan 2013 biswas et al 2018 adnan et al 2019 old brahmaputra river obr is a left bank distributary of the brahmaputra river and the off take of obr is at bahadurabad point causes of flood risks in the obr basin include geographic location geological and geomorphological formation and excessive rainfall during the monsoon and river siltation the decreasing trend of the average annual discharge and gradual silting at the mouth of obr is obstructing smooth flow from the brahmaputra to downstream reaches ali 2010 noor 2013 hossain and meng 2020 additionally rapid urbanization of the flood plain has also contributed to the increased magnitude and frequency of floods in recent years the dramatic change of land use reduces soil water storage capacity and increases direct surface runoff that can easily form flooding considering the above discussed factors coupling hydrological model hydraulic model and risk assessment model for flood risk assessment can provide early warning and support the development of flood prevention system to relief the impacts of possible flood events in the old brahmaputra river watershed tehrany et al 2013 many studies have been devoted to identifying the prime causes and impacts of floods in bangladesh tingsanchali and karim 2005 carrel et al 2010 bhuiyan and dutta 2012 haque and jahan 2015 however flood risk assessment using the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling is still unavailable in the obr basin area of bangladesh besides a vulnerability analysis by bottom up hazard in this region could provide guidelines to the decision makers to estimate the damages caused by floods each year this study aims a to carry out a flood frequency analysis of the flood discharge data using selected probability distributions models log normal log pearson type iii and gumbel b to assess flood risk using feature class normalization and c to prepare risk map using gis based coupled

as follows section 2 describes the study area and various datasets section 3 introduces the developed methodological framework including the flood frequency analysis the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling system analysis methods for flood risk hazard and vulnerability and the calibration and validation strategies section 4 describes the results finally summary of the main findings and conclusions are given in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area namely the old brahmaputra river obr watershed geographically ranges between 24 21 6 25 40 9 n in latitude and between 89 45 30 90 30 10 e in longitude the river main branch of the study area has a length of 138 km located in northeastern parts of bangladesh fig 1 a and spans three districts of the mymensingh division i e mymensingh jamalpur and sherpur that are further composed of 13 upazilas fig 1 b upazila is a small administrative region or known as a sub district in bangladesh obr originates from the left bank of the brahmaputra river to the north of bahadurabad and meets with the meghna river at bhairab bazar the width of obr is around 200 m with channel sinuosity of 1 24 average bed slope of obr is 6 cm km expanding to 5 6 m in breadth in many places the common land use types in this region include agriculture land fallow land and vegetation as a distributary of the brahmaputra river obr suffers seasonal riverine floods the jinjirum river a tributary of obr flows from the indo bangladesh border and acts as the primary source of dry season flow of obr precipitation has a strong seasonality in this watershed four prominent seasons are recognized in bangladesh i e pre monsoon march to may monsoon or rainy monsoon june to september post monsoon october and november and dry winter season december to february ahasan et al 2010 mullick et al 2019 in bangladesh floods frequently occur in the monsoon season while occasionally excessive rainfall during the pre monsoon season may also cause flash floods inhabitants in this region are mainly dependent on conventional agricultural production and primarily live along the riverbank increasing the risk of flooding 2 2 data

economic data are collected from the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs http www bbs gov bd to assess the socio economic vulnerability to flooding in the study area the sources and other information of these datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 methodology the framework to assess the flood risk developed in this study involves several major procedures pre process of basic data such as hydrometeorology land use land cover and dem data watershed delineation flood frequency analysis hydrological hydraulic modeling flood hazard and risk assessment fig 2 hydrometeorological data such as precipitation discharge and water level are directly used for hydrological modeling and flood frequency analysis flood frequency analysis uses a long term record of streamflow data to compute the flood frequencies of historical flood events and determine a typical flood event for further modeling and risk assessment the coupled hec hms and hec ras 1d 2d modeling simulate the hydrological processes and inundation of the selected typical flood event the outputs of the coupled hec hms and hec ras 1d 2d model such as flood depth flood velocity inundated area and other socio economic data including population density educational status economic conditions and housing and infrastructure are used as input for the flood hazard vulnerability and risk assessment analysis fig 2 in this advanced integrated method we coupled the united states army corps of engineers usace hec hms version 4 3 https www hec usace army mil software hec hms with the usace hec ras version 5 0 3 https www hec usace army mil software hec ras to do the simulation of the hydrological and hydraulic processes the hec ras model is a hydraulic model software that models the 1 dimensional 1d and 2 dimensional 2d hydraulics of water flow through natural rivers and other channels the relevant outputs of the hec hms and hec ras coupled system are then used as inputs of the bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis to quantify flood risk and its components 3 1 flood frequency analysis in this study the purpose of the flood frequency analysis is to determine the return period exceedance probability of the historical typical flood events so that we can conduct flood risk assessment based on the typical flood events to this end three flood frequency probability distributions including the log normal ln2 log pearson type iii lp3 and gumbel gev distributions were adopted to fit the streamflow data flood frequency analysis was conducted using annual maximum series of discharges data of 30 years 1988 2017 the observed annual maximum streamflow discharge for each year of the observation period is selected from a discharge time series to derive flood events recurrence intervals the recurrence intervals t r of a given streamflow discharge in the time series is obtained using the weibull formula chow et al 1988 ehiorobo and izinyon 2013 1 t r n 1 m where n is the number of years of the observation period and m is the rank of this given streamflow discharge which is obtained by arranging the data series in the descending order and assigning the highest value with a rank of 1 and the lowest value with a rank of n the corresponding design discharge q t of a given recurrence interval t can be computed by equation 2 ghosh and guchhait 2016 2 q t q k σ where q is the mean of the discharge data k is the frequency factor corresponding to each return period and σ is the standard deviation for the discharge data that is calculated as 3 σ q q 2 n 1 3 2 coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling hec ras hydraulic model version 5 0 3 was set up as a coupled 1d 2d model in which river flow was modeled in one dimension and floodplain flow was modeled in two dimensions to couple the hec ras with hec hms we first used the arcgis tool hec geohms to derive the hydrological physical conditions such as the main river channels and the delineation of the associated sub basin then the hec hms hydrologic model is applied to simulate the outflows of all subbasins which serve as the inflows and boundary conditions for the main river channels and the lateral flows of the main river channels in addtion the water level data at the mymensingh station fig 1 serve as the input downstream boundary condition in the hec ras model for this study the preprocessing needed by the hec ras simulation was conducted using the hec georas software and arcgis the monsoon seasons june september of 2004 were selected as calibration periods and the monsoon season of 2007 as validation periods in this study the hec geohms and arcgis platforms were used to process the dem to derive the topographic land surface river network and geographical data required by the hec hms model the soil conservation service scs curve number cn unit hydrograph and muskingum routing methods were selected for computing runoff generation hill slope flow concentration and channel routing respectively to verify the reliability and robustness of the hec hms model we further divided the simulation periods 2003 2017 into the calibration 2003 2006 and validation 2014 2017 periods the input data for the hec hms model include the 3 hourly rainfall data and monthly evapotranspiration data to evaluate the capability of the model a set of commonly used goodness of fit indicator i e the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e and the percentage of deviation from observed streamflow p b i a s were calculated the r 2 metric is an indicator of the strength of the relationship between the observed and simulated values when the r 2 value is close to 0 or the n s e value is less than or close to 0 the model prediction is considered unacceptable the value of r 2 can be calculated by equation 4 4 r 2 i n q i o q o q i s q s 2 i n q i o q o 2 i n q i s q s 2 where q i o is the i t h observed value q i s is the corresponding i t h simulated value q o is the mean of observed data q s is the mean of the simulated data and n is the total number of observations the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e value can be calculated by equation 5 5 n s e 1 i 1 n q i s q s 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 the n s e value ranges from to 1 with n s e 1 as the most optimum value the optimal value of percent bias pbias is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate underestimation by model while negative values indicate overestimation by model gupta et al 1999 the value of p b i a s can be calculated by equation 6 6 p b i a s i 1 n q i o q i s 100 i 1 n q i o where p b i a s is the deviation of data being evaluated expressed as a percentage 3 3 flood risk hazard and vulnerability analysis the total risk of flood r i s k i with a two dimensional index i e hazard and vulnerability to a given location i is assessed by equations 7 and 8 7 r i s k i h i v i 8 v i e i where h i is the hazard index and v i is the vulnerability index at location i which is the combination of multiple socio economic exposure indicators e and impact indicators i by following jahan 2018 and rahman 2019 for the bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis the hazard value of each administrative region upazila was evaluated according to geographic coverage of flood percentage of inundation area and propagation flow velocity vulnerability was evaluated considering population based eight different indicators table 2 based on rahman 2019 and principal component analysis pca recommended by jahan 2018 risk assessment was calculated based on the degree of exposure to floods and the possibility of floods occurring in the study area the risk was evaluated by four risk levels based on the criteria set by the project risk manager prm using the 5 by 5 risk matrix evaluation method fig 3 following ryu et al 2017 the scores of hazard h and vulnerability v are ranked from 1 to 5 according to the criteria proposed by jahan 2018 thus the multiplied value of hazard and vulnerability ranges between 1 and 25 the value of r i s k o b r j level was derived for the thirteen upazila as denoted by j under the districts of mymensingh jamalpur and sherpur of the study area using equation 9 9 r i s k o b r j h j v j with h j 1 2 3 4 5 v j 1 2 3 4 5 1 j 13 and r i s k o b r j s a f e m o d e r a t e m a j o r s e v e r e in this study three indicators were used to quantify the flood hazard i e flood depth percentage of inundation area and flow velocity to calculate the hazard index h its indicators need to be standardized considering that different indicators have different units and magnitudes the hazard and vulnerability scores are calculated as a weighted mean of their respective indicators and then normalized for hazard and vulnerability analysis to bring all values into the range a b or 1 100 equation 10 is used to achieve the normalization process 10 x a b a x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 1 n o r m a l i z e d x 100 where xi is the original value xmin is the minimum value and xmax is the maximum value of normalization after deriving the normalized values of the indicators and corresponding weights hazard and vulnerability score at the upazila level can be calculated using equation 11 11 d j w j 1 d i 1 w j 2 d i 2 w j 3 d i 3 w j n d i n where d j is hazard or vulnerability of an individual upazila d i 1 to d i n is the hazard or vulnerability indicator for an upazila j and w is the corresponding weight assigned to the individual indicator of that upazila j 3 4 calibration and validation strategies of coupled model in this study the hec hms model was run for a warming up period of six months prior the continuous simulation to limit the impacts of uncertainty in the manually assigned initial conditions the hec hms model was calibrated and validated using three different calibration strategies we chose the three different strategies to assess whether the optimized model parameters are location dependent and to avoid the selection of the localized parameter values the first strategy is to calibrate the model parameters subbasin wise from upstream to downstream the second strategy is to calibrate the model parameters subbasin wise from downstream to upstream the third strategy is to calibrate the model parameters subbasin wise using a random order in theory the first strategy will cause that the calibrated parameter values of the downstream subbasins are dependent on the calibrated values of the upperstream subbasins in constrast the second strategy will lead to that the calibrated parameter values of the upperstream subbasins rely on the calibration results of the downstream subbasins the third strategy will make the calibration dependency in a random order however if all of the three strategies can lead to a similar preformance it will prove that the model calibration is location independent 4 results and discussions 4 1 results of calibration and validation the rainfall runoff hec hms model was calibrated and validated using the observed discharge at the mymensingh and jamalpur stations of the obr watershed the coupled hydrological hydraulic model was calibrated for 2004 and validated for 2007 for both of these stations as shown in fig 4 the simulated flows agree well with the observed values for both calibration and validation periods at the mymensingh outlet similarly the simulated water level at the jamalpur point also matches very well with the observations during both calibration and validation periods fig 5 as mentioned above the hec hms model was calibrated using three calibration strategies first model shows trivial difference between the results using the three calibration strategies indicated by the close nse values 0 795 0 798 and 0 665 0 674 for calibration and validation respectively and r2 values 0 805 0 806 and 0 707 0 709 for calibration and validation respectively table 3 second the model performance in the validation is generally similar to that in the calibration but is slightly downgraded 0 665 0 674 validation vs 0 795 0 798 calibration and 0 707 0 709 validation vs 0 805 0 806 calibration for the nse and r2 metrics respectively table 3 the above results indicate that the hec hms model is well optimized in this study and that the hec hms model is overall reliable and robust for flood simulation in this study area 4 2 flood frequency analysis results frequency analysis gives the probability of flood occurrences based on the annual maximum series of discharges of the obr for several return periods 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 and 500 years flood as shown in table 4 the percentage deviation of ln2 distribution based values from the gev distribution based values ranges from 11 82 at tr 500 years to 4 66 at tr 2 years indicating that the fitted results based on these two distributions are very close to each other apart from this at 2 year return period both the lp3 and ln distributions predicted higher discharge values than the gev distribution table 4 our analysis suggests that log normal distribution is more suitable for the design of flood control structures as the design of these structures requires larger return periods to mitigate against the effect of floods for a long period and save the cost of rebuilding the event of failures the percentage deviations of the lp distribution from the gev distribution are generally small and range from 6 39 at 2 years to 0 72 at 500 years table 4 for the high frequency periods up to 5 years the ln distribution based values are higher than the gev results this implies that if a lower design value is required for up to 5 years ln2 is suitable but not economical the results show that the ln2 distribution appears to be the most appropriate flood frequency distribution for this region due to the largest discharge values among the three distributions tested on the sample data and the most consistent with the return periods more important the log normal distribution has a better goodness of fit r2 0 94 than the lp3 r2 0 92 and gev r2 0 90 distributions similar to our findings alam et al 2018 also identified that the ln2 distribution provided the best fitted results for northeastern region of bangladesh which is close to our study area therefore we adopted the ln2 distribution for the computation of flood return periods in this study to militate against the effect of floods for an extended period and save the cost of rebuilding in the event of failures our study provides an inundation map based on the 2004 flood event as it is one of the most devastating floods in the history of bangladesh the floods of 2004 lasted from july to september and covered 50 of the country of their peak besides the rainfall totals of over 300 mm in just seven days resulted in extensive flooding across the country notably in the northeast region www coolgeography co uk fig 6 shows the map of flood inundation based on the 2004 flood event with a recurrence interval of 15 50 years the results show that a total area of 757 90 km2 about 58 42 of the total area is at risk of flooding the upstream regions such as dewanganj baksiganj and sreebardi have a relatively low flood depth ranging from 0 30 m to 0 90 m fig 4 whereas downstream areas of the obr face high inundation varying between 1 80 m and 3 60 m fig 4 these areas with high flood depths are also the highly populated areas such as jamalpur sadar and mymensingh sadar making them under the highest inundation risk among the thirteen upazilas this analysis agrees with the flood susceptibility map drawn by recent peer studies in bangladesh adnan et al 2019 uddin et al 2019 uddin and matin 2021 specifically uddin and matin 2021 observed that northeastern parts of bangladesh including the greater mymensingh and sylhet divisions were inundated to the maximum extent during the recent monsoonal flood of 2020 it is worth of noting that analysis of flood events may involve multiple variables such as flood peak discharge flood volume and flood water level brunner et al 2016 uddin and matin 2021 although univariate probability distribution functions are usually used to estimate the occurrence probability or magnitude of the flood peak or volume in a particular region in flood frequency analysis zhang et al 2018 to more accurately estimate the probability of flooding one needs to know not only the high and extreme values of each variable but also the likelihood of their coinciding brunner et al 2017 the main issue of the univariate models is their difficulties in capturing the underlying joint probability among multiple physical processes which will lead to underestimation of the associated occurring probability fiorentino et al 2011 brunner et al 2016 4 3 risk and hazard analysis based on our flood risk assessment we derived the maps of hazard score vulnerability score and risk level for the whole region fig 7 similar to the spatial pattern of the simulated inundation map fig 6 the hazard level generally increases from the upstream northwest to the downstream southeast fig 7 a the upazilas with higher hazard levels are generally located in the lowland areas and along the obr river fig 7 a for the vulnerability the upazilas that are most vulnerable to floods are also located in the downstream areas fig 7 b these observations are in good agreement with a previous study by gain et al 2013 which also found that the lower part of the brahmaputra river has a high flood vulnerability this spatial pattern of hazard and vulnerability analyses is mainly related with the spatial distributions of population economy livelihood and land use regarding the resultant flood risk no upazila in the study area is under severe risky conditions with respect to the 2004 flood event fig 7 c the upazilas with the highest risks are jamalpur s mymensingh s and ishwarganj fig 7 c and table 5 although the three upazilas have a similar level of risk they have different compositions of hazard and vulnerability scores for example ishwarganj upazila has a low vulnerability to flood but has a very high hazard score table 5 and fig 8 in contrast phulpur is highly vulnerable to flood but has a very low flood danger table 5 and fig 8 among the thirteen upazila alongside the obr jamalpur sadar and mymensingh sadar are the most risky to floods with a risk level of 3 this study also predicts that sherpur sadar falls under the upper limit of moderate risk condition i e level 2 due to the medium level of hazard and vulnerability on the other hand dewanganj and sreebardi are relatively safe and classified as regions with a risk level of 1 since the two upazilas have both low levels of flood danger and vulnerability fig 8 and table 5 the remaining seven upazilas face a relatively moderate risk condition i e risk level of 2 details of the hazard score and rank vulnerability score and rank and risk level of the obr upazilas are summarized in table 5 based on the flood risk map corresponding to the 2004 flood event with flood depth and risk level overlapping the buildings communities and infrastructures fig 8 our results show that 46 48 of the study area will be inundated if flood depth is greater than 0 30 m and less than 3 60 m as a result many important places and points at risk including approximately 55 609 built ups such as residential buildings factories hospitals and markets 46 dwellings such as villages and towns and 144 important locations such as educational institutes cyclone shelters and other infrastructures this study also shows that the population of major cities and municipalities is much higher than that of the highland area which makes these area most vulnerable and at the highest risk fig 8 the above results are also supported by the previous studies by bhuiyan and al baky 2014 and adnan et al 2019 in the context of flood susceptibility zoning mapping of flood hazard and vulnerability in bangladesh our results clear implicate that further urban planning in this region or any other region should pay more attention to the potential flood hazard risk to achieve a sustainable urban planning although availability of natural resources and transportation convenience are key limiting factors for the urban planning finally there are a couple of uncertainties in this study which need be pointed out first we only applied the univariate probability distribution function to fit the discharge series rather than a bivariate or multivariate approach as a result the derived flood return period may be underestimated second uncertainty in the input data such as precipitation model parameters and model structure may also introduce uncertain in the resultant hazard maps despite these uncertainties our study has shown reasonablly well results and is supported by the other independent relevant studies more importantly our proposed framework could be easily applied to the other regions especially in the data scarce areas because this framework provides a comprehensive methods and tools to conduct the necessary analyses for flood risk assessment and can be easily implemented using the public available data such as the long term satellite observed rainfall data 5 conclusions this study provides a framework for assessing flood risk based on the coupled hydrological hydraulic modeling and bottom up hazard vulnerability analysis for the old brahmaputra river watershed our study finds that most of the flooding areas have a water depth greater than 0 30 m figs 6 and 8 the area under cultivation has a flood depth of more than 3 6 m implying a significant impact on agriculture due to the flooding and livelihood fig 8 approximately 46 48 of this region will be under hazardous conditions given a flood event with a recurrence interval of 15 50 years our results also indicate that the estimation of flood discharges from the log normal distribution is more reliable for the design and operation of vital infrastructures flood risk management and flood hazard mapping besides the computed risk levels were reasonably consistent with the overall property distribution and flood hazard potential in the study area the findings of this study are in good agreement with previous studies but provide a better understanding about the integrated flood risk and vulnerability assessment the outcomes of this study would help minimize the impacts of flooding and assist in an early warning of future flooding in the context of bangladesh the developed coupling strategy also provides a valuable tool for flood mapping and risk assessment in the south asian regions credit authorship contribution statement ke zhang conceptualization data curation investigation

25678,the present article proposes a suite of programs aimed at i representing landscape organization in relation with the functioning of annual crops or breeding systems ii evaluating water movements from biomass and hydrological exchanges and iii analyzing the transfer dynamics of nutrients suspended matter or fecal bacteria based on particle tracking methods simulations provided indications about the underlying processes that drive exchanges and sink source effects operating at the landscape scale opale was tested in three agricultural contexts and biophysical situations water flows and flows of associated matters were compared to data recorded at the catchment outlet and showed the efficiency of the algorithms developed in the generic opale libraries this article describes the underlying hypotheses and the full mathematical framework and procedures used to assess landscape eco functionality several examples are given to illustrate the use of opale in landscape reconfiguration prospects e g influence of landscape composition and structure on plant transpiration stream flow erosion nutrient and organism fluxes in water for the agroecological transition keywords farming systems decision rules agricultural landscapes crop management hydrological processes agroecology 1 introduction agroecology is aimed at developing several approaches to solve current agricultural production challenges wezel et al 2009 hatt et al 2018 it develops field and territory level innovations to increase interactions among plant animal and microorganism communities as mentioned by gascuel odoux and magda 2015 a major challenge is not only to promote designs of production systems and crop management methods on an ecological basis but also to consider innovations at the territorial level a main challenge is to find ways of defining new farmland organizations to enhance ecological landscape functionalities while considering economic activities bio geochemical cycles and biological processes poggi et al 2021 stakeholders are increasingly concerned by soil management and natural resource protection as well as by the closure of the water and nutrient cycles the control of contaminants etc as all of them are highly dependent on land use and land cover at the catchment scale agricultural landscapes can be considered as macro ecosystems resulting from interactions between the human society and biophysical processes landscapes constitute the mirror of past and present relationships between human beings and their surrounding nature vanier 1995 we considered landscapes as spatial arrangements of features agricultural fields urban forested semi natural elements like hedges grass strips ditches and flows operating at different time and spatial scales some of them are controlled by human activities flows of energy fertilizers farm effluents flows caused by herd displacements etc others are inherent in the functioning of the eco biophysical context considering the importance of water issues in the context of global change the ambitions of the agroecological transition gascuel odoux and magda 2015 and landscapes water quality relationships chaplin kramer et al 2016 the present article is focused on landscape eco functionalities related to water flows water displacement within landscapes and associated movements of solutes and living or inert suspended matter the operational assessment of landscape eco functionalities is aimed at evaluating the links between landscape composition land uses structure spatial arrangement of different land uses and water flows and nutrient pollutant flows associated with water movements it requires the implementation of interdisciplinary approaches modeling can offer an adapted framework to analyze and interpret the complexity of landscape macro ecosystems poggi et al 2021 especially when considering numerous links between decisions climate soils and organisms within the critical zone landscapes have been the object of several modeling developments focusing on the design of agricultural territories see for example maelia rizzo et al 2019 or the interpretation of landscape organizations in terms of water budget and flows mydhas moussa et al 2002 to the best of our knowledge links between these two approaches are sparse as mentioned by langhammer et al 2019 and zellner et al 2020 developing generic modeling of the links between human decisions water needs and water ecosystem functions is central to achieve evaluations of landscapes and elaborate territory prospects in a context of global change the present article describes opale a tool developed to address the issue of the agroecological transition at the landscape level the model considers a large set of agricultural production systems and hydrological conditions it is focused on i landscape design resulting from farming system parameters and decisions ii surface hydrology and biophysical processes more precisely the tool includes a set of libraries about the following items the design of the landscape occupied by farmland providing the distribution of crops across farmed fields based on from farming practices and schedules land use and land cover change model lulcc the modeling of water movements within previous simulated landscapes considering surface hypodermical and deep trajectories water movements within landscapes model wmwl the evaluation of inert and living solute and suspended matter transfers associated with water displacements including n p escherischia coli ec and suspended matter solute and suspended matter transfer ssmt the construction of normalized indicators of landscape functions in order to assess their regulation services a theoretical frame will be first presented to introduce our working hypotheses and our methods then opale software architecture will be presented with three different application cases differing in terms of agricultural and hydrological context they were implemented to assess several issues related to soil conservation nutrient cycling and surface water eutrophication or the degradation of the bacteriological quality of water resources 2 method and theory 2 1 land use and land cover change lulcc the unutilised agricultural area nuaa of landscapes non productive infrastructures urban areas forests is documented by geographical databases corine land cover shapes of forested areas simulating lulcc in utilised agricultural areas a is somewhat complex because of the diversity of farming systems and associated practices thenail et al 2009 benoît et al 2012 several models working at the plot level a plot corresponds here to an agricultural parcel a continuous area of land declared by a farmer on which a single group of crops is cultivated concern the organization of annual crop rotations dury et al 2012 but those that enable dealing with livestock or both livestock and crop farms are scarce one of the difficulties lies in their ability to manage the distribution of technical rules among plots and their respective contribution to the overall fodder balance for livestock and to commercial benefits for annual crop production for annual crops landscapes change every year in relation with crop successions and rotation rules taillandier et al 2012 formulated the choice of crop rotation as a multi criteria decision problem for each plot the farmer chooses a crop rotation following evaluations at the farm level based on several criteria financial risk expected income workload farmer s habits other works only focus on the crop allocation problem for example martel et al 2017 formalized it as a constraint satisfaction problem integrating agronomic and crop distribution constraints another work using optimization proposes to solve the crop allocation problem by computing the maximum flow of a transition graph of all possible multi year crop successions itineraries permitted by rotation rules houet et al 2014 then an optimization process is applied to select the itineraries allowing for the objectives of annual cropping plans expected surfaces of crop production to be achieved at the farm level for livestock and mixed crop livestock farms constraints are determined by livestock feed demands landscapes are quite stable from one year to the next as they are not subject to rotation and succession rules however the distribution of biomasses varies intra annually in relation to the grazing and hay cutting schedule landscapes show spatial structures with blocks assemblages of several plots of specific uses we considered three blocks fig 1 block 1 grouped priority plots for pastures of productive animals practices p1 hp1 cf supplementary material s1 permanent or temporary meadows for hay production and late pasture h3cp1 and h2cp1 and hp2 as well as distant pastures for non productive animals p2 the area of these blocks depends on the farming system for example the first block had to provide around 50 of unit forage needs ha in a milk round bale system versus 90 for traditional systems cf supplementary material s1 several constraints determine the extension and location of these blocks such as plant growth rates and palatability distance between livestock sheds and fields accessibility slope and soil conditions marie et al 2016 for example in case of dairy production a permanent meadow according to its slope its agronomic potential and its distance from the milking parlor may not be equally assigned to the grazing of dairy cows hay crops or the grazing of young cattle giving that livestock headcount cannot be easily changed in livestock systems landscape construction was modeled with reference to cascade rules and supply demand constraints where pasture for productive animal are the priority followed by crops and hay crops productions and finally pasture for heifers or lots of non productive animals for the remaining surfaces josselin et al 1999 as the drivers of the distribution of activities of a crop farm and a livestock farm differ greatly we did not use the same approach to represent the landscape design for crops farms including vegetable production we chose an algorithm similar to the one proposed by houet et al 2014 where the spatial distribution of crops depends on an optimization process based on maximal flow computations in this representation activities are constraint by cropping plans and rules related to permitted of forbidden crop rotations fig 1 with the following hypothesis i in the case of vegetable production with crops requiring regular daily intervention seeding planting harvesting packaging priority blocks nearby working sheds must be first allocated before implementing maximum flow computations ii crop system landscapes do not change according to seasonal climate changes as farmers can adjust irrigation schedules or change the final commercialization of the harvested products depending on the way meteorological conditions evolve iii all the plots concerned by the maximum flow computation are considered to be unconstrained by edaphic humidity stoniness etc topographical slope or cadastral conditions in the event that one or several plots cannot be used for annual crops their dominant use must be indicated in the geographical database describing the nuaa the maximum flow was computed using the classic edmonds karp max flow algorithm edmonds and karp 1972 as this algorithm is stochastic different solutions of spatial crop allocation can be obtained between two executions depending on random choices for the construction of graph edges unlike taillandier et al 2012 labor tasks were not explicitly evaluated but plowing sowing and hoeing dates were stochastically distributed in the computed crop successions to generate noise in calendars for livestock farms fig 2 we implemented stepwise computations controlling the adequacy between plot supply and the priorities for pasture and forage demands as proposed by marie et al 2016 considering farming systems and livestock heads we determined the forage needs and allocated them to farmlands following priorities and surface ratios of forage practices intensive or extensive meadows and pastures cf supplementary material s1 we considered that the extent of spatial blocks could change under unfavorable climatic situations because livestock feeding is priority over the constitution of forage stocks landscapes and the dynamics of grass biomass were therefore modified following seasonal climatic evolution in accordance with priority rules for livestock needs the time step for the simulations of livestock or crop systems is one day and the time span of the simulation is fixed by the user one year is the minimum required to build a landscape over the seasons much longer in crop sytems to evaluate landscape evolution according to successions 2 2 water movements within landscapes wmwl modeling water movements requires implementing distributed approaches in which a computational domain is defined by the watershed boundaries a watershed is a land area that channels rainfall and snowmelt to rivers and to an outflow point generally represented by square grid meshes where each individual cell defined as a square area of a dimension fixed by the pixel dimension of the digital elevation model is the object of water balance computations may use simultaneous or sequential approaches in the simultaneous approach implicit digital schemes can be performed to solve partial differential matrix equations considering all flows and local processes of the computational domain as in modflow harbaugh 2005 such an implementation is no straightforward task as an example boundary conditions must be defined for domains where the deepest geological structures and their links with the hydrological network are generally unknown or poorly known also the stability of the solution of the matrix equations is unsure because it depends on the configuration of the digital schemes to overcome these difficulties the sequential approach considers cell balance solved explicitly by cascade schemes from up slopes to the watershed outlet kiesel et al 2013 in addition all the processes that control soil moisture e g evapotranspiration percolation are evaluated successively in the same way as in the distributed smdr model gérard marchant et al 2006 or in the semi distributed swat model arnold and fohrer 2005 we chose this approach although it does not represent hydrodynamic processes simultaneously first errors are restrained when time step computations are shortened trevisan and periáňez 2016 second there are several operational gains i the deepest domain can be represented by black box representations ii equations are formal giving an eprouved ability to provide evaluations of time varying land management practices me et al 2018 iii no solver configuration is required two soil volumes were considered in the wmwl model i the vadose zone in the topsoil delimited by root depth overlying ii the saturated zone fig 3 the general water balance for extended hydrodynamic situations was 1 d w v z d t r e l h v s a h h o r h i m p d where w v z is the water store in the vadose zone mm d t the time interval d and the following all expressed in mm d 1 r rainfall e evapotranspiration d vertical drainage l the lateral movements of water sub surface flows h v s a overland flow generated by soil saturation variable source area runoff h h o r hortonian runoff h i m p overland flow from impermeabilized urban areas and d vertical drainage l h v a s h h o r and h i m p net values can be positive or negative depending on whether water flows are coming from up slope cells or directed to down slope cells respectively the processes controlling the water balance equation are summarized in fig 3 we accounted for a large diversity of hydrodynamic processes to extend the applicability of the wmwl model to generic situations biomass dynamics root depth and evapotranspiration flows were computed for vegetables crops and pastures by the generalized plant growth model gérard marchant et al 2006 detailed in appendix a 7 1 the model is based on a computation of cumulative degree days several thresholds were considered accounting for plant growth rates practices and farming schedules seeding cuts etc all of them tabulated from the lulcc model outputs we introduced first order kinetics to describe water table behavior arnold and fohrer 2005 lellay 2006 the seepage of the water table into the river network was evaluated from a transfer function applied during a restitution period hingray et al 2009 in this representation one of the major issues sarrazin 2012 is the capacity of the model to reproduce the hydrologically active areas of watersheds zones where groundwater tables can effectively seep into the river network following gurnell 1978 we considered that the representation of a river network dynamics accounted for temporary drying out of the river network and calculated the number of river segments where seepage was effective hypodermic water movement along slopes where topsoils are bounded by restricting layers or low permeability layers can favor the rising of sub surface water tables over the soil surface in thalweg and down slope conditions obled and zin 2004 gérard marchant et al 2006 for this reason the variable source area hydrology concept dunne et al 1975 was integrated in the wmwl computing scheme soil surface crusting is a main determinant of hortonian runoff process based models e g see jetten et al 1998 were developed to estimate hortonian runoff flows from hydrodynamic properties of soil surface crusts their applicability to agricultural contexts where the crusting dynamics is driven by farming practices and plant biomass development is challenging takken et al 1999 to avoid over parameterization we implemented expert based rules from the stream model cerdan et al 2002 to focus on the dominant drivers of crusting following kiesel et al 2013 we implemented a cascading computational scheme to evaluate water flows along slopes in which water balance was calculated for successive cells sorted by decreasing elevation and increasing index of topographic accumulation schwanghart and kuhn 2010 wmwl equations are fully described in appendix a 2 3 solute and suspended matter transfers ssmts the ssmt model calculates transfer functions to provide standardized evaluations of landscape functioning and help end users in the comparison of landscape configurations and structures transfer functions correspond to a density of mass transfer rate of compounds originating from transient stores often described by exponential or power law distributions haggerty et al 2002 we calculated surface and subsurface transfer functions sstfs for surface and subsurface flows by applying particle tracking methods considered as a key technology for assessing the diversity of displaced matters chenouard et al 2014 here particles represent a solute mass of nutrients in solution sm or ec numbers to assess landscape functioning during critical periods and save computational time sstf calculations were restricted to transfer periods t τ f t where τ f is the transfer duration days following a daily meteorological event of interest dmei starting at date t τ f dmeis are events representative of typical soil moisture conditions and biomass development e g low water periods or fall high flow recovery during the transfer period the ssmt module counts the number of particles that reach the watershed outlet as a function of water trajectories computed by the wmwl model and sink source determinism water trajectories and particle displacements can be interrupted on cells where the soil moisture balance does not exceed saturation thresholds during the transfer period we restricted water exchanges with the atmosphere to evapotranspiration flows rainfall was set to 0 to only account for particle displacements resulting from the landscape draining and water redistribution dynamics produced by dmeis particle tracking was based on previous schemes accounting for pollutant build up wash off and transport processes jiang et al 2019 during the transfer period for each τ days of the interval 0 τ f we considered the s k t τ build up stocks located on the k cells of the computational domain each of them affected by wash off rates w k t τ transferred to the outlet with associated p k τ transfer probabilities based on trévisan et al 2019 the amount of particles produced by a dmei was given by 2 0 τ f q τ 0 τ f 1 k s k t τ w k t τ p k τ for surface and subsurface flows transfer delays are generally short in the range of several days or one two weeks dorioz et al 1989 consequently the following build up stocks s k t τ f t and wash off 3d matrices w k t τ f t were computed for τ f 15 days two indicators of underlying processes driving exchanges and sink source effects operating at the landscape scale were evaluated by ssmt outputs first the dmei

dmeis single event dependent representations of landscape functioning the ssmt equations of particle behavior driving s k t τ w k t τ and q τ values are given in appendix b deeper transfer delays were greater than previously in the range of several months hingray et al 2009 as the groundwater table was represented by a black box analysis particle counting was not fitted the corresponding groundwater transfer function gtf was given by p 1 p τ s τ s λ r with λ a wmwl power law parameter for deep water transfer appendix a τ s the duration of the seepage period and r a retardation factor accounting for sink effects holzbecher 2012 equal to 0 in case of n transfer no sinks outside the vadose zone gtf were catchment scaled and generic event scaled representations of landscape functioning 2 4 model validation 2 4 1 lulcc and wmwl modeling we evaluated the deviation between the farmers cropping plans and the simulated plans through the absolute deviation a d i 1 n x ˆ i x i i 1 n x ˆ i where 1 n is the set of possible land uses x ˆ i the sum of areas of land use i expected by the cropping plan and x i the corresponding simulated sum river outflows summing all water components computed by the wmwl model were confronted to observed values trough the nash sutcliffe coefficient wallach et al 2013 2 4 2 particle tracking and ssmt modeling the amount q t of particles

can write 6 q t 1 k 0 τ f m k t τ p k τ d τ 1 k m k t p k τ where the asterisk represents the convolution product and p k τ the transfer probabilities generated by demis representative of hydro agrosystem conditions over the transfer period the individual particle behaviors and trajectories of surface and subsurface transfers cannot be measured directly to compare ssmt results with observed

lumped computed n total p and soluble p ec and sm outflows were confronted in separate worksheets to observed values following trévisan et al 2019 a unit conversion factor u was evaluated by minimizing the objective function q o b s t u q l t 2 between observed q o b s and calculated q l values of matter outflows 3 software architecture wmwl and opale guis fig 4 were implemented in the matlab environment while the lulcc and ssmt programs fig 5 were implemented with the gama platform taillandier et al 2019 the opale gui allows users to select libraries implement iof writing reading and parameterize commands in the two environments and saga geographical treatment http www saga gis org opale executable for the windows 64 bit environment source codes and documentation are available at github 1 1 https github com tiptop psdr opale git all programs were run on a computer with a cpu intelcore r i7 and 32 go ram at the center of the opale gui a workflow scheme organizes the workflow steps for landscape assessment the workflow scheme differs depending on the selected production systems from the listbox items livestocks crops livestock or crop vegetables at step 1 the new project button and a subsequent exec clic allows reading input files then it opens the gama gui where users can launch an initialization program linking together geographical information soils hydrological network fields farm systems etc as described in supplementary material s3 the computational mesh is also defined here with the sizes of the square grids based on the resolution of the digital elevation model then the lulcc program is opened and performs maximum flow or step computation schemes depending on the selected production systems configuring decision rules for crop successions and distance priorities between farms and practices is allowed lulcc outputs are agricultural landscape structures i e an assemblage of different agricultural plots and landscape infrastructures e g hedges filter strips non productive areas as referenced by grids where their proportion area in the cells of the computational mesh are calculated to limit topological representation biases for the following wmwl calculations the g m button step 2 builds matrices for the matlab environment and performs plant development and topography calculations to build the cascade scheme for sequential water flow balances along slopes the step 3 top buttons open the wmwl model for optimization wmwl optimization can be done contextually based on soil and hydro system properties or automatically with the lsqcurvefit tool in matlab all calculations up to this stage provide a baseline on the current landscape the step 3 bottom buttons open simulation purposes and build new matrices that can be compared to the current landscape if the user needs to analyze production system changes the workflow differs depending on farming conditions for crop vegetable systems crop distribution determined by random selections in the lulcc model forward planning of farming systems is implemented by modifying the crop areas of the first year of the crop succession in order to follow the initial patterns of crop distributions the aim is to avoid repeated simulations to obtain converging agent based model simulations outputs that are commonly done to compare present and future territories grillot et al 2018 the price to pay is that only the first year of the crop succession of current and future landscapes can be compared we implemented such modifications within the matlab environment where the first year of the current landscape matrices of crop allocation are modified according to the expected proportions of crop groups indicated by the user in the agricultural system landscape panel to do this we applied an algorithm in which parcels are progressively assigned to new expected productions until the user s constraints are met as breeding landscapes are not constrained by random choices of potential crop successions but by priority schemes modifications of farming systems and climatic conditions have to be calculated by re launching the lulcc model on an annual or pluriannual basis in which each new farming objective indicated in the agricultural system landscape panel is evaluated in terms of priority practices and field availability step 4 allows opening an m g library to configure the s k build up matrices for gama ssmt modeling on the right side of the opale gui three panels are enabled disabled depending on the workflow selection step the landscape water panel contains several dialog boxes for wmwl parameters k m c 1 c 2 c 3 λ b i m a x see appendix a and check box options to configure wmwl output plots when the obs cal check box is selected the nash sutcliffe coefficient wallach et al 2013 is computed to compare observed or calculated river flow outputs or to select parameters to be optimized by the lsqcurvefit program optimization processes can be paused for plot zooming and inspection from the upper tool bar or to analyze the contributions of water components to river outflows or select dmei dates the agricultural system landscape panel allows configuring the proportions of the farming systems as well as climatic conditions farming practices or infrastructure distribution several choices are possible with filter strips or hedgerows of deciduous of perennial tree species with the interface button the program interacts with saga libraries to re calculate the proportions of the infrastructures in the computational meshes finally with step 4 the landscapes eco functionality panel allows evaluating the transfer functions sstf and the nature of the particle matter to be treated in ssmt 4 examples of applications 4 1 catchment description and monitoring opale was tested in three different territories in terms of farming systems and geographical conditions site properties are given in table 1 geographical inputs are detailed in supplementary materials s3 miribel catchment was mainly concerned by hortonian overland flows from annual crops including fine silt texture conditions and a high sensitivity to soil surface crusting lepilleur 2017 due to the low permeability of lacustrine deposits preventing deep water percolation autran catchment was subject to soil moisture saturation of variable source areas causing frequent surface runoff petitqueux 2017 on the contrary aiguebelette tertiary sandstone was favorable to high soil permeability and water percolation was predominant pezet 2014 poulenard et al 2009 studied a catchment nearby aiguebelette sharing the same geographical context and showed that matter from riverbank erosion was predominant in suspended matter flows and that livestock played a role too these authors observed that the relative contributions of topsoils and river bank sediments were seasonal with an increase of the topsoil contribution during spring and summer pastures and a decrease in late fall and winter in relation with the access of livestock to the river network stakeholders are concerned by erosion soil protection and mud flows in miribel nutrient losses and eutrophication of surface waters in aiguebelette and bacteriological water quality in autrans stream flows were monitored using weirs placed at the catchment outlets water samples were collected in 2016 and 2017 by automatic samplers programmed for weekly flow weighted composite sampling in miribel the nephelometric turbidity unit ntu was monitored with an obs300 campbell scientific probe for sm flow evaluation in aiguebelette sm soluble reactive phosphorus srp total phosphorus tp and nitrates were analyzed by standard colorimetric methods afnor 1990 in autrans instantaneous water samples were collected manually and sent within 24h to the laboratory for ec enumeration following standard protocols iso 9308 2 for water bacteriological quality assessment in addition to differentiate between the proportions of human and bovine contamination water sub samples were treated to quantify hf183 and rum2bac bacteroidales markers following mauffret et al 2012 4 2 model parameterization table 2 gives parameter values for the wmwl and ssmt models we evaluated the parameters of the wmwl model k m c 1 c 2 c 3 λ b i m a x following the lsqcurvefit automatic optimization module or by referencing contextual values from expert estimation doing so and considering the respective soil conditions the bottom permeability ratio k m was high in miribel and aiguebelette but low in autrans horton store emptying was considered rapid and a maximum c 2 value was thus retained the saturation overflow emptying value c 3 was lower considering potential retardation effects due to variable extension of source areas all ssmt parameters were predefined δ a k d k k d r k e k referenced from available data given in table 2 as well as those proposed in the lulcc model supplementary material s1 parameters although a few decision variables can be redefined from the gama gui to account for local organization and decision rules fig 5 4 3 landscape reconfiguration prospects landscape reconfigurations were simulated to evaluate several agro ecological transition schemes aimed at valorizing landscape ecofunctionnalities and controlling water cycle and quality the values of the parameters were fixed following those indicated in table 2 giving reference states r to which the effects of landscape reconfigurations s were compared we evaluated the efficiency e f of the reconfigurations by e f 1 1 k 0 τ f q s τ 1 k 0 τ f q r τ low values correspond to low efficiency where k q s and q r are the number of dmei and the counts of particle outflow generated by the reconfigurated landscape and of the reference state respectively 4 3 1 farming system evolutions and grassland landscape reshaping to control vole overgrowths and bacteriological water quality degradation specialized livestock breeding territories can be associated with faecal contamination of water but also with grassland vole overgrowths in relation with low landscape heterogeneities the increasing number of permanent meadows the lack of disturbing activities plowing or natural barriers paths banks for rodent populations as well as the regression of natural refuges hedges forested patches for terrestrial and aerial predators halliez et al 2015 the following changes were tested on e coli flows in the autrans area i modification of farming systems to increase the area of plowed parcels two cases were evaluated with introductions of 10ha and 25ha of spring barley in cereals milk round bale systems corresponding to 1 5 and 3 8 of additional plowed surface in the watershed area respectively ii implementation of hedges 5m wide considered equivalent to a caduceous forested area following 5 modalities 10 km long along a preferential east west direction 10 km along a north south direction 10 km ew and 10 km ns 20 km ns 20 km ns and 10 km ew 4 3 2 changes in farming systems and agricultural practices and implementation of grass filter strips to control soil erosion and suspended matter flows industrial vegetable production is often associated with soil compaction and severe runoff and erosion events lepilleur 2017 we evaluated the effects of changes in the distribution of farming systems on sm with a 10 increase of annual crop systems in the miribel area in addition we tested the generalization of hoeing on row crops and the implementation of 0 2 0 4 3 4 3 8 22 42 and 96 ha of grass filter strips these latter filters were first positioned on critical source areas selected by visualizing displacements of sm particle clouds cf fig 11 and thereafter generalized to the catchment along the drainage network 4 3 3 water management as a consequence of periurbanization in the aiguebelette area stakeholders are confronted with the extension of the artificial hydrological network aimed at draining humid areas we tested the effect of river network reshaping on srp loads by adding 1296m of open drain length to the 4262 m of the present hydrological network in a sub catchment 137 ha of the studied area 2700 ha 4 4 discussed results 4 4 1 lulcc modeling for crop vegetable landscapes the ad ratio between expected crop surfaces and calculated crop surfaces differed depending on the farming systems fig 6 mean values were centered on 1 showing the ability of the lulcc model to construct reliable landscapes according to the farm production objectives for annual crops and mixed systems the deviation from the mean was low however it was greater for specialized vegetable systems as a great number of vegetable species can be introduced in crop successions depending on the evolution of the market demand for grassland landscapes expected calculated ratios were also centered on the mean value 1 fig 7 giving quite realistic landscapes regarding farms needs moreover a few differences were visible noticeably in the area of first priority for productive animal pastures where fields were not subdivided like farmers can do to adjust seasonal livestock needs to vegetation production deviations from true landscapes mainly resulted from uniform patterns of decision rules not always adapted to account for local seasonal adaptations to farm plot configurations in some instances this reflected our choices for the implementations of the landscape models mainly driven by the need to provide a sufficiently exhaustive but also simplified representation of agricultural landscapes allowing us to infer accessible input data 4 4 2 wmwl modeling the following figures confront calculated and observed data for miribel fig 8 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was 0 81 model biases were not detected as observed calculated couples were regularly placed around the bisector line for autrans similar patterns were observed although nse was lower nse 0 56 fig 9 yet above the 0 5 threshold agreed upon for model accuracy moriasi et al 2007 calculated water flows for aiguebelette also fitted rather well with observed data nse 0 72 fig 10 the main difference between the three catchments came from their sensitivity to loose deep water as expected the c 1 value corresponded to high impermeable territory at autrans table 2 we also noted a higher drainage dynamics at miribel high groundwater table delay λ value according to the high drainage density in this annual cropland zone global responses were also specific to the geographical contexts and fitted well with the hydrological patterns of the areas thus hortonian runoff represented 12 5 of total outflows in miribel and around 1 in the other two catchments it was quite the same with saturation runoff 9 6 in autrans negligible elsewhere in autrans peak flows came first from water table drainage 89 and secondly from urban runoff from impermeable surfaces 9 in aiguebelette rural overland flows were reduced 1 considering the low number of wwml model parameters the various soils and agricultural conditions in which it was applied the diversity of hydrological processes taken into account the efficiency of acceptable flow representations as well as the good agreements with the characteristics of the hydrosystems we considered that the underlying hypotheses about water balance and movement were founded 4 4 3 ssmt modeling fig 11 gives an example of ssmt outputs these are maps of miribel catchment showing the transfer of particles at different time steps τ following a winter dmei when the plant cover was reduced and soil surfaces subject to crust waterproofing produced surface sm decreased rapidly in one two days 4 4 3 1 sub surface transfer functions for miribel catchment sstfs were calculated for hortonian runoff for noteworthy dmeis at t i t τ f producing high flow peaks during the crop season fig 12 during spring and early summer t i 44 151 sstfs were rather similar with delivery ratios η t i around 0 075 considering the similarity of the spring sstf responses we considered that the sstf t i 44 was a good representative of the spring transfer dynamics and used it for the whole spring season to predict miribel sm flows from hortonian runoff following boiffin et al 1988 hortonian runoff was modeled considering the extension of low permeability surface crusts structures named f2 and the rearrangement of high permeability soil surfaces structures named f3 cf appendix a 7 5 in summer no particle was generated because the soil surface permeability remained high the mean extension area of f3 exceeded that of f2 the lowering of the water table and drying out of the drainage network led to a strong decrease of water flows in wet conditions the river length was nearly 40 km in summer based on eq 23 it was 500 m so that the turbidity probe at the catchment outlet was not permanently covered by water flows in early fall t i 311 the drying out of the drainage network persisted but was lower than in summer the drainage network length was around 10 of its initial length due to the disconnection of active overland flow areas the sstf sharply decreased with reduced η t i 0 02 for autrans catchment several dmeis were evaluated fig 13 two main sstf response patterns were described with a first type in which distributions showed sharp decreases when p τ 1 0 5 and a second type with lower decrease they corresponded to rapid losses when active areas were close to the river network or differed transfer rates from more distant sources respectively the first sharp type was generated when the h v s a variable source area vsa flows was greater than 1 5 m 3 s 1 the delivery ratios also differed throughout the season according to hydrological conditions with a general trend given by the statistical relationship η t i 0 099 h v s a t i 0 051 r 2 0 6 consequently two sstf types and the relationships between the delivery ratio and the variable source flow were introduced in q l t the lumped evaluation of ec flows for the aiguebelette catchment sstfs studied for different seasons t i 31 64 113 167 212 315 were rather equivalent with a sharp decrease similar to the one described in miribel at t i 311 fig 12 due to the fact that the water movements were essentially vertical and limited volumes moved laterally in this filtering context 4 4 3 2 modeling of matter outflows at miribel turbidity probes operated until late spring and data were collected to evaluate ssmt outputs fig 14 nse 0 73 one event obs 2 51 ntu d 1 cal 1 40 ntu d 1 situated at the end of the modeled sequence reduced the nse ratio it corresponded to stochastic conjunctions of the plowing sowing or hoeing dates that probably led to lower f2 f3 differences at autrans observed values were filtered according to the proportions of bacteroidales markers of human and bovine origins the bovine origin was dominant ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 observed and calculated ec values were confronted in fig 15 nse 0 61 even though acceptable efficiency was moderate as often when comparing manual samples to daily computations the spatial variability of fecal populations can be large in river systems with diurnal variation often by several orders of magnitude as noted by epa 2010 the solute transport in aiguebelette was analyzed considering eqs 7 and 8 and the gtf transfer distribution p τ associated to the λ parameter describing water table seepage for sm and particulate matter we developed the lumped modeling schemes described in previous studies for similar bank erosion situations trévisan et al 2019 considering that the production function m t was obtained from stores s t related to the active river length and livestock pressure and wash off w t was associated with drainage flow and urban runoff fig 16 gives results obtained at aiguebelette for solutes or suspended compounds recorded at the outlet nses were equal to 0 91 0 92 and 0 90 for nitrogen total phosphorus and sm respectively efficiencies were high and residuals were regularly dispersed around bisectors despite the variety of transferred compounds and modes of matter displacement outflows were quite well reproduced by ssmt modeling and provided evidence of the efficiency of opale outputs η t i s t w t ssft and gtf in assessing the links between practices and water related functions in agricultural landscapes 4 4 4 landscape reconfigurations the values of efficiency coefficients e f are given in table 3 for the miribel catchment hoeing of all row crops slightly reduced sm flows insofar as the benefits are expected to be limited to the few weeks following hoeing in this context of high soil crusting sensitivity efficiency is greater when the numbers of farming systems with annual crops increase in such sytems soil surfaces are much more protected from erosivity because intercropping reduces the length of the periods when soils are non covered by aerial biomass whereas unprotected compacted and emissive harvesting sites can be prolonged in vegetable production depending on the market demand the efficiency of landscape reconfiguration by gfs increased with the gfs area and increased sharply when gfs implementations were located on areas where sm particles converged in accordance with the need for better recognition and monitoring of critical source areas heathwaite et al 2005 in autrans the extension of plowed surfaces increased the landscape efficiency against e coli loads this was probably explained by the reduced pressure of manure spreads as these are buried by plowing and thereby not sources of bacterial emissions from overland runoff sistani et al 2009 meals et braun 2006 however efficiency was lower for r 25ha than for r 10ha of spring cereals this can be attributed to the fact that the closer proximity of pastures to the river network when cereal production was enlarged increased the pressure and transfer dynamics of e coli it is also conceivable that the extension of the cereal production are a went together with an increased risk of hortonian runoff high stemmed hedges increase landscape efficiency especially when hedges are planted in a ns direction the direction perpendicular to the main slope and the water flow direction this suggests that the effects of hedges are mainly attributable to the interception of surface runoff trajectories firstly by increasing the re infiltration of runoff due to the greater evapotranspiration potential of hedges compared to grasslands granier 2007 merot et al 1999 and secondly by a trapping effect which is debated for bacteria vansteelant 2004 these examples show how several landscape ecofunctionnalities can be associated in order to rationally fight against water contamination the proliferation of grassland vole overgrowths as well as better conditions for pasture thanks to shading effects associated with hedge networks drainage of humid areas in aiguebelette is concomitant with decreasing efficiency of landscapes against the control of srp flows from hypodermical transfers the decrease is much sharper during the growing season april and june when plant root systems are fully active compared to winter or autumn when evapotranspiration and nutrient uptake are low granier 2007 and efficiency less deprecated 5 conclusion landscape eco functionalities are related to agricultural uses and schedules wezel et al 2009 gascuel odoux and magda 2015 and stakeholders use operational tools to assess the incidence of global change climatic perturbations urbanization and evaluate the adaptations of farming systems or new land use practices a number of ecological infrastructures can be implemented to control and protect water resources such as filter strips dorioz et al 2006 interstitial hedgerows merot et al 1999 riparian hedgerows zaimes et al 2008 and ecological infrastructures including meanders marshes etc wang et al 2004 trévisan et periáňez 2016 in practice the efficiency of mitigation practices or landscape infrastructures strongly depends on their position in the landscape as well on cumulative effects wang et al 2004 opale the tool presented in this article was developed as an assessment tool of landscape organization to meet such demands by addressing several scientific and operational issues landscapes are built from production objectives of farming systems and related decision rules as such they are the seat of water displacements commonly analyzed through the common concept of transfer functions representing the distribution over time of elementary water volumes exported at catchment outlets haggerty et al 2000 hingray et al 2009 this representation is well developed in catchment hydrology to predict water flows and associated signals natural or artificial tracers at the outlet of catchments e g nilo de oliveira nascimento et al 1999 but also in river hydrology to evaluate channel organization and responses gooseff et al 2003 trévisan and periáňez 2016 despite available knowledge on the relationship between topographic patterns of catchments and the variability of their residence times mcguire et al 2005 eco hydrology developments are expected to evaluate the relationships between landscape composition structure and transfer patterns mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 our work is a contribution to such issues it proposes several libraries aimed at i analyzing the dynamics of the restitution of water and associated matter to the catchment outlet from the explicit resolution of distributed water balances and particle tracking methods and ii evaluating the efficiency of developed methods by using lumped modeling techniques and confronting them to a variety of real world observations operational issues mainly concern i the need for generic models adapted to a large geographical diversity of production systems biophysical environments and landscape features ii data accessibility iii robustness of algorithms to avoid over parameterization and over fitting problems and iv workable interfaces limiting i o data manipulation as much as possible and allowing fast workflows from data configuration to diagnosis opale allowed for efficient evaluations of water and matter outflows and led to transfer functions and delivery ratios useable as synthetic indicators of the assessment of landscape functioning and eco functionality we demonstrated the effectiveness of opale procedures

deposit structure named f 2 particles are rearranged by splash and sedimentation at the soil surface a very low permeability crust is formed and surface roughness and water retention decrease boiffin et al 1988 however as the plant cover increases along the crop season f 2 structures are reshaped and progressively rearranged by alternating moistening desiccation phases or by biological activity making way for high permeability f 3 structures in addition rainfall is redirected by leaves and stems to the collars of plants where soil surface permeability is elevated we therefore considered that soil crusting and plant development had opposite effects and we calculated the extension of crust deposits r the proportion of cell surface covered by crust deposits with r m a x 0 f 2 f 3 we

extinction or withdrawal to save computational time particle build up is evaluated under the matlab environment during the period preceding a dmei we did not consider lateral exchanges between cells as this is commonly done in the field of environmental studies for the evaluation of agricultural pressures massa et al 2008 in the contrary during the transfer period following a dmei wash off and sink source effects were evaluated in the gama environnement considering cascade effects between upslope and downslope cells particle build up build up stocks s k t are generated on computational

where f 2 k t and f 3 k t are the extents of continuous and discontinuous crusts respectively see appendix a depending on their nature particle stocks are not equally available for all water components except for surface flows where n p ec and sm can potentially be displaced from upstream to downstream cells particle displacement by subsurface flows was restricted to n and soluble p and only to n particles in the deepest water tables the aim was to account for trapping and filtering effects acting on ec and sm muirhead et al 2006 dorioz et al 2006 and for lower soluble p adsorption

agricultural production challenges wezel et al 2009 hatt et al 2018 it develops field and territory level innovations to increase interactions among plant animal and microorganism communities as mentioned by gascuel odoux and magda 2015 a major challenge is not only to promote designs of production systems and crop management methods on an ecological basis but also to consider innovations at the territorial level a main challenge is to find ways of defining new farmland organizations to enhance ecological landscape functionalities while considering economic activities bio geochemical

considered landscapes as spatial arrangements of features agricultural fields urban forested semi natural elements like hedges grass strips ditches and flows operating at different time and spatial scales some of them are controlled by human activities flows of energy fertilizers farm effluents flows caused by herd displacements etc others are inherent in the functioning of the eco biophysical context considering the importance of water issues in the context of global change the ambitions of the agroecological transition gascuel odoux and magda 2015 and landscapes water quality relationships chaplin kramer et al 2016 the present article is focused on landscape eco functionalities related to water flows water displacement within landscapes and associated movements of solutes and living or inert suspended matter the operational assessment of landscape eco functionalities is aimed at evaluating the links between landscape composition land uses structure spatial arrangement of different land uses and water flows and nutrient pollutant flows associated with water movements it requires the implementation of interdisciplinary approaches modeling can offer an adapted framework to analyze and interpret the complexity of landscape macro ecosystems poggi et al 2021 especially when considering numerous links between decisions climate soils and organisms within the critical zone landscapes have been the object of several modeling developments focusing on the design of agricultural territories see for example maelia rizzo et al 2019 or the interpretation of landscape organizations in terms of water budget and flows mydhas moussa et al 2002 to the best of our knowledge links between these two approaches are sparse as mentioned by langhammer et al 2019 and zellner et al 2020 developing generic modeling of the links between human decisions water needs and water ecosystem functions is central to achieve evaluations of landscapes and elaborate territory prospects in a context of global change the present article describes opale a tool developed to address the issue of the agroecological transition at the landscape level the model considers a large set of agricultural production systems and hydrological conditions it is focused on i landscape design resulting from farming system parameters and decisions ii surface hydrology and biophysical processes more precisely the tool includes a set of libraries about the following items the design of the landscape occupied by farmland providing the distribution of crops across farmed fields based on from farming practices and schedules land use and land cover change model lulcc the modeling of water movements within previous simulated landscapes considering surface hypodermical and deep trajectories water movements within landscapes model wmwl the evaluation of inert and living solute and suspended matter transfers associated with water displacements including n p escherischia coli ec and suspended matter solute and suspended matter transfer ssmt the construction of normalized indicators of landscape functions in order to assess their regulation services a theoretical frame will be first presented to introduce our working hypotheses and our methods then opale software architecture will be presented with three different application cases differing in terms of agricultural and hydrological context they were implemented to assess several issues related to soil conservation nutrient cycling and surface water eutrophication or the degradation of the bacteriological quality of water resources 2 method and theory 2 1 land use and land cover change lulcc the unutilised agricultural area nuaa of landscapes non productive infrastructures urban areas forests is documented by geographical databases corine land cover shapes of forested areas simulating lulcc in utilised agricultural areas a is somewhat complex because of the diversity of farming systems and associated practices thenail et al 2009 benoît et al 2012 several models working at the plot level a plot corresponds here to an agricultural parcel a continuous area of land declared by a farmer on which a single group of crops is cultivated concern the organization of annual crop rotations dury et al 2012 but those that enable dealing with livestock or both livestock and crop farms are scarce one of the difficulties lies in their ability to manage the distribution of technical rules among plots and their respective contribution to the overall fodder balance for livestock and to commercial benefits for annual crop production for annual crops landscapes change every year in relation with crop successions and rotation rules taillandier et al 2012 formulated the choice of crop rotation as a multi criteria decision problem for each plot the farmer chooses a crop rotation following evaluations at the farm level based on several criteria financial risk expected income workload farmer s habits other works only focus on the crop allocation problem for example martel et al 2017 formalized it as a constraint satisfaction problem integrating agronomic and crop distribution constraints another work using optimization proposes to solve the crop allocation problem by computing the maximum flow of a transition graph of all possible multi year crop successions itineraries permitted by rotation rules houet et al 2014 then an optimization process is applied to select the itineraries allowing for the objectives of annual cropping plans expected surfaces of crop production to be achieved at the farm level for livestock and mixed crop livestock farms constraints are determined by livestock feed demands landscapes are quite stable from one year to the next as they are not subject to rotation and succession rules however the distribution of biomasses varies intra annually in relation to the grazing and hay cutting schedule landscapes show spatial structures with blocks assemblages of several plots of specific uses we considered three blocks fig 1 block 1 grouped priority plots for pastures of productive animals practices p1 hp1 cf supplementary material s1 permanent or temporary meadows for hay production and late pasture h3cp1 and h2cp1 and hp2 as well as distant pastures for non productive animals p2 the area of these blocks depends on the farming system for example the first block had to provide around 50 of unit forage needs ha in a milk round bale system versus 90 for traditional systems cf supplementary material s1 several constraints determine the extension and location of these blocks such as plant growth rates and palatability distance between livestock sheds and fields accessibility slope and soil conditions marie et al 2016 for example in case of dairy production a permanent meadow according to its slope its agronomic potential and its distance from the milking parlor may not be equally assigned to the grazing of dairy cows hay crops or the grazing of young cattle giving that livestock headcount cannot be easily changed in livestock systems landscape construction was modeled with reference to cascade rules and supply demand constraints where pasture for productive animal are the priority followed by crops and hay crops productions and finally pasture for heifers or lots of non productive animals for the remaining surfaces josselin et al 1999 as the drivers of the distribution of activities of a crop farm and a livestock farm differ greatly we did not use the same approach to represent the landscape design for crops farms including vegetable production we chose an algorithm similar to the one proposed by houet et al 2014 where the spatial distribution of crops depends on an optimization process based on maximal flow computations in this representation activities are constraint by cropping plans and rules related to permitted of forbidden crop rotations fig 1 with the following hypothesis i in the case of vegetable production with crops requiring regular daily intervention seeding planting harvesting packaging priority blocks nearby working sheds must be first allocated before implementing maximum flow computations ii crop system landscapes do not change according to seasonal climate changes as farmers can adjust irrigation schedules or change the final commercialization of the harvested products depending on the way meteorological conditions evolve iii all the plots concerned by the maximum flow computation are considered to be unconstrained by edaphic humidity stoniness etc topographical slope or cadastral conditions in the event that one or several plots cannot be used for annual crops their dominant use must be indicated in the geographical database describing the nuaa the maximum flow was computed using the classic edmonds karp max flow algorithm edmonds and karp 1972 as this algorithm is stochastic different solutions of spatial crop allocation can be obtained between two executions depending on random choices for the construction of graph edges unlike taillandier et al 2012 labor tasks were not explicitly evaluated but plowing sowing and hoeing dates were stochastically distributed in the computed crop successions to generate noise in calendars for livestock farms fig 2 we implemented stepwise computations controlling the adequacy between plot supply and the priorities for pasture and forage demands as proposed by marie et al 2016 considering farming systems and livestock heads we determined the forage needs and allocated them to farmlands following priorities and surface ratios of forage practices intensive or extensive meadows and pastures cf supplementary material s1 we considered that the extent of spatial blocks could change under unfavorable climatic situations because livestock feeding is priority over the constitution of forage stocks landscapes and the dynamics of grass biomass were therefore modified following seasonal climatic evolution in accordance with priority rules for livestock needs the time step for the simulations of livestock or crop systems is one day and the time span of the simulation is fixed by the user one year is the minimum required to build a landscape over the seasons much longer in crop sytems to evaluate landscape evolution according to successions 2 2 water movements within landscapes wmwl modeling water movements requires implementing distributed approaches in which a computational domain is defined by the watershed boundaries a watershed is a land area that channels rainfall and snowmelt to rivers and to an outflow point generally represented by square grid meshes where each individual cell defined as a square area of a dimension fixed by the pixel dimension of the digital elevation model is the object of water balance computations may use simultaneous or sequential approaches in the simultaneous approach implicit digital schemes can be performed to solve partial differential matrix equations considering all flows and local processes of the computational domain as in modflow harbaugh 2005 such an implementation is no straightforward task as an example boundary conditions must be defined for domains where the deepest geological structures and their links with the hydrological network are generally unknown or poorly known also the stability of the solution of the matrix equations is unsure because it depends on the configuration of the digital schemes to overcome these difficulties the sequential approach considers cell balance solved explicitly by cascade schemes from up slopes to the watershed outlet kiesel et al 2013 in addition all the processes that control soil moisture e g evapotranspiration percolation are evaluated successively in the same way as in the distributed smdr model gérard marchant et al 2006 or in the semi distributed swat model arnold and fohrer 2005 we chose this approach although it does not represent hydrodynamic processes simultaneously first errors are restrained when time step computations are shortened trevisan and periáňez 2016 second there are several operational gains i the deepest domain can be represented by black box representations ii equations are formal giving an eprouved ability to provide evaluations of time varying land management practices me et al 2018 iii no solver configuration is required two soil volumes were considered in the wmwl model i the vadose zone in the topsoil delimited by root depth overlying ii the saturated zone fig 3 the general water balance for extended hydrodynamic situations was 1 d w v z d t r e l h v s a h h o r h i m p d where w v z is the water store in the vadose zone mm d t the time interval d and the following all expressed in mm d 1 r rainfall e evapotranspiration d vertical drainage l the lateral movements of water sub surface flows h v s a overland flow generated by soil saturation variable source area runoff h h o r hortonian runoff h i m p overland flow from impermeabilized urban areas and d vertical drainage l h v a s h h o r and h i m p net values can be positive or negative depending on whether water flows are coming from up slope cells or directed to down slope cells respectively the processes controlling the water balance equation are summarized in fig 3 we accounted for a large diversity of hydrodynamic processes to extend the applicability of the wmwl model to generic situations biomass dynamics root depth and evapotranspiration flows were computed for vegetables crops and pastures by the generalized plant growth model gérard marchant et al 2006 detailed in appendix a 7 1 the model is based on a computation of cumulative degree days several thresholds were considered accounting for plant growth rates practices and farming schedules seeding cuts etc all of them tabulated from the lulcc model outputs we introduced first order kinetics to describe water table behavior arnold and fohrer 2005 lellay 2006 the seepage of the water table into the river network was evaluated from a transfer function applied during a restitution period hingray et al 2009 in this representation one of the major issues sarrazin 2012 is the capacity of the model to reproduce the hydrologically active areas of watersheds zones where groundwater tables can effectively seep into the river network following gurnell 1978 we considered that the representation of a river network dynamics accounted for temporary drying out of the river network and calculated the number of river segments where seepage was effective hypodermic water movement along slopes where topsoils are bounded by restricting layers or low permeability layers can favor the rising of sub surface water tables over the soil surface in thalweg and down slope conditions obled and zin 2004 gérard marchant et al 2006 for this reason the variable source area hydrology concept dunne et al 1975 was integrated in the wmwl computing scheme soil surface crusting is a main determinant of hortonian runoff process based models e g see jetten et al 1998 were developed to estimate hortonian runoff flows from hydrodynamic properties of soil surface crusts their applicability to agricultural contexts where the crusting dynamics is driven by farming practices and plant biomass development is challenging takken et al 1999 to avoid over parameterization we implemented expert based rules from the stream model cerdan et al 2002 to focus on the dominant drivers of crusting following kiesel et al 2013 we implemented a cascading computational scheme to evaluate water flows along slopes in which water balance was calculated for successive cells sorted by decreasing elevation and increasing index of topographic accumulation schwanghart and kuhn 2010 wmwl equations are fully described in appendix a 2 3 solute and suspended matter transfers ssmts the ssmt model calculates transfer functions to provide standardized evaluations of landscape functioning and help end users in the comparison of landscape configurations and structures transfer functions correspond to a density of mass transfer rate of compounds originating from transient stores often described by exponential or power law distributions haggerty et al 2002 we calculated surface and subsurface transfer functions sstfs for surface and subsurface flows by applying particle tracking methods considered as a key technology for assessing the diversity of displaced matters chenouard et al 2014 here particles represent a solute mass of nutrients in solution sm or ec numbers to assess landscape functioning during critical periods and save computational time sstf calculations were restricted to transfer periods t τ f t where τ f is the transfer duration days following a daily meteorological event of interest dmei starting at date t τ f dmeis are events representative of typical soil moisture conditions and biomass development e g low water periods or fall high flow recovery during the transfer period the ssmt module counts the number of particles that reach the watershed outlet as a function of water trajectories computed by the wmwl model and sink source determinism water trajectories and particle displacements can be interrupted on cells where the soil moisture balance does not exceed saturation thresholds during the transfer period we restricted water exchanges with the atmosphere to evapotranspiration flows rainfall was set to 0 to only account for particle displacements resulting from the landscape draining and water redistribution dynamics produced by dmeis particle tracking was based on previous schemes accounting for pollutant build up wash off and transport processes jiang et al 2019 during the transfer period for each τ days of the interval 0 τ f we considered the s k t τ build up stocks located on the k cells of the computational domain each of them affected by wash off rates w k t τ transferred to the outlet with associated p k τ transfer probabilities based on trévisan et al 2019 the amount of particles produced by a dmei was given by 2 0 τ f q τ 0 τ f 1 k s k t τ w k t τ p k τ for surface and subsurface flows transfer delays are generally short in the range of several days or one two weeks dorioz et al 1989 consequently the following build up stocks s k t τ f t and wash off 3d matrices w k t τ f t were computed for τ f 15 days two indicators of underlying processes driving exchanges and sink source effects operating at the landscape scale were evaluated by ssmt outputs first the dmei sstf distribution obtained by particle counting at the catchment outlet 3 p 1 p τ f q τ 0 τ f q τ second η t τ f the landscape delivery ratio associated to the dmei started at t τ f 4 η t τ f 0 τ f q

dmeis single event dependent representations of landscape functioning the ssmt equations of particle behavior driving s k t τ w k t τ and q τ values are given in appendix b deeper transfer delays were greater than previously in the range of several months hingray et al 2009 as the groundwater table was represented by a black box analysis particle counting was not fitted the corresponding groundwater transfer function gtf was given by p 1 p τ s τ s λ r with λ a wmwl power law parameter for deep water transfer appendix a τ s the duration of the seepage period and r a retardation factor accounting for sink effects holzbecher 2012 equal to 0 in case of n transfer no sinks outside the vadose zone gtf were catchment scaled and generic event scaled representations of landscape functioning 2 4 model validation 2 4 1 lulcc and wmwl modeling we evaluated the deviation between the farmers cropping plans and the simulated plans through the absolute deviation a d i 1 n x ˆ i x i i 1 n x ˆ i where 1 n is the set of possible land uses x ˆ i the sum of areas of land use i expected by the cropping plan and x i the corresponding simulated sum river outflows summing all water components computed by the wmwl model were confronted to observed values trough the nash sutcliffe coefficient wallach et al 2013 2 4 2 particle tracking and ssmt modeling the amount q t of particles reaching the outlet depends on delayed flows that affect the number of particles m k t τ produced in each cell of the computational domain and available for water transfer 5 m k t τ s k t τ w k t τ we can write 6 q t 1 k 0 τ f m k t τ p k τ d τ 1 k m k t p k τ where the asterisk represents the convolution product and p k τ the transfer probabilities generated by demis representative of hydro agrosystem conditions over the transfer period the individual particle behaviors and trajectories of surface and subsurface transfers cannot be measured directly to compare ssmt results with observed values we introduced delivery ratios eq 4 produced stocks m k eq 5 and ssft p τ eq 3 values into a lumped formulation of particle flows q l t equivalent to 1 τ f q τ the ssmt outflows appendix c 7 q l

depended on the crusting dynamics appendix b solute matter outflows from deep water table seepage were calculated by eq 7 where the distribution p τ is given by the gtf cf paragraph 2 3 and η t τ f 1 lumped computed n total p and soluble p ec and sm outflows were confronted in separate worksheets to observed values following trévisan et al 2019 a unit conversion factor u was evaluated by minimizing the objective function q o b s t u q l t 2 between observed q o b s and calculated q l values of matter outflows 3 software architecture wmwl and opale guis fig 4 were implemented in the matlab environment while the lulcc and ssmt programs fig 5 were implemented with the gama platform taillandier et al 2019 the opale gui allows users to select libraries implement iof writing reading and parameterize commands in the two environments and saga geographical treatment http www saga gis org opale executable for the windows 64 bit environment source codes and documentation are available at github 1 1 https github com tiptop psdr opale git all programs were run on a computer with a cpu intelcore r i7 and 32 go ram at the center of the opale gui a workflow scheme organizes the workflow steps for landscape assessment the workflow scheme differs depending on the selected production systems from the listbox items livestocks crops livestock or crop vegetables at step 1 the new project button and a subsequent exec clic allows reading input files then it opens the gama gui where users can launch an initialization program linking together geographical information soils hydrological network fields farm systems etc as described in supplementary material s3 the computational mesh is also defined here with the sizes of the square grids based on the resolution of the digital elevation model then the lulcc program is opened and performs maximum flow or step computation schemes depending on the selected production systems configuring decision rules for crop successions and distance priorities between farms and practices is allowed lulcc outputs are agricultural landscape structures i e an assemblage of different agricultural plots and landscape infrastructures e g hedges filter strips non productive areas as referenced by grids where their proportion area in the cells of the computational mesh are calculated to limit topological representation biases for the following wmwl calculations the g m button step 2 builds matrices for the matlab environment and performs plant development and topography calculations to build the cascade scheme for sequential water flow balances along slopes the step 3 top buttons open the wmwl model for optimization wmwl optimization can be done contextually based on soil and hydro system properties or automatically with the lsqcurvefit tool in matlab all calculations up to this stage provide a baseline on the current landscape the step 3 bottom buttons open simulation purposes and build new matrices that can be compared to the current landscape if the user needs to analyze production system changes the workflow differs depending on farming conditions for crop vegetable systems crop distribution determined by random selections in the lulcc model forward planning of farming systems is implemented by modifying the crop areas of the first year of the crop succession in order to follow the initial patterns of crop distributions the aim is to avoid repeated simulations to obtain converging agent based model simulations outputs that are commonly done to compare present and future territories grillot et al 2018 the price to pay is that only the first year of the crop succession of current and future landscapes can be compared we implemented such modifications within the matlab environment where the first year of the current landscape matrices of crop allocation are modified according to the expected proportions of crop groups indicated by the user in the agricultural system landscape panel to do this we applied an algorithm in which parcels are progressively assigned to new expected productions until the user s constraints are met as breeding landscapes are not constrained by random choices of potential crop successions but by priority schemes modifications of farming systems and climatic conditions have to be calculated by re launching the lulcc model on an annual or pluriannual basis in which each new farming objective indicated in the agricultural system landscape panel is evaluated in terms of priority practices and field availability step 4 allows opening an m g library to configure the s k build up matrices for gama ssmt modeling on the right side of the opale gui three panels are enabled disabled depending on the workflow selection step the landscape water panel contains several dialog boxes for wmwl parameters k m c 1 c 2 c 3 λ b i m a x see appendix a and check box options to configure wmwl output plots when the obs cal check box is selected the nash sutcliffe coefficient wallach et al 2013 is computed to compare observed or calculated river flow outputs or to select parameters to be optimized by the lsqcurvefit program optimization processes can be paused for plot zooming and inspection from the upper tool bar or to analyze the contributions of water components to river outflows or select dmei dates the agricultural system landscape panel allows configuring the proportions of the farming systems as well as climatic conditions farming practices or infrastructure distribution several choices are possible with filter strips or hedgerows of deciduous of perennial tree species with the interface button the program interacts with saga libraries to re calculate the proportions of the infrastructures in the computational meshes finally with step 4 the landscapes eco functionality panel allows evaluating the transfer functions sstf and the nature of the particle matter to be treated in ssmt 4 examples of applications 4 1 catchment description and monitoring opale was tested in three different territories in terms of farming systems and geographical conditions site properties are given in table 1 geographical inputs are detailed in supplementary materials s3 miribel catchment was mainly concerned by hortonian overland flows from annual crops including fine silt texture conditions and a high sensitivity to soil surface crusting lepilleur 2017 due to the low permeability of lacustrine deposits preventing deep water percolation autran catchment was subject to soil moisture saturation of variable source areas causing frequent surface runoff petitqueux 2017 on the contrary aiguebelette tertiary sandstone was favorable to high soil permeability and water percolation was predominant pezet 2014 poulenard et al 2009 studied a catchment nearby aiguebelette sharing the same geographical context and showed that matter from riverbank erosion was predominant in suspended matter flows and that livestock played a role too these authors observed that the relative contributions of topsoils and river bank sediments were seasonal with an increase of the topsoil contribution during spring and summer pastures and a decrease in late fall and winter in relation with the access of livestock to the river network stakeholders are concerned by erosion soil protection and mud flows in miribel nutrient losses and eutrophication of surface waters in aiguebelette and bacteriological water quality in autrans stream flows were monitored using weirs placed at the catchment outlets water samples were collected in 2016 and 2017 by automatic samplers programmed for weekly flow weighted composite sampling in miribel the nephelometric turbidity unit ntu was monitored with an obs300 campbell scientific probe for sm flow evaluation in aiguebelette sm soluble reactive phosphorus srp total phosphorus tp and nitrates were analyzed by standard colorimetric methods afnor 1990 in autrans instantaneous water samples were collected manually and sent within 24h to the laboratory for ec enumeration following standard protocols iso 9308 2 for water bacteriological quality assessment in addition to differentiate between the proportions of human and bovine contamination water sub samples were treated to quantify hf183 and rum2bac bacteroidales markers following mauffret et al 2012 4 2 model parameterization table 2 gives parameter values for the wmwl and ssmt models we evaluated the parameters of the wmwl model k m c 1 c 2 c 3 λ b i m a x following the lsqcurvefit automatic optimization module or by referencing contextual values from expert estimation doing so and considering the respective soil conditions the bottom permeability ratio k m was high in miribel and aiguebelette but low in autrans horton store emptying was considered rapid and a maximum c 2 value was thus retained the saturation overflow emptying value c 3 was lower considering potential retardation effects due to variable extension of source areas all ssmt parameters were predefined δ a k d k k d r k e k referenced from available data given in table 2 as well as those proposed in the lulcc model supplementary material s1 parameters although a few decision variables can be redefined from the gama gui to account for local organization and decision rules fig 5 4 3 landscape reconfiguration prospects landscape reconfigurations were simulated to evaluate several agro ecological transition schemes aimed at valorizing landscape ecofunctionnalities and controlling water cycle and quality the values of the parameters were fixed following those indicated in table 2 giving reference states r to which the effects of landscape reconfigurations s were compared we evaluated the efficiency e f of the reconfigurations by e f 1 1 k 0 τ f q s τ 1 k 0 τ f q r τ low values correspond to low efficiency where k q s and q r are the number of dmei and the counts of particle outflow generated by the reconfigurated landscape and of the reference state respectively 4 3 1 farming system evolutions and grassland landscape reshaping to control vole overgrowths and bacteriological water quality degradation specialized livestock breeding territories can be associated with faecal contamination of water but also with grassland vole overgrowths in relation with low landscape heterogeneities the increasing number of permanent meadows the lack of disturbing activities plowing or natural barriers paths banks for rodent populations as well as the regression of natural refuges hedges forested patches for terrestrial and aerial predators halliez et al 2015 the following changes were tested on e coli flows in the autrans area i modification of farming systems to increase the area of plowed parcels two cases were evaluated with introductions of 10ha and 25ha of spring barley in cereals milk round bale systems corresponding to 1 5 and 3 8 of additional plowed surface in the watershed area respectively ii implementation of hedges 5m wide considered equivalent to a caduceous forested area following 5 modalities 10 km long along a preferential east west direction 10 km along a north south direction 10 km ew and 10 km ns 20 km ns 20 km ns and 10 km ew 4 3 2 changes in farming systems and agricultural practices and implementation of grass filter strips to control soil erosion and suspended matter flows industrial vegetable production is often associated with soil compaction and severe runoff and erosion events lepilleur 2017 we evaluated the effects of changes in the distribution of farming systems on sm with a 10 increase of annual crop systems in the miribel area in addition we tested the generalization of hoeing on row crops and the implementation of 0 2 0 4 3 4 3 8 22 42 and 96 ha of grass filter strips these latter filters were first positioned on critical source areas selected by visualizing displacements of sm particle clouds cf fig 11 and thereafter generalized to the catchment along the drainage network 4 3 3 water management as a consequence of periurbanization in the aiguebelette area stakeholders are confronted with the extension of the artificial hydrological network aimed at draining humid areas we tested the effect of river network reshaping on srp loads by adding 1296m of open drain length to the 4262 m of the present hydrological network in a sub catchment 137 ha of the studied area 2700 ha 4 4 discussed results 4 4 1 lulcc modeling for crop vegetable landscapes the ad ratio between expected crop surfaces and calculated crop surfaces differed depending on the farming systems fig 6 mean values were centered on 1 showing the ability of the lulcc model to construct reliable landscapes according to the farm production objectives for annual crops and mixed systems the deviation from the mean was low however it was greater for specialized vegetable systems as a great number of vegetable species can be introduced in crop successions depending on the evolution of the market demand for grassland landscapes expected calculated ratios were also centered on the mean value 1 fig 7 giving quite realistic landscapes regarding farms needs moreover a few differences were visible noticeably in the area of first priority for productive animal pastures where fields were not subdivided like farmers can do to adjust seasonal livestock needs to vegetation production deviations from true landscapes mainly resulted from uniform patterns of decision rules not always adapted to account for local seasonal adaptations to farm plot configurations in some instances this reflected our choices for the implementations of the landscape models mainly driven by the need to provide a sufficiently exhaustive but also simplified representation of agricultural landscapes allowing us to infer accessible input data 4 4 2 wmwl modeling the following figures confront calculated and observed data for miribel fig 8 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient was 0 81 model biases were not detected as observed calculated couples were regularly placed around the bisector line for autrans similar patterns were observed although nse was lower nse 0 56 fig 9 yet above the 0 5 threshold agreed upon for model accuracy moriasi et al 2007 calculated water flows for aiguebelette also fitted rather well with observed data nse 0 72 fig 10 the main difference between the three catchments came from their sensitivity to loose deep water as expected the c 1 value corresponded to high impermeable territory at autrans table 2 we also noted a higher drainage dynamics at miribel high groundwater table delay λ value according to the high drainage density in this annual cropland zone global responses were also specific to the geographical contexts and fitted well with the hydrological patterns of the areas thus hortonian runoff represented 12 5 of total outflows in miribel and around 1 in the other two catchments it was quite the same with saturation runoff 9 6 in autrans negligible elsewhere in autrans peak flows came first from water table drainage 89 and secondly from urban runoff from impermeable surfaces 9 in aiguebelette rural overland flows were reduced 1 considering the low number of wwml model parameters the various soils and agricultural conditions in which it was applied the diversity of hydrological processes taken into account the efficiency of acceptable flow representations as well as the good agreements with the characteristics of the hydrosystems we considered that the underlying hypotheses about water balance and movement were founded 4 4 3 ssmt modeling fig 11 gives an example of ssmt outputs these are maps of miribel catchment showing the transfer of particles at different time steps τ following a winter dmei when the plant cover was reduced and soil surfaces subject to crust waterproofing produced surface sm decreased rapidly in one two days 4 4 3 1 sub surface transfer functions for miribel catchment sstfs were calculated for hortonian runoff for noteworthy dmeis at t i t τ f producing high flow peaks during the crop season fig 12 during spring and early summer t i 44 151 sstfs were rather similar with delivery ratios η t i around 0 075 considering the similarity of the spring sstf responses we considered that the sstf t i 44 was a good representative of the spring transfer dynamics and used it for the whole spring season to predict miribel sm flows from hortonian runoff following boiffin et al 1988 hortonian runoff was modeled considering the extension of low permeability surface crusts structures named f2 and the rearrangement of high permeability soil surfaces structures named f3 cf appendix a 7 5 in summer no particle was generated because the soil surface permeability remained high the mean extension area of f3 exceeded that of f2 the lowering of the water table and drying out of the drainage network led to a strong decrease of water flows in wet conditions the river length was nearly 40 km in summer based on eq 23 it was 500 m so that the turbidity probe at the catchment outlet was not permanently covered by water flows in early fall t i 311 the drying out of the drainage network persisted but was lower than in summer the drainage network length was around 10 of its initial length due to the disconnection of active overland flow areas the sstf sharply decreased with reduced η t i 0 02 for autrans catchment several dmeis were evaluated fig 13 two main sstf response patterns were described with a first type in which distributions showed sharp decreases when p τ 1 0 5 and a second type with lower decrease they corresponded to rapid losses when active areas were close to the river network or differed transfer rates from more distant sources respectively the first sharp type was generated when the h v s a variable source area vsa flows was greater than 1 5 m 3 s 1 the delivery ratios also differed throughout the season according to hydrological conditions with a general trend given by the statistical relationship η t i 0 099 h v s a t i 0 051 r 2 0 6 consequently two sstf types and the relationships between the delivery ratio and the variable source flow were introduced in q l t the lumped evaluation of ec flows for the aiguebelette catchment sstfs studied for different seasons t i 31 64 113 167 212 315 were rather equivalent with a sharp decrease similar to the one described in miribel at t i 311 fig 12 due to the fact that the water movements were essentially vertical and limited volumes moved laterally in this filtering context 4 4 3 2 modeling of matter outflows at miribel turbidity probes operated until late spring and data were collected to evaluate ssmt outputs fig 14 nse 0 73 one event obs 2 51 ntu d 1 cal 1 40 ntu d 1 situated at the end of the modeled sequence reduced the nse ratio it corresponded to stochastic conjunctions of the plowing sowing or hoeing dates that probably led to lower f2 f3 differences at autrans observed values were filtered according to the proportions of bacteroidales markers of human and bovine origins the bovine origin was dominant ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 observed and calculated ec values were confronted in fig 15 nse 0 61 even though acceptable efficiency was moderate as often when comparing manual samples to daily computations the spatial variability of fecal populations can be large in river systems with diurnal variation often by several orders of magnitude as noted by epa 2010 the solute transport in aiguebelette was analyzed considering eqs 7 and 8 and the gtf transfer distribution p τ associated to the λ parameter describing water table seepage for sm and particulate matter we developed the lumped modeling schemes described in previous studies for similar bank erosion situations trévisan et al 2019 considering that the production function m t was obtained from stores s t related to the active river length and livestock pressure and wash off w t was associated with drainage flow and urban runoff fig 16 gives results obtained at aiguebelette for solutes or suspended compounds recorded at the outlet nses were equal to 0 91 0 92 and 0 90 for nitrogen total phosphorus and sm respectively efficiencies were high and residuals were regularly dispersed around bisectors despite the variety of transferred compounds and modes of matter displacement outflows were quite well reproduced by ssmt modeling and provided evidence of the efficiency of opale outputs η t i s t w t ssft and gtf in assessing the links between practices and water related functions in agricultural landscapes 4 4 4 landscape reconfigurations the values of efficiency coefficients e f are given in table 3 for the miribel catchment hoeing of all row crops slightly reduced sm flows insofar as the benefits are expected to be limited to the few weeks following hoeing in this context of high soil crusting sensitivity efficiency is greater when the numbers of farming systems with annual crops increase in such sytems soil surfaces are much more protected from erosivity because intercropping reduces the length of the periods when soils are non covered by aerial biomass whereas unprotected compacted and emissive harvesting sites can be prolonged in vegetable production depending on the market demand the efficiency of landscape reconfiguration by gfs increased with the gfs area and increased sharply when gfs implementations were located on areas where sm particles converged in accordance with the need for better recognition and monitoring of critical source areas heathwaite et al 2005 in autrans the extension of plowed surfaces increased the landscape efficiency against e coli loads this was probably explained by the reduced pressure of manure spreads as these are buried by plowing and thereby not sources of bacterial emissions from overland runoff sistani et al 2009 meals et braun 2006 however efficiency was lower for r 25ha than for r 10ha of spring cereals this can be attributed to the fact that the closer proximity of pastures to the river network when cereal production was enlarged increased the pressure and transfer dynamics of e coli it is also conceivable that the extension of the cereal production are a went together with an increased risk of hortonian runoff high stemmed hedges increase landscape efficiency especially when hedges are planted in a ns direction the direction perpendicular to the main slope and the water flow direction this suggests that the effects of hedges are mainly attributable to the interception of surface runoff trajectories firstly by increasing the re infiltration of runoff due to the greater evapotranspiration potential of hedges compared to grasslands granier 2007 merot et al 1999 and secondly by a trapping effect which is debated for bacteria vansteelant 2004 these examples show how several landscape ecofunctionnalities can be associated in order to rationally fight against water contamination the proliferation of grassland vole overgrowths as well as better conditions for pasture thanks to shading effects associated with hedge networks drainage of humid areas in aiguebelette is concomitant with decreasing efficiency of landscapes against the control of srp flows from hypodermical transfers the decrease is much sharper during the growing season april and june when plant root systems are fully active compared to winter or autumn when evapotranspiration and nutrient uptake are low granier 2007 and efficiency less deprecated 5 conclusion landscape eco functionalities are related to agricultural uses and schedules wezel et al 2009 gascuel odoux and magda 2015 and stakeholders use operational tools to assess the incidence of global change climatic perturbations urbanization and evaluate the adaptations of farming systems or new land use practices a number of ecological infrastructures can be implemented to control and protect water resources such as filter strips dorioz et al 2006 interstitial hedgerows merot et al 1999 riparian hedgerows zaimes et al 2008 and ecological infrastructures including meanders marshes etc wang et al 2004 trévisan et periáňez 2016 in practice the efficiency of mitigation practices or landscape infrastructures strongly depends on their position in the landscape as well on cumulative effects wang et al 2004 opale the tool presented in this article was developed as an assessment tool of landscape organization to meet such demands by addressing several scientific and operational issues landscapes are built from production objectives of farming systems and related decision rules as such they are the seat of water displacements commonly analyzed through the common concept of transfer functions representing the distribution over time of elementary water volumes exported at catchment outlets haggerty et al 2000 hingray et al 2009 this representation is well developed in catchment hydrology to predict water flows and associated signals natural or artificial tracers at the outlet of catchments e g nilo de oliveira nascimento et al 1999 but also in river hydrology to evaluate channel organization and responses gooseff et al 2003 trévisan and periáňez 2016 despite available knowledge on the relationship between topographic patterns of catchments and the variability of their residence times mcguire et al 2005 eco hydrology developments are expected to evaluate the relationships between landscape composition structure and transfer patterns mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 our work is a contribution to such issues it proposes several libraries aimed at i analyzing the dynamics of the restitution of water and associated matter to the catchment outlet from the explicit resolution of distributed water balances and particle tracking methods and ii evaluating the efficiency of developed methods by using lumped modeling techniques and confronting them to a variety of real world observations operational issues mainly concern i the need for generic models adapted to a large geographical diversity of production systems biophysical environments and landscape features ii data accessibility iii robustness of algorithms to avoid over parameterization and over fitting problems and iv workable interfaces limiting i o data manipulation as much as possible and allowing fast workflows from data configuration to diagnosis opale allowed for efficient evaluations of water and matter outflows and led to transfer functions and delivery ratios useable as synthetic indicators of the assessment of landscape functioning and eco functionality we demonstrated the effectiveness of opale procedures

making way for high permeability f 3 structures in addition rainfall is redirected by leaves and stems to the collars of plants where soil surface permeability is elevated we therefore considered that

extinction or withdrawal to save computational time particle build up is evaluated under the matlab environment during the period preceding a dmei we did not consider lateral exchanges between cells as this is commonly done in the field of environmental studies for the evaluation of agricultural pressures massa et al 2008 in the contrary during the transfer period following a dmei wash off and sink source effects were evaluated in the gama environnement considering cascade effects between upslope and downslope cells particle build up build up stocks s k t are generated on computational

only to n particles in the deepest water tables the aim was to account for trapping and filtering effects acting on ec and sm muirhead et al 2006 dorioz et al 2006 and for lower soluble p adsorption

25679,we present a freely available open source modelling framework to explore environmental transport and fate of nano and microplastics in aquatic systems the full multi models 1 fragmentation of plastic into a predefined set of size classes 2 speciation of plastic particles between pristine heteroaggregated biofouled and biofouled heteroaggregated species 3 dynamic vertical exchange between water layers and sediment of a freshwater system and 4 horizontal particle transport by eddy diffusion and advective flow the full multi framework relates emission rates to environmental exposure concentrations while considering the intrinsic properties of plastic particles and variable environmental system properties the model can be applied to analyse scenarios with different process descriptions plastic types emission routes and environmental parameters for hypothesis generation to identify dominant fate processes and in hazard and risk assessment here we introduce and illustrate the framework by modelling plastic particles with a range of densities in a generic flowing river system graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic pollution environmental fate modelling freshwater microplastics open source 1 introduction plastic pollution is found in rivers lakes and the ocean globally peng et al 2020 macleod et al 2021 sebille et al 2015 gonzález fernández et al 2021 and it is present in a variety of sizes shapes and compositions kooi et al 2021 plastic debris in aquatic systems is subject to weathering by ultraviolet light biodegradation and physical stress that results in fragmentation and chemical degradation over time at the same time plastic particles can aggregate with suspended particulate matter spm and can be subject to colonization by biofilms all of these processes affect transport fate and size distribution of plastic particles and are likely important for determining their environmental exposure levels wagner et al 2014 horton et al 2017 rochman et al 2019 kooi and koelmans 2019 rummel et al 2017 also these processes will occur to different extents depending on the particle characteristics and environmental conditions singh et al 2019 for example plastic particles with lower density than water might be transported long distances by surface currents but the same material may sink into sediments and become immobile if it is colonized by a dense biofilm lobelle et al 2021 hoellein et al 2019 semcesen and wells 2021 kaiser et al 2017 fazey and ryan 2016 ye and andrady 1991 large plastic particles that are more dense than water will sink into sediment however fibres and small fragments of plastic with the same density may remain suspended in water due to slow settling velocities changes in the size shape and effective density of plastic particles over time due to fragmentation biofouling and formation of aggregates with natural spm can thus strongly affect the transport and fate of plastic in the environment horton et al 2017 the combined complexity of factors governing these processes restrains our current understanding about these mechanisms which limits our ability to forecast exposure concentrations for different plastic types and emission scenarios and to assess potential risks therefore one of the key challenges in plastic pollution is to decipher how their different fate and transport processes compete with each other under different environmental conditions and for different plastic types so that dominant environmental fate pathways can be identified and targeted for further study horton et al 2017 mathematical models have the potential to serve as platforms to integrate information and understanding about the transport and fate of plastics in the environment and in the face of high uncertainties about appropriate process descriptions to support hypothesis generation to guide research macleod et al 2010 experience with environmental models such as the water quality analysis simulation program wasp di toro et al 1983 or the oecd pov lrtp screening tool wegmann et al 2009 demonstrates that once confidence has been established in a model it can be used for estimating environmental concentrations for risk assessment or as a basis for formulating monitoring strategies in recent years modelling approaches have been developed for quantifying the export of plastics into the oceans siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 for assessing the processes that transport or retain plastics in rivers and river catchments areas siegfried et al 2017 unice et al 2019 besseling et al 2017 and to study the fate of plastic in the ocean sebille et al 2015 lebreton et al 2012 liubartseva et al 2016 koelmans et al 2017 however up to date no general framework covering all relevant plastic particle processes e g aggregation biofouling fragmentation and degradation the variability of plastic properties i e size density and shape and that is adaptable to different regions and temporal scales has been yet introduced alimi et al 2018 with the aim of filling this gap here we present an open source flexible multimedia mass balance transport and fate modelling framework for plastic particles in aquatic environments multimedia mass balance fate and transport models praetorius et al 2012 meesters et al 2014 garner et al 2017 liu and cohen 2014 knightes et al 2019 have been recently developed for the study of nanoparticles in the environment such models have the potential to be adapted to integrate processes descriptions relevant for plastic using the same principles of nonequilibrium colloidal behaviour which differs significantly from the behaviour of dissolved chemical contaminants praetorius et al 2014 hüffer et al 2017 alimi et al 2018 furthermore multimedia mass balance models have a modular design that permits adaptation to different regional environments and flexibility to describe different spatial and temporal scales macleod et al 2010 wania et al 2006 in the fast evolving field of plastic pollution research where high uncertainties exist for many process descriptions and new knowledge is constantly being generated jahnke et al 2017 arp et al 2021 a flexible and adaptable model framework that the scientific community has free access to as open source software fills a research need the full multi framework is based on a generic modular unit cell that includes first order kinetic process descriptions for vertical and horizontal transport fragmentation biofouling and heteroaggregation of plastic particles with natural spm in aquatic systems the framework can be readily parameterised to describe rivers lakes or ocean areas at different spatial resolutions and temporal scales the base version of the full multi framework can be extended with new process descriptions or by adding new mass balance compartments as new findings on plastic particle fate processes become available by modifying the mass balance equations as described in the full multi repository user s manual the aim is to provide a modelling framework that serves as a standard reference for evaluating the fate of plastic particles using easy to run and open access code the framework is coded in python and the version described in this paper is accessible via the github repository https github com nano2plastproject thefullmulti river we illustrate the full multi framework by application to describe three types of plastic particles with a range of densities d polyethylene pe d 980 kg m3 polyamide pa d 999 kg m3 and polyvinyl chloride pvc d 1580 kg m3 in a generic flowing river system the model scenarios reported in this paper can be replicated using tutorials presented as jupyter notebooks on the full multi github repository i e fullmulti rivermodel paper pe ipynb fullmulti rivermodel paper pa ipynb and fullmulti rivermodel paper pvc ipynb 2 the full multi model framework 2 1 model description the full multi model framework s name reflects that it is a multimedia mass balance model that tracks plastic particles in multiple sizes and multiple speciation forms environmental compartments within each unit cell of a full multi model are represented as well mixed boxes and particle size and species specific transport and fate processes within and between compartments are described using first order kinetics some process descriptions in the full multi model are taken from the environmental fate and transport model for inorganic nanoparticles developed by praetorius et al 2012 and additional processes relevant to plastic particles including fragmentation and biofouling have been added based on a literature review the overall mass balance is defined by a system of coupled first order differential equations in the default parameterization of the framework described in this paper there are five particle size classes i e 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μm particles and four speciation states i e pristine heteroaggregated biofouled and biofouled heteroaggregated thus for each compartment in the modeled system there are 5 4 20 coupled mass balance equations 2 1 1 the unit cell and the model domain models of plastic transport and fate in aquatic systems are built up in the full multi framework using a predefined default unit cell that consists of two different types of environmental compartment water and sediment that are further subdivided into smaller compartments depending on the modelled system applied to describe a generic river system such as in the default parameterization the compartments represent 1 surface water 2 flowing water 3 stagnant water and 4 surface sediment fig 1 compartments are linked to define model unit cells and unit cells are linked to define the entire modeled domain the dimensioning of the compartments and selected number of unit cells will determine the spatial resolution of the model table 1 and the connectivity can be adjusted to represent a variety of aquatic systems for example a single unit cell representing a lake where particle transport is only studied between compartments in the vertical axes or several interconnected cells via eddy diffusion representing the global ocean in the default generic river parameterization unit cells are connected in series by a unidirectional flow of water in the flowing water and surface water compartments as well as bed load transport in the sediment compartments to describe a specific river system connections between unit cells can also be added to describe tributaries to a main river channel each unit cell in a modeled system can be individually parameterised to describe the geographical and geochemical features of the water body 2 1 2 description of plastic particles the plastic particles in the full multi framework are represented as a distribution of particles via discrete size classes and described by input parameters specifying diameter density and shape table 2 the default parameterization of the model framework assumes five size classes i e 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μm particles which represents a compromise between computational time power requirements and resolution of plastic particles at a range of sizes the plastic particles can take on four different speciation forms pristine heteroaggregated biofouled and biofouled heteroaggregated while for the mass balance accounting the particles remain in their originally assigned size class upon speciation i e each particle species is tracked within the size class of the parent pristine particle effective changes in particles size and density are calculated for each species and accounted for in the calculation of fate processes for heteroaggregated and biofouled plastic particles the effective size and density are calculated based on the equations shown in table s1 to account for the impact of added volume and different density from spm and biofilm for the biofouled particle the calculations are based on a model study by kooi et al 2017 where the biofilm layer was assumed to have a thickness of 5 μm and a density of 1388 kg m3 for the heteroaggregated species the spm were assumed to have an spherical shape a diameter of 0 5 μm and a density of 2000 kg m3 praetorius et al 2012 2 1 3 fate processes for each size class of plastic particles in water compartments the full multi model simulates transformation of the particles between the four different microplastic species i e heteroaggregation aggregate break up biofouling and defouling fragmentation into the next smallest size class chemical degradation that removes plastic from the system transport between compartments within a unit cell by settling rising mixing and transport between unit cells by advection fig 1 in sediment compartments the modeled fate processes are fragmentation degradation burial into deep inaccessible sediments resuspension to the adjacent water compartment within the unit cell and transport along the river between unit cells via bedload transport fig 1 the formulation of each of the processes included in the default parameterization of the full multi is based on a review of the literature some equations were taken from transport and fate frameworks for inorganic nanoparticles praetorius et al 2012 based on traditional particle model concepts e g suspended solids and colloids while other process descriptions such as fragmentation and biofouling have been specified by assuming first order kinetics a more detailed description is provided below and the equations with corresponding references and levels of confidence are presented in table s2 it is worth mentioning that nano and microplastics in the environment representing a relatively new area of science there is still uncertainty about what the main governing processes are in this sense the process descriptions included in the model framework should be seen as provisional and are intended to be edited and updated by the user community to incorporate new information and understanding as it becomes available the fate processes in the full multi framework can be broadly divided into three categories interaction with natural entities transformation and transport between different compartments 2 1 3 1 interaction processes heteroaggregation breakup and biofouling heteroaggregation the aggregation of plastic particles with natural spm is modelled following classical colloid theory as discussed in praetorius et al 2012 as a pseudo first order process table s2 the rate constant for this process depends on the collision frequency between the two types of particles the concentration of spm present in the system and the attachment efficiency for heteroaggregation α het agg describing the probability of heteroaggregate formation upon collision praetorius et al 2020 α het agg describes the degree of favourable interaction between plastic particles and spm and is influenced by the respective surface characteristics of the colliding particles as well as the water chemistry in the default parameterization of the full multi model the concentration of spm is considered constant along the whole system 30 mg l and the attachment efficiencies estimated by besseling et al 2017 for nano sized plastic particles are used for the process parameterization furthermore it is hypothesized that biofilm increases the attachment efficiency of a plastic particle reflected in two times higher values of α het agg for biofiouled plastic particles compared to the pristine form table s3 breakup of plastic particle spm heteroaggregates is formulated in the full multi as being proportional to the rate of heteroaggregation table s2 while experimental data are still very limited on the kinetics of heteroaggregate breakup it is likely that this process is size dependent and therefore consideration of the size factor is suggested as future implementation in the model the processes of heteroaggregation and breakup of heteroaggregates are included only in the water compartments of the current implementation of the framework as depicted in fig 1 homoaggregation of plastic particles with themselves is not included in the current full multi version due to high dilution of plastic particles in the environment compared to naturally occurring spm homoaggregation is assumed negligible and does not justify the additional computational effort of including a second order process in the model framework biofouling is the process where organisms colonise the surface of submerged plastic particles and form a biofilm surface rummel et al 2017 in the full multi framework biofouling is represented as a first order kinetic process characterized by a characteristic time for biofilm to grow on the surface of the plastic particle t biof growth the default parameterization of the full multi framework considers biofilm growth on pristine and heteroaggregated particles that are present in water compartments and assumes that the time for biofilm growth varies with depth following the hypothesis that biofouling occurs at slower rates in deeper waters due to reduced light limiting the growth of the biofilm organisms kooi et al 2017 hence biofouling is fastest in the surface water compartment the values of t biof growth assumed in the default parameterization are presented in table s3 and are based on experimental findings that indicate that biofilm formation takes place within days or weeks rummel et al 2017 future applications of the model could also consider plastic additives present in the modelled particles as influencing the rate of biofouling nelson et al 2021 as well as different growth rates as a function of temperature sunlight and water composition defouling the disintegration of the biofilm layer can occur due to light limitation grazing or dissolution of carbonates in acid waters kooi et al 2017 in the full multi framework defouling is represented as a first order kinetic process characterized by a biofilm degradation time t biof degrade despite being a potentially relevant fate process the rate constant for defouling is assumed to be zero in all compartments in the current formulation of the full multi due to lack of data regarding biofilm degradation times 2 1 3 2 transformation processes fragmentation and degradation polymer degradation by biotic and or abiotic processes is represented as a first order degradation process based on estimated half lives for degradation t half table s2 for many plastic types polymer degradation is expected to be a slow process ward and reddy 2020 and degradation rates may be negligible compared to other processes in many systems however biodegradable polymers might have shorter degradation times and therefore this process is implemented in the framework in the default model parameterization due to the lack of data regarding plastic degradation times long half lives for degradation were assumed and specified as being equal for all of the defined compartments also degradation half lives for pristine plastic particles were assumed smaller than for heteroaggregated and or biofouled particles assuming a protective effect of the spm or biofilm outer layer finally less protective effect of biofilm compared to spm was assumed table s3 currently degradation is represented as complete mineralization but it would be possible to consider the formation of degradation intermediates and their fate in future model implementations fragmentation of plastic particles in the full multi is modeled as a size dependent process based on an estimated rate constant k frag gen for fragmentation of pristine particles in the largest 1000 μm size class in flowing water in the default parameterization we assume fragmentation of pristine 1000 μm particles occurs on a 1 year timescale and set k frag gen 1 1 year 3 2 10 8 s 1 fragmentation rate constants for all size classes of pristine particles are then calculated by scaling k frag gen assuming fragmentation occurs more slowly for smaller particles in proportion to the ratio of diameters explosive fragmentation is assumed such that fragmentation produces a number of smaller particles calculated by dividing the volume of particles in the parent size class by the volume of particles in the daughter size class table s2 in the default formulation of the full multi fragmentation is assumed to occur unidirectionally from larger to consecutively smaller size fractions only thus for example particles in the 1000 μm size class fragment into the 100 μm size class only fragmentation of plastic particles in the environment is driven by diverse factors such as uv radiation physical stress induced by water turbulence and wind and biodegradation min et al 2020 in the default formulation of the full multi fragmentation rates in surface water where uv radiation and turbulence are strongest are assumed to be ten times higher than in the other water compartments table s3 fragmentation of heteroaggregated particles is assumed negligible in the default model formulation and biofouled particles are assumed to fragment at half the rate of the corresponding pristine plastic particle due to shielding of the particle s surface from uv radiation and physical stress 2 1 3 3 transport processes advection bed load transport burial resuspension settling rising mixing advective transport of the plastic particles in the moving water compartments horizontal transport in the sediment bed vertical mixing of bulk water burial into deep sediment and resuspension into stagnant water are modelled following the same assumptions and process formulations as in the model developed by praetorius et al 2012 describing the fate and transport of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the rhine river table s2 first order rate constants for settling or rising of plastic particles are estimated based on the depth of the compartment of study and the value of settling or rising velocity of the plastic particle calculated using stokes law for theoretical settling velocities of a perfect sphere in a fluid with laminar flow praetorius et al 2012 table s2 settling and rising are mutually exclusive and whether a particle settles or rises is determined by the density difference between the plastic particle and water limitations to this process description have been identified in the literature and involve overestimation of settling velocities of large low density particles and underestimation of the influence of particle shape waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 kowalski et al 2016 other settling formulations can be implemented in the full multi framework by the user if desired 2 1 4 mass balance model equations the mass balance equations for each particle species in each size class form a system of coupled first order ordinary differential equations odes eq 1 that are functions of species and size specific particle number of plastic particlesin each compartment of the model domain and of time by default concentrations eq 2 are expressed as number of plastic particles per volume in the water compartments and per dry weight mass in the sediment compartment by converting the volume of sediment into mass using a typical dry sediment bulk density 1 3 g cm3

different size classes for all compartments in the model the matrix m fullmulti contains the rate constants of the mass balance equation eq 1 and q imput is the emission vector 2 2 model parameterization the full multi framework requires parameters to define the characteristics of the plastic particles the fate process descriptors the properties of the modelled system and the connectivity between model unit cells these input parameters are specified in four input files whose content is summarised in table 3 and its modification procedure described in the user s guide provided in the open access github repository emission scenarios also must be specified to define the q imput vector and drive the model calculations emissions generally describe the time variable input flow of plastic particles per minute but they may also be specified as a pulse or constant emission flow rate the location or locations where the emissions enter the model domain i e the specific compartments and unit cells receiving emissions must also be specified the species and size class of plastic emitted into the system and the simulated time duration and target timestep for the ode solver are also required inputs for the parameterizsation of the different microplastic fate and transport processes included in the model a series of assumptions about how when and where the different processes take place in the modelled system are required and are documented in section 2 1 1 and table s3 different degrees of confidence in the formulation of the processes table s2 or in the selection of the input parameters table s3 are highlighted where those with low confidence levels correspond to processes where parameters are missing or highly uncertain and or where process descriptions are based on assumptions that require critical evaluation by further research while particle shape is been included as a model input the fate processes included in the current model version are only parameterised for spherically shaped particles however fibre process formulations are previewed for implementation 3 illustrative application for a generic river we illustrate the full multi framework by application to describe the fate and transport of plastic particles with a range of densities in a generic river system 3 1 framework configuration and parameterization our generic river system configuration of the full multi framework links model unit cells illustrated in fig 1 with uni directional water flow in the surface water and flowing water compartments and with bedload transport of sediments fig 2 the modeled generic river is 1000 km long and is subdivided into 20 unit cells with identical dimensions 50 km length 80 m width and 5 42 m total depth and with a water flow velocity of 1 3 m s discharge 562 m3 s in the surface water and flowing water compartments fig 2 the unit cell structure dimensions and flow velocity were inspired by the model for the rhine river by praetorius et al 2012 the process descriptions for plastic fate in the generic river system are parameterised according to the assumptions described in section 2 1 1 and are summarised in table s3 in many cases these parameterizations and process descriptions are provisional and according to our flexible and open source modelling approach they can be modified in future applications of the model as needed for scenario analysis or as new research emerges 3 2 scenario analysis for plastic with a range of densities as an illustrative application of the model framework we modeled a low density buoyant plastic assumed to be polyethylene pe d 980 kg m3 a near neutrally buoyant plastic assumed to be polyamide pa d 999 kg m3 and a high density plastic assumed to be polyvinyl chloride pvc d 1580 kg m3 for each of these plastic types we simulated a constant emission of 100 pristine plastic particles per minute in the 1000 μm size class into the flowing water compartment of the first i e the furthest up stream unit cell of the generic river the model was run to simulate 365 days with a target timestep of 1 h after the model run information about the speciation of plastic particles their dynamic exchange between the three water layers and sediment and fragmentation into the five size classes i e 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μm is produced as output in the form of concentration values of each plastic species in each size class in each compartment in each unit cell of the river over time 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 modeled concentrations after 1 year simulation time species and size class specific concentrations of plastic particles per compartment along the generic river system after one year of simulation for pe pa and pvc are shown in figs 3 5 respectively results are presented as number concentrations of plastic particles no per m3 in the water compartments and per gram of sediment for the sediment compartment conversion of the results into mass concentration is possible in the model through estimation of the particle volume and density by taking its shape into consideration the distribution in number concentration of plastic particles between the different compartments along the whole river system differ strongly as a function of particle density and size figs 3 5 the concentration of low density pristine pe particles i e 1000 μm free plastic particles in the flowing water compartment decreases steeply in the first 50 km of the river i e in the first unit cell due to transfer to the surface water compartment as a consequence of its buoyancy fig 3 as simulated in the model these particles also quickly aggregate with spm to form heteroaggregates which become the dominant particle species along the whole river system fig 3 and table s4 the buoyant low density pe particles that remain in pristine form or are heteroaggregated are mainly found in the surface water compartment and are mainly found in sizes of 100 and 10 μm however a fraction of their heteroaggregated and or biofouled forms settle down to the sediment and are most abundant in the smallest size bins for the heteroaggregates this size effect where the most abundant heteroaggregated particles in the sediment are the smaller size fractions can be explained by the fact that spm contributes in higher extent to the final density of the particles when attached to smaller particles table s1 as depicted in fig 3 and as parameterised in the full multi low density pe particles remain in the generic river system from upstream to downstream the near neutrally buoyant pristine particles of pa settle into the sediment compartment much more efficiently compared to pe regardless of aggregation state with the biggest size fractions disappearing from the systems through burial at 400 600 km downstream fig 4 however some pa particles i e those with 1 and 10 μm diameter remain in the water compartments even far downstream in the river finally all species of the high density pvc particles are subject to sedimentation and burial into the deep sediment of the river with only very low number concentrations of the smallest size fractions being distributed downriver in the sediment compartment fig 5 3 3 2 comparing competing processes as half life times since all processes in the model are described using first order kinetics they can be compared directly to each other to facilitate comparison we calculated half life times for each process in each compartment of the model as ln2 k process where k process is the process specific rate constant in s 1 the half life time represents the time required for a particle s concentration to decrease to half its initial value due to the process in question only fate processes with the shortest half life times are the fastest processes and will be the dominant process pathways that plastic particles will follow in the modelled compartment figs 6 8 show process half life times for each plastic particle species and size class for the three different plastic types in form of heatmaps green values correspond to short half life times fastest dominant processes of a few minutes to tens of hours from lighter to darker green while the blue colour represents longer half life times slower fate processes ranging from days to months to years from lighter to darker blue grey shading marks processes that do not take place for the particular compartment plastic form or size fraction as formulated in the model these heatmaps provide a visualization of the competing fate and transport pathways for the different species and size fractions of the three plastic types in our simulated generic river system with our default model formulation and parameterization as shown in the heatmaps in figs 6 8 the fastest processes and therefore the processes that determine the fate of the plastic particles in the water compartments of our default model configuration are the transformation processes of heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate break up vertical transport through rising for the low density pe particles and settling and advective transport in the sediment compartment burial dominates the particles fate followed by resuspension into the upper stagnant water compartment heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate break up rates as formulated in the model vary with size differences in settling in figs 6 8 and rising half life times in fig 6 are also observed as a function of size and also aggregation state settling and rising are formulated as mutually exclusive processes in the model and their half life times in water compartments are a function of particle size and overall density which is determined by the density of the plastic particle and the density of spm for heteroaggregated particles and or of biofilm for biofouled particles table s1 the density of water is specified as 998 kg m3 in the default parameterization thus as observed in fig 6 pristine pe particles have lower density than water and rise rather than settle in the flowing and stagnant water compartments while heteroaggregated and biofouled pe particles will settle or rise depending on the size of the parent plastic particle for example small particles of low density pe that have been colonized by biofilm or heteroaggregated with particulate organic matter have higher bulk density than water as described in table s1 which leads to settling rather than rising fig 6 settling half life times for the low density pe particles range from 30 min to a few hours for the smallest heteroaggregated particles and for the biofouled particles pe half life times for rising for those particles with lower density than water vary from 30 min to several months depending on the size and particle form and are fastest for the largest 1000 μm size fraction due to the higher density of pa and pvc no rising to the surface water compartment occurs for any of the particles forms and sizes figs 7 and 8 and the half life times of settling are again controlled by the particle size settling half life times for pvc and pa particles range from 30 min to a few hours for the largest particles 10 1000 μm but increase to several months for the smallest pa particles and the smallest non biofouled pvc particles due to higher drag forces the half life times for advection out of each unit cell in surface water and flowing water 7 4 h in our default model configuration provide a useful benchmark for comparison with other processes in figs 6 8 processes in water with half life times shorter than advection occur on timescales shorter than the residence time of water in the unit cell and thus represent important in cell pathways in cases where reversible processes are much faster than the particle residence time in the system they could be parameterised using constant steady state concentration ratios instead of using a kinetic approach in this sense in our default model parameterization for the three plastic types for example heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate break up could be reformulated using steady state concentration ratios mixing between compartments and degradation of the particles are slow processes compared to advection and thus are not expected to dominate in cell fate of plastic in sediments burial to deep sediment and resuspension occur on the same timescale and are faster than down river transport of plastic with sediments 3 3 3 model evaluation against field data the generic river parameterization and constant emissions assumed in our illustrative example does not allow for evaluation of the model against absolute concentrations of plastic particles measured in a real river however a degree of evaluation of the model against field data is possible by comparing the modeled size distribution of plastic particles to field measurements kooi and koelmans 2019 collected data from 11 studies that reported plastic particle concentrations in 10 or more size classes and fitted the relative abundance of particles as a function of size with power law regressions our modeled relative abundance of pe plastic particles in the three water compartments in the last i e furthest downstream unit cell of the generic river after 1 simulated year falls within the range of measurements of floating plastic fig 9 which provides a partial validation of the assumptions about fragmentation made in the model in terms of distribution of the plastic particles within the different compartments of the generic river system table 4 summarises the model estimated particles distribution integrated over all size ranges and species as percentage of particles per compartment relative to the total number of particles in the system these results are in line with results obtained from field studies where it was found that the higher density polymers prevailed in samples taken from river and marine sediments while a larger percentage of buoyant polymers were found in surface water samples of fresh waters effluents and to a lower extent marine surface waters kooi et al 2021 4 conclusions we present a modelling framework to describe the fate of plastic particles in aquatic systems that describes multiple dimensions of particle characteristics size and speciation and that can be applied to diverse aquatic systems we envision this framework as a tool to support hypothesis generation for process level studies and data analysis design of field measurement campaigns scenario analysis and developing bounding exposure estimates for risk assessment the calculations for pe pa and pvc in the generic river system presented in this paper can be replicated by prospective users of the framework by following tutorials in jupyter notebooks on the models github repository https github com nano2plastproject thefullmulti river the full open access model code is also available there and open for continued development our evaluation of the modelled relative abundance of floating plastic particles in our generic scenario against field measurements provides a degree of confirmation that the fragmentation process descriptions in the model are reasonable however additional performance evaluation and validation should be carried out before the model is used in risk assessment or decision support applications an interesting feature of the model results illustrated in fig 9 is the model s prediction of low relative abundance of 0 1 μm particles in their review and meta analysis of measurement data kooi and koelmans 2019 reported that some datasets showed increasing particle concentrations with increasing size below 20 μm however they did not have confidence in this finding due to the methodological challenges of quantifying small plastic particles and they suggested a practical detection limit of 20 μm our generic river modelling with the current process descriptions and parameterization predicts a maximum in relative abundance of floating plastic particles at around 1 μm diameter that prediction is an example of how the model framework can be used for hypothesis generation to inspire

25679,we present a freely available open source modelling framework to explore environmental transport and fate of nano and microplastics in aquatic systems the full multi models 1 fragmentation of

the framework by modelling plastic particles with a range of densities in a generic flowing river system graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic pollution environmental fate modelling freshwater microplastics open source 1 introduction plastic pollution is found in rivers lakes and the ocean globally peng et al 2020 macleod et al 2021 sebille et al 2015 gonzález fernández et al 2021 and it is present in a variety of sizes shapes and compositions kooi et al 2021 plastic debris in aquatic systems is subject to weathering by ultraviolet light biodegradation and physical stress that results in fragmentation and chemical degradation over time at the same time plastic particles can aggregate with suspended particulate matter spm and can be subject to colonization by biofilms all of these processes affect transport fate and size distribution of plastic particles and are likely important for determining their environmental exposure levels wagner et al 2014 horton et al 2017 rochman et al 2019 kooi and koelmans 2019 rummel et al 2017 also these processes will occur to different extents depending on the particle characteristics and environmental conditions singh et al 2019 for example plastic particles with lower density than water might be transported long distances by surface currents but the same material may sink into sediments and become immobile if it is colonized by a dense biofilm lobelle et al 2021 hoellein et al 2019 semcesen and wells 2021 kaiser et al 2017 fazey and ryan 2016 ye and andrady 1991 large plastic particles that are more dense than water will sink into sediment however fibres and small fragments of plastic with the same density may remain suspended in water due to slow settling velocities changes in the size shape and effective density of plastic particles over time due to fragmentation biofouling and formation of aggregates with natural spm can thus strongly affect the transport and fate of plastic in the environment horton et al 2017 the combined complexity of factors governing these processes restrains our current understanding about these mechanisms which limits our ability to forecast exposure concentrations for different plastic types and emission scenarios and to assess potential risks therefore one of the key challenges in plastic pollution is to decipher how their different fate and transport processes compete with each other under different environmental conditions and for different plastic types so that dominant environmental fate pathways can be identified and targeted for further study horton et al 2017 mathematical models have the potential to serve as platforms to integrate information and understanding about the transport and fate of plastics in the environment and in the face of high uncertainties about appropriate process descriptions to support hypothesis generation to guide research macleod et al 2010 experience with environmental models such as the water quality analysis simulation program wasp di toro et al 1983 or the oecd pov lrtp screening tool wegmann et al 2009 demonstrates that once confidence has been established in a model it can be used for estimating environmental concentrations for risk assessment or as a basis for formulating monitoring strategies in recent years modelling approaches have been developed for quantifying the export of plastics into the oceans siegfried et al 2017 van wijnen et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 for assessing the processes that transport or retain plastics in rivers and river catchments areas siegfried et al 2017 unice et al 2019 besseling et al 2017 and to study the fate of plastic in the ocean sebille et al 2015 lebreton et al 2012 liubartseva et al 2016 koelmans et al 2017 however up to date no general framework covering all relevant plastic particle processes e g aggregation biofouling fragmentation and degradation the variability of plastic properties i e size density and shape and that is adaptable to different regions and temporal scales has been yet introduced alimi et al 2018 with the aim of filling this gap here we present an open source flexible multimedia mass balance transport and fate modelling framework for plastic particles in aquatic environments multimedia mass balance fate and transport models praetorius et al 2012 meesters et al 2014 garner et al 2017 liu and cohen 2014 knightes et al 2019 have been recently developed for the study of nanoparticles in the environment such models have the potential to be adapted to integrate processes descriptions relevant for plastic using the same principles of nonequilibrium colloidal behaviour which differs significantly from the behaviour of dissolved chemical contaminants praetorius et al 2014 hüffer et al 2017 alimi et al 2018 furthermore multimedia mass balance models have a modular design that permits adaptation to different regional environments and flexibility to describe different spatial and temporal scales macleod et al 2010 wania et al 2006 in the fast evolving field of plastic pollution research where high uncertainties exist for many process descriptions and new knowledge is constantly being generated jahnke et al 2017 arp et al 2021 a flexible and adaptable model framework that the scientific community has free access to as open source software fills a research need the full multi framework is based on a generic modular unit cell that includes first order kinetic process descriptions for vertical and horizontal transport fragmentation biofouling and heteroaggregation of plastic particles with natural spm in aquatic systems the framework can be readily parameterised to describe rivers lakes or ocean areas at different spatial resolutions and temporal scales the base version of the full multi framework can be extended with new process descriptions or by adding new mass balance compartments as new findings on plastic particle fate processes become available by modifying the mass balance equations as described in the full multi repository user s manual the aim is to provide a modelling framework that serves as a standard reference for evaluating the fate of plastic particles using easy to run and open access code the framework is coded in python and the version described in this paper is accessible via the github repository https github com nano2plastproject thefullmulti river we illustrate the full multi framework by application to describe three types of plastic particles with a range of densities d polyethylene pe d 980 kg m3 polyamide pa d 999 kg m3 and polyvinyl chloride pvc d 1580 kg m3 in a generic flowing river system the model scenarios reported in this paper can be replicated using tutorials presented as jupyter notebooks on the full multi github repository i e fullmulti rivermodel paper pe ipynb fullmulti rivermodel paper pa ipynb and fullmulti rivermodel paper pvc ipynb 2 the full multi model framework 2 1 model description the full multi model framework s name reflects that it is a multimedia mass balance model that tracks plastic particles in multiple sizes and multiple speciation forms environmental compartments within each unit cell of a full multi model are represented as well mixed boxes and particle size and species specific transport and fate processes within and between compartments are described using first order kinetics some process descriptions in the full multi model are taken from the environmental fate and transport model for inorganic nanoparticles developed by praetorius et al 2012 and additional processes relevant to plastic particles including fragmentation and biofouling have been added based on a literature review the overall mass balance is defined by a system of coupled first order differential equations in the default parameterization of the framework described in this paper there are five particle size classes i e 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μm particles and four speciation states i e pristine heteroaggregated biofouled and biofouled heteroaggregated thus for each compartment in the modeled system there are 5 4 20 coupled mass balance equations 2 1 1 the unit cell and the model domain models of plastic transport and fate in aquatic systems are built up in the full multi framework using a predefined default unit cell that consists of two different types of environmental compartment water and sediment that are further subdivided into smaller compartments depending on the modelled system applied to describe a generic river system such as in the default parameterization the compartments represent 1 surface water 2 flowing water 3 stagnant water and 4 surface sediment fig 1 compartments are linked to define model unit cells and unit cells are linked to define the entire modeled domain the dimensioning of the compartments and selected number of unit cells will determine the spatial resolution of the model table 1 and the connectivity can be adjusted to represent a variety of aquatic systems for example a single unit cell representing a lake where particle transport is only studied between compartments in the vertical axes or several interconnected cells via eddy diffusion representing the global ocean in the default generic river parameterization unit cells are connected in series by a unidirectional flow of water in the flowing water and surface water compartments as well as bed load transport in the sediment compartments to describe a specific river system connections between unit cells can also be added to describe tributaries to a main river channel each unit cell in a modeled system can be individually parameterised to describe the geographical and geochemical features of the water body 2 1 2 description of plastic particles the plastic particles in the full multi framework are represented as a distribution of particles via discrete size classes and described by input parameters specifying diameter density and shape table 2 the default parameterization of the model framework assumes five size classes i e 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μm particles which represents a compromise between computational time power requirements and resolution of plastic particles at a range of sizes the plastic particles can take on four different speciation forms pristine heteroaggregated biofouled and biofouled heteroaggregated while for the mass balance accounting the particles remain in their originally assigned size class upon speciation i e each particle species is tracked within the size class of the parent pristine particle effective changes in particles size and density are calculated for each species and accounted for in the calculation of fate processes for heteroaggregated and biofouled plastic particles the effective size and density are calculated based on the equations shown in table s1 to account for the impact of added volume and different density from spm and biofilm for the biofouled particle the calculations are based on a model study by kooi et al 2017 where the biofilm layer was assumed to have a thickness of 5 μm and a density of 1388 kg m3 for the heteroaggregated species the spm were assumed to have an spherical shape a diameter of 0 5 μm and a density of 2000 kg m3 praetorius et al 2012 2 1 3 fate processes for each size class of plastic particles in water compartments the full multi model simulates transformation of the particles between the four different microplastic species i e heteroaggregation aggregate break up biofouling and defouling fragmentation into the next smallest size class chemical degradation that removes plastic from the system transport between compartments within a unit cell by settling rising mixing and transport between unit cells by advection fig 1 in sediment compartments the modeled fate processes are fragmentation degradation burial into deep inaccessible sediments resuspension to the adjacent water compartment within the unit cell and transport along the river between unit cells via bedload transport fig 1 the formulation of each of the processes included in the default parameterization of the full multi is based on a review of the literature some equations were taken from transport and fate frameworks for inorganic nanoparticles praetorius et al 2012 based on traditional particle model concepts e g suspended solids and colloids while other process descriptions such as fragmentation and biofouling have been specified by assuming first order kinetics a more detailed description is provided below and the equations with corresponding references and levels of confidence are presented in table s2 it is worth mentioning that nano and microplastics in the environment representing a relatively new area of science there is still uncertainty about what the main governing processes are in this sense the process descriptions included in the model framework should be seen as provisional and are intended to be edited and updated by the user community to incorporate new information and understanding as it becomes available the fate processes in the full multi framework can be broadly divided into three categories interaction with natural entities transformation and transport between different compartments 2 1 3 1 interaction processes heteroaggregation breakup and biofouling heteroaggregation the aggregation of plastic particles with natural spm is modelled following classical colloid theory as discussed in praetorius et al 2012 as a pseudo first order process table s2 the rate constant for this process depends on the collision frequency between the two types of particles the concentration of spm present in the system and the attachment efficiency for heteroaggregation α het agg describing the probability of heteroaggregate formation upon collision praetorius et al 2020 α het agg describes the degree of favourable interaction between plastic particles and spm and is influenced by the respective surface characteristics of the colliding particles as well as the water chemistry in the default parameterization of the full multi model the concentration of spm is considered constant along the whole system 30 mg l and the attachment efficiencies estimated by besseling et al 2017 for nano sized plastic particles are used for the process parameterization furthermore it is hypothesized that biofilm increases the attachment efficiency of a plastic particle reflected in two times higher values of α het agg for biofiouled plastic particles compared to the pristine form table s3 breakup of plastic particle spm heteroaggregates is formulated in the full multi as being proportional to the rate of heteroaggregation table s2 while experimental data are still very limited on the kinetics of heteroaggregate breakup it is likely that this process is size dependent and therefore consideration of the size factor is suggested as future implementation in the model the processes of heteroaggregation and breakup of heteroaggregates are included only in the water compartments of the current implementation of the framework as depicted in fig 1 homoaggregation of plastic particles with themselves is not included in the current full multi version due to high dilution of plastic particles in the environment compared to naturally occurring spm homoaggregation is assumed negligible and does not justify the additional computational effort of including a second order process in the model framework biofouling is the process where organisms colonise the surface of submerged plastic particles and form a biofilm surface rummel et al 2017 in the full multi framework biofouling is represented as a first order kinetic process characterized by a characteristic time for biofilm to grow on the surface of the plastic particle t biof growth the default parameterization of the full multi framework considers biofilm growth on pristine and heteroaggregated particles that are present in water compartments and assumes that the time for biofilm growth varies with depth following the hypothesis that biofouling occurs at slower rates in deeper waters due to reduced light limiting the growth of the biofilm organisms kooi et al 2017 hence biofouling is fastest in the surface water compartment the values of t biof growth assumed in the default parameterization are presented in table s3 and are based on experimental findings that indicate that biofilm formation takes place within days or weeks rummel et al 2017 future applications of the model could also consider plastic additives present in the modelled particles as influencing the rate of biofouling nelson et al 2021 as well as different growth rates as a function of temperature sunlight and water composition defouling the disintegration of the biofilm layer can occur due to light limitation grazing or dissolution of carbonates in acid waters kooi et al 2017 in the full multi framework defouling is represented as a first order kinetic process characterized by a biofilm degradation time t biof degrade despite being a potentially relevant fate process the rate constant for defouling is assumed to be zero in all compartments in the current formulation of the full multi due to lack of data regarding biofilm degradation times 2 1 3 2 transformation processes fragmentation and degradation polymer degradation by biotic and or abiotic processes is represented as a first order degradation process based on estimated half lives for degradation t half table s2 for many plastic types polymer degradation is expected to be a slow process ward and reddy 2020 and degradation rates may be negligible compared to other processes in many systems however biodegradable polymers might have shorter degradation times and therefore this process is implemented in the framework in the default model parameterization due to the lack of data regarding plastic degradation times long half lives for degradation were assumed and specified as being equal for all of the defined compartments also degradation half lives for pristine plastic particles were assumed smaller than for heteroaggregated and or biofouled particles assuming a protective effect of the spm or biofilm outer layer finally less protective effect of biofilm compared to spm was assumed table s3 currently degradation is represented as complete mineralization but it would be possible to consider the formation of degradation intermediates and their fate in future model implementations fragmentation of plastic particles in the full multi is modeled as a size dependent process based on an estimated rate constant k frag gen for fragmentation of pristine particles in the largest 1000 μm size class in flowing water in the default parameterization we assume fragmentation of pristine 1000 μm particles occurs on a 1 year timescale and set k frag gen 1 1 year 3 2 10 8 s 1 fragmentation rate constants for all size classes of pristine particles are then calculated by scaling k frag gen assuming fragmentation occurs more slowly for smaller particles in proportion to the ratio of diameters explosive fragmentation is assumed such that fragmentation produces a number of smaller particles calculated by dividing the volume of particles in the parent size class by the volume of particles in the daughter size class table s2 in the default formulation of the full multi fragmentation is assumed to occur unidirectionally from larger to consecutively smaller size fractions only thus for example particles in the 1000 μm size class fragment into the 100 μm size class only fragmentation of plastic particles in the environment is driven by diverse factors such as uv radiation physical stress induced by water turbulence and wind and biodegradation min et al 2020 in the default formulation of the full multi fragmentation rates in surface water where uv radiation and turbulence are strongest are assumed to be ten times higher than in the other water compartments table s3 fragmentation of heteroaggregated particles is assumed negligible in the default model formulation and biofouled particles are assumed to fragment at half the rate of the corresponding pristine plastic particle due to shielding of the particle s surface from uv radiation and physical stress 2 1 3 3 transport processes advection bed load transport burial resuspension settling rising mixing advective transport of the plastic particles in the moving water compartments horizontal transport in the sediment bed vertical mixing of bulk water burial into deep sediment and resuspension into stagnant water are modelled following the same assumptions and process formulations as in the model developed by praetorius et al 2012 describing the fate and transport of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the rhine river table s2 first order rate constants for settling or rising of plastic particles are estimated based on the depth of the compartment of study and the value of settling or rising velocity of the plastic particle calculated using stokes law for theoretical settling velocities of a perfect sphere in a fluid with laminar flow praetorius et al 2012 table s2 settling and rising are mutually exclusive and whether a particle settles or rises is determined by the density difference between the plastic particle and water limitations to this process description have been identified in the literature and involve overestimation of settling velocities of large low density particles and underestimation of the influence of particle shape waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 kowalski et al 2016 other settling formulations can be implemented in the full multi framework by the user if desired 2 1 4 mass balance model equations the mass balance equations for each particle species in each size class form a system of coupled first order ordinary differential equations odes eq 1 that are functions of species and size specific particle number of plastic particlesin each compartment of the model domain and of time by default concentrations eq 2 are expressed as number of plastic particles per volume in the water compartments and per dry weight mass in the sediment compartment by converting the volume of sediment into mass using a typical dry sediment bulk density 1 3 g cm3

different size classes for all compartments in the model the matrix m fullmulti contains the rate constants of the mass balance equation eq 1 and q imput is the emission vector 2 2 model parameterization the full multi framework requires parameters to define the characteristics of the plastic particles the fate process descriptors the properties of the modelled system and the connectivity between model unit cells these input parameters are specified in four input files whose content is summarised in table 3 and its modification procedure described in the user s guide provided in the open access github repository emission scenarios also must be specified to define the q imput vector and drive the model calculations emissions generally describe the time variable input flow of plastic particles per minute but they may also be specified as a pulse or constant emission flow rate the location or locations where the emissions enter the model domain i e the specific compartments and unit cells receiving emissions must also be specified the species and size class of plastic emitted into the system and the simulated time duration and target timestep for the ode solver are also required inputs for the parameterizsation of the different microplastic fate and transport processes included in the model a series of assumptions about how when and where the different processes take place in the modelled system are required and are documented in section 2 1 1 and table s3 different degrees of confidence in the formulation of the processes table s2 or in the selection of the input parameters table s3 are highlighted where those with low confidence levels correspond to processes where parameters are missing or highly uncertain and or where process descriptions are based on assumptions that require critical evaluation by further research while particle shape is been included as a model input the fate processes included in the current model version are only parameterised for spherically shaped particles however fibre process formulations are previewed for implementation 3 illustrative application for a generic river we illustrate the full multi framework by application to describe the fate and transport of plastic particles with a range of densities in a generic river system 3 1 framework configuration and parameterization our generic river system configuration of the full multi framework links model unit cells illustrated in fig 1 with uni directional water flow in the surface water and flowing water compartments and with bedload transport of sediments fig 2 the modeled generic river is 1000 km long and is subdivided into 20 unit cells with identical dimensions 50 km length 80 m width and 5 42 m total depth and with a water flow velocity of 1 3 m s discharge 562 m3 s in the surface water and flowing water compartments fig 2 the unit cell structure dimensions and flow velocity were inspired by the model for the rhine river by praetorius et al 2012 the process descriptions for plastic fate in the generic river system are parameterised according to the assumptions described in section 2 1 1 and are summarised in table s3 in many cases these parameterizations and process descriptions are provisional and according to our flexible and open source modelling approach they can be modified in future applications of the model as needed for scenario analysis or as new research emerges 3 2 scenario analysis for plastic with a range of densities as an illustrative application of the model framework we modeled a low density buoyant plastic assumed to be polyethylene pe d 980 kg m3 a near neutrally buoyant plastic assumed to be polyamide pa d 999 kg m3 and a high density plastic assumed to be polyvinyl chloride pvc d 1580 kg m3 for each of these plastic types we simulated a constant emission of 100 pristine plastic particles per minute in the 1000 μm size class into the flowing water compartment of the first i e the furthest up stream unit cell of the generic river the model was run to simulate 365 days with a target timestep of 1 h after the model run information about the speciation of plastic particles their dynamic exchange between the three water layers and sediment and fragmentation into the five size classes i e 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μm is produced as output in the form of concentration values of each plastic species in each size class in each compartment in each unit cell of the river over time 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 modeled concentrations after 1 year simulation time species and size class specific concentrations of plastic particles per compartment along the generic river system after one year of simulation for pe pa and pvc are shown in figs 3 5 respectively results are presented as number concentrations of plastic particles no per m3 in the water compartments and per gram of sediment for the sediment compartment conversion of the results into mass concentration is possible in the model through estimation of the particle volume and density by taking its shape into consideration the distribution in number concentration of plastic particles between the different compartments along the whole river system differ strongly as a function of particle density and size figs 3 5 the concentration of low density pristine pe particles i e 1000 μm free plastic particles in the flowing water compartment decreases steeply in the first 50 km of the river i e in the first unit cell due to transfer to the surface water compartment as a consequence of its buoyancy fig 3 as simulated in the model these particles also quickly aggregate with spm to form heteroaggregates which become the dominant particle species along the whole river system fig 3 and table s4 the buoyant low density pe particles that remain in pristine form or are heteroaggregated are mainly found in the surface water compartment and are mainly found in sizes of 100 and 10 μm however a fraction of their heteroaggregated and or biofouled forms settle down to the sediment and are most abundant in the smallest size bins for the heteroaggregates this size effect where the most abundant heteroaggregated particles in the sediment are the smaller size fractions can be explained by the fact that spm contributes in higher extent to the final density of the particles when attached to smaller particles table s1 as depicted in fig 3 and as parameterised in the full multi low density pe particles remain in the generic river system from upstream to downstream the near neutrally buoyant pristine particles of pa settle into the sediment compartment much more efficiently compared to pe regardless of aggregation state with the biggest size fractions disappearing from the systems through burial at 400 600 km downstream fig 4 however some pa particles i e those with 1 and 10 μm diameter remain in the water compartments even far downstream in the river finally all species of the high density pvc particles are subject to sedimentation and burial into the deep sediment of the river with only very low number concentrations of the smallest size fractions being distributed downriver in the sediment compartment fig 5 3 3 2 comparing competing processes as half life times since all processes in the model are described using first order kinetics they can be compared directly to each other to facilitate comparison we calculated half life times for each process in each compartment of the model as ln2 k process where k process is the process specific rate constant in s 1 the half life time represents the time required for a particle s concentration to decrease to half its initial value due to the process in question only fate processes with the shortest half life times are the fastest processes and will be the dominant process pathways that plastic particles will follow in the modelled compartment figs 6 8 show process half life times for each plastic particle species and size class for the three different plastic types in form of heatmaps green values correspond to short half life times fastest dominant processes of a few minutes to tens of hours from lighter to darker green while the blue colour represents longer half life times slower fate processes ranging from days to months to years from lighter to darker blue grey shading marks processes that do not take place for the particular compartment plastic form or size fraction as formulated in the model these heatmaps provide a visualization of the competing fate and transport pathways for the different species and size fractions of the three plastic types in our simulated generic river system with our default model formulation and parameterization as shown in the heatmaps in figs 6 8 the fastest processes and therefore the processes that determine the fate of the plastic particles in the water compartments of our default model configuration are the transformation processes of heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate break up vertical transport through rising for the low density pe particles and settling and advective transport in the sediment compartment burial dominates the particles fate followed by resuspension into the upper stagnant water compartment heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate break up rates as formulated in the model vary with size differences in settling in figs 6 8 and rising half life times in fig 6 are also observed as a function of size and also aggregation state settling and rising are formulated as mutually exclusive processes in the model and their half life times in water compartments are a function of particle size and overall density which is determined by the density of the plastic particle and the density of spm for heteroaggregated particles and or of biofilm for biofouled particles table s1 the density of water is specified as 998 kg m3 in the default parameterization thus as observed in fig 6 pristine pe particles have lower density than water and rise rather than settle in the flowing and stagnant water compartments while heteroaggregated and biofouled pe particles will settle or rise depending on the size of the parent plastic particle for example small particles of low density pe that have been colonized by biofilm or heteroaggregated with particulate organic matter have higher bulk density than water as described in table s1 which leads to settling rather than rising fig 6 settling half life times for the low density pe particles range from 30 min to a few hours for the smallest heteroaggregated particles and for the biofouled particles pe half life times for rising for those particles with lower density than water vary from 30 min to several months depending on the size and particle form and are fastest for the largest 1000 μm size fraction due to the higher density of pa and pvc no rising to the surface water compartment occurs for any of the particles forms and sizes figs 7 and 8 and the half life times of settling are again controlled by the particle size settling half life times for pvc and pa particles range from 30 min to a few hours for the largest particles 10 1000 μm but increase to several months for the smallest pa particles and the smallest non biofouled pvc particles due to higher drag forces the half life times for advection out of each unit cell in surface water and flowing water 7 4 h in our default model configuration provide a useful benchmark for comparison with other processes in figs 6 8 processes in water with half life times shorter than advection occur on timescales shorter than the residence time of water in the unit cell and thus represent important in cell pathways in cases where reversible processes are much faster than the particle residence time in the system they could be parameterised using constant steady state concentration ratios instead of using a kinetic approach in this sense in our default model parameterization for the three plastic types for example heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate break up could be reformulated using steady state concentration ratios mixing between compartments and degradation of the particles are slow processes compared to advection and thus are not expected to dominate in cell fate of plastic in sediments burial to deep sediment and resuspension occur on the same timescale and are faster than down river transport of plastic with sediments 3 3 3 model evaluation against field data the generic river parameterization and constant emissions assumed in our illustrative example does not allow for evaluation of the model against absolute concentrations of plastic particles measured in a real river however a degree of evaluation of the model against field data is possible by comparing the modeled size distribution of plastic particles to field measurements kooi and koelmans 2019 collected data from 11 studies that reported plastic particle concentrations in 10 or more size classes and fitted the relative abundance of particles as a function of size with power law regressions our modeled relative abundance of pe plastic particles in the three water compartments in the last i e furthest downstream unit cell of the generic river after 1 simulated year falls within the range of measurements of floating plastic fig 9 which provides a partial validation of the assumptions about fragmentation made in the model in terms of distribution of the plastic particles within the different compartments of the generic river system table 4 summarises the model estimated particles distribution integrated over all size ranges and species as percentage of particles per compartment relative to the total number of particles in the system these results are in line with results obtained from field studies where it was found that the higher density polymers prevailed in samples taken from river and marine sediments while a larger percentage of buoyant polymers were found in surface water samples of fresh waters effluents and to a lower extent marine surface waters kooi et al 2021 4 conclusions we present a modelling framework to describe the fate of plastic particles in aquatic systems that describes multiple dimensions of particle characteristics size and speciation and that can be applied to diverse aquatic systems we envision this framework as a tool to support hypothesis generation for process level studies and data analysis design of field measurement campaigns scenario analysis and developing bounding exposure estimates for risk assessment the calculations for pe pa and pvc in the generic river system presented in this paper can be replicated by prospective users of the framework by following tutorials in jupyter notebooks on the models github repository https github com nano2plastproject thefullmulti river the full open access model code is also available there and open for continued development our evaluation of the modelled relative abundance of floating plastic particles in our generic scenario against field measurements provides a degree of confirmation that the fragmentation process descriptions in the model are reasonable however additional performance evaluation and validation should be carried out before the model is used in risk assessment or decision support applications an interesting feature of the model results illustrated in fig 9 is the model s prediction of low relative abundance of 0 1 μm particles in their review and meta analysis of measurement data kooi and koelmans 2019 reported that some datasets showed increasing particle concentrations with increasing size below 20 μm however they did not have confidence in this finding due to the methodological challenges of quantifying small plastic particles and they suggested a practical detection limit of 20 μm our generic river modelling with the current process descriptions and parameterization predicts a maximum in relative abundance of floating plastic particles at around 1 μm diameter that prediction is an example of how the model framework can be used for hypothesis generation to inspire
