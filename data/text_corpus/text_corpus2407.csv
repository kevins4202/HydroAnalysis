12035,the waste that pharmaceutical industries produce has hazardous implications on the environment and public health if disposed without being treated pharmaceutical industry wastewater piww is the product of the drug and formulation development process and its safe disposal upon treatment is essential there have been very few studies that reflect on nature of effluents from the pharmaceutical industries to select successful and efficacious process of treatment it is critical to know the characteristics and components of the influent water hence this review aims at comprehensively analysing the characteristics of the pharmaceutical wastewater to provide a better insight on the preferable choices of treatment several studies have been carried out on various treatment methods this paper compares these methods namely physicochemical advanced oxidation and bioremediation in which bioremediation emerges as the most sustainable and economically viable option additionally the scope of this paper extends to discuss the various types of bioremediation their applications and drawbacks in context of industrial wastewater treatment aimed at decreasing the ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment bioremediation characterisation 1 introduction groundwater and surface water are the most important sources of water for domestic as well as industrial activities 70 of the groundwater available is used for agricultural purposes curcio et al 2018 jha et al 2019 and is the most abundant source of drinking water shah et al 2018a 2019a 2019c vaidya et al 2015 in agriculture water is used for the cattle and irrigation while it assumes a versatile role such as that of a cooling washing processing transporting and diluting agent in a manufacturing unit nag et al 2007 dieter et al 2018 shah et al 2017 2019b sircar et al 2017 the use of water is also very important to the sanitary needs of an industry which in turn produces wastewater containing xenobiotics that is discharged into either local streams or sewer the water discarded from the manufacturing units of pharmaceutical companies is termed as pharmaceutical industry wastewater piww the production process of drugs is not in pace with the treatment options available the global phenol production for various industries has exceeded 8 million tonnes worldwide in 2008 saha et al 2017 shah et al 2018b sircar et al 2015 hence these compounds accumulate to adversely affect the ecosystem of water and raise public health concerns when consumed or used for domestic purposes water quality monitoring programs have become a necessity to ensure the public health of vulnerable water bodies suthar et al 2010 kannel et al 2007 phiri et al 2005 several reports suggest the prominent presence of toxic and hazardous compounds in the wastewater groundwater and surface water damodhar and reddy 2013 heberer 2002 hernando et al 2004 stackelberg et al 2004 cahill et al 2004 debska et al 2004 gomez et al 2006 the wastewater may include organic biodegradable organic non biodegradable and inorganic substances heavy metals and potential inhibitors which eventually end up into a water catchment area or into the groundwater as landfill leachates their presence and concentration can be evaluated by analysis of samples by establishing a water quality index using several physicochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity bod cod total suspended solids tss amongst others see table 1 an in depth understanding of the composition and characterisation of the derived wastewater is essential for deploying a given technique and ensuring its performance in a waste water treatment plant mhlanga and brouckaert 2013 melcer 2003 in the pharmaceutical industry effluents are characteristic and need to be discarded to maintain the quality and safety standards of the pharmaceuticals it is crucial to categorize the components and their nature before treatment as the effluents it produces contain chemicals that exhibit carcinogenic mutagenic teratogenic and other severe adverse effects it predominantly consists of organic substances which are more harmful than its inorganic counterpart kumar et al 2018 since the pharmaceutical companies produce a variety of medications and cosmetics their wastewater stream is not uniform it contains substances ranging from active biomass and antibiotics to polyaromatic hydrocarbons and phenols kumar et al 2019 dixit and parmar 2013 chang et al 2008 additionally the water bodies were also found to have microplastics which are relevant to this industry as grades of plastics such as pvc and others are used for packaging purposes they have gene altering endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic life and are harmful to another biota they pose an indirect threat to human health due to the process of fragmentation rezania et al 2018 a wastewater plant is employed to treat the untreated influents into relatively neutral effluents for disposal gadipelly et al 2014 the predominance of fluoride ions in drinking water have raised many public health concerns such as kidney disorders and dental fluorosis and hence the latest techniques such as electrocoagulation nanofiltration reverse osmosis and adsorption ion exchange can be applied for its remediation yadav et al 2019 traditionally the treatment of piww can be classified into primary secondary and tertiary classes the primary class of treatment is either chemical or physicochemical such as ozonation electrocoagulation in nature the secondary is dominated by biological processes such as active bio sludge and the tertiary consists of advanced oxidation processes such as catalytic oxidation amongst them bioremediation has emerged as a promising technique for treatment rana et al 2017 bioremediation or biological degradation has an advantage over other chemical methods that have been unsuccessful and have rendered the water toxic due to the yielding of by products in the treatment process the bioremediation process relies on the action of either fungal bacterial or plant phytoremediation species or on the use of aerobic anaerobic or membrane bioreactors to treat and maintain a steady state of chemicals in the ecosystem of water a bioremediation technique aims at treating xenobiotics and plastics as a result of microbial transformation that makes the water less toxic and more stable than its initial polluted state misal et al 2011 de luca et al 2018 other bioremediation techniques discussed include treatment using biomimetic membranes ultrafiltration membranes and photocatalysis membrane technology is widely used in desalination and water treatment in a typical plant polymeric membranes are used in potable water reuse in areas with water scarcity issues these membranes carry out microfiltration and ultrafiltration and are sometimes used in conjunction with techniques such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration but they also offer certain limitations such as membrane fouling stability and material related issues warsinger et al 2018 while there are a lot of studies that focus individually on metals antibiotics or microplastics and their anaerobic fungal or phytoremediation in general there have been fewer ones that have characterised and evaluated the impact of piww and the pharmaceutical waste in entirety the aim of this study is to throw light at qualitative aspects characteristics and components of piww the review not only takes into account the drugs and its intermediates but also certain polymers used in formulation as well as plastics in its packaging in purview of the pharmaceutical industry the significance of this review is that it compares and compiles the more specific effective and sustainable bioremediation techniques for removal or biodegradation of piww moreover it plays a role in ruling out other generalised expensive and relatively inefficient methods that aim at only improving only certain properties such as cod bod and physicochemical properties of water it also provides a perspective on why each method was devised and its significance the scope of conventional primary secondary and tertiary methods of treatment types of bioremediation techniques and their limitations have been discussed and reviewed with a view to expand its future scope and applicability additionally there exists a gap as all aspects that are reviewed have not been covered solely from the perspective of pharmaceutical industry 2 characterisation of pharmaceutical industry waste water piww identifying the properties of water and its pollutants is necessary to devise a treatment method deegan et al 2011 and for that a comprehensive study of both the physico chemical properties and the content of xenobiotics in the effluents is required to be done fig 1 classifies the type of possible pollutants in piww the most characteristic feature of pharmaceutical industries wastewater is that it contains not just the apis active pharmaceutical ingredients but also the various intermediates solvents catalysts and other raw materials used to synthesise and develop a particular medication in its desirable dosage form and these materials are quite detrimental for the water in the catchment area that it is ultimately disposed in zaman et al 2014 fent et al 2006 oktem et al 2007 petrovic et al 2009 introduced the method of estimation of concentration in sewage using back calculation of the prescription rate data and the potential hydrolysis of conjugates excretion rates and metabolism based on the defined daily doses however it was later found out that the annual drug sales is not the correct data set to predict the environmental concentrations of the influents in the wwtps accurately as there is a lacuna of data bound and voulvoulis 2006 and this gap between the data was reflected in the form of significant deviations in environmental concentrations of samples when compared to the proposed predicted model by european medicines agency 2006 to provide better information and understanding of the effect of pharmaceuticals fass sweden have made an effort by supplying information on the effect of a particular pharmaceutically active substance on the environment in terms of its biodegradation rate and bioaccumulation potential an environmental classification of the pharmaceutical substances has been made to provide a clearer perspective of the substances that have a greater potential risk or environmental impact it also aids the companies to carry out an individual environmental risk assessment fass 2012 rana et al 2017 have given a detailed overview of the parameters used to determine the quality of water used in the pharmaceutical industry in varied regions of india the data from various studies has been represented as follows petrovic et al 2009 has reviewed the most commonly found drugs in the samples from more than seven sewage water sites in spain and have classified them into over the counter drugs otcs prescribed drugs and drugs of abuse das see table 2 for an overview of prevalent drugs the otcs majorly consisted of nsaids such as ibuprofen 0 381 150 73 μg l santos et al 2007 nakada et al 2006 diclofenac 0 05 17 1 μg l indomethacin 0 23 0 64 μg l petrovic et al 2009 lishman et al 2006 gros et al 2006 paracetamol 0 13 246 μg l lishman et al 2006 gros et al 2006 nakada et al 2006 gómez et al 2007 and others in their mean median or maximum influent concentrations prescribed drugs in the wastewater largely consisted of i lipid regulating and cholesterol lowering drugs such as gemfibrozil 0 155 0 965 μg l and clofibric acid 0 072 0 36 μg l petrovic et al 2009 gros et al 2006 tauxe wuersch et al 2005 ii psychiatric drugs for example carbamazepine 0 015 1 85 μg l nakada et al 2006 clara et al 2005 gros et al 2006 gómez et al 2007 iii antibiotics such as sulphamethaxozole 0 59 μg l ofloxacin ciprofloxacin 3 8 4 6 μg l trimethoprim 1 172 μg l watkinson et al 2007 some antibiotics such as chloramphenicol penicillins and its semi synthetic and synthetic forms amongst others have been detected in a study by al riyami et al 2018 in oman it has been claimed to cause health complications in humans if sub lethal concentrations of residual antibiotics are exposed to pathogens in the sewage water as it may lead to the development of antibiotic drug resistant microorganisms al riyami et al 2018 al bahry et al 2013 iv antihistaminics such as ranitidine 0 188 μg l gros et al 2006 v β blockers such as atenolol 0 395 μg l metoprolol 0 411 0 015 μg l propranolol 0 168 μg l macleod et al 2007 the drugs of abuse content of the wastewater was dominated by cocaine and benzoylecgonine there was a large ratio of morphine and its derivatives amphetamine like drugs have been found in concentrations of nanograms in the effluent wastewater however the concentrations lysergic acid lsd and its derivatives and tetrahydrocannabinol thc have been found to be negligibly low the reviewed data was derived from sample effluent studies of some countries of europe namely italy spain ireland belgium germany switzerland and united kingdom kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 boleda et al 2007 huerta fontela et al 2007 2008 postigo et al 2008 bones et al 2007 zuccato et al 2008 castiglioni et al 2006a 2006b gheorghe et al 2008 hummel et al 2006 deschamps et al 2012 carried out a data survey using data provided by feam in brazil they studied the process of pharmaceutical production and effluent treatment two companies were selected and the effluents constituted of amoxicillin and its metabolites amoxicilloic acid ama and amoxicillin diketopiperazine 2 5 dione diketo norfloxacin sulfadiazine and piperacillin amongst others the significance of this study is that it throws light on the fact that ama and diketo are potential allergens and the treatment of effluents using fenton oxidation has yielded results with discrepancies the other most important type of micropollutant present was microplastics plastics such as hdpe ldpe pvc etc are used in the packaging bottles or strips of tablets of drugs polymers such as bisphenol a in packaging which is a priority hazardous substance octacrylene which is a uv filter used in sunscreens and triclosan which is used in anti bacterials are some other polymers that reduce to micropollutants and disrupt the ecosystem of the water ejhed et al 2018 additionally traces of metals such as aluminium may be found as they are also an important component for packaging such as strip packaging of tablets and capsules there also have been quite a few studies that elucidate the presence of compounds classified as environmental hormones such as dioxins diethylstilboestrol and other estrogens they have potential to disrupt the reproductive system and show feminine characteristics in a male population of birds 3 methods of treatment for pharmaceutical industry waste water piww the most commonly used methods for the treatment of piww can be broadly classified into physicochemical processes biological processes which can further be classified into aerobic and anaerobic processes and advanced oxidation processes table 3 presents an overview of physicochemical and advanced oxidation processes 3 1 physicochemical methods very often these methods are used as primary processes that are followed by biological processes as secondary method of treatment these processes are carried out to decrease the organic load for the subsequent biological process vanerkar et al 2013 the most widely used methods are electrocoagulation ozone treatment and the method of activated carbon adsorption and these methods are most often used in conjunction with the biological methods malakootian and ahmadian 2019 studied the process of electro activated persulfate using iron electrodes on the wastewater samples containing ciprofloxacin antibiotic collected from an iranian pharmaceutical company the wastewater was subjected to persulfate but it was not successful in treating the water due to the complex structure of the antibiotic molecule when the sample was subjected to two were combined ec ps process an efficiency of 96 with its peak activity at 75 min was obtained this rise in efficiency was because electrocoagulation contributed to the activation of persulfate which increased the rate of the process and gave way to speedy removal of the antibiotic gome and upadhyay 2013 evaluated the process of ozonation for the treatment of wastewater samples from pharmaceutical industries in dewas madhya pradesh india in terms of its biodegradability i e ratio of bod cod the untreated samples were treated under either acidic or alkaline conditions individually a dose of 30 mg l ozone for alkaline conditions and 32 73 mg l for acidic conditions was required their observations did not show significant improvement in the biodegradability however it was suggested that increasing the treatment time accentuated the improvement in the biodegradability hegazy et al 2014 have employed the technique of factorial design to evaluate the efficiency of adsorption of phenol in wastewater onto activated carbon from r stricta species obtained from wadi hermela in central saudi arabia using anova t test and f test for the variables the interactions were interpreted to be significant an efficiency of 85 adsorption was reported hence this method was proved to be effective for the decontamination of phenol containing effluents these methods are significant as it can be inferred from them that increasing the treatment time using a combined operation strategy and carefully designing the process can yield better results it also points out that the ph conditions during ozonation did not strongly influence the outcome 3 2 advanced oxidation methods advanced oxidation processes have traditionally been used for drinking water but they have great potential in the treatment of piww as they are capable of generating in situ ros or reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl species h 2 o 2 ozone and superoxide radical species which have little selectivity and can effectively mineralise substances into c o 2 water and inorganic ions or acids kanakaraju et al 2018 dalrymple et al 2007 aljuboury et al 2014 have used fenton oxidation process for the pre treatment of piww samples of extremely polluted pharmaceutical wastewater were procured from a chemical manufacturing unit of active pharmaceutical agents fenton oxidation was applied and the optimum concentration of ferrous ion was found out to be 0 3 m and that of hydrogen peroxide was 3 m using experimental design the efficiency of the model was characterised by a 90 removal of cod of the wastewater within the first 10 min additionally samples containing active pharmaceutical intermediates were also evaluated in which fenton oxidation proved to be the best technique for reduction of cod in the wastewaters kanakaraju et al 2018 have extensively reviewed the various advanced oxidation processes employed in different studies the single aops used were ozonation for pharmaceuticals such as nsaids non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and the precursors of nsaids such as salicylic acid fenton photo fenton and solar photo fenton methods were mainly used for the treatment of antibiotics such as ofloxacin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid among others uv peroxide processes were used for antibiotics especially sulphonamides certain analgesics and antiarrhythmic agents sonolysis was exclusively used for antibiotics and nsaids such as diclofenac and piroxicam de bel et al 2011 naddeo et al 2015 lianou et al 2017 ziylan yavas and ince 2018 radiation technique has been used for carbamazepine and fluoxetine garcía espinoza et al 2018 perez et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 liu et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 reinholds et al 2017 silva et al 2016 szabo et al 2018 the aops are also widely found to be used for pre treatment of wastewater and also in combinations with other processes for increased efficiency and optimisation of the treatment process for example márquez et al 2014 have used ozone ti o 2 solar photocatalysis for a mixture of 4 different classes of pharmaceutical drugs from the sampled distilled and effluent water it was concluded that the initial step of ozonisation had poor removal efficiency of a mere 10 however upon subsequent treatment with ti o 2 solar photocatalysis the efficiency drastically improved to 80 for distilled water and 60 for effluent water since aops are the latest technologies in solving treatment issues for industries the greatest advantage they offer is the treatment of antibiotics in a time where antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern such methods aid in averting exposure of antibiotics and their metabolites and hence prevent further resistance however the biggest challenge of aops is its less affordability 3 3 advanced materials used in conventional treatment amouzgar et al 2016 have studied the application of advanced materials such as polymers inorganics semiconductors zero valence metals and composite membranes as a way to overcome the limitations of conventional treatment methods in treating pharmaceutical wastewater the major materials studied were activated carbon modified carbon nanotubes cnt modified polysaccharide matrices metal organic framework mof reactive composites tio2 coated adsorbents adsorption by zeolite and polymer composites and adsorption by clay so far it was found that all these materials work on the basis of adsorption phenomenon and that not one material can be used exclusively for all methods the review is complemented with case studies and a maximum of 90 efficiency has been achieved amongst the methods which indicates the potential of these materials and the need of more studies in the area to apply these techniques as an evidence of their merit 4 scope of bioremediation techniques in the treatment of pharmaceutical industry waste water piww in most cases the conventional treatment by the wastewater treatment plants wwtps is effective in reduction of the carbon and nitrogen content of the wastewater however it has been observed that they are insufficient in the effective removal of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse and the effluent water streams from the wwtps have been categorised as micropollutants another hurdle in employing the chemical and physicochemical methods for the treatment is the fact that the cost of operation using chemicals is rather expensive for industries in addition to the harmful by products the chemical process leaves behind amin et al 2013 hence biological degradation or bioremediation techniques have been sought for while applying the biological treatment it is crucial to ensure that the by product of the biologically treated effluent is not more toxic than the initial influent the process of biodegradation bioremediation of the influent wastewater is dependent on the following factors stereochemistry of the compound present toxicity of the given compound its concentration efficiency of the microbial strain utilised conditions during the degradation process retention time and the presence of other compounds and their concentration misal et al 2011 a broad classification of the bioremediation techniques that are commonly used or are emerging can be given as bacterial bioremediation aerobic and anaerobic methods of bioremediation phytoremediation fungal bioremediation and phycoremediation all of which are discussed further table 4 gives a summary of reviewed bioremediation techniques 4 1 bacterial bioremediation bacterial remediation has been used quite extensively to treat industrial wastewaters different types of bacteria such as endophytes pseudomonas and other strains of bacteria as well as species such as b subtilis have been employed in the treatment process das et al 2012 carried out a study in tamil nadu india in which they collected samples from nine different sites in the pharmaceutical industry in the forms of mee feed water condensate water condensate water online boiler blow down water cooling tower water and s t p water etp mee and processed salts of which the latter 3 were in solid form a bacterial consortium using bacillus subtilis bacillus megatherium pseudomonas fluorescens phosphate solubilising bacteria pseudomonas putida bacillus pumilis nitrobacter aspergillus niger bacillus licheniformis nitrosomonas rodococcus was prepared prior to the treatment parameters such as cod tss tds and sulphates were determined the effluents were then treated using the aforementioned bacterial consortium chakraborty et al 2012 after the treatment it was found out that the levels of sulphates tds and tss in all samples had considerably decreased when compared with the data before the treatment however cod of all the samples appeared to remain somewhat constant and showed very minute changes upon treatment the study signifies that a versatile bacterial consortium with varied strains is effective in the degradation of sulphates and tss whilst is unable to successfully improve the cod of water madukasi et al 2010 studied the effect of wild strain purple non sulphur photosynthetic bacterium the strain was named as z08 and was identified as rhodobacter sphaeroides by 16srdn the pharmaceutical wastewater was enriched with 0 5 of ammonium sulphate and 0 1 of yeast extract for 5 d of retention time under microaerobic optimum light 6000 lx at the end of the study an 80 removal rate of cod was observed which evidently shows the potential utility of phototrophic bacteria in the treatment of wastewater for the removal of organic wastes 4 2 aerobic methods of bioremediation aerobic methods of bioremediation predominantly consist of activated sludge treatment membrane batch reactors mbrs and sequence batch reactors watkinson et al 2007 have tested for the total antibiotic concentration in the effluent samples collected from wwtps in brisbane australia they have applied the active sludge method to assess the treatment and removal of 28 sorts of human and veterinary antibiotics which in the influent samples were found in a concentration range of 0 34 4 6 μg l the samples were evaluated using lc ms ms technique of analysis the results showed a significant decrease in the concentrations of ciprofloxacin sulphamethoxazole lincomycin and trimethoprim with their prevalence in an average range of 0 05 0 6 μg l the resulting total antibiotic concentration for this method heavily relied on the concentration of nitrates and hence demonstrates a strong relationship between the two suresh and abraham 2018 describe the process of activated sludge as the addition of a flocculent suspension of microorganisms such as nitrite and ammonia oxidising bacteria such as nitrosococcus mobilis and nitrospira sp and subsequent aeration of the suspension the activated sludge process can further be subdivided into conventional and stepped aeration processes a submerged diffuser is often present inside the tank for agitation parameters such as ph extended aeration oxidation ditches can be altered for different types of treatment model ejhed et al 2018 compares three different facilities for 32 pharmaceuticals hormones and polymers 28 of the 32 pharmaceuticals retained in the treatment facilities the study indicates that active sludge method is advantageous than the more commonly used trickling filtration method it also throws light on the correlation of logko w value of the drug to its removal efficiency by activated sludge method it suggests that logko w value is proportional to its removal efficiency additionally need of more studies to establish the correlation of hydraulic retention time and active surface area with removal efficiency is expressed radjenovic et al 2007 have successfully carried out treatment using a membrane bioreactor on samples collected from a wastewater plant rubi in barcelona spain the analysis of the mbr treated v s conventional wastewater was done in which they concluded that drugs such as diclofenac ranitidine ofloxacin hydrochlorothiazide have been expected to be completely removed as compared to other methods such as activated sludge which are very sensitive to parameters such as operating temperatures and ph however certain drugs such as carbamazepine have shown no effect and have retained in the water sample unchanged but on the basis of their study it can clearly be concluded that the process of mbr is superior to the active sludge method and has been devised for its improvement ileri et al 2003 have made the use of sequence batch reactors sbrs as an alternative to active sludge as this method requires less land or floor space and produce no returning sludge an additional advantage that sbrs offer is that it does not require separate units for aeration and sedimentation processes they have sampled raw mixed pharmaceutical wastewater and domestic wastewater and their findings were as follows the removal rates of biochemical oxygen demand bod were found to be 82 and that of cod were 88 a removal rate of 96 was observed for n h 3 and 98 for suspended solids ss from the sampled domestic and pharmaceutical wastewater were achieved by employing an sbr which operated for 4 h of aeration and a period of 60 min for the process of sedimentation 4 3 anaerobic methods of bioremediation anaerobic methods offer many advantages over the aerobic methods the most significant of which is that it uses about 1 kwh fossil energy kg cod removed as compared to the activated sludge method depending upon the type of system used for aeration in the latter van lier et al 2015 anaerobic biodegradation can be described as a fermentation process which involves either of the following mechanisms depending upon the microorganism used acidogenesis methanogenesis hydrolysis or acetogenesis shi et al 2017 ji et al 2013 anaerobic contact reactor acr up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb fluidised bed reactor fbr and anaerobic film reactor constitute the main reactor configurations used for the treatment of industrial wastewaters suresh and abraham 2018 comoglu et al 2015 studied the anaerobic treatment of samples collected from pharmaceutical industry in istanbul turkey using a mixed mesophilic nongranular sludge from eskisehir municipal wastewater treatment plant in turkey as an inoculum up flow anaerobic stage reactor they have studied the batch process as well as the continuous process for determining the contrast in the efficacy of each in order to optimise the process a factorial design of 3 3 was used to carry out the experiments the relationships between parameters such as biomass hrt olr alkalinity and nutrient was studied in great detail a consistent 70 75 removal of cod was obtained as a pre treatment with an overall 93 97 efficiency it was concluded that the performance of the uapb reactor archaeal and bacterial biomass were indicators of their ability to efficiently treat pharmaceutical industry wastewater under anaerobic conditions for pharmaceutical wastewater an up flow anaerobic stage reactor has been successfully used rather than anaerobic film or contact reactor these are also applied for pre treatment before active sludge methods shi et al 2017 have reviewed several studies and they strongly advocate the use of anaerobic treatment in combination with a subsequent aerobic treatment the reason for using such a technique is that it can considerably improve the treatment stability and promote complete oxidation an anaerobic treatment would treat most of the organic compounds in the wastewater leaving behind certain organic residues which can successfully be treated using an aerobic treatment method in addition to the reduction of ammonia via nitrification a study was carried out in which an anaerobic uasb system was used in conjunction with aerobic sequential reactor methods a 94 7 cod removal efficiency for uasb mbr and a 91 8 efficiency for uasb sbr was observed when such hybrid models of aerobic and anaerobic methods had been employed respectively shi et al 2014 bacterial bioremediation with a versatile microbial consortium yields efficiency of about 70 80 other widely used techniques include aerobic processes such as active sludge sequence batch reactors and membrane bioreactors in which sbrs have proved to be the most efficient and cost effective as opposed to the aerobic anaerobic processes have shown excellent performance even with minimal use of energy up flow anaerobic stage reactor is the most widely accepted form of anaerobic process across the pharmaceutical industry so far the hybrid models of aerobic and anaerobic methods can be considered the most competent and preferable methods of bioremediation as they provide extraordinary efficiencies and greater control over the process when it comes to the treatment of specific pollutants in the influent water additionally advanced methods such as fenton oxidation in conjunction with bioremediation techniques offer a newer and interesting area of research 4 4 phytoremediation phytoremediation is primarily an in situ method of bioremediation it is believed that any plant that grows in polluted sites is a good phytoremediator this method of remediation is dependent on the physical chemical biochemical microbiological and biological interactions of plant with the toxic pollutants azubuike et al 2016 wang et al 2015 studied the effect of the plant samples of polygonum orientale collected from fenhe river taiyuan shanxi province china on different concentrations of solutions of phenol i e 5 20 and 80 mg l as they were present in the concentration range of 4 68 82 17 mg l in the fenhe river wetland area preceding the experiment each plant sample was treated to kill microorganisms and a culture with nutrient media and ampicillin to inhibit growth of algae was prepared and the acclimated cultures were used for the treatment two control models were also prepared the analysis of culture was done using spectrometric assay and the result was expressed in terms of residual phenol for plant cultures that were exposed to 80 mg l of phenol the residual amount of phenol was found to be 57 3 and at 20 mg l it was observed to consistently decrease to 33 07 however the residual phenol at 5 mg l reduced exponentially approaching a removal percentage of approximately 100 towards the end of 5 days a nath et al 2013 have investigated the biosorption properties of water hyacinth eichornia crassipes on industrial dyes these dyes are quite often used in the pharmaceutical industry as indicators for analysis the removal efficiencies observed were 90 88 92 90 percentage for methylene blue congo red crystal violet and malachite green after a contact time of 5 days this study makes the application of water hyacinth in removal of industrial dyes stand out from the common applications of phytoremediation of removal of drugs and phenol gujarathi et al 2005 have carried out a study using a model for helianthus annus i e sunflower as a phytoremediator for aqueous media containing tetracycline and oxytetracycline the hairy roots of the sunflower plant and their rhizospheric activity play a key role in understanding the plant pollutant interaction it was found that the root system released compounds that acted as a catalyst in the rapid removal and modification of the antibiotic moiety a uv spectroscopic analyses of exudate treated oxytetracycline pointed out that the modifications had been significant a direct relation between the age of cultures and the rate of modification and an inverse relation between the concentration of the oxytetracycline and rate of modification was observed the theory of enzyme catalysis being at play in the mechanism was dismissed but a decrease in rate of modification was observed upon addition and increase in concentration of ascorbic acid an anti oxidant this suggests that reactive oxygen species ros might have a role to play in the antibiotic modification process this method can be merited with its cost effectiveness and good capacity to bioaccumulate toxins and remove tetracyclines and heavy metals such as cadmium and lead which are not removed as efficiently by microorganisms an additional prospect of its application is in the removal of phenol and industrial dyes 4 5 fungal bioremediation there are several strains of fungal spores such as aspergillus niger aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niveus that can be used for bioremediation however some strains have limitations as they have a long spore formation cycle the ascomycetes group of fungi has been recognised widely for its efficacy in cod removal of industrial wastewaters such as that derived from distilleries mohammad et al 2006 angayarkanni et al 2003 bardi et al 2017 have studied the effect of a strain of white rot fungus wrf named bjerkandera adusta mut 2295 on synthetic recalcitrant effluent sample solutions that had been prepared from tannic and humic acids the results showed an 89 and 75 of bod removal in tannic and humic acid solutions respectively with a 61 cod removal in case of tannic acid effluent increasing number of studies are being carried out to tap the biochemical potential of species of filamentous fungi such as basidiomycetes for the enzymatic biotransformation of various pharmaceuticals olicón hernández et al 2017 4 6 phycoremediation brar et al 2017 have reviewed the method of phycoremediation for the removal of heavy metals microalgae macroalgae and cyanobacteria have been employed to treat the water containing heavy metals such as chromium the use of species such as chlorella scenedesmus nodularia phormidium botryococcus spirulina oscillatoria desmodesmus arthrospira nostoc chlamydomonas cyanothece have been done so far dubey et al 2013 rawat et al 2011 the current trends of biological treatment have been contrasted with that of phycoremediation in which they argue that phycoremediation has the inherent potential to utilise the nutrients and metals present in the wastewater which renders it superior and viable option for further use as a source of biomass fuel and alternative energy a study by yewalkar et al 2007 demonstrates the reduction of cr vi to cr iii species due to the presence of the living algal cells of chlorella sp a residual amount of only 10 21 of cr vi and a decrease of greater than 50 was observed when analysed using colorimetric assay in water containing chlorella sp nitrella sp this evidently shows its potential in treating wastewater containing cr vi as a pollutant das et al 2015 illustrate the properties of phoridium sp as a biosorption medium for pb2 ions from aqueous medium in simulated wastewater they illustrate how the solid residue obtained from the algal oil extraction used for production of biodiesel is used to prepare the adsorbent a 92 2 efficiency is observed in the biosorption process at an optimum ph concentration 10 mg l and temperature conditions arumugam et al 2018 have compiled the sources and applications of all the types of seaweeds i e red brown and green seaweeds and characterised their role in each industry it throws light on the versatility of the seaweeds and their utilisation for removal of phenol hydrocarbons biphenyls nutrients heavy metals and dyes from the wastewater as is relevant to the pharmaceutical industry they argue that many studies have been done using simulated wastewater which may bring discrepancies in efficiency when applied to real wastewater due to the complexities involved in the real application and hence elucidate the need to study their applicability on real samples of wastewater microalgal bioremediation is emerging as a sustainable option for sequestration of pollutants from wastewaters additionally they provide a source for biofuel and its residues can further be used as a biosorption medium it is clearly indicated that the algae are predominantly associated with the removal of heavy metals 4 7 cyanobacteria in bioremediation sarmah and rout 2019 studied the effect of a cyanobacterial isolate nostoc carneum on low density polyethylene the pe strips were found to be perforated and fragile towards the end of the process the biodegraded products were analysed using ft ir and nmr technique the peaks obtained indicated the presence of carbonyl groups which were formed upon cleavage of polyethylene polyethylene is anticipated to be the carbon source for the colonising cyanobacteria a 3 utilisation of carbon from polyethylene was observed enzymes are expected to play a key role in biodegradation the greater weight loss and thinning of the pe substratum is observed upon the fast growth of the cyanobacterium this study holds relevant in case of pharmaceutical industry as various grades of polyethylene are used in tertiary packaging and in the blow fill seal technology for parenteral and other liquid formulations where the use of optimum grade is indispensable to providing a sterilised product hence biodegradation using a cyanobacterial species may aid in the facing the challenges in the treatment of these polymers 4 8 membrane based treatment membrane methods depend on pressure driven process of removal and have attracted the attention of scientists due to their energy efficient and environmentally benign nature giwa et al 2017 these are particularly advantageous over methods such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration as they do not require large energy inputs and high costs of operation dasgupta et al 2016 in addition to pharmaceutical applications β galactosidase enzyme is used in functional foods as a prebiotic such as in production of galato oligosaccharide gos this enzyme is further known to play a role in the utilisation of whey to form ethanol from aqueous medium by membrane recycle bioreactor and co immobilization of s cerevisiae with β galactosidase this is a key bioremediation mechanism based on the reuse and recycling of waste materials a nath et al 2014 petrosino et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2017 5 future scope and limitations of bioremediation techniques one of the major limitations of bioremediation as a technique for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is that despite the availability of several different methods of bioremediation for industrial wastewater not all have been studied to be applied to treat the wastewater generated from the pharmaceutical industry it is often observed that despite the fact that microorganisms are ubiquitous in a water stream their action is not effective the lack of nutrient such as nitrogen or phosphorus maybe credited for this lack of action azubuike et al 2016 another limitation of bioremediation as a technique is that it is often limited to biodegradable pollutants and is a highly selective process which can make its application for the treatment of a variety of xenobiotics difficult moreover the extrapolation of bench or pilot scale to large scale site operation and research to successfully engineer the process is difficult few concerns have also been raised in regards to the toxicity of the end product of the bioremediation process as compared to the untreated parent compound amin et al 2013 due to the versatility of the bioremediation techniques it is evident that the prospect of its applicability in various ways is very likely one of the most common ways these techniques are being deployed is its conjunction with another biological or chemical or physical method to improve its efficiency a hybrid model such as a sequential reactor or a simultaneous bioremediation process for treatment is often designed to nullify the possibilities of the presence of any residues or recalcitrant compounds in the resultant effluent shi et al 2014 the molecular study of microorganisms has contributed to a better understanding of their functions and metabolic pathways which in turn have led to the designing of techniques that can overcome the limitations otherwise faced by microbial culture methodologies biostimulation is a process used to overcome the lack of nutrients for the microorganisms as it relies upon the addition of nutrients that are required for a microbial consortium however the amount of nutrients should be mediated as an excess of nutrients has been observed to hinder the activity wang et al 2012 another emerging field of study is that of nanomaterials nanomaterials have been recognised to improve the efficiency of the microorganisms by increasing the surface area and lowering the activation energy rizwan et al 2014 with the advent of genetic engineering microorganisms can be engineered and designed to perform specific functions in the treatment process furthermore biocatalysts and biosurfactants may also be applied in order to increase the efficiency of the process as well as accentuate the already existing potential of this technique recent findings report broadens the scope of bioremediation by extending its applicability by using them in models that use the microorganisms as biomarker for certain wastes and microbial fuel cells which also utilise the degradation products and provide dual process solutions lu et al 2017 patel et al 2017 6 conclusion pharmaceutical industry has a vital role to play in the healthcare of humankind but it has also played a role in degradation of the sources that we derive our water from the objective of this review was to characterise the piww and to compare and contrast the various methods of treatment with a focus on the bioremediation techniques its emergence and the current trends the features and constituents of the influent wastewater are critical to the adoption of a specific treatment method as drugs and their metabolites especially of antibiotics can have severe adverse environmental impacts and as a result offer resistance against those medications in the population that is exposed to it traditionally along with physicochemical methods only the aerobic and anaerobic bioremediation methods were used to treat the wastewater until the advanced oxidation processes were applied the physical chemical and advanced oxidation treatment techniques are met with limitations such as inadequate efficacies toxic by products and high costs of operation so as an alternate to those other biological degradation or bioremediation techniques have been researched the processes described in the review include ex situ activated sludge mbr etc as well as in situ phytoremediation techniques it is also pointed out that a treatment method that has two processes such as bioremediation in conjunction with aop has a superior performance numerous studies on alternative ways of bioremediation have given way to the study on endophytes for phycoremediation cyanobacterial remediation reverse osmosis and membrane processes which involve the use of biological membranes for the filtration mechanism and can yield competent efficiencies however not all studies reviewed take into account the natural qualities such as hardness amount of silt salts etc of the water samples taken for study and their effects on the treatment process many similar methods have provided inconsistent efficiencies each study reviewed has considered a different parameter for efficiency thus making the comparison amongst them difficult this urges the need for more studies that can compare and define the superiority of a technique over the other many studies have not been carried out using the real samples of wastewater which can offer challenges to its real world applicability the review emphasises on the merits and demerits of each process this can aid further studies in optimising the processes for improved efficiencies using advanced tools such as quality by design and artificial neural networks to design a treatment model that has superior performance hence it can be concluded that bioremediation techniques with their plasticity and immense potential can serve as a means of sustainable wastewater management of the pharmaceutical industry to mitigate its ecotoxicological impacts authors contribution all the authors make substantial contribution in this manuscript as and ms participated in drafting the

12035,the waste that pharmaceutical industries produce has hazardous implications on the environment and public health if disposed without being treated pharmaceutical industry wastewater piww is the product of the drug and formulation development process and its safe disposal upon treatment is essential there have been very few studies that reflect on nature of effluents from the pharmaceutical industries to select successful and efficacious process of treatment it is critical to know the characteristics and components of the influent water hence this review aims at comprehensively analysing the characteristics of the pharmaceutical wastewater to provide a better insight on the preferable choices of treatment several studies have been carried out on various treatment methods this paper compares these methods namely physicochemical advanced oxidation and bioremediation in which bioremediation emerges as the most sustainable and economically viable option additionally the scope of this paper extends to discuss the various types of bioremediation their applications and drawbacks in context of industrial wastewater treatment aimed at decreasing the ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment bioremediation characterisation 1 introduction groundwater and surface water are the most important sources of water for domestic as well as industrial activities 70 of the groundwater available is used for agricultural purposes curcio et al 2018 jha et al 2019 and is the most abundant source of drinking water shah et al 2018a 2019a 2019c vaidya et al 2015 in agriculture water is used for the cattle and irrigation while it assumes a versatile role such as that of a cooling washing processing transporting and diluting agent in a manufacturing unit nag et al 2007 dieter et al 2018 shah et al 2017 2019b sircar et al 2017 the use of water is also very important to the sanitary needs of an industry which in turn produces wastewater containing xenobiotics that is discharged into either local streams or sewer the water discarded from the manufacturing units of pharmaceutical companies is termed as pharmaceutical industry wastewater piww the production process of drugs is not in pace with the treatment options available the global phenol production for various industries has exceeded 8 million tonnes worldwide in 2008 saha et al 2017 shah et al 2018b sircar et al 2015 hence these compounds accumulate to adversely affect the ecosystem of water and raise public health concerns when consumed or used for domestic purposes water quality monitoring programs have become a necessity to ensure the public health of vulnerable water bodies suthar et al 2010 kannel et al 2007 phiri et al 2005 several reports suggest the prominent presence of toxic and hazardous compounds in the wastewater groundwater and surface water damodhar and reddy 2013 heberer 2002 hernando et al 2004 stackelberg et al 2004 cahill et al 2004 debska et al 2004 gomez et al 2006 the wastewater may include organic biodegradable organic non biodegradable and inorganic substances heavy metals and potential inhibitors which eventually end up into a water catchment area or into the groundwater as landfill leachates their presence and concentration can be evaluated by analysis of samples by establishing a water quality index using several physicochemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity bod cod total suspended solids tss amongst others see table 1 an in depth understanding of the composition and characterisation of the derived wastewater is essential for deploying a given technique and ensuring its performance in a waste water treatment plant mhlanga and brouckaert 2013 melcer 2003 in the pharmaceutical industry effluents are characteristic and need to be discarded to maintain the quality and safety standards of the pharmaceuticals it is crucial to categorize the components and their nature before treatment as the effluents it produces contain chemicals that exhibit carcinogenic mutagenic teratogenic and other severe adverse effects it predominantly consists of organic substances which are more harmful than its inorganic counterpart kumar et al 2018 since the pharmaceutical companies produce a variety of medications and cosmetics their wastewater stream is not uniform it contains substances ranging from active biomass and antibiotics to polyaromatic hydrocarbons and phenols kumar et al 2019 dixit and parmar 2013 chang et al 2008 additionally the water bodies were also found to have microplastics which are relevant to this industry as grades of plastics such as pvc and others are used for packaging purposes they have gene altering endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic life and are harmful to another biota they pose an indirect threat to human health due to the process of fragmentation rezania et al 2018 a wastewater plant is employed to treat the untreated influents into relatively neutral effluents for disposal gadipelly et al 2014 the predominance of fluoride ions in drinking water have raised many public health concerns such as kidney disorders and dental fluorosis and hence the latest techniques such as electrocoagulation nanofiltration reverse osmosis and adsorption ion exchange can be applied for its remediation yadav et al 2019 traditionally the treatment of piww can be classified into primary secondary and tertiary classes the primary class of treatment is either chemical or physicochemical such as ozonation electrocoagulation in nature the secondary is dominated by biological processes such as active bio sludge and the tertiary consists of advanced oxidation processes such as catalytic oxidation amongst them bioremediation has emerged as a promising technique for treatment rana et al 2017 bioremediation or biological degradation has an advantage over other chemical methods that have been unsuccessful and have rendered the water toxic due to the yielding of by products in the treatment process the bioremediation process relies on the action of either fungal bacterial or plant phytoremediation species or on the use of aerobic anaerobic or membrane bioreactors to treat and maintain a steady state of chemicals in the ecosystem of water a bioremediation technique aims at treating xenobiotics and plastics as a result of microbial transformation that makes the water less toxic and more stable than its initial polluted state misal et al 2011 de luca et al 2018 other bioremediation techniques discussed include treatment using biomimetic membranes ultrafiltration membranes and photocatalysis membrane technology is widely used in desalination and water treatment in a typical plant polymeric membranes are used in potable water reuse in areas with water scarcity issues these membranes carry out microfiltration and ultrafiltration and are sometimes used in conjunction with techniques such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration but they also offer certain limitations such as membrane fouling stability and material related issues warsinger et al 2018 while there are a lot of studies that focus individually on metals antibiotics or microplastics and their anaerobic fungal or phytoremediation in general there have been fewer ones that have characterised and evaluated the impact of piww and the pharmaceutical waste in entirety the aim of this study is to throw light at qualitative aspects characteristics and components of piww the review not only takes into account the drugs and its intermediates but also certain polymers used in formulation as well as plastics in its packaging in purview of the pharmaceutical industry the significance of this review is that it compares and compiles the more specific effective and sustainable bioremediation techniques for removal or biodegradation of piww moreover it plays a role in ruling out other generalised expensive and relatively inefficient methods that aim at only improving only certain properties such as cod bod and physicochemical properties of water it also provides a perspective on why each method was devised and its significance the scope of conventional primary secondary and tertiary methods of treatment types of bioremediation techniques and their limitations have been discussed and reviewed with a view to expand its future scope and applicability additionally there exists a gap as all aspects that are reviewed have not been covered solely from the perspective of pharmaceutical industry 2 characterisation of pharmaceutical industry waste water piww identifying the properties of water and its pollutants is necessary to devise a treatment method deegan et al 2011 and for that a comprehensive study of both the physico chemical properties and the content of xenobiotics in the effluents is required to be done fig 1 classifies the type of possible pollutants in piww the most characteristic feature of pharmaceutical industries wastewater is that it contains not just the apis active pharmaceutical ingredients but also the various intermediates solvents catalysts and other raw materials used to synthesise and develop a particular medication in its desirable dosage form and these materials are quite detrimental for the water in the catchment area that it is ultimately disposed in zaman et al 2014 fent et al 2006 oktem et al 2007 petrovic et al 2009 introduced the method of estimation of concentration in sewage using back calculation of the prescription rate data and the potential hydrolysis of conjugates excretion rates and metabolism based on the defined daily doses however it was later found out that the annual drug sales is not the correct data set to predict the environmental concentrations of the influents in the wwtps accurately as there is a lacuna of data bound and voulvoulis 2006 and this gap between the data was reflected in the form of significant deviations in environmental concentrations of samples when compared to the proposed predicted model by european medicines agency 2006 to provide better information and understanding of the effect of pharmaceuticals fass sweden have made an effort by supplying information on the effect of a particular pharmaceutically active substance on the environment in terms of its biodegradation rate and bioaccumulation potential an environmental classification of the pharmaceutical substances has been made to provide a clearer perspective of the substances that have a greater potential risk or environmental impact it also aids the companies to carry out an individual environmental risk assessment fass 2012 rana et al 2017 have given a detailed overview of the parameters used to determine the quality of water used in the pharmaceutical industry in varied regions of india the data from various studies has been represented as follows petrovic et al 2009 has reviewed the most commonly found drugs in the samples from more than seven sewage water sites in spain and have classified them into over the counter drugs otcs prescribed drugs and drugs of abuse das see table 2 for an overview of prevalent drugs the otcs majorly consisted of nsaids such as ibuprofen 0 381 150 73 μg l santos et al 2007 nakada et al 2006 diclofenac 0 05 17 1 μg l indomethacin 0 23 0 64 μg l petrovic et al 2009 lishman et al 2006 gros et al 2006 paracetamol 0 13 246 μg l lishman et al 2006 gros et al 2006 nakada et al 2006 gómez et al 2007 and others in their mean median or maximum influent concentrations prescribed drugs in the wastewater largely consisted of i lipid regulating and cholesterol lowering drugs such as gemfibrozil 0 155 0 965 μg l and clofibric acid 0 072 0 36 μg l petrovic et al 2009 gros et al 2006 tauxe wuersch et al 2005 ii psychiatric drugs for example carbamazepine 0 015 1 85 μg l nakada et al 2006 clara et al 2005 gros et al 2006 gómez et al 2007 iii antibiotics such as sulphamethaxozole 0 59 μg l ofloxacin ciprofloxacin 3 8 4 6 μg l trimethoprim 1 172 μg l watkinson et al 2007 some antibiotics such as chloramphenicol penicillins and its semi synthetic and synthetic forms amongst others have been detected in a study by al riyami et al 2018 in oman it has been claimed to cause health complications in humans if sub lethal concentrations of residual antibiotics are exposed to pathogens in the sewage water as it may lead to the development of antibiotic drug resistant microorganisms al riyami et al 2018 al bahry et al 2013 iv antihistaminics such as ranitidine 0 188 μg l gros et al 2006 v β blockers such as atenolol 0 395 μg l metoprolol 0 411 0 015 μg l propranolol 0 168 μg l macleod et al 2007 the drugs of abuse content of the wastewater was dominated by cocaine and benzoylecgonine there was a large ratio of morphine and its derivatives amphetamine like drugs have been found in concentrations of nanograms in the effluent wastewater however the concentrations lysergic acid lsd and its derivatives and tetrahydrocannabinol thc have been found to be negligibly low the reviewed data was derived from sample effluent studies of some countries of europe namely italy spain ireland belgium germany switzerland and united kingdom kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 boleda et al 2007 huerta fontela et al 2007 2008 postigo et al 2008 bones et al 2007 zuccato et al 2008 castiglioni et al 2006a 2006b gheorghe et al 2008 hummel et al 2006 deschamps et al 2012 carried out a data survey using data provided by feam in brazil they studied the process of pharmaceutical production and effluent treatment two companies were selected and the effluents constituted of amoxicillin and its metabolites amoxicilloic acid ama and amoxicillin diketopiperazine 2 5 dione diketo norfloxacin sulfadiazine and piperacillin amongst others the significance of this study is that it throws light on the fact that ama and diketo are potential allergens and the treatment of effluents using fenton oxidation has yielded results with discrepancies the other most important type of micropollutant present was microplastics plastics such as hdpe ldpe pvc etc are used in the packaging bottles or strips of tablets of drugs polymers such as bisphenol a in packaging which is a priority hazardous substance octacrylene which is a uv filter used in sunscreens and triclosan which is used in anti bacterials are some other polymers that reduce to micropollutants and disrupt the ecosystem of the water ejhed et al 2018 additionally traces of metals such as aluminium may be found as they are also an important component for packaging such as strip packaging of tablets and capsules there also have been quite a few studies that elucidate the presence of compounds classified as environmental hormones such as dioxins diethylstilboestrol and other estrogens they have potential to disrupt the reproductive system and show feminine characteristics in a male population of birds 3 methods of treatment for pharmaceutical industry waste water piww the most commonly used methods for the treatment of piww can be broadly classified into physicochemical processes biological processes which can further be classified into aerobic and anaerobic processes and advanced oxidation processes table 3 presents an overview of physicochemical and advanced oxidation processes 3 1 physicochemical methods very often these methods are used as primary processes that are followed by biological processes as secondary method of treatment these processes are carried out to decrease the organic load for the subsequent biological process vanerkar et al 2013 the most widely used methods are electrocoagulation ozone treatment and the method of activated carbon adsorption and these methods are most often used in conjunction with the biological methods malakootian and ahmadian 2019 studied the process of electro activated persulfate using iron electrodes on the wastewater samples containing ciprofloxacin antibiotic collected from an iranian pharmaceutical company the wastewater was subjected to persulfate but it was not successful in treating the water due to the complex structure of the antibiotic molecule when the sample was subjected to two were combined ec ps process an efficiency of 96 with its peak activity at 75 min was obtained this rise in efficiency was because electrocoagulation contributed to the activation of persulfate which increased the rate of the process and gave way to speedy removal of the antibiotic gome and upadhyay 2013 evaluated the process of ozonation for the treatment of wastewater samples from pharmaceutical industries in dewas madhya pradesh india in terms of its biodegradability i e ratio of bod cod the untreated samples were treated under either acidic or alkaline conditions individually a dose of 30 mg l ozone for alkaline conditions and 32 73 mg l for acidic conditions was required their observations did not show significant improvement in the biodegradability however it was suggested that increasing the treatment time accentuated the improvement in the biodegradability hegazy et al 2014 have employed the technique of factorial design to evaluate the efficiency of adsorption of phenol in wastewater onto activated carbon from r stricta species obtained from wadi hermela in central saudi arabia using anova t test and f test for the variables the interactions were interpreted to be significant an efficiency of 85 adsorption was reported hence this method was proved to be effective for the decontamination of phenol containing effluents these methods are significant as it can be inferred from them that increasing the treatment time using a combined operation strategy and carefully designing the process can yield better results it also points out that the ph conditions during ozonation did not strongly influence the outcome 3 2 advanced oxidation methods advanced oxidation processes have traditionally been used for drinking water but they have great potential in the treatment of piww as they are capable of generating in situ ros or reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl species h 2 o 2 ozone and superoxide radical species which have little selectivity and can effectively mineralise substances into c o 2 water and inorganic ions or acids kanakaraju et al 2018 dalrymple et al 2007 aljuboury et al 2014 have used fenton oxidation process for the pre treatment of piww samples of extremely polluted pharmaceutical wastewater were procured from a chemical manufacturing unit of active pharmaceutical agents fenton oxidation was applied and the optimum concentration of ferrous ion was found out to be 0 3 m and that of hydrogen peroxide was 3 m using experimental design the efficiency of the model was characterised by a 90 removal of cod of the wastewater within the first 10 min additionally samples containing active pharmaceutical intermediates were also evaluated in which fenton oxidation proved to be the best technique for reduction of cod in the wastewaters kanakaraju et al 2018 have extensively reviewed the various advanced oxidation processes employed in different studies the single aops used were ozonation for pharmaceuticals such as nsaids non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and the precursors of nsaids such as salicylic acid fenton photo fenton and solar photo fenton methods were mainly used for the treatment of antibiotics such as ofloxacin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid among others uv peroxide processes were used for antibiotics especially sulphonamides certain analgesics and antiarrhythmic agents sonolysis was exclusively used for antibiotics and nsaids such as diclofenac and piroxicam de bel et al 2011 naddeo et al 2015 lianou et al 2017 ziylan yavas and ince 2018 radiation technique has been used for carbamazepine and fluoxetine garcía espinoza et al 2018 perez et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 liu et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 reinholds et al 2017 silva et al 2016 szabo et al 2018 the aops are also widely found to be used for pre treatment of wastewater and also in combinations with other processes for increased efficiency and optimisation of the treatment process for example márquez et al 2014 have used ozone ti o 2 solar photocatalysis for a mixture of 4 different classes of pharmaceutical drugs from the sampled distilled and effluent water it was concluded that the initial step of ozonisation had poor removal efficiency of a mere 10 however upon subsequent treatment with ti o 2 solar photocatalysis the efficiency drastically improved to 80 for distilled water and 60 for effluent water since aops are the latest technologies in solving treatment issues for industries the greatest advantage they offer is the treatment of antibiotics in a time where antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern such methods aid in averting exposure of antibiotics and their metabolites and hence prevent further resistance however the biggest challenge of aops is its less affordability 3 3 advanced materials used in conventional treatment amouzgar et al 2016 have studied the application of advanced materials such as polymers inorganics semiconductors zero valence metals and composite membranes as a way to overcome the limitations of conventional treatment methods in treating pharmaceutical wastewater the major materials studied were activated carbon modified carbon nanotubes cnt modified polysaccharide matrices metal organic framework mof reactive composites tio2 coated adsorbents adsorption by zeolite and polymer composites and adsorption by clay so far it was found that all these materials work on the basis of adsorption phenomenon and that not one material can be used exclusively for all methods the review is complemented with case studies and a maximum of 90 efficiency has been achieved amongst the methods which indicates the potential of these materials and the need of more studies in the area to apply these techniques as an evidence of their merit 4 scope of bioremediation techniques in the treatment of pharmaceutical industry waste water piww in most cases the conventional treatment by the wastewater treatment plants wwtps is effective in reduction of the carbon and nitrogen content of the wastewater however it has been observed that they are insufficient in the effective removal of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse and the effluent water streams from the wwtps have been categorised as micropollutants another hurdle in employing the chemical and physicochemical methods for the treatment is the fact that the cost of operation using chemicals is rather expensive for industries in addition to the harmful by products the chemical process leaves behind amin et al 2013 hence biological degradation or bioremediation techniques have been sought for while applying the biological treatment it is crucial to ensure that the by product of the biologically treated effluent is not more toxic than the initial influent the process of biodegradation bioremediation of the influent wastewater is dependent on the following factors stereochemistry of the compound present toxicity of the given compound its concentration efficiency of the microbial strain utilised conditions during the degradation process retention time and the presence of other compounds and their concentration misal et al 2011 a broad classification of the bioremediation techniques that are commonly used or are emerging can be given as bacterial bioremediation aerobic and anaerobic methods of bioremediation phytoremediation fungal bioremediation and phycoremediation all of which are discussed further table 4 gives a summary of reviewed bioremediation techniques 4 1 bacterial bioremediation bacterial remediation has been used quite extensively to treat industrial wastewaters different types of bacteria such as endophytes pseudomonas and other strains of bacteria as well as species such as b subtilis have been employed in the treatment process das et al 2012 carried out a study in tamil nadu india in which they collected samples from nine different sites in the pharmaceutical industry in the forms of mee feed water condensate water condensate water online boiler blow down water cooling tower water and s t p water etp mee and processed salts of which the latter 3 were in solid form a bacterial consortium using bacillus subtilis bacillus megatherium pseudomonas fluorescens phosphate solubilising bacteria pseudomonas putida bacillus pumilis nitrobacter aspergillus niger bacillus licheniformis nitrosomonas rodococcus was prepared prior to the treatment parameters such as cod tss tds and sulphates were determined the effluents were then treated using the aforementioned bacterial consortium chakraborty et al 2012 after the treatment it was found out that the levels of sulphates tds and tss in all samples had considerably decreased when compared with the data before the treatment however cod of all the samples appeared to remain somewhat constant and showed very minute changes upon treatment the study signifies that a versatile bacterial consortium with varied strains is effective in the degradation of sulphates and tss whilst is unable to successfully improve the cod of water madukasi et al 2010 studied the effect of wild strain purple non sulphur photosynthetic bacterium the strain was named as z08 and was identified as rhodobacter sphaeroides by 16srdn the pharmaceutical wastewater was enriched with 0 5 of ammonium sulphate and 0 1 of yeast extract for 5 d of retention time under microaerobic optimum light 6000 lx at the end of the study an 80 removal rate of cod was observed which evidently shows the potential utility of phototrophic bacteria in the treatment of wastewater for the removal of organic wastes 4 2 aerobic methods of bioremediation aerobic methods of bioremediation predominantly consist of activated sludge treatment membrane batch reactors mbrs and sequence batch reactors watkinson et al 2007 have tested for the total antibiotic concentration in the effluent samples collected from wwtps in brisbane australia they have applied the active sludge method to assess the treatment and removal of 28 sorts of human and veterinary antibiotics which in the influent samples were found in a concentration range of 0 34 4 6 μg l the samples were evaluated using lc ms ms technique of analysis the results showed a significant decrease in the concentrations of ciprofloxacin sulphamethoxazole lincomycin and trimethoprim with their prevalence in an average range of 0 05 0 6 μg l the resulting total antibiotic concentration for this method heavily relied on the concentration of nitrates and hence demonstrates a strong relationship between the two suresh and abraham 2018 describe the process of activated sludge as the addition of a flocculent suspension of microorganisms such as nitrite and ammonia oxidising bacteria such as nitrosococcus mobilis and nitrospira sp and subsequent aeration of the suspension the activated sludge process can further be subdivided into conventional and stepped aeration processes a submerged diffuser is often present inside the tank for agitation parameters such as ph extended aeration oxidation ditches can be altered for different types of treatment model ejhed et al 2018 compares three different facilities for 32 pharmaceuticals hormones and polymers 28 of the 32 pharmaceuticals retained in the treatment facilities the study indicates that active sludge method is advantageous than the more commonly used trickling filtration method it also throws light on the correlation of logko w value of the drug to its removal efficiency by activated sludge method it suggests that logko w value is proportional to its removal efficiency additionally need of more studies to establish the correlation of hydraulic retention time and active surface area with removal efficiency is expressed radjenovic et al 2007 have successfully carried out treatment using a membrane bioreactor on samples collected from a wastewater plant rubi in barcelona spain the analysis of the mbr treated v s conventional wastewater was done in which they concluded that drugs such as diclofenac ranitidine ofloxacin hydrochlorothiazide have been expected to be completely removed as compared to other methods such as activated sludge which are very sensitive to parameters such as operating temperatures and ph however certain drugs such as carbamazepine have shown no effect and have retained in the water sample unchanged but on the basis of their study it can clearly be concluded that the process of mbr is superior to the active sludge method and has been devised for its improvement ileri et al 2003 have made the use of sequence batch reactors sbrs as an alternative to active sludge as this method requires less land or floor space and produce no returning sludge an additional advantage that sbrs offer is that it does not require separate units for aeration and sedimentation processes they have sampled raw mixed pharmaceutical wastewater and domestic wastewater and their findings were as follows the removal rates of biochemical oxygen demand bod were found to be 82 and that of cod were 88 a removal rate of 96 was observed for n h 3 and 98 for suspended solids ss from the sampled domestic and pharmaceutical wastewater were achieved by employing an sbr which operated for 4 h of aeration and a period of 60 min for the process of sedimentation 4 3 anaerobic methods of bioremediation anaerobic methods offer many advantages over the aerobic methods the most significant of which is that it uses about 1 kwh fossil energy kg cod removed as compared to the activated sludge method depending upon the type of system used for aeration in the latter van lier et al 2015 anaerobic biodegradation can be described as a fermentation process which involves either of the following mechanisms depending upon the microorganism used acidogenesis methanogenesis hydrolysis or acetogenesis shi et al 2017 ji et al 2013 anaerobic contact reactor acr up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb fluidised bed reactor fbr and anaerobic film reactor constitute the main reactor configurations used for the treatment of industrial wastewaters suresh and abraham 2018 comoglu et al 2015 studied the anaerobic treatment of samples collected from pharmaceutical industry in istanbul turkey using a mixed mesophilic nongranular sludge from eskisehir municipal wastewater treatment plant in turkey as an inoculum up flow anaerobic stage reactor they have studied the batch process as well as the continuous process for determining the contrast in the efficacy of each in order to optimise the process a factorial design of 3 3 was used to carry out the experiments the relationships between parameters such as biomass hrt olr alkalinity and nutrient was studied in great detail a consistent 70 75 removal of cod was obtained as a pre treatment with an overall 93 97 efficiency it was concluded that the performance of the uapb reactor archaeal and bacterial biomass were indicators of their ability to efficiently treat pharmaceutical industry wastewater under anaerobic conditions for pharmaceutical wastewater an up flow anaerobic stage reactor has been successfully used rather than anaerobic film or contact reactor these are also applied for pre treatment before active sludge methods shi et al 2017 have reviewed several studies and they strongly advocate the use of anaerobic treatment in combination with a subsequent aerobic treatment the reason for using such a technique is that it can considerably improve the treatment stability and promote complete oxidation an anaerobic treatment would treat most of the organic compounds in the wastewater leaving behind certain organic residues which can successfully be treated using an aerobic treatment method in addition to the reduction of ammonia via nitrification a study was carried out in which an anaerobic uasb system was used in conjunction with aerobic sequential reactor methods a 94 7 cod removal efficiency for uasb mbr and a 91 8 efficiency for uasb sbr was observed when such hybrid models of aerobic and anaerobic methods had been employed respectively shi et al 2014 bacterial bioremediation with a versatile microbial consortium yields efficiency of about 70 80 other widely used techniques include aerobic processes such as active sludge sequence batch reactors and membrane bioreactors in which sbrs have proved to be the most efficient and cost effective as opposed to the aerobic anaerobic processes have shown excellent performance even with minimal use of energy up flow anaerobic stage reactor is the most widely accepted form of anaerobic process across the pharmaceutical industry so far the hybrid models of aerobic and anaerobic methods can be considered the most competent and preferable methods of bioremediation as they provide extraordinary efficiencies and greater control over the process when it comes to the treatment of specific pollutants in the influent water additionally advanced methods such as fenton oxidation in conjunction with bioremediation techniques offer a newer and interesting area of research 4 4 phytoremediation phytoremediation is primarily an in situ method of bioremediation it is believed that any plant that grows in polluted sites is a good phytoremediator this method of remediation is dependent on the physical chemical biochemical microbiological and biological interactions of plant with the toxic pollutants azubuike et al 2016 wang et al 2015 studied the effect of the plant samples of polygonum orientale collected from fenhe river taiyuan shanxi province china on different concentrations of solutions of phenol i e 5 20 and 80 mg l as they were present in the concentration range of 4 68 82 17 mg l in the fenhe river wetland area preceding the experiment each plant sample was treated to kill microorganisms and a culture with nutrient media and ampicillin to inhibit growth of algae was prepared and the acclimated cultures were used for the treatment two control models were also prepared the analysis of culture was done using spectrometric assay and the result was expressed in terms of residual phenol for plant cultures that were exposed to 80 mg l of phenol the residual amount of phenol was found to be 57 3 and at 20 mg l it was observed to consistently decrease to 33 07 however the residual phenol at 5 mg l reduced exponentially approaching a removal percentage of approximately 100 towards the end of 5 days a nath et al 2013 have investigated the biosorption properties of water hyacinth eichornia crassipes on industrial dyes these dyes are quite often used in the pharmaceutical industry as indicators for analysis the removal efficiencies observed were 90 88 92 90 percentage for methylene blue congo red crystal violet and malachite green after a contact time of 5 days this study makes the application of water hyacinth in removal of industrial dyes stand out from the common applications of phytoremediation of removal of drugs and phenol gujarathi et al 2005 have carried out a study using a model for helianthus annus i e sunflower as a phytoremediator for aqueous media containing tetracycline and oxytetracycline the hairy roots of the sunflower plant and their rhizospheric activity play a key role in understanding the plant pollutant interaction it was found that the root system released compounds that acted as a catalyst in the rapid removal and modification of the antibiotic moiety a uv spectroscopic analyses of exudate treated oxytetracycline pointed out that the modifications had been significant a direct relation between the age of cultures and the rate of modification and an inverse relation between the concentration of the oxytetracycline and rate of modification was observed the theory of enzyme catalysis being at play in the mechanism was dismissed but a decrease in rate of modification was observed upon addition and increase in concentration of ascorbic acid an anti oxidant this suggests that reactive oxygen species ros might have a role to play in the antibiotic modification process this method can be merited with its cost effectiveness and good capacity to bioaccumulate toxins and remove tetracyclines and heavy metals such as cadmium and lead which are not removed as efficiently by microorganisms an additional prospect of its application is in the removal of phenol and industrial dyes 4 5 fungal bioremediation there are several strains of fungal spores such as aspergillus niger aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niveus that can be used for bioremediation however some strains have limitations as they have a long spore formation cycle the ascomycetes group of fungi has been recognised widely for its efficacy in cod removal of industrial wastewaters such as that derived from distilleries mohammad et al 2006 angayarkanni et al 2003 bardi et al 2017 have studied the effect of a strain of white rot fungus wrf named bjerkandera adusta mut 2295 on synthetic recalcitrant effluent sample solutions that had been prepared from tannic and humic acids the results showed an 89 and 75 of bod removal in tannic and humic acid solutions respectively with a 61 cod removal in case of tannic acid effluent increasing number of studies are being carried out to tap the biochemical potential of species of filamentous fungi such as basidiomycetes for the enzymatic biotransformation of various pharmaceuticals olicón hernández et al 2017 4 6 phycoremediation brar et al 2017 have reviewed the method of phycoremediation for the removal of heavy metals microalgae macroalgae and cyanobacteria have been employed to treat the water containing heavy metals such as chromium the use of species such as chlorella scenedesmus nodularia phormidium botryococcus spirulina oscillatoria desmodesmus arthrospira nostoc chlamydomonas cyanothece have been done so far dubey et al 2013 rawat et al 2011 the current trends of biological treatment have been contrasted with that of phycoremediation in which they argue that phycoremediation has the inherent potential to utilise the nutrients and metals present in the wastewater which renders it superior and viable option for further use as a source of biomass fuel and alternative energy a study by yewalkar et al 2007 demonstrates the reduction of cr vi to cr iii species due to the presence of the living algal cells of chlorella sp a residual amount of only 10 21 of cr vi and a decrease of greater than 50 was observed when analysed using colorimetric assay in water containing chlorella sp nitrella sp this evidently shows its potential in treating wastewater containing cr vi as a pollutant das et al 2015 illustrate the properties of phoridium sp as a biosorption medium for pb2 ions from aqueous medium in simulated wastewater they illustrate how the solid residue obtained from the algal oil extraction used for production of biodiesel is used to prepare the adsorbent a 92 2 efficiency is observed in the biosorption process at an optimum ph concentration 10 mg l and temperature conditions arumugam et al 2018 have compiled the sources and applications of all the types of seaweeds i e red brown and green seaweeds and characterised their role in each industry it throws light on the versatility of the seaweeds and their utilisation for removal of phenol hydrocarbons biphenyls nutrients heavy metals and dyes from the wastewater as is relevant to the pharmaceutical industry they argue that many studies have been done using simulated wastewater which may bring discrepancies in efficiency when applied to real wastewater due to the complexities involved in the real application and hence elucidate the need to study their applicability on real samples of wastewater microalgal bioremediation is emerging as a sustainable option for sequestration of pollutants from wastewaters additionally they provide a source for biofuel and its residues can further be used as a biosorption medium it is clearly indicated that the algae are predominantly associated with the removal of heavy metals 4 7 cyanobacteria in bioremediation sarmah and rout 2019 studied the effect of a cyanobacterial isolate nostoc carneum on low density polyethylene the pe strips were found to be perforated and fragile towards the end of the process the biodegraded products were analysed using ft ir and nmr technique the peaks obtained indicated the presence of carbonyl groups which were formed upon cleavage of polyethylene polyethylene is anticipated to be the carbon source for the colonising cyanobacteria a 3 utilisation of carbon from polyethylene was observed enzymes are expected to play a key role in biodegradation the greater weight loss and thinning of the pe substratum is observed upon the fast growth of the cyanobacterium this study holds relevant in case of pharmaceutical industry as various grades of polyethylene are used in tertiary packaging and in the blow fill seal technology for parenteral and other liquid formulations where the use of optimum grade is indispensable to providing a sterilised product hence biodegradation using a cyanobacterial species may aid in the facing the challenges in the treatment of these polymers 4 8 membrane based treatment membrane methods depend on pressure driven process of removal and have attracted the attention of scientists due to their energy efficient and environmentally benign nature giwa et al 2017 these are particularly advantageous over methods such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration as they do not require large energy inputs and high costs of operation dasgupta et al 2016 in addition to pharmaceutical applications β galactosidase enzyme is used in functional foods as a prebiotic such as in production of galato oligosaccharide gos this enzyme is further known to play a role in the utilisation of whey to form ethanol from aqueous medium by membrane recycle bioreactor and co immobilization of s cerevisiae with β galactosidase this is a key bioremediation mechanism based on the reuse and recycling of waste materials a nath et al 2014 petrosino et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2017 5 future scope and limitations of bioremediation techniques one of the major limitations of bioremediation as a technique for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is that despite the availability of several different methods of bioremediation for industrial wastewater not all have been studied to be applied to treat the wastewater generated from the pharmaceutical industry it is often observed that despite the fact that microorganisms are ubiquitous in a water stream their action is not effective the lack of nutrient such as nitrogen or phosphorus maybe credited for this lack of action azubuike et al 2016 another limitation of bioremediation as a technique is that it is often limited to biodegradable pollutants and is a highly selective process which can make its application for the treatment of a variety of xenobiotics difficult moreover the extrapolation of bench or pilot scale to large scale site operation and research to successfully engineer the process is difficult few concerns have also been raised in regards to the toxicity of the end product of the bioremediation process as compared to the untreated parent compound amin et al 2013 due to the versatility of the bioremediation techniques it is evident that the prospect of its applicability in various ways is very likely one of the most common ways these techniques are being deployed is its conjunction with another biological or chemical or physical method to improve its efficiency a hybrid model such as a sequential reactor or a simultaneous bioremediation process for treatment is often designed to nullify the possibilities of the presence of any residues or recalcitrant compounds in the resultant effluent shi et al 2014 the molecular study of microorganisms has contributed to a better understanding of their functions and metabolic pathways which in turn have led to the designing of techniques that can overcome the limitations otherwise faced by microbial culture methodologies biostimulation is a process used to overcome the lack of nutrients for the microorganisms as it relies upon the addition of nutrients that are required for a microbial consortium however the amount of nutrients should be mediated as an excess of nutrients has been observed to hinder the activity wang et al 2012 another emerging field of study is that of nanomaterials nanomaterials have been recognised to improve the efficiency of the microorganisms by increasing the surface area and lowering the activation energy rizwan et al 2014 with the advent of genetic engineering microorganisms can be engineered and designed to perform specific functions in the treatment process furthermore biocatalysts and biosurfactants may also be applied in order to increase the efficiency of the process as well as accentuate the already existing potential of this technique recent findings report broadens the scope of bioremediation by extending its applicability by using them in models that use the microorganisms as biomarker for certain wastes and microbial fuel cells which also utilise the degradation products and provide dual process solutions lu et al 2017 patel et al 2017 6 conclusion pharmaceutical industry has a vital role to play in the healthcare of humankind but it has also played a role in degradation of the sources that we derive our water from the objective of this review was to characterise the piww and to compare and contrast the various methods of treatment with a focus on the bioremediation techniques its emergence and the current trends the features and constituents of the influent wastewater are critical to the adoption of a specific treatment method as drugs and their metabolites especially of antibiotics can have severe adverse environmental impacts and as a result offer resistance against those medications in the population that is exposed to it traditionally along with physicochemical methods only the aerobic and anaerobic bioremediation methods were used to treat the wastewater until the advanced oxidation processes were applied the physical chemical and advanced oxidation treatment techniques are met with limitations such as inadequate efficacies toxic by products and high costs of operation so as an alternate to those other biological degradation or bioremediation techniques have been researched the processes described in the review include ex situ activated sludge mbr etc as well as in situ phytoremediation techniques it is also pointed out that a treatment method that has two processes such as bioremediation in conjunction with aop has a superior performance numerous studies on alternative ways of bioremediation have given way to the study on endophytes for phycoremediation cyanobacterial remediation reverse osmosis and membrane processes which involve the use of biological membranes for the filtration mechanism and can yield competent efficiencies however not all studies reviewed take into account the natural qualities such as hardness amount of silt salts etc of the water samples taken for study and their effects on the treatment process many similar methods have provided inconsistent efficiencies each study reviewed has considered a different parameter for efficiency thus making the comparison amongst them difficult this urges the need for more studies that can compare and define the superiority of a technique over the other many studies have not been carried out using the real samples of wastewater which can offer challenges to its real world applicability the review emphasises on the merits and demerits of each process this can aid further studies in optimising the processes for improved efficiencies using advanced tools such as quality by design and artificial neural networks to design a treatment model that has superior performance hence it can be concluded that bioremediation techniques with their plasticity and immense potential can serve as a means of sustainable wastewater management of

12036,egypt is one of the most water scarce countries of the middle east and north africa region and is highly vulnerable to climatic changes in the egyptian deserts new land reclamation projects depend mainly on groundwater as the main source of water also solar energy is the most promising renewable source of energy for pumping and transport of water moghra region is one of the well known 1 5 million acres reclamation projects areas in the western desert in this paper a groundwater model was constructed and used to investigate the sustainable groundwater management scenarios in moghra region taking into consideration impacts of the expected climate changes using modflow gms software moghra model was prepared and calibrated based on the region s topographic climatic geologic and hydrologeolgic conditions the model was used to explore the impacts of climate changes sea level rise slr by 1 0 m and temperature increase by 2 0c and 40 c on the management scenarios in addition the required power for water management after 5 10 50 and 100 years were determined it was concluded that the best management scenario is to use 1000 wells to extract 1 2 mm3 d of water for serving a total area of 85 714 acres 360 km2 this scenario satisfies the project criteria that permits a maximum drawdown less than 1 m year it was also concluded that slr has mild effects on groundwater levels due to the vast aquifer dimensions additionally the increase in evapotranspiration due to temperature increase will lead to a significant increase in the consumptive use the power needed to extract water will continuously increase due to the expected increase in drawdown the required area for photovoltaic pv solar plant was determined and its value increased by 6 and 12 due to temperature increase of 2 c and 4 c respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords arcgis climate change groundwater management modflow gms moghra aquifer solar energy 1 introduction the middle east and north africa mena region is one of the most water scarce regions in the world rapid increase in population political instability and socio economic crises increase the region vulnerability to the impacts of climate changes egypt set many ambitious reclamation projects in desert lands to create new communities out of the highly populated nile valley and delta to fulfil the local increasing needs for food in egypt groundwater is one of the main water resources after the nile river it is the main source to fulfil the water requirements for new reclamation lands in egyptian deserts solar energy is one of the most efficient renewable energy sources needed for water pumping and supply climate changes may lead to longer droughts periods and consequently affect negatively the potentiality of groundwater sustainable management of the aquifer systems is essential to ensure the safe exploitation of the available water storage all management scenarios should be planned and investigated to protect the aquifer systems considering both quantity and quality aspects the national project for reclaiming 1 5 million acres in the egyptian deserts has been planned depending on the groundwater potential in the aquifer systems nwrc 2017 as most areas of this national project are located at a distance from the nile valley and delta the power required for groundwater extraction should be covered by renewable energy wind and solar energy systems in the western desert the most reliable renewable energy source is the solar energy where 200 mw is the target amount of solar energy to be generated solar atlas of egypt 2018 this evaluation stems from the high value of solar radiation as well as the significant number of sun shining days per year photovoltaic pv plants are the most sustainable and environment friendly system with low pollution emissions sahin and rehman 2012 in average egypt has 9 11 h of sunshine day throughout the year and only few cloudy days due to its location that has high solar insulation and radiation eud 2015 due to the location of moghra area in the eastern corner of the qattara depression the sunshine days and radiation is less than that in the south western dessert groundwater models associated with geographic information systems gis databases can be used to simulate and investigate different scenarios of groundwater management applying solar energy for ensuring the required power these models comprise boundary conditions soil properties sources sinks water levels and aquifer hydraulic properties loucks et al 1985 gis is used to prepare the input thematic layers and to link these data sets with the groundwater model producing integrated gis groundwater models integrated models were used to define optimal locations of pv solar power plants based on gis remote sensing rs techniques and multi criteria decision mcd methods salim 2012 georgiou and skarlatos 2016 a mcd model was developed based on gis techniques where several layers of topography accessibility depth to water groundwater salinity solar radiation and land use were used as input data sayed et al 2019 the developed mcd model was applied on moghra region to produce a map for best locations of solar energy plants the output results of the mcd model showed that locations close to the nile delta and away from moghra lake qattara depression and oil fields are the best for a pv plant a gis based multi criteria analysis was used to produce maps for groundwater vulnerability to pollution in agareb aquifer southern tunisia eight criteria were selected hydraulic conductivity depth to groundwater aquifer type slope land use distance to rivers distance to residential areas and distance to main roads aydi 2018 in order to achieve the sustainable development based on groundwater and solar energy in the egyptian deserts the impacts of climate changes should be taken into consideration for the following reasons the increase in temperature negatively affects crop yields growing seasons length yield potential suitable land for agriculture and increases evaporation rates brauch 2002 masria 2017 it is expected that by 2100 the annual precipitation will decrease by 10 40 in egypt boko et al 2007 the mediterranean slr may cause flooding in coastal zones of the nile delta and will increase the extent of salt water intrusion in the coastal aquifers el raey 1997 decline in levels and flow rates of the nile river and its branches will cause a decrease of groundwater recharge and will consequently lower the piezometric levels within the adjacent aquifer systems masria 2017 based on the literature it is predicted that the mediterranean sea level will rise by values ranging between 0 07 and 0 36 m in 2050 0 09 and 0 69 m in 2080 and 0 30 and 0 80 m in 2100 elsharkawy et al 2009 global climate models forecasted that the rate of slr between 0 18 and 0 59 mm year will occur by the end of the 21st century el quilish 2019 a gis inundation model was developed to predict the inundated areas of the nile delta as a result of the slr of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m haggag et al 2013 patil et al 2020 measured the climate changes effects on groundwater recharge using visual modflow flex software wassef and schüttrumpf 2016 used gis and groundwater finite element numerical model feflow to simulate the groundwater salinity concentrations in the coastal aquifer west of the nile delta egypt six scenarios were driven in the model based on two different variables with time the impact of the expected changes in the mediterranean sea level and groundwater discharge in the period from 1990 to 2100 kahsay et al 2018 investigated the effects of climate changes such as precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration on groundwater recharge and base flow in tekeze sub catchment ethiopia the results showed an increasing trend in average temperature and evapotranspiration and a decreasing trend in annual rainfall high investments are spent in the long term for constructing large solar power plants so climate change impacts should be taken into account to help in technology selection energy output projections and aid in financial planning changes in the solar power plants are investigated for selecting best locations and technologies to complete new large scale interconnected plants changes in solar power csp and pv energy output maps are presented by calculating fractional contributions from insolation and temperature changes crook et al 2011 maintenance of solar collectors and pv panels depends on the location of the area whether it is arid or humid dust accumulation on solar collectors cells and pv panels is a major problem in arid regions while in humid areas precipitation cleans the panels by dust removal in addition large hail stones probably shatter pv panels and solar collectors crook et al 2011 in 2015 the international renewable energy agency irena produced an interactive pdf map for southern and eastern africa renewable energy zones searez this map contained locations of areas with high wind speed solar pv and concentrated solar power csp zones and estimated zones attributes required for the site selection process irena 2015 in this research a groundwater model was constructed using modflow gms software to simulate moghra aquifer system based on the available topographic climatic geological and hydrological data processed using arcgis the model was used to investigate scenarios of sustainable groundwater management applying solar energy for water pumping to cover the irrigation requirements of the target reclamation area considering the impacts of climate change mediterranean sea sea level rise and higher temperatures two main management scenarios are proposed as

required surface area for the pv plants will be determined under different temperature increase scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 moghra study area moghra region is one of the areas selected for the 1 5 million acres 6300 km2 land reclamation project in egypt it is located in the north eastern corner of the western desert on the western side of the nile delta covering an area of about 150 000 acres 630 km2 fig 1 the climate of the study area is long hot in summer and short warm in winter with low rainfall and high rates of evaporation youssef et al 2012 groundwater in moghra aquifer system flows towards qattara depression and its quality changes from highly saline water near the depression in the west to fresh water at wadi el natroun in the east water salinity within the aquifer ranges between 289 and 31 000 ppm abdel mogith et al 2013 in the present work the modelled area was defined based on 1 the best locations of solar plants determined using a gis based multi criteria analysis model sayed et al 2019 2 the locations of wells recommended by the ministry of irrigation and water resources for the 1 5 million acres project 2 2 collected data the collected data covers physical and hydrogeological settings of the study area as follows 2 2 1 geological setting the description of the litho stratigraphic units forming moghra aquifer system is shown by one of the lithologic sections fig 2 mwri 2016 and the geological cross section of moghra region fig 3 the moghra aquifer encountered well identified lithological units composed of sand and sandstone with intercalations of clay shale and siltstone of the lower miocene moghra formation table 1 moghra aquifer extends from rosetta nile branch in the east to qattara depression in the west and el fayoum depression in the south with a surface area of approximately 50 000 km2 dawoud et al 2005 2 2 2 topography the topography of the study area was defined using the digital elevation model dem produced using the elevation data obtained and processed from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data fig 4 2 2 3 depth to groundwater in moghra region the groundwater level ranges from 10 m m s l near to the nile delta in the east to about 50 m m s l at qattara depression in the west while it is 48 m m s l south of qattara depression abdel mogith et al 2013 depth to water has been generated using the dem and piezometric maps of the study area and illustrated in fig 5 showing that it ranges from 10 m to 386 m m s l regarding the recharge conditions moghra aquifer is recharged from the river nile in the east while those areas near to el moghra oasis and el qattara depression in the west are probably recharged through upward leakage under artesian conditions abdel mogith et al 2013 2 2 4 base of moghra aquifer the static level of moghra aquifer ranges from 63 m to 113 m m s l and its dynamic level varies from 410 m to 660 m m s l as illustrated in fig 6 abbas 2017 3 conceptual model modflow 10 3 6 under gms platform is used to construct a groundwater model for moghra aquifer to simulate the 3 dimensional anisotropic and heterogeneous flow bear 1979 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 as follows 1 δ δ x k x x δ h δ x δ δ y k y y δ h δ y δ δ z k z z δ h δ z s s δ h δ t w where kxx kyy and kzz are the hydraulic conductivities lt 1 in the x y and z directions respectively h is the potentiometric head l w is the volumetric flux per unit volume that represents sources and or sinks of water t 1 ss is the specific storage l 1 and t is the time t 3 1 model grid the modelled area is 58 000 km2 186 km in length and 312 km in width and is simulated by a grid with cell sizes of 1000 m 1000 m in the x and y directions in the z direction the modelled domain is represented by one layer with a thickness of 1000 m 3 2 boundary conditions based on the classification given by ezzat 1984 and abdel mogith et al 2013 two types of boundary conditions were applied to simulate the steady state conditions of the gw flow as shown in fig 7 1 dirichlet boundary condition type for the north eastern and south western boundaries with fixed head values of 0 and 80 m s l respectively 2 neumann boundary condition type for the north western and south eastern boundaries as no flow boundaries 3 3 hydrogeological characteristics from the previous work the hydraulic conductivity of moghra aquifer system varies between 0 2 and 100 m d and the porosity is estimated to be 0 3 youssef et al 2012 abdel mogith et al 2013 abbas 2017 where the aquifer is generally considered as an unconfined aquifer accordingly the storativity is replaced by the specific yield and a value of 0 2 was assigned for the transient conditions freeze and cherry 1979 3 4 model calibration the constructed moghra model was calibrated under the steady state conditions by justifying the hydraulic conductivity using the pest module of modflow the calibration process was based on minimizing the differences between computed and observed piezometric heads the calibrated model has a root mean square error rmse equal to 1 42 and the square of correlation coefficient r2 equal to 0 9978 that is an acceptable value as shown in fig 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 management scenarios 4 1 1 scenarios without climate change impacts the calibrated moghra model was used to investigate three management scenarios 3 well combinations 440 1000 and 1520 pumping wells running with a fixed pumping rate of 120 m3 h well for all scenarios the irrigation water rate was taken as 14 m3 acre day eud 2015 abbas 2017 the well operation time is fixed as 10 h d and the total test duration is 100 years fig 9 illustrates the drawdown breakthrough curves for the different management scenarios during 100 years test period the maximum drawdown and the total cultivated area for each scenario are presented in table 2 it was found that the best scenario is to pump water using 1000 wells with a total extraction of 120 000 m3 h serving a total area of 85 714 acres 360 km2 the value of maximum drawdown from this scenario is 91 94 m about 0 90 m year after 100 years this value is compatible with the recommendation of the ministry of irrigation and water resources mwri that the maximum drawdown should not exceed 1 0 m year 4 1 2 scenarios with climate change impacts 4 1 2 1 impact of sea level rise slr in addition to the three management scenarios presented above moghra model was used to investigate the impact of mediterranean slr of 1 0 m brown et al 2011 on the aquifer conditions during a100 years test period in order to investigate this scenario the model northern boundary along the sea shoreline was increased by 1 0 m the result of the slr simulation was compared with the model piezometric map under normal conditions figs 10 and 11 show the comparison between the two piezometric levels and it can be noticed that the piezometric levels are slightly affected due to the vast dimensions of the modelled aquifer the maximum drawdown after 100 years can be considered almost the same value occurring under normal conditions although the result of this scenario is positive the negative impact is that the salt water intrusion extent will increase within the aquifer due to the rise of sea water level this should be considered and investigated especially in the northern zones of the study area the increase in extent of sea water intrusion will cause deterioration of the groundwater quality that is an important parameter for the aquifer sustainable management in addition the expected 1 0 m rise of the sea level will cause a reduction of the thickness of freshwater storage by 40 m sherif and singh 1999 4 1 2 2 impact of temperature and evapotranspiration increase as a result of climate changes and impacts of global warming it is expected by 2060 an increase in temperature by 40c in cairo and by 3 1 4 70c in the rest of egypt brauch 2002 in desert areas evaporation rates depend on temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity fao 1986 blaney criddle is one of the theoretical approaches to determine crop consumptive use in the form of evapotranspiration et using only measured data on air temperature blaney criddle formula is expressed in equation 2 as follows blaney and criddle 1950 2 et 0 p 0 46 t mean 8 13 where et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day as an average for one month tmean is the average daily temperature in c p is the average percentage of annual daytime hours per day fao 1986 for moghra region where the latitude is around 30 n the average p value can be taken as 0 3 fao 1986 also the air temperature for moghra region varies between 13 4 and 28 2 c and the average temperature is 21 2 c elreefelmasry 2017 due to climate changes it is noticed that the mean annual temperature changed significantly at cairo port said and alexandria with an increase of 1 887 c 0 979 c and 0 765 c respectively during the period between

hydrologeolgic conditions the model was used to explore the impacts of climate changes sea level rise slr by 1 0 m and temperature increase by 2 0c and 40 c on the management scenarios in addition the required power for water management after 5 10 50 and 100 years were determined it was concluded that the best management scenario is to use 1000 wells to extract 1 2 mm3 d of water for serving a total area of 85 714 acres 360 km2 this scenario satisfies the project criteria that permits a maximum drawdown less than 1 m year it was also concluded that slr has mild effects on groundwater levels

climate changes egypt set many ambitious reclamation projects in desert lands to create new communities out of the highly populated nile valley and delta to fulfil the local increasing needs for food in egypt groundwater is one of the main water resources after the nile river it is the main source to fulfil the water requirements for new reclamation lands in egyptian deserts solar energy is one of the most efficient renewable energy sources needed for water pumping and supply climate changes may lead to longer droughts periods and consequently affect negatively the potentiality of groundwater sustainable management of the aquifer systems is essential to ensure the safe exploitation of the available water storage all management scenarios should be planned and investigated to protect the aquifer systems considering both quantity and quality aspects the national project for reclaiming 1 5 million acres in the egyptian deserts has been planned depending on the groundwater potential in the aquifer systems nwrc 2017 as most areas of this national project are located at a distance from the nile valley and delta the power required for groundwater extraction should be covered by renewable energy wind and solar energy systems in the western desert the most reliable renewable energy source is the solar energy where 200 mw is the target amount of solar energy to be generated solar atlas of egypt 2018 this evaluation stems from the high value of solar radiation as well as the significant number of sun shining days per year photovoltaic pv plants are the most sustainable and environment friendly system with low pollution emissions sahin and rehman 2012 in average egypt has 9 11 h of sunshine day throughout the year and only few cloudy days due to its location that has

the 1 5 million acres 6300 km2 land reclamation project in egypt it is located in the north eastern corner of the western desert on the western side of the nile delta covering an area of about 150 000 acres 630 km2 fig 1 the climate of the study area is long hot in summer and short warm in winter with low rainfall and high rates of evaporation youssef et al 2012 groundwater in moghra aquifer system flows towards qattara depression and its quality changes from highly saline water near the depression in the west to fresh water at wadi el natroun in the east water salinity within the aquifer ranges between 289 and 31 000 ppm abdel mogith et al 2013 in the present work the modelled area was defined based on 1 the best locations of solar plants determined using a gis based multi criteria analysis

clay shale and siltstone of the lower miocene moghra formation table 1 moghra aquifer extends from rosetta nile branch in the east to qattara depression in the west and el fayoum depression in the south with a surface area of approximately 50 000 km2 dawoud et al 2005 2 2 2 topography the topography of the study area was defined using the digital elevation model dem produced using the elevation

the east to about 50 m m s l at qattara depression in the west while it is 48 m m s l south of qattara depression abdel mogith et al 2013 depth to water has been generated using the dem and piezometric maps of the study area and illustrated in fig 5 showing that it ranges from 10 m to 386 m m s l regarding the recharge conditions moghra aquifer is recharged from the river nile in the east while those areas near to el moghra oasis and el qattara depression in the west are probably recharged through upward leakage under artesian conditions abdel mogith et al 2013 2 2 4 base of moghra aquifer the static level of moghra aquifer ranges from 63 m to 113 m m s l and its dynamic level varies from 410 m to 660 m m s l as illustrated in fig 6 abbas 2017 3 conceptual model modflow

system varies between 0 2 and 100 m d and the porosity is estimated to be 0 3 youssef et al 2012 abdel mogith et al 2013 abbas 2017 where the aquifer is generally considered as an unconfined aquifer accordingly the storativity is replaced by the specific yield and a value of 0 2 was assigned for the transient conditions freeze and cherry 1979 3 4 model calibration the constructed moghra model was calibrated under the steady state conditions by justifying the hydraulic conductivity using the pest module of modflow the calibration process was based on minimizing the differences between computed and observed piezometric heads the calibrated model has a root mean square error rmse equal to 1 42 and the square of correlation coefficient r2 equal to 0 9978 that is an acceptable value as shown in fig 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 management scenarios 4 1 1 scenarios without climate change impacts the calibrated moghra model was used to investigate three management scenarios 3 well combinations 440 1000 and 1520 pumping wells running with a fixed pumping rate of 120 m3 h well for all scenarios the irrigation water rate was taken as 14 m3 acre day eud 2015 abbas 2017 the well operation time is fixed as 10 h d and the total test duration is 100 years fig 9 illustrates the drawdown breakthrough curves for the different management scenarios during 100 years test period the maximum drawdown and the total cultivated area for each scenario are presented in table 2 it was found that the best scenario is to pump water using 1000 wells with a total extraction of 120 000 m3 h serving a total area of 85 714 acres 360 km2 the value of maximum drawdown from this scenario is 91 94 m about 0 90 m year after 100 years this value is compatible with the recommendation of the ministry of irrigation and water resources mwri that the maximum drawdown should not exceed 1 0 m year 4 1 2 scenarios with climate change impacts 4 1 2 1 impact of sea level rise slr in addition to the three management scenarios presented above moghra model was used to investigate the impact of mediterranean slr of 1 0 m brown et al 2011 on the aquifer conditions during a100 years test period in order to investigate this scenario the model northern boundary along the sea shoreline was increased by 1 0 m the result of the slr simulation was compared with the model piezometric map under normal conditions figs 10 and 11 show the comparison between the two piezometric levels and it can be noticed that the piezometric levels are slightly affected due to the vast dimensions of the modelled aquifer the maximum drawdown after 100 years can be considered almost the same value occurring under normal conditions although the result of this scenario is positive the negative impact is that the salt water intrusion extent will increase within the aquifer due to the rise of sea water level this should be considered and investigated especially in the northern zones of the study area the increase in extent of sea water intrusion will cause deterioration of the groundwater quality that is an important parameter for the aquifer sustainable management in addition the expected 1 0 m rise of the sea level will cause a reduction of the thickness of freshwater storage by 40 m sherif and singh 1999 4 1 2 2 impact of temperature and evapotranspiration increase as a result of climate

dehnavi et al 2011 ogundana and talabi 2014 ado ekiti area southwestern nigeria is situated on basement terrain where aquiferous units are limited to the weathered overburden zones and fracture systems talabi and tijani 2013 bayowa et al 2014 differential weathering always set in because of the existence of rocks with variable competency consequently different dissolved constituents that invariably find their ways into the groundwater system of the environment ensued the population of ado ekiti and environ was 156 122 in 1991 and 313 690 in 2006 national population commision 2006 national population commission 1991 2006 the population projection for 2016 was 427 700 from the growth in population it was an obvious issue that anthropogenic activities would have increased along

geogenic source of groundwater constituents anthropogenic activities arisen mainly from indiscriminate waste dumps open defecations agricultural activities and effluents from motor mechanic workshops talabi and ogundana 2014 constitute major sources of constituents that pose threats to the groundwater of the study area the composition of groundwater is therefore a function of both natural hydrogeochemical processes as well as anthropogenic activities and that the type extent and duration of anthropogenic activities may have impacted the groundwater quality since groundwater composition is a product of geology and human activities many studies including pawar et al 2014 mcgrane 2016 naveen et al 2017 rivera et al 2017 have examined groundwater in relation to geology in urban

2017 at least 25 urban dwellers in developing countries do not have access to water of excellent quality and improved sanitation ado ekiti area is not an exception in that most shallow wells dried up during dry season exposing over 40 of the populace to endless search for potable water talabi and ogundana 2014 worked on the bacteriological evaluation of groundwater in ekiti state and concluded

quartzite the older granite and charnockite the older granite and charnockite got intruded into the pre existing rocks migmatite and quartzite during the pan african orogeny physical characteristics of groundwater in the study area table 1 indicated that 11 wells were not lined three 3 and eight 8 of the unlined wells are found on the porphyritic granite and migmatite respectively most of the wells were covered on cement grouting and supplying clean water in appearance the ph of water samples was weakly alkaline with mean value of 7 16 of water from the granitic terrain and 7 10 of water from the migmatite the ph is within approved who 2011 standard for drinking water the turbidity of the groundwater ranged from 0 00 to 33 00ntu av 4 35ntu on migmatitic terrain 0 8ntu av 3 73ntu on porphyritic granite and 0 00 to 1 00ntu av 1 00ntu on fine grained granite drinking water should have a turbidity of 5ntu davis and robert 2002 all the turbidity values fell within the 5 ntu accepted limit except in few locations 6 out of 30 where the values were higher fig 2 turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by suspended solids that are usually invisible to the naked eye though the occurrence of turbidity is location specific indicating the presence of inorganic particulate matter and non soluble metal oxides de giglio et al 2018 mitigation measures could include use of variable speed pumps automatic pumping to waste blending or engineered solutions consumption of groundwater with turbidity above approved standard may constitute a health risk which may inhibit the action of disinfectants thereby protecting the pathogens singh et al 2013 tiwari and singh 2014 the average groundwater values of ec μs cm tds mg l and th mg l on porphyritic granite terrain were 421 11 315 85 and 133 92 respectively fine grained granite 412 00 309 00 and 146 50 respectively while the values on migmatite terrains respectively were 206 77 155 08 and 133 12 table 1 all mean values of ec μs cm tds mg l and th mg l fell within approved standard of who 2011 indicating the suitability of the groundwater for drinking fig 3 however the total hardness th is the degree to which water prevents the lather formation with soap and level to which the boiling point of water is increased hardness of the water is the property attributed to the presence of alkaline earths water can be classified into soft 75 mg l moderately hard 75 150 mg l hard 150 300 mg l and very hard 300 mg l based on hardness sawyer and mcmarthy 1967 based on this classification 22 8 from pg 1 from fg and 13 from mg out of the 30 sampled groundwater fell into moderately hard water while the remaining 8 3 from pg 1 from fg and 4 from mg samples were in hard water category however mcgowan 2000 classified water with hardness 60 mg l as soft high hardness may cause encrustation on water supply distribution systems while long term consumption of extremely hard water might lead to an increased incidence of urolithiasis anencephaly parental mortality some types of cancer and cardio vascular disorders agrawal and jagetia 1997 in general the values of ec and tds to some extent reflected the strength characteristics of the rocks where the strength order is migmatite fine grained granite porphyritic granite the rock with least strength will weather faster and therefore more tds this assertion was in conformity with the research of talabi 2015 in which the weathering intensity of meta igneous rocks in parts of the basement terrains of southwestern nigeria was in the order of granite migmatite charnockite the bacteriological evaluation revealed that e coli cfu 100 ml ranged from 0 00 to 10 av 2 27 on porphyritic granite terrain 1 00 to 2 00 av 1 5 on fine grained granite while on migmatite terrain it ranged between 0 00 and 13 av 5 41 table 1 the result indicated values above who 2011 recommended standard for drinking water except in few locations 2 each on porphyritic granite and migmatite where the e coli were 0 00 cfu 100 ml as for the total bacteria counts tbc cfu 100 ml all groundwater samples tested positive with mean values of 12 36 14 00 and 3 00 on porphyritic granite fine grained granite and migmatite respectively all tbc values were above who 2011 approved standard and rendered the groundwater unpotable fig 4 5 major ion chemistry among the major anions in porphyritic granite terrain considering the mean concentration chloride 51 46 mg l was generally dominant and representing on average 52 42 meq of the total anions this was followed by bicarbonate representing on an average 29 61 of the total anions sulphate and nitrate were less dominant ions contributing 14 53 and 3 37 to the total anions respectively phosphate was insignificantly low representing the least dominant anion of the total anions as for the fine grained granite terrain the percentage representations of the anions were cl 59 22 hco3 23 40 so4 2 15 18 and no3 2 09 phosphate concentration was insignificant and negligible in the migmatite terrain the anions concentrations were cl 43 84 hco3 41 35 so4 2 12 92 and no3 1 88 in general the order of anions abundance in the groundwater was found to be cl hco3 so4 2 no3 po4 3 table 2 fig 5 as for the major cations in porphyritic granite fine grained granite and migmatite terrains ca2 was the dominant ions representing on the average 38 72 46 95 and 37 47 respectively of total cations in order of abundance na closely follow ca2 representing 36 86 36 30 and 30 46 respectively the cations mg2 and k were of secondary importance the mg2 had percentage representations on the average of total cations 14 30 13 72 and 16 28 on porphyritic granite fine grained granite and migmatite respectively in the same order of lithology k percentage representations were 10 12 8 87 and 9 95 respectively the order of cations abundance was ca2 na mg2 k table 2 fig 5 suitability of the groundwater for chemical potability was carried out by comparing the concentrations of the chemical parameters with who 2011 approved standard all chemical parameters have values that fell below the who 2011 approved standard hence the groundwater in the study area is chemically potable 6 groundwater characterization of the study area groundwater characterization constitutes one of the vital tools for sustainable groundwater development and management to characterize the groundwater in this study the major ionic species obtained from the hydrochemical analyses were projected graphically on the piper trilinear diagram and the schoeller graph piper 1944 hem 1985 respectively using origin software the schoeller diagram schoeller 1967 is a semi logarithmic diagram developed to represent major ion analyses in meq l and to demonstrate different hydrochemical water types on the same diagram this type of graphical representation has the advantage that unlike the trilinear diagrams actual sample concentrations is displayed and compared with similar waters exhibiting similar fingerprints results of the schoeller diagram fig 6 revealed the following cations order of distribution in the groundwater of the study area ca2 na mg2 k and anions of the order cl hco3 so4 2 no3 the diagram clearly signified dominance of ca mg cl and ca mg hco3 waters the piper diagram plots the major ions as percentages of milliequivalents in two base triangles the total cations and the total anions are set equal to 100 and the data points in the two triangles are projected onto an adjacent diamond grid this plot reveals useful properties and relationships for large sample groups the main purpose of the piper diagram is to show clustering of data points to indicate samples that have similar compositions in this study the hydrochemical facies fig 7 include mixed ca mg cl so4 water 22 samples representing 73 33 cacl type 5 samples representing 16 67 and cahco3 water 3 samples representing 10 the piper diagram clearly revealed the dominance of mixed exchange water type ca mg cl so4 in addition the alkaline earth metals ca and mg exceeded alkali metals na and k this indicated that weak acids exceeded strong acids indicating weak acids dominance of the water chemistry of the groundwater in the study area this type of scenario indicated geogenic as the main source of the ions in the groundwater source of ions in the groundwater of the study area further evaluation of the sources of various ions in the groundwater of the study area employing a plot of the tds against na na ca2 ratio fig 8 showed that the groundwater has modified its chemistry principally from the weathered materials derived from the underlying bedrocks the gibbs 1970 diagram indicated that 63 33 of the groundwater samples representing 19 out of total 30 samples were in the rock dominant category while the 20 6 sample and 16 67 5 samples fell in the dilution and weathering fields respectively 6 1 irrigation quality assessment knowledge of irrigation water quality is critical to understanding agricultural management for long term productivity excellent to good irrigation water can influence crop productivity more than soil fertility hybrid weed control and other agricultural strategies that may be employed by soil scientists the irrigation water quality assessment in this research is judged by employing some irrigation determining factors which include sodium absorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium carbonate rsc electrical conductivity ec richards 1954 magnesium adsorption ratio mar hazards kelly s ratio kr and permeability index pi the summary of the estimated irrigation quality indices employed in this study is presented in table 3 electrical conductivity measured as salinity hazard is one of the most influential water quality guideline on crop productivity the primary effect of high ec water on crop productivity is physiological drought the plant is unable to compete with ions in the soil solution for water the higher the ec the less water is available to plants even though the soil may appear wet this is due to the fact that useable plant water in the soil solution decreases dramatically as ec increases electrical conductivity ec wilcox 1955 cited in jeyaseelan et al 2013 classified irrigation quality evaluation as follows excellent 100 250 μs cm good 250 750 μs cm doubtful 750 2250 μs cm and unsuitable 2250 μs cm the ec in this study ranged from 35 73 to 821 33 μs cm with 12 samples 40 in excellent category 17 samples 56 67 and 1 sample 3 33 in the doubtful class the result indicated that the groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation furthermore the estimated sar range of 0 21 2 25 indicated values of less than 10 signifying good irrigation water suitable on all agricultural soils mandel and shiftan 1991 the application of water with a sodium imbalance can further reduce yield under certain soil texture conditions despite the fact that plant growth is primarily limited by the salinity ec level of the irrigation water reductions in water infiltration can occur when irrigation water contains high sodium relative to the calcium and magnesium contents a high salt content high ec in water leads to formation of saline soil while high sodium content sar leads to development of an alkaline soil khodapanah et al 2009 based on us salinity laboratory classification 1954 a plot of salinity hazard ec against sodium hazard fig 9 for groundwater samples in the study area is classified into two classes low c1 and medium c2 indicating that the groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation other parameters also indicated that the groundwater was suitable for irrigation with rsbc ranging from 3 61 0 97 pi 9 76 69 95 mar 11 26 78 80 while kr ranged from 0 29 to 2 26 kelly ratio 1 is suitable for irrigation on all soils while kr 1 is unsuitable kelly et al 1940 cited in jeyaseelan et al 2013 eighteen samples 60 of the water samples in this study have kr 1 and therefore suitable for irrigation while the remaining 12 samples 40 are unsuitable there were no significant variations within rock units in the parameters however significant variation was observed in respect of ssp in which the values ranged between 12 80 and 46 76 in migmatites from 19 16 to 22 03 in fine grained granite and 8 71 46 84 in porphyritic granite irrigation waters having ssp values more than 50 are considered unsuitable shah and mistry 2013 in this present research all ssp values fell below 50 and the groundwater is suitable for irrigation according to the us department of agriculture water having more than 2 5 epm of rsbc is not suitable for irrigation purposes all the groundwater samples of the study area had rsbc 2 5epm indicating that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation purposes water can be categorized into class i ii and iii based on pi values nagaraju et al 2006 class i signifies excellent irrigation water with 75 and class ii waters are categorized as good for irrigation with 25 pi 75 while class iii waters are unsuitable with pi 25 doneen 1964 cited in bhat et al 2018 excess mg in water affects soils by increasing their salinity and shifting the normal equilibrium between calcium and magnesium which may adversely affect crop yields joshi et al 2009 the values of the magnesium adsorption ratio of groundwater in this study ranged from 11 26 to 77 80 with 22 samples out of 30 representing 73 33 of the water samples fell within the acceptable limit of 50 ayers and westcot 1985 thus 26 67 of the water was unsuitable for irrigation since their magnesium adsorption ratio were higher than 50 and as such will have harmful effect to soil 7 conclusions this research established the quality characteristics of shallow groundwater in ado ekiti area southwestern nigeria it was discovered that the ph of the shallow groundwater was weakly alkaline though still within the range of approved standard for drinking water all other physical parameters ec μs cm tds mg l and turbidity ntu indicated that the groundwater in the study area was fresh and potable water hardness indicated that majority of the groundwater 73 33 were in the moderately hard water category while the remaining 26 67 fell into the hard water class the abundance of major anions and cations were in the following orders cl hco3 so4 2 no3 po4 3 ca2 na mg2 k respectively in addition rock units influenced the dissolution order of the ions with more ions dissolved in porphyritic granite closely followed by fine grained granite while migmatite had the least all sampled water tested positive to bacteriological analysis and rendered the groundwater unsuitable for drinking except when treated characterization of groundwater of the study area revealed the dominance of mixed exchange water type ca mg cl so4 with cacl and cahco3 water types in the minority irrigation quality evaluation revealed that the groundwater was suitable for irrigation the groundwater of the study area was low mineralized with low residence time chemically potable but bacteriologically infected rock types have significant influence on the ionic concentrations of the groundwater with more dissolved ions occurring in porphyritic granite declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts

quartzite the older granite and charnockite the older granite and charnockite got intruded into the pre existing rocks migmatite and quartzite during the pan african orogeny physical characteristics of groundwater in the study area table 1 indicated that 11 wells were not lined three 3 and eight 8 of the unlined wells are found on the porphyritic granite and migmatite respectively most of the wells were covered on cement grouting and supplying clean water in appearance the ph of water samples was weakly alkaline with mean value of 7 16 of water from the granitic terrain and 7 10 of water from the migmatite the ph is within approved who 2011 standard for drinking water the turbidity of the groundwater ranged from 0 00 to 33 00ntu av 4 35ntu on migmatitic terrain 0 8ntu av 3 73ntu on porphyritic granite and 0 00 to 1 00ntu av 1 00ntu on fine grained granite drinking water should have a turbidity of 5ntu davis and robert 2002 all the turbidity values fell within the 5 ntu accepted limit except in few locations 6 out of 30 where the values were higher fig 2 turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by suspended solids that are usually invisible to the naked eye though the occurrence of turbidity is location specific indicating the presence of inorganic particulate matter and non soluble metal oxides de giglio et al 2018 mitigation measures could include use of variable speed pumps automatic pumping to waste blending or engineered solutions consumption of groundwater with turbidity above approved standard may constitute a health risk which may inhibit the action of disinfectants thereby protecting the pathogens singh et al 2013 tiwari and singh 2014 the average groundwater values of ec μs cm tds mg l and th mg l on porphyritic granite terrain were 421 11 315 85 and 133 92 respectively fine grained granite 412 00 309 00 and 146 50 respectively while the values on migmatite terrains respectively were 206 77 155 08 and 133 12 table 1 all mean values of ec μs cm tds mg l and th mg l fell within approved standard of who 2011 indicating the suitability of the groundwater for drinking fig 3 however the total hardness th is the degree to which water prevents the lather formation with soap and level to which the boiling point of water is increased hardness of the water is the property attributed to the presence of alkaline earths water can be classified into soft 75 mg l moderately hard 75 150 mg l hard 150 300 mg l and very hard 300 mg l based on hardness sawyer and mcmarthy 1967 based on this classification 22 8 from pg 1 from fg and 13 from mg out of the 30 sampled groundwater fell into moderately hard water while the remaining 8 3 from pg 1 from fg and 4 from mg samples were in hard water category however mcgowan 2000 classified water with hardness 60 mg l as soft high hardness may cause encrustation on water supply distribution systems while long term consumption of extremely hard water might lead to an increased incidence of urolithiasis anencephaly parental mortality some types of cancer and cardio vascular disorders agrawal and jagetia 1997 in general the values of ec and tds to some extent reflected the strength characteristics of the rocks where the strength order is migmatite fine grained granite porphyritic granite the rock with least strength will weather faster and therefore more tds this assertion was in conformity with the research of talabi 2015 in which the weathering intensity of meta igneous rocks in parts of the basement terrains of southwestern nigeria was in the order of granite migmatite charnockite the bacteriological evaluation revealed that e coli cfu 100 ml ranged from 0 00 to 10 av 2 27 on porphyritic granite terrain 1 00 to 2 00 av 1 5 on fine grained granite while on migmatite terrain it ranged between 0 00 and 13 av 5 41 table 1 the result indicated values above who 2011 recommended standard for drinking water except in few locations 2 each on porphyritic granite and migmatite where the e coli were 0 00 cfu 100 ml as for the total bacteria counts tbc cfu 100 ml all groundwater samples tested positive with mean values of 12 36 14 00 and 3 00 on porphyritic granite fine grained granite and migmatite respectively all tbc values were above who 2011 approved standard and rendered the groundwater unpotable fig 4 5 major ion chemistry among the major anions in porphyritic granite terrain considering the mean concentration chloride 51 46 mg l was generally dominant and representing on average 52 42 meq of the total anions this was followed by bicarbonate representing on an average 29 61 of the total anions sulphate and nitrate were less dominant ions contributing 14 53 and 3 37 to the total anions respectively phosphate was insignificantly low representing the least dominant anion of the total anions as for the fine grained granite terrain the percentage representations of the anions were cl 59 22 hco3 23 40 so4 2 15 18 and no3 2 09 phosphate concentration was insignificant and negligible in the migmatite terrain the anions concentrations were cl 43 84 hco3 41 35 so4 2 12 92 and no3 1 88 in general the order of anions abundance in the groundwater was found to be cl hco3 so4 2 no3 po4 3 table 2 fig 5 as for the major cations in porphyritic granite fine grained granite and migmatite terrains ca2 was the dominant ions representing on the average 38 72 46 95 and 37 47 respectively of total cations in order of abundance na closely follow ca2 representing 36 86 36 30 and 30 46 respectively the cations mg2 and k were of secondary importance the mg2 had percentage representations on the average of total cations 14 30 13 72 and 16 28 on porphyritic granite fine grained granite and migmatite respectively in the same order of lithology k percentage representations were 10 12 8 87 and 9 95 respectively the order of cations abundance was ca2 na mg2 k table 2 fig 5 suitability of the groundwater for chemical potability was carried out by comparing the concentrations of the chemical parameters with who 2011 approved standard all chemical parameters have values that fell below the who 2011 approved standard hence the groundwater in the study area is chemically potable 6 groundwater characterization of the study area groundwater characterization constitutes one of the vital tools for sustainable groundwater development and management to characterize the groundwater in this study the major ionic species obtained from the hydrochemical analyses were projected graphically on the piper trilinear diagram and the schoeller graph piper 1944 hem 1985 respectively using origin software the schoeller diagram schoeller 1967 is a semi logarithmic diagram developed to represent major ion analyses in meq l and to demonstrate different hydrochemical water types on the same diagram this type of graphical representation has the advantage that unlike the trilinear diagrams actual sample concentrations is displayed and compared with similar waters exhibiting similar fingerprints results of the schoeller diagram fig 6 revealed the following cations order of distribution in the groundwater of the study area ca2 na mg2 k and anions of the order cl hco3 so4 2 no3 the diagram clearly signified dominance of ca mg cl and ca mg hco3 waters the piper diagram plots the major ions as percentages of milliequivalents in two base triangles the total cations and the total anions are set equal to 100 and the data points in the two triangles are projected onto an adjacent diamond grid this plot reveals useful properties and relationships for large sample groups the main purpose of the piper diagram is to show clustering of data points to indicate samples that have similar compositions in this study the hydrochemical facies fig 7 include mixed ca mg cl so4 water 22 samples representing 73 33 cacl type 5 samples representing 16 67 and cahco3 water 3 samples representing 10 the piper diagram clearly revealed the dominance of mixed exchange water type ca mg cl so4 in addition the alkaline earth metals ca and mg exceeded alkali metals na and k this indicated that weak acids exceeded strong acids indicating weak acids dominance of the water chemistry of the groundwater in the study area this type of scenario indicated geogenic as the main source of the ions in the groundwater source of ions in the groundwater of the study area further evaluation of the sources of various ions in the groundwater of the study area employing a plot of the tds against na na ca2 ratio fig 8 showed that the groundwater has modified its chemistry principally from the weathered materials derived from the underlying bedrocks the gibbs 1970 diagram indicated that 63 33 of the groundwater samples representing 19 out of total 30 samples were in the rock dominant category while the 20 6 sample and 16 67 5 samples fell in the dilution and weathering fields respectively 6 1 irrigation quality assessment knowledge of irrigation water quality is critical to understanding agricultural management for long term productivity excellent to good irrigation water can influence crop productivity more than soil fertility hybrid weed control and other agricultural strategies that may be employed by soil scientists the irrigation water quality assessment in this research is judged by employing some irrigation determining factors which include sodium absorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium carbonate rsc electrical conductivity ec richards 1954 magnesium adsorption ratio mar hazards kelly s ratio kr and permeability index pi the summary of the estimated irrigation quality indices employed in this study is presented in table 3 electrical conductivity measured as salinity hazard is one of the most influential water quality guideline on crop productivity the primary effect of high ec water on crop productivity is physiological drought the plant is unable to compete with ions in the soil solution for water the higher the ec the less water is available to plants even though the soil may appear wet this is due to the fact that useable plant water in the soil solution decreases dramatically as ec increases electrical conductivity ec wilcox 1955 cited in jeyaseelan et al 2013 classified irrigation quality evaluation as follows excellent 100 250 μs cm good 250 750 μs cm doubtful 750 2250 μs cm and unsuitable 2250 μs cm the ec in this study ranged from 35 73 to 821 33 μs cm with 12 samples 40 in excellent category 17 samples 56 67 and 1 sample 3 33 in the doubtful class the result indicated that the groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation furthermore the estimated sar range of 0 21 2 25 indicated values of less than 10 signifying good irrigation water suitable on all agricultural soils mandel and shiftan 1991 the application of water with a sodium imbalance can further reduce yield under certain soil texture conditions despite the fact that plant growth is primarily limited by the salinity ec level of the irrigation water reductions in water infiltration can occur when irrigation water contains high sodium relative to the calcium and magnesium contents a high salt content high ec in water leads to formation of saline soil while high sodium content sar leads to development of an alkaline soil khodapanah et al 2009 based on us salinity laboratory classification 1954 a plot of salinity hazard ec against sodium hazard fig 9 for groundwater samples in the study area is classified into two classes low c1 and medium c2 indicating that the groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation other parameters also indicated that the groundwater was suitable for irrigation with rsbc ranging from 3 61 0 97 pi 9 76 69 95 mar 11 26 78 80 while kr ranged from 0 29 to 2 26 kelly ratio 1 is suitable for irrigation on all soils while kr 1 is unsuitable kelly et al 1940 cited in jeyaseelan et al 2013 eighteen samples 60 of the water samples in this study have kr 1 and therefore suitable for irrigation while the remaining 12 samples 40 are unsuitable there were no significant variations within rock units in the parameters however significant variation was observed in respect of ssp in which the values ranged between 12 80 and 46 76 in migmatites from 19 16 to 22 03 in fine grained granite and 8 71 46 84 in porphyritic granite irrigation waters having ssp values more than 50 are considered unsuitable shah and mistry 2013 in this present research all ssp values fell below 50 and the groundwater is suitable for irrigation according to the us department of agriculture water having more than 2 5 epm of rsbc is not suitable for irrigation purposes all the groundwater samples of the study area had rsbc 2 5epm indicating that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation purposes water can be categorized into class i ii and iii based on pi values nagaraju et al 2006 class i signifies excellent irrigation water with 75 and class ii waters are categorized as good for irrigation with 25 pi 75 while class iii waters are unsuitable with pi 25 doneen 1964 cited in bhat et al 2018 excess mg in water affects soils by increasing their salinity and shifting the normal equilibrium between calcium and magnesium which may adversely affect crop yields joshi et al 2009 the values of the magnesium adsorption ratio of groundwater in this study ranged from 11 26 to 77 80 with 22 samples out of 30 representing 73 33 of the water samples fell within the acceptable limit of 50 ayers and westcot 1985 thus 26 67 of the water was unsuitable for irrigation since their magnesium adsorption ratio were higher than 50 and as such will have harmful effect to soil 7 conclusions this research established the quality characteristics of shallow groundwater in ado ekiti area southwestern nigeria it was discovered that the ph of the shallow groundwater was weakly alkaline though still within the range of approved standard for drinking water all other physical parameters ec μs cm tds mg l and turbidity ntu indicated that the groundwater in the study area was fresh and potable water hardness indicated that majority of the groundwater 73 33 were in the moderately hard water category while the remaining 26 67 fell into the hard water class the abundance of major anions and cations were in the following orders cl hco3 so4 2 no3 po4 3 ca2 na mg2 k respectively in addition rock units influenced the dissolution order of the ions with more ions dissolved in porphyritic granite closely followed by fine grained granite while migmatite had the least all sampled water tested positive to bacteriological analysis and rendered the groundwater unsuitable for drinking except when treated characterization of groundwater of the study area revealed the dominance of mixed exchange water type ca mg cl so4 with cacl and cahco3 water types in the minority irrigation quality evaluation revealed that the groundwater was suitable for irrigation the groundwater of the study area was low mineralized with low residence time chemically potable but bacteriologically infected rock types have significant influence on the ionic concentrations of the groundwater with more dissolved ions occurring in porphyritic granite declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts

3 7 are illustrated in table 1 based on the experimental and predicted results a quadratic equation was quadratic regression modeling was operated between the response of the corresponding coded values of four variables and an empirical equation was obtained as 3 r 1 40 54 1 38 a 13 61 b 9 41 c 9 91 d 0 027 ab 0 19 ac 0 095 ad 3 80 bc 3 32 bd 4 45 cd 2 67 a 2 1 03 b 2 3 56 c 2 7 57 d 2 in eq 3 a negative sign suggests an antagonistic effect whereas a positive sign indicates a synergistic effect pezoti junior et al 2014 as shown in equation 3 the mg concentration b and ph d are positive this indicates that the photodegradation of mg by pact γ fe2o3 can be improved when these factors are increased the significance of each coefficient was evaluated by a higher f value and smaller p value a fairly high correlation between the experimental and predicted response suggests the adequacy of the quadratic model setiabudi et al 2016 3 3 analysis of variance anova anova is a statistical technique that subdivides the total variation in a set of data into component part associated with specific source of variation for the purpose of testing hypothesis on the parameter of the model anova helps in prediction of significant and non significant factors on the basis of p and f values using fisher s null hypothesis method ahmad and hasan 2016 adequacy of model is confirmed by higher f value while p value 0 05 indicate that model terms are significant in this model the f value is 5 47 and p value is 0 0011 which is less than 0 05 justifying the significance of model the p value of lack of fit lof is greater than 0 05 which suggest that the model is statistically not significant marrakchi et al 2017 it is clear from anova that statistically irrelevant terms having p value greater that 0 05 were deleted from the quadratic equation based on the valued of t and p to achieve a more précised response surface model adequate precision ap value of 9 875 in quadratic regression model imputed an adequate signal of photodegradation of mg on pact γ fe2o3 the magnitude of the model was analyzed by the values of correlation coefficient r2 and r2adj the correlation coefficient r2 is used to measure how good the model predicts response value based on the outcomes concluded by anova the values of r2 and r2adj were found to be 0 83 and 0 68 given in table 2 respectively see table 3 4 r 1 40 54 13 61 b 9 41 c 9 91 d 7 57 d 2 a plot of experimental versus calculated values of removal indicates good fit shown in fig 4 b and presence of linear relationship between them with high correlation coefficient indicates the normal distribution of error around the mean and good applicability of model for the explanation of experimental data these plots are required to check the normality assumption in fitted model fig 4 a shows residual plot versus run numbers the random pattern of residual would indicate the model adequacy the diagram demonstrates a well conveyance of points along straight line with the estimations of r2 and r2adj as 0 83 and 0 68 separately 3 4 three dimensional response surface plot and their interpretation 3d surface plots are the graphical portrayal of regression equation delineating the synchronous impact of two variable on adsorption while letting other variables steady ahmad and hasan 2016 3d surface plots of interaction effect of variable on removal efficiency of mg are given in fig 5 a d fig 5 a account to the 3d surface plot for simultaneous effect of concentration and time on the removal efficiency of mg while holding the catalyst dose at 0 75 g and temperature 318 k from fig 5 a an increase in percent efficiency of mg dye was observed when concentration of mg increases from 30 to 60 mg l 1 with an increase in time from 120 to 180 min further increase in mg concentration leads to decrease in percent removal due to saturation of adsorbent sites by mg molecules at a limited concentration shakeel et al 2014 thus an optimized mg concentration of 60 mg l 1 was used for all the adsorption isotherms kinetic and thermodynamic studies similarly from fig 5 b it can be seen that the adsorption limit of mg increments as ph increased from 4 to 6 and after that decline somewhat with the further increment of ph esteems at ph 4 0 h ions emulated with mg cationic dye for the available active sites on the exterior surface of the adsorbent which would impede the reach of mg due to the repulsion forces hence the evacuation of mg was the less presumably because of the elevated rivalry of proton with mg dye for surface active sites as the ph of the solution further increases the concentration of h ions in the solvent medium decrease that accelerates adsorption of mg increases higher adsorption rate at high ph imply that mg interact with adsorbent via chelating mechanism with carboxylic and hydroxyl groups of the adsorbent until a maximum yield is reached at ph 6 0 a decrease in adsorption rate was observed which may be attributed to participation of the mg with hydroxides nekouei and nekouei 2018 fig 5 c constitute the 3d interactive plot between adsorbent dose and mg concentration with respect to removal efficiency of mg as it can be seen increasing the concentration from 30 to 60 mg l 1 increases the dye removal efficiency while the increase in adsorbent dose restricts the removal efficiency suggesting that mg concentration has a synergistic effect while adsorbent dose has an antagonistic effect fig 5 d represent the 3d surface plot for interaction effect of ph and adsorbent dose on the removal efficiency of mg while holding the time at 170 28 min mg concentration 60 mg l 1 and temperature 318 k as can be seen increasing adsorbent dose from 0 75 g to 1 25 g with an increase in ph decreases the removal efficiency for mg this behavior can be explained as adsorbent dose increases the number of adsorbent particles also increases facilitating more active sites for adsorption however as the amount of adsorbent increases effective surface area and adsorbate adsorbent ratio reduces resulting in less mg uptake the purpose of the present study was to optimize the four variables that affect the adsorption of mg on pam chitosan γ fe2o3 obtained results clearly indicates that the optimum values of radiation time 170 28 min ph 6 adsorbent dose 0 75 g mg concentration of 60 mg l 1 under these conditions the predicted removal percentage of mg dye by pact γ fe2o3 calculated was 77 which agrees well with the experimental value of 73 with desirability of 1 0 3 5 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are of great importance to understand the interaction between dye and adsorbent adsorption data applied to langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin isotherm at three different temperature 298 k 308 k and 318 k respectively 3 5 1 langmuir adsorption isotherm the langmuir equation is generally used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity corresponding to the complete monolayer coverage on homogenous adsorbent surface without any interaction between the adsorbed ions langmuir 1914 mathematically equation can be represented as 5 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 qe is the adsorption amount at the equilibrium mg g 1 qm is the maximum capacity mg g 1 and kl is the langmuir constant related to the affinity of binding sites l mg 1 the linear plot fig 6 a for langmuir model was obtained at three different temperatures can be seen from table 4 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacities qm calculated by langmuir model was found to be 62 89 78 92 and 86 28 mg g 1 and regression coefficient value are 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 at 298 k 308 k and 318 k respectively which suggest that the langmuir model is best fitted to the experimental data at all temperature range the values of error analysis sse and rmse were found to be 0 008 13 85 at 298 k 0 003 2 18 at 308 k and 0 002 9 54 at 318 k 3 5 2 freundlich adsorption isotherm freundlich adsorption isotherm model is based on the adsorption on reversible heterogeneous surface the linearized freundlich equation can be represented as 6 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf indicates the adsorption capacity and n is the adsorption intensity which is a numerical value and varies with heterogeneity liu et al 2018 the magnitude of the exponent n gives an indication of the favorability of adsorption for a favorable adsorption the value of n must be greater than unity n and kf can be calculated by linear plot between lnqe and ce fig 6 b from table 4 the value of n is more than unity which indicating a favorable adsorption and the value of regression coefficient is 0 97 0 99 and 0 96 at 298 k 308 k and 318 k the values of error analysis sse and rmse were found to be 0 005 60 85 at 298 k 0 030 74 56 at 308 k and 0 06 67 20 at 318 k 3 5 3 dubinin radushkevich adsorption isotherm d r isotherm is generally applied to express the adsorption mechanism with a gaussian energy distribution onto a heterogeneous surface muthukumaran et al 2016 the isotherm is generally expressed by the following equation 7 ln q e lnq m k d r ε 2 where qe is the amount of dye adsorbed on the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g 1 qm is the theoretical isotherm saturation capacity mg g 1 kd r is the d r isotherm constant mol2 kj 2 and ε is the d r isotherm constant the model is generally used to distinguish the physical and chemical adsorption of dye with its mean free energy e per molecule of adsorbate can be computed by the relationship 8 e 1 2 k d r ε is polanyi potential which is related to the equilibrium concentration 9 ε r t 1 1 c e where r t and ce represent the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 absolute temperature k and equilibrium concentration mg l 1 at equilibrium respectively one of the unique features of d r model lies on a fact that it is temperature dependent and when adsorption data at different temperatures are plotted as a function of logarithm of amount adsorbed ln qe vs the square of potential energy qm and kd r can be determined from equation 8 from the linear plot of d r model given in fig 6 c qm was determined to be 71 71 70 52 83 35 mg g 1 and the free mean energy e is 2672 61 3227 49 and 3015 11 at 298 k 308 k and 318 k respectively indicating a chemisorption process the values of error analysis sse and rmse were found to be 0 14 5 01 at 298 k 0 19 6 22 at 308 k and 0 14 6 61 at 318 k 3 5 4 temkin adsorption isotherm this isotherm directly takes into account of adsorbent adsorbate interactions this model is based on two assumption i heat of adsorption would decrease linearly rather than logarithmic ii uniform distribution of binding energies up to some maximum binding energy the temkin isotherm equation is wang et al 2019 10 q e b ln a b ln c e 11 b r t b where r is gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is absolute temperature k b is the temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol 1 and a is the equilibrium binding constant corresponding to the maximum binding energy l g 1 the linear plot fig 6 d of qe versus lnce enable to determine the constant a and b the temkin constant given in table 4 clearly suggests that the adsorption involves chemisorption rather than an ion exchange mechanism the temkin isotherm gives a satisfactory linear fit data at all temperatures the value of binding constant a given in table 4 as 2 716 2 560 and 2 747 l mg 1 also support high affinity of mg towards adsorbent surface at high temperature 3 6 adsorption kinetics in order to determine the rate determining step during adsorption process the kinetic data was investigated by four kinetic models lagergren pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and weber morris intra particle diffusion 3 6 1 lagergren pseudo first order the pseudo first order kinetic is based on the assumption that adsorption was controlled by diffusion step liu et al 2018 the linear equation of this can be expressed by following equation 12 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qe and qt mg g 1 is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the value of rate constant k1 and qe is calculated from the straight line plot of log qe qt vs time shown in fig 7 a the values of calculated removal capacity qe cal was obtained as 8 588 mg g 1 first order rate constant k1 as 0 013 min 1 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 974 sum of square of error sse value as 0 0367 and root mean square error rmse as 68 152 3 6 2 pseudo second order the linear equation of pseudo second order kinetic is given by following equation 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt mg g 1 is amount of dye adsorbed at time t k2 is pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 qe is amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 günay et al 2007 the pseudo second order constants can be calculated from the linear plot between t qt and time which is given in fig 7 b and calculated data in table 5 the values of calculated removal capacity qe cal was obtained as 78 310 mg g 1 first order rate constant k2 as 0 0054 min 1 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 999 sum of square of error sse value as 0 007 and root mean square error rmse as 1 570 the value of qe calculated from pseudo second order kinetic model are very close to experimental values qe exp 76 39 mg g 1 in comparison with the value obtained from pseudo first order the pseudo second order model has high regression coefficient r seo and shin 2015 0 99 and low sse value than the pseudo first order r seo and shin 2015 0 98 so pseudo second order fits best to describe the sorption rate of mg on pact γ fe2o3 nanocomposite see table 6 3 6 3 elovich model the linear form of this equation is expressed as 14 q t 1 β ln t 1 β ln α β where α is initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min 1 and β is the adsorption constant g mg 1 fig 7 c shows linearization of elovich model wang et al 2019 the slope and intercept of plot of qt vs lnt were used to determine the constant β and the initial adsorption rate α the values of calculated parameters initial adsorption rate α was found to be 2 1010 mg g 1 min 1 constant β as 0 36 g mg 1 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 98 sum of square of error sse value as 0 44 the comparison of results with the regression coefficient is shown in table 5 the regression coefficient for elovich kinetic model were low as compared to pseudo second order this suggests that elovich model is not acceptable to define the kinetics of removal of mg by pact γ fe2o3 nanocomposite 3 6 4 weber morris intraparticle diffusion model the intraparticle diffusion was explored using the following equation suggested by weber and morris 15 q t k int t 0 5 c where kint is intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 qt is amount adsorbed at time t mg g 1 the plot of qt vs t1 2 given in fig 7 d appears to be a multi linear graph which indicate two or more steps occurring in the removal process sharma et al 2017 the parameters calculated are listed in table 5 the value of various diffusion parameters calculated are intraparticle diffusion rate constant as 0 70 mg g 1 min 1 2 intercept c value as 68 28 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 93 and sum of square of error sse value as 0 64 the intraparticle diffusion rate was obtained from slope of the gentle sloped portion from table 5 with the low regression coefficient value it seems that this model is partially supporting the removal process in the initial stage 3 7 thermodynamics study thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change δho entropy change δso and gibbs free energy change δgo determined through following equation 16 k c c a d c e 17 ln k c δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t where kc is distribution coefficient obtained by equation 16 at various temperatures ce and cad are liquid and solid phase concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 respectively chaudhary et al 2018 the value of kc at different temperature were obtained from equation 17 the enthalpy changes of adsorption δho and entropy change δso can be calculated from slope and intercept of plot lnkc vs 1 t fig 8 18 δ g o δ h o t δ s o thermodynamic parameters associated with the mg remocval by pact γ fe2o3 the nanocomposite are listed in fig 8 the positive value of δh confirmed the endothermic nature of the process of mg on pact γ fe2o3 the values of δg are all negative and the negative value of δgᴼ increases as the temperature increase from 298 to 318 k which indicates that the process of the nanocomposite is spontaneous and spontaneity increases with temperature see table s2 the positive value of δs revealed the increased randomness and increase in the degrees of freedom at the adsorbent solution interface during the immobilization of the mg on the active sites of the adsorbent therefore enabling commonness of randomness and spontaneity in the system 4 conclusion the material pact γ fe2o3 was synthesized via oxidative free radical polymerization reaction of acrylamide monomer in presence of γ fe2o3 as a filler by grafting with chitosan the utility of the material was explored towards the removal of malachite green dye from the wastewater various kind of process variables were optimized by well known statistical tool termed as response surface methodology is associated with central composite design the optimized variable conditions such as contact time 170 28 min ph 6 adsorbent dose 0 75 g mg concentration of 60 mg l 1 under these conditions the predicted removal percentage of mg dye by pact γ fe2o3 calculated was 77 which agrees well with the experimental value of 73 with desirability of 1 0 based on the mathematical model application it was observed that the experimental data verily inclines towards the langmuir model with variable temperature conditions 298 318 k the dynamics of the reaction defines that the mechanism of uptake of mg molecules by pact γ fe2o3 takes place with the formation of a coordination bonds between the solute and the material within the liquid perimeter the material also shows a wide range of applicability towards different carcinogenic pollutants and can be used for pilot scale level in chemical industries data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the

azimi et al 2019 vyavahare et al 2018 the presence of mg in water system can lead to dangerous effect on organic system and internal organ which can cause different diseases such as carcinogenic genotoxic mutagenic el zahhar and awwad 2016 after a massive treatment still the color of these dyes persist for long time in water and does not get degrade simply rahman et al 2019 various conventional methods which have been utilized for the degradation of virulent dyes are such as membrane filtration photo catalyzed degradation microbiological oxidation ozonation coagulation flocculation and biological processes robati et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 ahmad et al 2017 mittal et al 2016d 2016e daraei and mittal 2017 these methods were found to be less efficient due to their excessive cost and occasional potency the most favorable approach for removal of dyes from water is adsorption due to its high potency low cost moderate approach easy handling and high selectivity zheng et al 2015 crini and badot 2008 shen et al 2009 anastopoulos et al 2018 mittal 2016 recently nanomaterials have been extensively used to decontaminate water and resolve issue regarding purity of

2013 the absorption peak at 624 cm 1 corresponds to fe o bond from the ftir spectra it was concluded that γ fe2o3 mnps were successfully surface functionalized by a polymer hydrogel blend of pam g cts through the formation of no bond the change in crystalline structure and information about the distance between the planes in γ fe2o3 before and after the reinforcement process was obtained through x ray diffraction method fig s2 represents the xrd spectra of a γ fe2o3 and b pact γ fe2o3 nanocomposite from fig s2 a the characteristic xrd peaks for γ fe2o3 appears at 2θ values of 30 43 35 84 43 45 53 89 57 35 and 62 94 which are corresponds to miller indices values of 200 311 400 422 512 and 440 the plane value of 400 is characteristic value for γ fe2o3 as already reported in literature hoque et al 2018 referring to the xrd spectra of pact γ fe2o3 in fig s2 b the characteristic 2θ values appears at 32 65 34 72 44 21 59 61 and 62 98 which belongs to the miller indices value of 220 310 400 510 and 440 the shifting in plane values and reduction in peak intensities in pact γ fe2o3 indicates that the γ fe2o3 nanoparticles have been completely stabilized by polyacrylamide g chitosan polymer matrix with presence of a little amorphous character scanning electron micrographs of the chitosan pact γ fe2o3 with edx are given in fig s3 a c in the sem image of chitosan non porous flakes were appeared while the sem image of pact γ fe2o3 indicates a more porous irregular surface due to capping of γ fe2o3 nanoparticles with hydrogel chitosan biopolymer the change in the morphology is due to the formation of crosslink network between chitosan and γ fe2o3 nanoparticles fig s3 c represents the edx spectra of pact γ fe2o3 nanocomposite indicating the material composition as c 32 07 n 3 44 o 39 92 and fe 24 57 typical tem image of pact γ fe2o3 nanocomposite has been shown in fig 3 which indicates the presence of relatively spherical particles and well disperse distribution of the γ fe2o3 nps in the chitosan matrix according to fig 3 the average size of γ fe2o3 nps was estimated to be 10 67 nm 3 2 rsm approach and statistical analysis response surface methodology is an immense source of mathematical and statistical techniques for improvement and optimization of parameters for various chemical and industrial processes anfar et al 2017 central composite design is one of the most powerful and efficient experimental design among the other response surface designs because of its ability to quantify the parameters of the quadratic model building of sequential designs detection of lack of fit of the model and use of blocks a design consisting of 30 experimental patters based on variation of four important variables such as contact time a mg concentration b adsorbent dose c and ph d was constructed by design expert given in table s1 the given range for a particular variable parameter such as contact time 80 210 min mg concentration 15 75 mg l 1 catalyst dose 0 5 1 5 g and ph 3 7 are illustrated in table 1 based on the experimental and predicted results a quadratic equation was quadratic regression modeling was operated between the response of the corresponding coded values of four variables and an empirical equation was obtained as 3 r 1 40 54 1 38 a 13 61 b 9 41 c 9 91 d 0 027 ab 0 19 ac 0 095 ad 3 80 bc 3 32 bd 4 45 cd 2 67 a 2 1 03 b 2 3 56 c 2 7 57 d 2 in eq 3 a negative sign suggests an antagonistic effect whereas a positive sign indicates a synergistic effect pezoti junior et al 2014 as shown in equation 3 the mg concentration b and ph d are positive this indicates that the photodegradation of mg by pact γ fe2o3 can be improved when these factors are increased the significance of each coefficient was evaluated by a higher f value and smaller p value a fairly high correlation between the experimental and predicted response suggests the adequacy of the quadratic model setiabudi et al 2016 3 3 analysis of variance anova anova is a statistical technique that subdivides the total variation in a set of data into component part associated with specific source of variation for the purpose of testing hypothesis on the parameter of the model anova helps in prediction of significant and non significant factors on the basis of p and f values using fisher s null hypothesis method ahmad and hasan 2016 adequacy of model is confirmed by higher f value while p value 0 05 indicate that model terms are significant in this model the f value is 5 47 and p value is 0 0011 which is less than 0 05 justifying the significance of model the p value of lack of fit lof is greater than 0 05 which suggest that the model is statistically not significant marrakchi et al 2017 it is clear from anova that statistically irrelevant terms having p value greater that 0 05 were deleted from the quadratic equation based on the valued of t and p to achieve a more précised response surface model adequate precision ap value of 9 875 in quadratic regression model imputed an adequate signal of photodegradation of mg on pact γ fe2o3 the magnitude of the model was analyzed by the values of correlation coefficient r2 and r2adj the correlation coefficient r2 is used to measure how good the model predicts response value based on the outcomes concluded by anova the values of r2 and r2adj were found to be 0 83 and 0 68 given in table 2 respectively see table 3 4 r 1 40 54 13 61 b 9 41 c 9 91 d 7 57 d 2 a plot of experimental versus calculated values of removal indicates good fit shown in fig 4 b and presence of linear relationship between them with high correlation coefficient indicates the normal distribution of error around the mean and good applicability of model for the explanation of experimental data these plots are required to check the normality assumption in fitted model fig 4 a shows residual plot versus run numbers the random pattern of residual would indicate the model adequacy the diagram demonstrates a well conveyance of points along straight line with the estimations of r2 and r2adj as 0 83 and 0 68 separately 3 4 three dimensional response surface plot and their interpretation 3d surface plots are the graphical portrayal of regression equation delineating the synchronous impact of two variable on adsorption while letting other variables steady ahmad and hasan 2016 3d surface plots of interaction effect of variable on removal efficiency of mg are given in fig 5 a d fig 5 a account to the 3d surface plot for simultaneous effect of concentration and time on the removal efficiency of mg while holding the catalyst dose at 0 75 g and temperature 318 k from fig 5 a an increase in percent efficiency of mg dye was observed when concentration of mg increases from 30 to 60 mg l 1 with an increase in time from 120 to 180 min further increase in mg concentration leads to decrease in percent removal due to saturation of adsorbent sites by mg molecules at a limited concentration shakeel et al 2014 thus an optimized mg concentration of 60 mg l 1 was used for all the adsorption isotherms kinetic and thermodynamic studies similarly from fig 5 b it can be seen that the adsorption limit of mg increments as ph increased from 4 to 6 and after that decline somewhat with the further increment of ph esteems at ph 4 0 h ions emulated with mg cationic dye for the available active sites on the exterior surface of the adsorbent which would impede the reach of mg due to the repulsion forces hence the evacuation of mg was the less presumably because of the elevated rivalry of proton with mg dye for surface active sites as the ph of the solution further increases the concentration of h ions in the solvent medium decrease that accelerates adsorption of mg increases higher adsorption rate at high ph imply that mg interact with adsorbent via chelating mechanism with carboxylic and hydroxyl groups of the adsorbent until a maximum yield is reached at ph 6 0 a decrease in adsorption rate was observed which may be attributed to participation of the mg with hydroxides nekouei and nekouei 2018 fig 5 c constitute the 3d interactive plot between adsorbent dose and mg concentration with respect to removal efficiency of mg as it can be seen increasing the concentration from 30 to 60 mg l 1 increases the dye removal efficiency while the increase in adsorbent dose restricts the removal efficiency suggesting that mg concentration has a synergistic effect while adsorbent dose has an antagonistic effect fig 5 d represent the 3d surface plot for interaction effect of ph and adsorbent dose on the removal efficiency of mg while holding the time at 170 28 min mg concentration 60 mg l 1 and temperature 318 k as can be seen increasing adsorbent dose from 0 75 g to 1 25 g with an increase in ph decreases the removal efficiency for mg this behavior can be explained as adsorbent dose increases the number of adsorbent particles also increases facilitating more active sites for adsorption however as the amount of adsorbent increases effective surface area and adsorbate adsorbent ratio reduces resulting in less mg uptake the purpose of the present study was to optimize the four variables that affect the adsorption of mg on pam chitosan γ fe2o3 obtained results clearly indicates that the optimum values of radiation time 170 28 min ph 6 adsorbent dose 0 75 g mg concentration of 60 mg l 1 under these conditions the predicted removal percentage of mg dye by pact γ fe2o3 calculated was 77 which agrees well with the experimental value of 73 with desirability of 1 0 3 5 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are of great importance to understand the interaction between dye and adsorbent adsorption data applied to langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin isotherm at three different temperature 298 k 308 k and 318 k respectively 3 5 1 langmuir adsorption isotherm the langmuir equation is generally used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity corresponding to the complete monolayer coverage on homogenous adsorbent surface without any interaction between the adsorbed ions langmuir 1914 mathematically equation can be represented as 5 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 qe is the adsorption amount at the equilibrium mg g 1 qm is the maximum capacity mg g 1 and kl is the langmuir constant related to the affinity of binding sites l mg 1 the linear plot fig 6 a for langmuir model was obtained at three different temperatures can be seen from table 4 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacities qm calculated by langmuir model was found to be 62 89 78 92 and 86 28 mg g 1 and regression coefficient value are 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 at 298 k 308 k and 318 k respectively which suggest that the langmuir model is best fitted to the experimental data at all temperature range the values of error analysis sse and rmse were found to be 0 008 13 85 at 298 k 0 003 2 18 at 308 k and 0 002 9 54 at 318 k 3 5 2 freundlich adsorption isotherm freundlich adsorption isotherm model is based on the adsorption on reversible heterogeneous surface the linearized freundlich equation can be represented as 6 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf indicates the adsorption capacity and n is the adsorption intensity which is a numerical value and varies with heterogeneity liu et al 2018 the magnitude of the exponent n gives an indication of the favorability of adsorption for a favorable adsorption the value of n must be greater than unity n and kf can be calculated by linear plot between lnqe and ce fig 6 b from table 4 the value of n is more than unity which indicating a favorable adsorption and the value of regression coefficient is 0 97 0 99 and 0 96 at 298 k 308 k and 318 k the values of error analysis sse and rmse were found to be 0 005 60 85 at 298 k 0 030 74 56 at 308 k and 0 06 67 20 at 318 k 3 5 3 dubinin radushkevich adsorption isotherm d r isotherm is generally applied to express the adsorption mechanism with a gaussian energy distribution onto a heterogeneous surface muthukumaran et al 2016 the isotherm is generally expressed by the following equation 7 ln q e lnq m k d r ε 2 where qe is the amount of dye adsorbed on the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g 1 qm is the theoretical isotherm saturation capacity mg g 1 kd r is the d r isotherm constant mol2 kj 2 and ε is the d r isotherm constant the model is generally used to distinguish the physical and chemical adsorption of dye with its mean free energy e per molecule of adsorbate can be computed by the relationship 8 e 1 2 k d r ε is polanyi potential which is related to the equilibrium concentration 9 ε r t 1 1 c e where r t and ce represent the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 absolute temperature k and equilibrium concentration mg l 1 at equilibrium respectively one of the unique features of d r model lies on a fact that it is temperature dependent and when adsorption data at different temperatures are plotted as a function of logarithm of amount adsorbed ln qe vs the square of potential energy qm and kd r can be determined from equation 8 from the linear plot of d r model given in fig 6 c qm was determined to be 71 71 70 52 83 35 mg g 1 and the free mean energy e is 2672 61 3227 49 and 3015 11 at 298 k 308 k and 318 k respectively indicating a chemisorption process the values of error analysis sse and rmse were found to be 0 14 5 01 at 298 k 0 19 6 22 at 308 k and 0 14 6 61 at 318 k 3 5 4 temkin adsorption isotherm this isotherm directly takes into account of adsorbent adsorbate interactions this model is based on two assumption i heat of adsorption would decrease linearly rather than logarithmic ii uniform distribution of binding energies up to some maximum binding energy the temkin isotherm equation is wang et al 2019 10 q e b ln a b ln c e 11 b r t b where r is gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is absolute temperature k b is the temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol 1 and a is the equilibrium binding constant corresponding to the maximum binding energy l g 1 the linear plot fig 6 d of qe versus lnce enable to determine the constant a and b the temkin constant given in table 4 clearly suggests that the adsorption involves chemisorption rather than an ion exchange mechanism the temkin isotherm gives a satisfactory linear fit data at all temperatures the value of binding constant a given in table 4 as 2 716 2 560 and 2 747 l mg 1 also support high affinity of mg towards adsorbent surface at high temperature 3 6 adsorption kinetics in order to determine the rate determining step during adsorption process the kinetic data was investigated by four kinetic models lagergren pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and weber morris intra particle diffusion 3 6 1 lagergren pseudo first order the pseudo first order kinetic is based on the assumption that adsorption was controlled by diffusion step liu et al 2018 the linear equation of this can be expressed by following equation 12 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qe and qt mg g 1 is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the value of rate constant k1 and qe is calculated from the straight line plot of log qe qt vs time shown in fig 7 a the values of calculated removal capacity qe cal was obtained as 8 588 mg g 1 first order rate constant k1 as 0 013 min 1 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 974 sum of square of error sse value as 0 0367 and root mean square error rmse as 68 152 3 6 2 pseudo second order the linear equation of pseudo second order kinetic is given by following equation 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt mg g 1 is amount of dye adsorbed at time t k2 is pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 qe is amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 günay et al 2007 the pseudo second order constants can be calculated from the linear plot between t qt and time which is given in fig 7 b and calculated data in table 5 the values of calculated removal capacity qe cal was obtained as 78 310 mg g 1 first order rate constant k2 as 0 0054 min 1 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 999 sum of square of error sse value as 0 007 and root mean square error rmse as 1 570 the value of qe calculated from pseudo second order kinetic model are very close to experimental values qe exp 76 39 mg g 1 in comparison with the value obtained from pseudo first order the pseudo second order model has high regression coefficient r seo and shin 2015 0 99 and low sse value than the pseudo first order r seo and shin 2015 0 98 so pseudo second order fits best to describe the sorption rate of mg on pact γ fe2o3 nanocomposite see table 6 3 6 3 elovich model the linear form of this equation is expressed as 14 q t 1 β ln t 1 β ln α β where α is initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min 1 and β is the adsorption constant g mg 1 fig 7 c shows linearization of elovich model wang et al 2019 the slope and intercept of plot of qt vs lnt were used to determine the constant β and the initial adsorption rate α the values of calculated parameters initial adsorption rate α was found to be 2 1010 mg g 1 min 1 constant β as 0 36 g mg 1 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 98 sum of square of error sse value as 0 44 the comparison of results with the regression coefficient is shown in table 5 the regression coefficient for elovich kinetic model were low as compared to pseudo second order this suggests that elovich model is not acceptable to define the kinetics of removal of mg by pact γ fe2o3 nanocomposite 3 6 4 weber morris intraparticle diffusion model the intraparticle diffusion was explored using the following equation suggested by weber and morris 15 q t k int t 0 5 c where kint is intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 qt is amount adsorbed at time t mg g 1 the plot of qt vs t1 2 given in fig 7 d appears to be a multi linear graph which indicate two or more steps occurring in the removal process sharma et al 2017 the parameters calculated are listed in table 5 the value of various diffusion parameters calculated are intraparticle diffusion rate constant as 0 70 mg g 1 min 1 2 intercept c value as 68 28 coefficient of linear regression r2 as 0 93 and sum of square of error sse value as 0 64 the intraparticle diffusion rate was obtained from slope of the gentle sloped portion from table 5 with the low regression coefficient value it seems that this model is partially supporting the removal process in the initial stage 3 7 thermodynamics study thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change δho entropy change δso and gibbs free energy change δgo determined through following equation 16 k c c a d c e 17 ln k c δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t where kc is distribution coefficient obtained by equation 16 at various temperatures ce and cad are liquid and solid phase concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 respectively chaudhary et al 2018 the value of kc at different temperature were obtained from equation 17 the enthalpy changes of adsorption δho and entropy change δso can be calculated from slope and intercept of plot lnkc vs 1 t fig 8 18 δ g o δ h o t δ s o thermodynamic parameters associated with the mg remocval by pact γ fe2o3 the nanocomposite are listed in fig 8 the positive value of δh confirmed the endothermic nature of the process of mg on pact γ fe2o3 the values of δg are all negative and the negative value of δgᴼ increases as the temperature increase from 298 to 318 k which indicates that the process of the nanocomposite is spontaneous and spontaneity increases with temperature see table s2 the positive value of δs revealed the increased randomness and increase in the degrees of freedom at the adsorbent solution interface during the immobilization of the mg on the active sites of the adsorbent therefore enabling commonness of randomness and spontaneity in the system 4 conclusion the material pact γ fe2o3 was synthesized via oxidative free radical polymerization reaction of acrylamide monomer in presence of γ fe2o3 as a filler by grafting with chitosan the utility of the material was explored towards the removal of malachite green dye from the wastewater various kind of process variables were optimized by well known statistical tool termed as response surface methodology is associated with central composite design the optimized variable conditions such as contact time 170 28 min ph 6 adsorbent dose 0 75 g mg concentration of 60 mg l 1 under these conditions the predicted removal percentage of mg dye by pact γ fe2o3 calculated was 77 which agrees well with the experimental value of 73 with desirability of 1 0 based on the mathematical model application it was observed that the experimental data verily inclines towards the langmuir model with variable temperature conditions 298 318 k the dynamics of the reaction defines that the mechanism of uptake of mg molecules by pact γ fe2o3 takes place with the formation of a coordination bonds between the solute and the material within the liquid perimeter the material also shows a wide range of applicability towards different carcinogenic pollutants and can be used for pilot scale level in chemical industries data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the

intermediate stage of chemical evolution while groundwater characterizes the late stage of chemical evolution analysis of flow net combined with hydrogeologic sections revealed significant relationship of surface water and groundwater in the basin the upper and lower reaches are characterized by contour heads showing an upstream pointing curvature due to depression induced by groundwater discharge where contour lines cross a gaining stream the middle reach is marked by contour curvature pointing downstream owing to mounding induced by groundwater recharge where it crosses a losing stream groundwater shows markedly depleted isotopic composition than surface water both surface water and groundwater fall below global meteoric water line and local meteoric water line

groundwater have been using as natural resource for various activities like agriculture domestic drinking and small industries leading to major contribution to the state s economy these resources can be utilized to the maximum if the mechanism of sw gw interaction is well understood winter 1999 levy and xu 2012 it depends on hydrological processes covering a wide range of spatial scales from local scale woessner 2000 over river reach scale anibas et al 2012 up to catchment scale amoros and bornette 2002 pringle 2003 the concept of hydrological connectivity helps in understanding the importance of gw sw interaction in hydrogeologic systems woessner 2000 lane et al 2004 as well as for hydro ecological processes the information on hydrological studies in irb has been mainly confined to the assessment of quality for various uses studies on contamination of arsenic in sw and gw have been reported by chakraborti et al 2008 singh 2010 oinam et al 2011 chandrashekhar et al 2014 investigation

water bodies like river lake wetlands and flow direction are used for sw gw interaction study fetter 2001 bresciani et al 2018 if the head contours show a curvature pointing in the downstream direction then the contour lines cross a losing stream due to the mounding induced by groundwater recharge whereas if it shows a curvature pointing in the upstream direction where the contour lines cross a gaining stream due to the depression induced by groundwater discharge winter et al 1998 based on this method the imphal river can be divided into three reaches upper reach ur middle reach and lower reach fig 3 in upper reach the contour lines cut the river pointing upstream indicating gaining river where gw fed the river in middle reach the contour lines intersect the imphal river pointing towards downstream representing a losing river where it supplies water to the gw while lower reach is characterized by gaining nature the gw flow direction indicates that the loktak lake is a gw fed lake particularly towards the southern part of the lake fig 3 the upper reach flows through the motbung piedmont surface pleistocene while middle and lower reaches flow through the imphal and wangoo sugnu flat surfaces holocene the water table map reveals three types of regional flow directions the southeast flow in the upper reach the western flow in the middle reach and the eastern flow in the

underneath the manipur river bed around the ahallup flood plain the water table around this flood plain is below the river indicating influent stream fig 4a where gw gains water from this river the other aquifer horizons a2 a3 are encountered at the depth of 10 m around the chingkhu depression and keithelmanbi pediment surfaces section b depicts subsurface aquifer disposition of stretch of 30 km between bishnupur and sugnu for a depth of 15 m in the lower reach of irb fig 4b the depositional sequence in this section is dominated by shale gravels clay and soft soil the main aquifer horizons are identified as soft soils and soil mixed with gravels in northwestern part of the section where the loktak lake is located the depth of water table around this lake is higher than the lake and hence gw supplies water into this lake fig 4b the main shallow subsurface sediment below this lake is soft sand soil a4 another significant aquifer layer composed of gravelly sand a5 is encountered beneath the manipur river bed towards se part of the section the layer is laterally extensive but limited in its thickness the river at this reach gains water from gw making effluent type of river other aquifer layer made up of soft shale a6 is observed at the thanga depression where the layer has thickness of 20 m evolution of hydrochemical constituents in irb is characterized by systemic changes in anion species from hco3 to so4 to cl along the gw flow such phenomenon has been observed around some parts of manipur valley aquifer systems kshetrimayum and laxmi 2017 durov diagram fig 5 shows that gw samples are more chemically strong in reaction than sw the gw samples are dominantly characterized by intermediate and late stages of chemical evolution while sw samples are limited to intermediate stage the intermediate stage represents simple dissolution or ion mixing process while late stage depicts reverse ion exchange process indicating end point durov 1948 the gw samples g1 g3 g13 g14 g20 and sw samples r3 4 l2 represent end members indicating cl dominant and no dominant cation representing water characterized by reverse ion exchange process these water samples have older residential age than other samples in ternary plot fig 6 the cations are plotted along the lines between ca2 and na k end members denoting the impact of the dominant cation as a result of the carbonate ca2 member and or the alkalis na k member du et al 2018 in anion facies both sw and gw samples are plotted along a line of hco3 end member indicating dissolution of ion under oxidized conditions furthermore si content increases as cl so4 content increases in both sw than gw 5 1 isotopic characteristics of sw gw interaction δ18o values of gw samples in dh pz ap fp in irb range from 6 99 to 6 14 6 94 to 4 9 7 01 to 4 45 and 7 43 to 4 75 for δ2h the values vary from 45 16 to 40 82 44 26 to 31 98 46 86 to 26 85 and 48 75 to 31 79 in dh pz ap fp respectively the mean δ18o and δ2h values of dh pz ap fp are 6 66 and 43 24 6 41 and 41 11 6 27 and 40 48 6 19 and 40 26 respectively these values suggest that dh has the most depleting isotopic composition while the fp has the most enriched composition among all the geomorphic units stable o and h isotope values δ2h and δ18o and d excess values from sw and gw across irb are given in table 1 fig 7 a depicts the isotopic signature of sw and gw in irb as well as both the global and local meteoric water lines all the samples plot below the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl dh 9 13 δ18o 16 19 kumar et al 2010 and the slope of the regression lines for sw and gw 7 to 0 14 and 7 43 to 4 45 for o isotope and 46 12 to 1 46 and 48 75 to 26 85 for h isotope respectively is lower than 8 and 9 13 values for gmwl and lmwl respectively indicating that both sw and gw originate from infiltration of modern precipitation that was not subject to surface or subsurface alteration of its isotopic composition grünberger et al 2004 dor et al 2011 yin et al 2011 the distribution patterns of δ2h and δ18o of sw and gw are similar indicating extensive interaction between them the slope of the evaporation line el δd 4 92 δ18o 9 69 r2 0 992 in irb is 4 92 fig 7a the original composition of water before subject to evaporation is given by intersecting point of el with gmwl farid et al 2013 which is calculated as 6 58 and 42 17 for the irb the d excess defined as d δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 is a useful proxy for identifying secondary processes influencing the atmospheric vapor content in the evaporation condensation cycle craig 1961 machavaram and krishnamurthy 1994 for atmospheric moisture not influenced by secondary evaporative processes the d excess approximates the y intercept of the gmwl of 10 marfia et al 2004 the d excess values in irb range from 3 08 to 11 8 with an average of 7 65 for imphal river and from 5 to 3 24 with a mean of 0 4 for the loktak lake the d excess values for gw ranges from 6 21 to 12 25 with an average of 9 81 these d excess values suggest that the isotopic composition in water samples is characteristic of semi arid climate based on the isotopic signature sw can be identified into two groups as shown in fig 7a the first group belongs to the imphal river samples r1 7 which lie along the meteoric lines and show depleted isotopic compositions 5 5 and 36 9 the second group represents loktak lake and swamp samples l8 12 s13 which fall away from meteoric lines and have enriched isotopic composition 2 7 and 23 this variation in isotopic composition may infer that the degree of intensity of evaporation of meteoric water before gw recharge banner et al 1989 is higher in the loktak lake than that of the imphal river as these rivers are often recharged by gw at several reaches fig 3 a plot of the mean δ18o vs cl in sw and gw samples shows a scattered distribution fig 7b sw samples show enriched isotopic composition with low cl concentration while gw samples have depleted isotope compositions with high cl concentration indicating major impact of transpiration petrides and cartwright 2006 three gw samples g38 g40 g41 belonging to ap and dh show depleted isotopic composition with elevated cl indicating old stage of chemical evolution with older residential age the chemical evolution of gw originates from pz and reaches end members at ap and dh the mechanism of mineralization in sw and gw can also be explained by tds versus δ18o correlation fig 7c sw has low tds with enriched isotopic composition indicating the evaporation process contributing to the salinization at places farid et al 2013 gw samples show high tds with depleted isotopic composition suggesting that mineralization is controlled by both dissolution and weak evaporation process farid et al 2013 6 conclusion the present study adopts an approach combining hydrogeology hydrochemical and isotopic constituents of sw and gw to assess their interaction recharge condition and chemical evolution in the imphal river basin located in ne india the highlights of the present work are listed as follows 1 the concentrations of solutes in tds decrease according to the sequence si cl hco3 ca2 mg2 na so4 no3 k in sw and si cl hco3 ca2 na mg2 so4 k no3 in gw indicating similar ion distribution pattern 2 hydrochemical facies are more in gw ca2 cl hco3 na2 cl ca2 na ca2 cl na cl than in sw ca2 cl na cl ca2 indicating strong ion mixing process in gw 3 the pattern of flow net with water bodies illustrates three zones of sw gw interaction i the effluent zone of the upper and lower reaches of the imphal river ii the influent zone of the mid reach of the imphal river and iii the gw fed loktak lake 4 the regional gw flow direction is towards the loktak lake along with three local flow variations southeastern flow in the upper reach western flow in the middle reach and eastern flow in the lower reach 5 the gw is characterized by intermediate and late stages of chemical evolution while sw is limited to intermediate stages the intermediate stage represents simple dissolution or ion mixing process while late stage depicts reverse ion exchange process indicating end stage of groundwater evolution 6 o and h isotopic composition in sw is more enriched than gw both sw and gw show below gmwl and lmwl indicating source of water through infiltration of recent precipitation that was not subject to alteration of its isotopic composition the distribution patterns of δ2h and δ18o of sw and gw are similar indicating extensive interaction between them the slope of the evaporation line δd 4 92 δ18o 9 69 r2 0 992 is calculated as 4 92 the original composition of water before subject to evaporation is found out to be 6 58 and 42 17 the d excess values 7 65 for the imphal river 0 4 for the loktak lake and 9 81 for gw suggests that isotopic composition in water samples is characteristic of semi arid climate the isotopic constituents in sw infer that intensity of evaporation of meteoric water before gw recharge is higher in the loktak lake than river as it is often recharged by gw a plot of δ18o vs cl distinguished three gw samples g38 g40 g41 belonging to ap and dh representing end member of chemical evolution with relatively older residential age tds versus δ18o correlation indicates that sw has low tds with enriched isotopic composition indicating the evaporation process in mineralization gw is signified with high tds and depleted isotopic composition suggesting mineralization controlled by dissolution and weak evaporation process acknowledgement the authors are grateful to prof s balakrishnan and dr k srinivasamoorthy of department of earth sciences pondicherry university india for

12039,the surface water and groundwater interaction in the imphal river basin in northeast india using hydrogeology hydrochemical and isotopic constituents has examined to elucidate hydrochemical evolution surface water and groundwater mixing and recharge condition groundwater is characterized by ca2 cl hco3 facies while surface water exhibits ca2 cl type surface water prevailed the intermediate stage of chemical evolution while groundwater characterizes the late stage of chemical evolution analysis of flow net combined with hydrogeologic sections revealed significant relationship of surface water and groundwater in the basin the upper and lower reaches are characterized by contour heads showing an upstream pointing curvature due to depression induced by groundwater discharge where contour lines cross a gaining stream the middle reach is marked by contour curvature pointing downstream owing to mounding induced by groundwater recharge where it crosses a losing stream groundwater shows markedly depleted isotopic composition than surface water both surface water and groundwater fall below global meteoric water line and local meteoric water line indicating the source of water through infiltration of modern precipitation the slope of the evaporation line and the original composition of water are identified as 4 92 and 6 58 and 42 17

valley northeast india 1 introduction there are 15 major rivers and streams in manipur which covers an area of 166 77 km2 i e 0 75 of the total geographical area nwa 2009 these rivers are distributed in four basins which are the barak river basin to the west the imphal river basin irb in the central the yu river basin in the east and the liyai river basin in the north fig 1 irb is the second largest basin after the barak river basin and is a part of the chindwin myittha drainage system of myanmar the main rivers and tributaries of the basin are the imphal river iril river nambul river thoubal river sekmai river chakpi river and khuga river most of these rivers are ephemeral in nature and originated from surrounding hills of the disang shales eocene to cretaceous and barail sandstone oligocene irb occupies the sole intermontane valley which has population of nearly 2 million people shm 2017 covering a catchment area of 6332 km2 in which 5109 km2 falls in the manipur valley with discharge capacity of 0 5192 million hectare meters envis 2018 90 of the drinking water in manipur is provided by the rivers and tributaries of this basin irb has total of 708 surface water bodies in which 167 are smaller in size 2 25 ha and 541 are bigger 2 25 ha the surface water bodies are in the form of lakes paleo channels ponds swamps moats etc which contribute an area of 63 616 ha that is 2 85 of total geographic area out of this lakes and ponds share 61 5 rivers and streams occupy 26 2 and swamps occupy 5 5 nwa 2009 though manipur falls under high intensity of rainfall having an average annual rainfall of 1435 mm it faces acute shortage of water during dry seasons as surface water bodies like wetlands and rivers become dried up this surface water along with groundwater have been using as natural resource for various activities like agriculture domestic drinking and small industries leading to major contribution to the state s economy these resources can be utilized to the maximum if the mechanism of sw gw interaction is well understood winter 1999 levy and xu 2012 it depends on hydrological processes covering a wide range of spatial scales from local scale woessner 2000 over river reach scale anibas et al 2012 up to catchment scale amoros and bornette 2002 pringle 2003 the concept of hydrological connectivity helps in understanding the importance of gw sw interaction in hydrogeologic systems woessner 2000 lane et al 2004 as well as for hydro ecological processes the information on hydrological studies in irb has been mainly confined to the assessment of quality for various uses studies on contamination of arsenic in sw and gw have been reported by chakraborti et al 2008 singh 2010 oinam et al 2011 chandrashekhar et al 2014 investigation on relationship of fe and as in manipur valley has been conducted by gupta and singh 2018 the mechanism and source of salinization in manipur aquifer systems has been studied by kshetrimayum and laxmi

lakes and gw using isotopes has been well explained guyonnet 1991 sacks et al 1992 shedlock et al 1993 winter and rosenberry 1995 winter 1999 the novelty of the work is to characterize the isotopic constituents of surface water and groundwater in the imphal valley such types of work have not been carried out by anyone in the region therefore the result of present work in this regard will contribute to the existing pool of knowledge for further research the present paper elucidates interaction of sw like loktak lake lamphel pat swamps and imphal river with underlying subsurface aquifer systems such approach will provide insight into the mechanism of sw gw mixing recharge condition chemical evolution and groundwater age which is needed for effective management of water resources in

residential age than other samples in ternary plot fig 6 the cations are plotted along the lines between ca2 and na k end members denoting the impact of the dominant cation as a result of the carbonate ca2 member and or the alkalis na k member du et al 2018 in anion facies both sw and gw samples are plotted along a line of hco3 end member indicating dissolution of ion under oxidized conditions furthermore si content increases as cl so4 content increases in both sw than gw 5 1 isotopic characteristics of sw gw interaction δ18o values of gw samples in dh pz ap fp in irb range from 6 99 to 6 14 6 94 to 4 9 7 01 to 4 45 and 7 43 to 4 75 for δ2h the values vary from 45 16 to 40 82 44 26 to 31 98 46 86 to 26 85 and 48 75 to 31 79 in dh pz ap fp respectively the mean δ18o and δ2h values of dh pz ap fp are 6 66 and 43 24 6 41 and 41 11 6 27 and 40 48 6 19 and 40 26 respectively these values suggest that dh has the most depleting isotopic composition while the fp has the most enriched composition among all the geomorphic units stable o and h isotope values δ2h and δ18o and d excess values from sw and gw across irb are given in table 1 fig 7 a depicts the isotopic signature of sw and gw in irb as well as both the global and local meteoric water lines all the samples plot below the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl dh 9 13 δ18o 16 19 kumar et al 2010 and the slope of the regression lines for sw and gw 7 to 0 14 and 7 43 to 4 45 for o isotope and 46 12 to 1 46 and 48 75 to 26 85 for h isotope respectively is lower than 8 and 9 13 values for gmwl and lmwl respectively indicating that both sw and gw originate from infiltration of modern precipitation that was not subject to surface or subsurface alteration of its isotopic composition grünberger et al 2004 dor et al 2011 yin et al 2011 the distribution patterns of δ2h and δ18o of sw and gw are similar indicating extensive interaction between them the slope of the evaporation line el δd 4 92 δ18o 9 69 r2 0 992 in irb is 4 92 fig 7a the original composition of water before subject to evaporation is given by intersecting point of el with gmwl farid et al 2013 which is calculated as 6 58 and 42 17 for the irb the d excess defined as d δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 is a useful proxy for identifying secondary processes influencing the atmospheric vapor content in the evaporation condensation cycle craig 1961 machavaram and krishnamurthy 1994 for atmospheric moisture not influenced by secondary evaporative processes the d excess approximates the y intercept of the gmwl of 10 marfia et al 2004 the d excess values in irb range from 3 08 to 11 8 with an average of 7 65 for imphal river and from 5 to 3 24 with a mean of 0 4 for the loktak lake the d excess values for gw ranges from 6 21 to 12 25 with an average of 9 81 these d excess values suggest that the isotopic composition in water samples is characteristic of semi arid climate based on the isotopic signature sw can be identified into two groups as shown in fig 7a the first group belongs to the imphal river samples r1 7 which lie along the meteoric lines and show depleted isotopic compositions 5 5 and 36 9 the second group represents loktak lake and swamp samples l8 12 s13 which fall away from meteoric lines and have enriched isotopic composition 2 7 and 23 this variation in isotopic composition may infer that the degree of intensity of evaporation of meteoric water before gw recharge banner et al 1989 is higher in the loktak lake than that of the imphal river as these rivers are often recharged by gw at several reaches fig 3 a plot of the mean δ18o vs cl in sw and gw samples shows a scattered distribution fig 7b sw samples show enriched isotopic composition with low cl concentration while gw samples have depleted isotope compositions with high cl concentration indicating major impact of transpiration petrides and cartwright 2006 three gw samples g38 g40 g41 belonging to ap and dh show depleted isotopic composition with elevated cl indicating old stage of chemical evolution with older residential age the chemical evolution of gw originates from pz and reaches end members at ap and dh the mechanism of mineralization in sw and gw can also be explained by tds versus δ18o correlation fig 7c sw has low tds with enriched isotopic composition indicating the evaporation process contributing to the salinization at places farid et al 2013 gw samples show high tds with depleted isotopic composition suggesting that mineralization is controlled by both dissolution and weak evaporation process farid et al 2013 6 conclusion the present study adopts an approach combining hydrogeology hydrochemical and isotopic constituents of sw and gw to assess their interaction recharge condition and chemical evolution in the imphal river basin located in ne india the highlights of the present work are listed as follows 1 the concentrations of solutes in tds decrease according to the sequence si cl hco3 ca2 mg2 na so4 no3 k in sw and si cl hco3 ca2 na mg2 so4 k no3 in gw indicating similar ion distribution pattern 2 hydrochemical facies are more in gw ca2 cl hco3 na2 cl ca2 na ca2 cl na cl than in sw ca2 cl na cl ca2 indicating strong ion mixing process in gw 3 the pattern of flow net with water bodies illustrates three zones of sw gw interaction i the effluent zone of the upper and lower reaches of the imphal river ii the influent zone of the mid reach of the imphal river and iii the gw fed loktak lake 4 the regional gw flow direction is towards the loktak lake along with three local flow variations southeastern flow in the upper reach western flow in the middle reach and eastern flow in the lower reach 5 the gw is characterized by intermediate and late stages of chemical evolution while sw is limited to intermediate stages the intermediate stage represents simple dissolution or ion mixing process while late stage depicts reverse ion exchange process indicating end stage of groundwater evolution 6 o and h isotopic composition in sw is more enriched than gw both sw and gw show below gmwl and lmwl indicating source of water through infiltration of recent precipitation that was not subject to alteration of its isotopic composition the distribution patterns of δ2h and δ18o of sw and gw are similar indicating extensive interaction between them the slope of the evaporation line δd 4 92 δ18o 9 69 r2 0 992 is calculated as 4 92 the original composition of water before subject to evaporation is found out to be 6 58 and 42 17 the d excess values 7 65 for the imphal river 0 4 for the loktak lake and 9 81 for gw suggests that isotopic composition in water samples is characteristic of semi arid climate the isotopic constituents in sw infer that intensity of evaporation of meteoric water before gw recharge is higher in the loktak lake than river as it is often recharged by gw a plot of δ18o vs cl distinguished three gw samples g38 g40 g41 belonging to ap and dh representing end member of chemical evolution with relatively older residential age tds versus δ18o correlation indicates that sw has low tds with enriched isotopic composition indicating the evaporation process in mineralization gw is signified with high tds and depleted isotopic composition suggesting mineralization controlled by dissolution and weak evaporation process acknowledgement the authors are grateful to prof s balakrishnan and dr k srinivasamoorthy of department of earth sciences pondicherry university india for
