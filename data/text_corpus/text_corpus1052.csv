important role in soil erosion modeling which is closely related to flow rate slope gradient geomorphology friction and surface cover conditions zhang et al 2002 2003 2010 ban et al 2016 it is also used to estimate hydraulic parameters such as stream power shear stress and roughness friction zhang et al 2009 di stefano et al 2017 flow velocity measurement is useful to improve hydraulic knowledge and develop soil erosion models bagarello et al 2015 costanza et al 2018 erosive flow velocity is highly variable in soil erosion events dong et al 2014 soil erosion processes including soil detachment sediment transport and deposition directly depend on erosive flow velocity flow movement provides kinetic energy for soil erosion and thus produces waterfalls or headcuts to decrease flow velocity nadal romero et al 2013 rahma et al 2013 shi et al 2014 ban et al 2017 the expected increase in flow velocity is reduced because the energy of high slope gradient or flow rate is influenced by serious erosion thereby increasing soil roughness govers 1992 di stefano et al 2017 this fact is obviously caused by the truth that bed roughness increases with high erosion rate under high discharge and slope conditions qian et al 2016 chen et al 2018 huang et al 2018 govers 1992 and gim√©nez and govers 2001 concluded that the flow velocity on loose soil surface mainly relied on flow discharge rather than hydraulic roughness or slope gradient the flow velocity was related to flow rate by using a power function 1 v a q b where v is the flow velocity m s 1 q is the unit width flow

that of govers 1992 with different parameters govers et al 2000 modeled the flow velocity on a stony slope through a laboratory experiment with the corrected parameters nearing et al 1989 stated that the complexity of erosion processes was significant and must be optimized by minimizing the differences between the estimated and measured values nearing et al 2017 measured runoff velocity on rock cover hillslope and concluded that flow velocity was dependent on discharge rate instead of slope gradient polyakov et al 2018 still adopted discharge alone to predict flow velocity by eq 1 these studies concluded that flow velocity had a close relation with flow rate whereas slope gradient had little or no influence on flow velocity they predicted runoff velocity from flow rate by using eq 1 from govers 1992 though difference in the parameters in fact the research by nearing et al 2017 showed that the slope gradient had some influences on flow velocity though they didn t take slope gradient into account in their model in addition the designed slope gradients in their experiments were all gentle and whether the steep hillslope would change the flow velocity remained a question to be verified their experiments on flow velocity measurements were all made under the impacts of soil erosion the theoretical flow power before soil erosion remained unclear the measurement of theoretical flow velocity on hillslopes under different hydraulic conditions without the effect of soil erosion was significant to understand hydrodynamics several methods had been used by researchers to simulate the bed roughness on erosion free slope surfaces for removing the influence of erosion on water flow li and abrahams 1997 conducted experiments with a flume glued with silica sand to morphologically obtain a straight surface the sediment free water flow on a straight surface with theoretical increase in velocity from 6 4 to 71 0 cm s 1 to obtain the relation between correction factor and bed roughness dunkerley 2001 estimated the mean flow velocities through laboratory measurement on glued sand bed to simulate soil bed conditions which were applicable to many dryland soils the surface flow velocity ranged from 5 28 to 14 19 cm s 1 zhang et al 2010 investigated the effects of sediment load on correction factor using a flume glued with sediments to simulate grain roughness the velocities of sediment free and sediment laden flows were measured and the sediment free flow velocity varied from 0 56 to 1 65 m s 1 they aimed to obtain the correction factor for dye tracing method rather than establishing the regression equation in terms of flow velocity as a function of discharge rate and slope gradient dong et al 2014 compared the flow velocity on sandpapers glued with soil particles and that on soil slope to verify the grain roughness of naturally eroded surfaces their experiments showed that the sandpaper glued with soil well simulated the actual rill they conducted a laboratory experiment to measure erosive flow velocity on glued soil surface with flow rates of 12 24 and 48 l min 1 and slope gradients of 5 10 and 15 their velocity values are insufficient to model the relationship between runoff velocity and discharge rate or slope gradient previous studies on the theoretical flow velocity on glued sand bed or soil board are not concessive a regression equation for flow velocity under different flow rate and slope gradient combinations should be built to better understand the hydraulic features of erosive flow this study adopted an electrolyte tracer method under the pulse boundary conditions of lei et al 2005 to investigate the theoretical flow velocity on glued soil bed under different flow rates and slope gradients the model as a function of flow rate and slope gradient was adopted to fit with the measured flow velocity the results of sediment free velocities present the flow characteristics change trend and erosive energy 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil materials the experimental soil materials were collected from the loess plateau in shaanxi province at the location at 109 19 23 e and 36 51 30 n the experimental soil materials were air dried before being sieved with a 5 mm mesh the soil materials contained 25 62 sand 64 57 silt and 9 81 clay to be classified as a silty loam the water flow rate was controlled using a series of valves and measured using a graduated cylinder and a stopwatch prior to the experiment the slope gradient and flow rate were adjusted to the designed values the flow velocities for sediment free flow were measured when the flow became stable 2 2 soil flume the experiments were conducted on a soil flume platform of 12 m long and 3 m wide a flume of 0 5 m wide and 12 m long was built for measuring sediment transport capacity in the right side of the fig 1 a and mini flume strips of 0 40 m wide 12 m long and 0 5 m deep were built in the rest part of the platform as shown in fig 1a the gaps between the steel sheets to form the rills and the platform were sealed with 0 05 m thick clay soil materials at the bottom which were compacted to a bulk density of no less than 1 5 g cm 3 experimental soil materials were filled into each experimental mini flume to a depth of 0 4 m and a bulk density of about 1 3 g cm 3 after that a rill or ephemeral gully was dug along the mini flume central line at the soil surface to a depth of 0 05 m and a width of 0 1 m the soil surface of rectangular rills was paved by sandpapers glued with soil particles to imitate the rills made of the same soil materials an electrolyte tracer measurement system can accurately trace the salt transport in water flow along the flume to estimate flow velocity this system consisted of a computer a data logger nine electrical conductivity sensors and a solute injector as shown in fig 1b solute injection was controlled on specially designed software by clicking the button of data collection solute transport data were collected using electric conductance sensors and transmitted to the data logger the computer connected to the data logger was used to automatically calculate velocity on the above mentioned software the sensors were inserted into the rill at locations of 0 1 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 m from the solute injector the solute injector was installed at the upper end of the flume fig 1b an electromagnetic valve was adopted to control the amount of saturated potassium chloride solution into the flow a peristaltic pump was capable of supplying the flow rates from 0 17 to 5 33 10 3 m2 s 1 and when flow rates were higher at discharge rates from 10 67 to 42 67 10 3 m2 s 1 a submersible pump was used for water supply flow velocity was measured when the water flow in the rill became steady to get a wide range of unit width flow rates the flow rates in the 0 1 m wide rill covered 0 to 8 th power of 2 at 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 and 256 l min 1 or equivalent to 0 17 0 33 0 67 1 33 2 67 5 33 10 67 21 33 and 42 67 10 3 m2 s 1 and the experiments were made on five slope gradients of 8 7 17 6 26 8 36 4 and 46 6 the average velocity was computed in each treatment from three replicates to reduce random errors the total experimental runs were 135 9 unit width flow rate 5 slope gradients 3 replicates with totally 1080 135 experimental runs 8 measurement positions data points 2 3 computational method 2 3 1 regression model of flow velocity the flow velocity is a function of flow rate when the slope gradient is given as defined in eq 1 under each of the five experimental slope gradients flow velocity fitting by eq 1 produced the values of a and b the a and b values under different slope gradients were modeled using the following eq 2 the a and b would be expressed by slope gradient as follow 2 a f 1 i b f 2 i where i is slope gradient represents 8 7 17 6 26 8 36 4 and 46 6 2 3 2 flow velocity sensitivity flow velocity sensitivity chen et al 2019 was calculated to analyze the effects of flow rate and slope gradient on flow velocity as defined by 3 sv i o Œ¥ o Œ¥ i where sv is the sensitivity i represents the input value flow rate or slope gradient and o is the flow velocity the sv in eq 3 reflects the influence of different input values on the output results 2 3 3 resistance to water flow resistance to flow is quantified using manning s n 4a n v 1 i 1 2 h 2 3 4b v n 1 i 1 2 h 2 3 where n is manning roughness coefficient and h is water flow depth m for the equations above the unit width flow rate is expressed as 5 q v h equation 4b is substituted into eq 5 gives 6 h n 3 5 q 2 5 i 3 10 introducing eq 6 into eq 4a yields 7 v n 3 5 q 2 5 i 3 10 equation 7 shows that the flow velocity is a function of roughness flow rate and slope gradient the following is computed based on the partial derivative of eq 7 with respect to unit width flow rate and slope gradient 8a v q 2 5 n 3 5 q 3 5 i 3 10 8b v i 3 10 n 3 5 q 2 5 i 7 10 the eqs 8a and 8b reflect the change rate of flow velocity with flow rate and slope gradient the statistical analysis was performed by origin originlab inc washington usa to estimate the parameters in eq 7 the pearson correlation and significance differences were done by spss spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 flow velocity and regression model the experimentally measured flow velocities were presented in table 1 measured by different sensors located at distances 5 0 to 12 0 m from the uppermost end the mean flow velocity in table 1 increased from 0 31 to 3 34 m s 1 with flow rate and slope gradient the flow velocities under different experimental treatments were graphically shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows the flow velocities as functions of unit width flow rates under different slope gradients different colors represent the slope gradients from 8 7 to 46 6 flow velocity strongly depends on unit width flow rate thereby indicating its important impact flow velocity increases notably with unit width flow rate the flow velocity also relies on slope gradient the growth rate of flow velocity under each slope gradient increases gradually with flow rate the measured flow velocities listed in table 1 are fitted by eq 1 the fitted curves are shown in fig 2 with the fitted parameters a and b in eq 1 listed in table 2 the regression model shows a good correlation between flow velocity and unit width flow rate under different slope conditions with r2 ranging from 0 978 to 0 994 the high accuracy values indicate that the model given by eq 1 can accurately predict the flow velocity with unit width flow rate under different slope gradients the parameters a and b values under different slope gradients are regressed and listed in table 3 the improved model was determined and expressed by the best fitting formula as shown below 9 v 5 850 e 1 197 i q 0 608 i 2 0 342 i 0 381 the measured data was regressed by eq 1 without taking slope gradient into consideration parameters a and b were 0 759 and 0 343 with r2 of 0 882 moreover the data predicted by eq 9 was compared with the measured data and r2 was 0 985 fig 3 furthermore the flow velocity was also calculated by eq 7 and the output was the same as the average value listed in table 1 which verified the validity of model formula these result shows that the improved model given by eq 9 which takes slope gradient into account is reasonable and can produce better regression result than eq 1 3 2 flow velocity sensitivity to slope gradient and unit width flow rates flow velocity sensitivity calculated by eq 3 is shown in tables 4a and 4b to show the increasing tendency of flow velocity with slope gradient and unit width flow rates the positive value means flow velocity has the same tendency as increasing slope gradient and unit width flow rates most values in table 4a were positive showed flow velocity increased with slope gradient except for several conditions the systemetic trend that flow velocity sensitivity to slope declined with unit width flow rates increased from 0 67 to 42 67 10 3 m2 s 1 under these circumstances flow velocity sensitivity was the lowest when slope gradient increased from 17 6 to 26 8 this finding showed that slope gradient had significant influence on flow velocity however the flow velocity was more sensitive to slope conditions ranging from17 6 to 46 6 all in all slope gradient had critical influence on flow velocity flow velocity sensitivity to unit width flow rates at each slope listed in table 4b slightly fluctuated showing that the sensitivity of velocity to flow rate was similar at different slopes the sensitivity values were stochastic illustrating flow velocity was not sensitive to flow rate the positive value showed the increasing trend of flow velocity with unit width flow rates furthermore the change rate of flow velocity was calculated by eqs 8a and 8b as shown in fig 4 the flow velocity changed with flow rate and slope gradient and the rate showed different tendency and degree the maximum and minimum change rates with flow rate were 1082 35 and 18 56 with increasing flow rate low flow rate made flow velocity increase more rapidly than the higher however the flow velocity change rate ranged from 6 83 to 0 30 with higher slope gradient these results showed that flow velocity increased with flow rate and slope gradient but the rate of rise declined gradually besides flow velocity mainly relied on flow rate rather than slope gradient for the data in fig 4 with a considerable magnitude 3 3 values of manning s n the calculated values of manning s n by eq 4a are given in table 5 the value found for larger unit width flow rates was slightly higher than for smaller conditions water flow depth in table 1 increased with flow rate but decreased with slope gradient which led to the roughness listed in table 5 fluctuations in velocities were found between the low and high flow rate conditions for different cases of slope gradient and showed that flow velocity closely related with flow rate slope gradient and roughness the pearson correlation analysis had been done to investigate the impact of flow rate slope gradient water flow depth and bed roughness on flow velocity as shown in table 6 all the variables were correlated to flow velocity but flow depth and bed roughness were removed from the main variables during the stepwise regression process through the significance test the significance test also illustrated the direct contributions of unit width flow rate and slope gradient to flow velocity which were 0 868 and 0 261 respectively the greatest effect of variable on flow velocity was flow rate and the second was slope gradient the indirect influences of flow rate and slope gradient on flow velocity through bed roughness also can be calculated flow rate and slope gradient indirectly affected velocity through bed roughness the bed roughness was controlled mainly by flow rate which was 0 657 0 757 0 868 meaning that flow rate and slope gradient directly or indirectly affected flow velocity through bed roughness 4 discussion 4 1 flow velocity sensitivity the higher slope gradient causes the increase in flow velocity indicating that flow velocity is inextricably linked to flow rate and slope gradient this result contradicts with other studies govers 1992 and gim√©nez and govers 2001 concluded that the flow velocity on loose soil surfaces mainly relied on flow discharge rather than slope gradient nearing et al 1999 conducted an experiment on a coarse loamy soil surface with flow rate increasing from 9 6 to 57 6 l min 1 they obtained a similar conclusion and an equation similar to that of govers 1992 with different parameters they all concluded that slope did not influence the flow velocity in rills govers 1992 stated that velocity was unaffected by slope and was attributed to bed roughness where it countrer balanced the trend of flow velocity with the increase in slope gradient no systematic slope was set up in their experiments and flow velocity was acquired from the gentle slope gradient ranging from 2 to 10 these findings may be caused by rough and irregular beds increase in erosion and gentle slopes foster et al 1984 rauws 1989 nearing et al 2017 gim√©nez and govers 2001 showed that rill bed morphology and flow conditions caused the absence of slope influence on flow velocity the simulated sandpaper rill bed glued with soil material provided the experimental conditions to ensure the consistency of bed form roughness morphology and bed shape the slope in this study was relatively steep and showed an apparent influence on flow velocity slope gradient was usually considered as a key factor that affected soil erosion under most circumstances wischmeier and smith 1978 zhuang et al 2018 the influence of slope on the relationship between flow velocity and discharge may be presented in conditions where soils are strongly consolidated thereby limiting the ability of rills to change channels takken et al 1998 in this research it can be concluded that the slope gradient is equally important with flow rate for flow velocity variation 4 2 model verification the regression model was verified by data from other research including li and abramhams 1997 zhang et al 2010 and dong et al 2014 li and abramhams 1997 tested the sediment free water flow velocity at three slopes of 1 2 3 5 and 5 5 and unit discharge ranged from 1 69 to 49 59 m2 s 1 dye tracing method was used to acquire the theorical velocity of overland flow by zhang et al 2010 in laboratory the mean velocity in a glued hydraulic flume was tested under conditions of slope gradient varied from 8 7 to 34 2 and flow rate from 16 to 126 l min 1 the experiments of dong et al 2014 adopted three flow discharges 12 24 and 48 l min 1 and three slope gradients 5 10 and 15 their experimental conditions were substituted into eq 9 to simulate the erosive flow velocity and verify the formula applicability flow velocity in that research was compared with simulated data as shown in fig 5 the overall results indicated that the unit conversion of formula calculation must be exercised before calculating the estimated flow velocity measurements of flow velocity by li and abramhams 1997 zhang et al 2010 and dong et al 2014 and the simulated value showed a good linear correlation fig 5 with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 853 0 932 and 0 954 and a linear fitting parameter of 1 091 0 923 and 1 632 this high r2 means eq 9 has a significantly high degree of accuracy to estimate flow velocity in fig 5 the ratio between different groups suggested that the dye tracing value was higher or lower than the value fitted by the electrolyte tracing method which indicated that the improved model was an efficient formula to estimate flow velocity it is well known that the mean flow velocity estimated by dye tracing technique is converted from measured velocity by the proportional coefficient which varies under different conditions luk and merz 1992 normally the proportional coefficient which varies approximately from 0 30 to 0 86 emmett 1970 luk and merz 1992 is affected by several factors such as velocity surface roughness flow regime and erosion emmett 1970 li and abrahams 1997 though the correction factor for dye tracing method in zhang et al 2010 was adopted the mean velocity was still not certainly the truth value these lead to the linear fitting parameter in fig 5 and the difference between two methods thereby the improved model had enough accuracy to predict flow velocity further studies with systematic flow rate and slope gradient are needed to quantify the potential erosion flow regime or surface roughness effects of hydraulic conditions on flow velocity 4 3 bed roughness govers 1992 suggested that flow velocity increase on rough rill bed was much less than that on smooth bed or it might not be influenced by slope gradient in an eroding rill owing to increase in bed roughness the absence of slope in general function eq 1 mainly induced by bed roughness in eroded rills which increased with slope gradient and counterbalanced the change tendency of flow velocity with slope gradient abrahams et al 1996 huang et al 2020 the bed roughness generally increased with slope gradient in an eroded rill and the flow velocity increased with flow rate alone was attributed to the opposing relationship between bed roughness and flow velocity govers et al 2000 many experiments conducted in eroded rills had showed that the flow velocity would not significantly increase with flow rate or slope gradient as a result of the increase in roughness with higher flow rate and slope gradient in eroded rills nearing et al 1999 this research was conducted in noneroded flume and the flow velocity obviously increased with flow rate and slope gradient fig 2 a higher flow rate on a rougher bed would lead to a deeper flow depth and thus a greater roughness in this study the experimental sediment was evenly glued on the surface of the flume bed so that the roughness caused by flume bed kept constant in all the experiment sessions therefore the flow rate or the slope gradient adopted in this research may influence bed roughness through flow depth and velocity as listed in tables 1 and 5 in addition the relationship deduced in eq 7 showed flow velocity was a function of bed roughness flow rate and slope gradient in theory this fact proved the improved model given by eq 9 was reasonable to relate flow velocity to flow rate and slope gradient this finding contradicted govers conclusion that slope gradient had little effect on flow velocity and explained why the measured data tendency in fig 2 and relationship in eq 9 5 conclusion the mean flow velocity of sediment free water flow on a sandpaper surface glued with loess soil particles under different flow rates and slope gradients was measured through salt solute tracing method in this study a systemic measurements of water flow velocity on different slope gradients and flow rates were made the measured results illustrated that flow velocity increased with flow rate and slope gradient and the sensitivity to slope gradient exhibited different trends at different flow rates flow velocity mainly relied on unit width flow rate with decreased change rate followed by slope gradient the measured data was fitted with a power function of unit width flow rate and the model parameters were functionally related to slope gradient to present the empirical flow velocity relationship with flow discharge and slope gradient the improved model was verified using the existing data in the literature and showed a significantly higher accuracy to estimate flow velocity the relationship allows the prediction of flow velocity from unit width flow discharge and slope gradient credit

a computer a data logger nine electrical conductivity sensors and a solute injector as shown in fig 1b solute injection was controlled on specially designed software by clicking the button of data collection solute transport data were collected using electric conductance sensors and transmitted to the data logger the computer connected to the data logger was used to automatically calculate velocity on the above mentioned software the sensors were inserted into the rill at locations of 0 1 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 m from the solute injector the solute injector was installed at the upper end of the flume fig 1b an electromagnetic valve was adopted to control the amount of saturated potassium chloride solution into the flow a peristaltic pump was capable of supplying the flow rates from 0 17 to 5 33 10 3 m2 s 1 and when flow rates were higher at discharge rates from 10 67 to 42 67 10 3 m2 s 1 a submersible pump was used for water supply flow velocity was measured when the water flow in the rill became steady to get a wide range of unit width flow rates the flow rates in the 0 1 m wide rill covered 0 to 8 th power of 2 at 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 and 256 l min 1 or equivalent to 0 17 0 33 0 67 1 33 2 67 5 33 10 67 21 33 and 42 67 10 3 m2 s 1 and the experiments were made on five slope gradients of 8 7 17 6 26 8 36 4 and 46 6 the average velocity was computed in each treatment from three replicates to reduce random errors the total experimental runs were 135 9 unit width flow rate 5 slope gradients 3 replicates with totally 1080 135 experimental runs 8 measurement positions data points 2 3 computational method 2 3 1 regression model of flow velocity the flow velocity is a function of flow rate when the slope gradient is given as defined in eq 1 under each of the five experimental slope gradients flow velocity fitting by eq 1 produced the values of a and b the a and b values under different slope gradients were modeled using the following eq 2 the a and b would be expressed by slope gradient as follow 2 a f 1 i b f 2 i where i is slope gradient represents 8 7 17 6 26 8 36 4 and 46 6 2 3 2 flow velocity sensitivity flow velocity sensitivity chen et al 2019 was calculated to analyze the effects of flow rate and slope gradient on flow velocity as defined by 3 sv i o Œ¥ o Œ¥ i where sv is the sensitivity i represents the input value flow rate or slope gradient and o is the flow velocity the sv in eq 3 reflects the influence of different input values on the output results 2 3 3 resistance to water flow resistance to flow is quantified using manning s n 4a n v 1 i 1 2 h 2 3 4b v n 1 i 1 2 h 2 3 where n is manning roughness coefficient and h is water flow depth m for the equations above the unit width flow rate is expressed as 5 q v h equation 4b is substituted into eq 5 gives 6 h n 3 5 q 2 5 i 3 10 introducing eq 6 into eq 4a yields 7 v n 3 5 q 2 5 i 3 10 equation 7 shows that the flow velocity is a function of roughness flow rate and slope gradient the following is computed based on the partial derivative of eq 7 with respect to unit width flow rate and slope gradient 8a v q 2 5 n 3 5 q 3 5 i 3 10 8b v i

estimate the parameters in eq 7 the pearson correlation and significance differences were done by spss spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 flow velocity and regression model the experimentally measured flow velocities were presented in table 1 measured by different sensors located at distances 5 0 to 12 0 m from the uppermost end the mean flow velocity in table 1 increased from 0 31 to 3 34 m s 1 with flow rate and slope gradient the flow velocities under different experimental treatments were graphically shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows the flow velocities as functions of unit width flow rates under different slope gradients different colors represent the slope gradients from 8 7 to 46 6 flow velocity strongly depends on unit width flow rate thereby indicating its important impact flow velocity increases notably with unit width flow rate the flow velocity also relies on slope gradient the growth rate of flow velocity under each slope gradient increases gradually with flow rate the measured flow velocities listed in table 1 are fitted by eq 1 the fitted curves are shown in fig 2 with the fitted parameters a and b in eq 1 listed in table 2 the regression model shows a good correlation between flow velocity and unit width flow rate under different slope conditions with r2 ranging from 0 978 to 0 994 the high accuracy values indicate that the model given by eq 1 can accurately predict the flow velocity with unit width flow rate under different slope gradients the parameters a and b values under different slope gradients are regressed and listed in table 3 the improved model was determined and expressed by the best fitting formula as shown below 9 v 5 850 e 1 197 i q 0 608 i 2 0 342 i 0 381 the measured data was regressed by eq 1 without taking slope gradient into consideration parameters a and b were 0 759 and 0 343 with r2 of 0 882 moreover the data predicted by eq 9 was compared with the measured data and r2 was 0 985 fig 3 furthermore the flow velocity was also calculated by eq 7 and the output was the same as the average value listed in table 1 which verified the validity of model formula these result shows that the improved model given by eq 9 which takes slope gradient into account is reasonable and can produce better regression result than eq 1 3 2 flow velocity sensitivity to slope gradient and unit width flow rates flow velocity sensitivity calculated by eq 3 is shown in tables 4a and 4b to show the increasing tendency of flow velocity with slope gradient and unit width flow rates the positive value means flow velocity has the same tendency as increasing slope gradient and unit width flow rates most values in table 4a were positive showed flow velocity increased with slope gradient except for several conditions the systemetic trend that flow velocity sensitivity to slope declined with unit width flow rates increased from 0 67 to 42 67 10 3 m2 s 1 under these circumstances flow velocity sensitivity was the lowest when slope gradient increased from 17 6 to 26 8 this finding showed that slope gradient had significant influence on flow velocity however the flow velocity was more sensitive to slope conditions ranging from17 6 to 46 6 all in all slope gradient had critical influence on flow velocity flow velocity sensitivity to unit width flow rates at each slope listed in table 4b slightly fluctuated showing that the sensitivity of velocity to flow rate was similar at different slopes the sensitivity values were stochastic illustrating flow velocity was not sensitive to flow rate the positive value showed the increasing trend of flow velocity with unit width flow rates furthermore the change rate of flow velocity was calculated by eqs 8a and 8b as shown in fig 4 the flow velocity changed with flow rate and slope gradient and the rate showed different tendency and degree the maximum and minimum change rates with flow rate were 1082 35 and 18 56 with increasing flow rate low flow rate made flow velocity increase more rapidly than the higher however the flow velocity change rate ranged from 6 83 to 0 30 with higher slope gradient these results showed that flow velocity increased with flow rate and slope gradient but the rate of rise declined gradually besides flow velocity mainly relied on flow rate rather than slope gradient for the data in fig 4 with a considerable magnitude 3 3 values of manning s n the calculated values of manning s n by eq 4a are given in table 5 the value found for larger unit width flow rates was slightly higher than for smaller conditions water flow depth in table 1 increased with flow rate but decreased with slope gradient which led to the roughness listed in table 5 fluctuations in velocities were found between the low and high flow rate conditions for different cases of slope gradient and showed that flow velocity closely related with flow rate slope gradient and roughness the pearson correlation analysis had been done to investigate the impact of flow rate slope gradient water flow depth and bed roughness on flow velocity as shown in table 6 all the variables were correlated to flow velocity but flow depth and bed roughness were removed from the main variables during the stepwise regression process through the significance test the significance test also illustrated the direct contributions of unit width flow rate and slope gradient to flow velocity which were 0 868 and 0 261 respectively the greatest effect of variable on flow velocity was flow rate and the second was slope gradient the indirect influences of flow rate and slope gradient on flow velocity through bed roughness also can be calculated flow rate and slope gradient indirectly affected velocity through bed roughness the bed roughness was controlled mainly by flow rate which was 0 657 0 757 0 868 meaning that flow rate and slope gradient directly or indirectly affected flow velocity through bed roughness 4 discussion 4 1 flow velocity sensitivity the higher slope gradient causes the increase in flow velocity indicating that flow velocity is inextricably linked to flow rate and slope gradient this result contradicts with other studies govers 1992 and gim√©nez and govers 2001 concluded that the flow velocity on loose soil surfaces mainly relied on flow discharge rather than slope gradient nearing et al 1999 conducted an experiment on a coarse loamy soil surface with flow rate increasing from 9 6 to 57 6 l min 1 they obtained a similar conclusion and an equation similar to that of govers 1992 with different parameters they all concluded that slope did not influence the flow velocity in rills govers 1992 stated that velocity was unaffected by slope and was attributed to bed roughness where it countrer balanced the trend of flow velocity with the increase in slope gradient no systematic slope was set up in their experiments and flow velocity was acquired from the gentle slope gradient ranging from 2 to 10 these findings may be caused by rough and irregular beds increase in erosion and gentle slopes foster et al 1984 rauws 1989 nearing et al 2017 gim√©nez and govers 2001 showed that rill bed morphology and flow conditions caused the absence of slope influence on flow velocity the simulated sandpaper rill bed glued with soil material provided the experimental conditions to ensure the consistency of bed form roughness morphology and bed shape the slope in this study was relatively steep and showed an apparent influence on flow velocity slope gradient was usually considered as a key factor that affected soil erosion under most circumstances wischmeier and smith 1978 zhuang et al 2018 the influence of slope on the relationship between flow velocity and discharge may be presented in conditions where soils are strongly consolidated thereby limiting the ability of rills to change channels takken et al 1998 in this research it can be concluded that the slope gradient is equally important with flow rate for flow velocity variation 4 2 model verification the regression model was verified by data from other research including li and abramhams 1997 zhang et al 2010 and dong et al 2014 li and abramhams 1997 tested the sediment free water flow velocity at three slopes of 1 2 3 5 and 5 5 and unit discharge ranged from 1 69 to 49 59 m2 s 1 dye tracing method was used to acquire the theorical velocity of overland flow by zhang et al 2010 in laboratory the mean velocity in a glued hydraulic flume was tested under conditions of slope gradient varied from 8 7 to 34 2 and flow rate from 16 to 126 l min 1 the experiments of dong et al 2014 adopted three flow discharges 12 24 and 48 l min 1 and three slope gradients 5 10 and 15 their experimental conditions were substituted into eq 9 to simulate the erosive flow velocity and verify the formula applicability flow velocity in that research was compared with simulated data as shown in fig 5 the overall results indicated that the unit conversion of formula calculation must be exercised before calculating the estimated flow velocity measurements of flow velocity by li and abramhams 1997 zhang et al 2010 and dong et al 2014 and the simulated value showed a good linear correlation fig 5 with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 853 0 932 and 0 954 and a linear fitting parameter of 1 091 0 923 and 1 632 this high r2 means eq 9 has a significantly high degree of accuracy to estimate flow velocity in fig 5 the ratio between different groups suggested that the dye tracing value was higher or lower than the value fitted by the electrolyte tracing method which indicated that the improved model was an efficient formula to estimate flow velocity it is well known that the mean flow velocity estimated by dye tracing technique is converted from measured velocity by the proportional coefficient which varies under different conditions luk and merz 1992 normally the proportional coefficient which varies approximately from 0 30 to 0 86 emmett 1970 luk and merz 1992 is affected by several factors such as velocity surface roughness flow regime and erosion emmett 1970 li and abrahams 1997 though the correction factor for dye tracing method in zhang et al 2010 was adopted the mean velocity was still not certainly the truth value these lead to the linear fitting parameter in fig 5 and the difference between two methods thereby the improved model had enough accuracy to predict flow velocity further studies with systematic flow rate and slope gradient are needed to quantify the potential erosion flow regime or surface roughness effects of hydraulic conditions on flow velocity 4 3 bed roughness govers 1992 suggested that flow velocity increase on rough rill bed was much less than that on smooth bed or it might not be influenced by slope gradient in an eroding rill owing to increase in bed roughness the absence of slope in general function eq 1 mainly induced by bed roughness in eroded rills which increased with slope gradient and counterbalanced the change tendency of flow velocity with slope gradient abrahams et al 1996 huang et al 2020 the bed roughness generally increased with slope gradient in an eroded rill and the flow velocity increased with flow rate alone was attributed to the opposing relationship between bed roughness and flow velocity govers et al 2000 many experiments conducted in eroded rills had showed that the flow velocity would not significantly increase with flow rate or slope gradient as a result of the increase in roughness with higher flow rate and slope gradient in eroded rills nearing et al 1999 this research was conducted in noneroded flume and the flow velocity obviously increased with flow rate and slope gradient fig 2 a higher flow rate on a rougher bed would lead to a deeper flow depth and thus a greater roughness in this study the experimental sediment was evenly glued on the surface of the flume bed so that the roughness caused by flume bed kept constant in all the experiment sessions therefore the flow rate or the slope gradient adopted in this research may influence bed roughness through flow depth and velocity as listed in tables 1 and 5 in addition the relationship deduced in eq 7 showed flow velocity was a function of bed roughness flow rate and slope gradient in theory this fact proved the improved model given by eq 9 was reasonable to relate flow velocity to flow rate and slope gradient this finding contradicted govers conclusion that slope gradient had little effect on flow velocity and explained why the measured data tendency in fig 2 and relationship in eq 9 5 conclusion the mean flow velocity of sediment free water flow on a sandpaper surface glued with loess soil particles under different flow rates and slope gradients was measured through salt solute tracing method in this study a systemic measurements of water flow velocity on different slope gradients and flow rates were made the measured results illustrated that flow velocity increased with flow rate and slope gradient and the sensitivity to slope gradient exhibited different trends at different flow rates flow velocity mainly relied on unit width flow rate with decreased change rate followed by slope gradient the measured data was fitted with a power function of unit width flow rate and the model parameters were functionally related to slope gradient to present the empirical flow velocity relationship with flow discharge and slope gradient the improved model was verified using the existing data in the literature and showed a significantly higher accuracy to estimate flow velocity the relationship allows the prediction of flow velocity from unit width flow discharge and slope gradient credit

5261,at present many conceptual water balance models have been proposed on monthly annual and mean annual timescales with the increasing applications of these models an emerging question is whether the water balance models on different timescales have some commonalities and can be integrated to this end this study established and applied a practical unified framework of water balance models that can be applied to different timescales the framework was first developed on monthly timescale where the water balance was captured by combining the abcd model and budyko hypothesis with four parameters then this framework was extended to annual and mean annual timescales under which certain parameters can be eliminated or assumed to be certain values to be specific on the annual timescale the water balance was simulated by a budyko type model incorporating the water storage change on the mean annual timescale the water balance was further simplified into a budyko type model which neglects the water storage change thus all of the three typical water balance models on different timescales were unified to a general framework the models were applied to 437 catchments in the contiguous united states with satisfying results achieved considering the water storage changes can improve the performance of annual water balance models in regions with clear interannual carrying water storage furthermore the water balance models on different timescales share common supply and demand limits which is similar to budyko hypothesis keywords water balance models timescales budyko hypothesis water storage change 1 introduction water is a global resource that is moved between different media and plays an irreplaceable role in human lives understanding the mechanisms of water movement is imperative for practices of water resources management flood prediction and wastewater treatment builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 gao et al 2019 luke et al 2017 sivapalan et al 2011 conservation of mass is a globally recognized physical law that is applicable in water movement regardless of spatial and temporal scales however the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow and evapotranspiration is not only controlled by the conservation of mass but also subject to many other temporal and geologic natural factors dunne and black 1970 jetse et al 2010 todini 2007 wu et al 2018 in addition human activities have greatly increased the complexity of water movement and the hydrological connectivity leaving the accurate description of the water cycle a challenging and crucial task for hydrological and environmental researches milly et al 2008 milly and dunne 2017 at the catchment scale a widely used tool for the understanding of hydrological cycle is water balance model which quantitatively describes the water cycle at catchment scale zhang et al 2008 for different locations with special site characteristics numerous water balance models have been proposed to incorporate snowfall glacier vegetation and topography builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 carmona et al 2014 henley et al 2011 lindstrom et al 1997 ponce and shetty 1995 sivapalan et al 2011 wang et al 2016 apart from the spatial representativeness timescale is another critical aspect because the movement of water is determined by various factors which are subject to the variations in timescales ning et al 2019 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2008 for example the catchment water storage change can be neglected on mean annual timescale but cannot on monthly timescale greve et al 2016 likewise the precipitation intensity and spatial pattern greatly influence the daily water balance but may have little influence on the mean annual timescale beven and binley 1992 to consider the impact of timescale on the water balance different water balance models have been independently developed for monthly annual and mean annual timescales among water balance models on monthly timescale there are two components in general the first is the carrying water storage between time steps and the second is the infiltration component even though the forms of monthly water balance models vary with climatic conditions and locations these aforementioned two components are common for an effective monthly water balance model such as the abcd model thomas 1981 hydrologiska byr√•ns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model hagg et al 2007 lindstrom et al 1997 zhang and lindstrom 1997 and dynamic water balance model zhang et al 2008 among them the abcd model is a widely used tool al lafta et al 2013 fernandez et al 2000 martinez and gupta 2010 thomas 1981 and proved to have the same physical basis as the scs model and long term budyko equation wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 fast flow generation baseflow soil moisture groundwater storage and evapotranspiration can be appropriately estimated using only four parameters in the abcd model however the physical rationale and validity of the abcd models deserve further applications the key equation in the abcd model has been used as a budyko type equation wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 how to connect abcd model and budyko model is an important issue for understanding hydrological processes across different timescales annual water balance model is usually simpler than the monthly water balance model and includes less parameters for example the ponce shetty equation which is a two stage annual water balance model only contains four parameters with the neglect of water storage change ponce and shetty 1995 despite of its simplicity the ponce shetty equation still got acceptable results in the united states sivapalan et al 2011 and the united kingdom gnann et al 2019 apart from that budyko type equation which is initially used on mean annual timescale with only one or two parameters is also applied to annual timescale by assuming that the interannual water storage change is negligible carmona et al 2014 however berghuijs and woods 2016 shown the existence of space time asymmetry in budyko spaces and stated the asymmetry may underestimate the water yield assessment wu et al 2018 also demonstrated that soil moisture or water storage change is a non negligible factor when applying the budyko framework to annual or monthly timescale therefore incorporating water storage change to budyko model is required to achieve a more accurate annual water balance model water balance on mean annual timescale is mainly described by budyko type equation which is an empirical equation reflecting the supply and demand limits of water resources budyko 1974 first proposed a non parametric form of budyko equation which was then improved by incorporating several parameters to express geologic climatic or human activities impacts choudhury 1999 greve et al 2016 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008a zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 though a consensus is yet to be reached regarding the control factors in budyko type equations most studies acknowledged that aridity index i e the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation is the core climatic factor determining the water balance on mean annual timescale berghuijs et al 2017 gnann et al 2019 greve et al 2015 yang et al 2014a yang et al 2014b apart from the water balance model specified for a single timescale some studies showed that the conceptual water balance models on different timescales share some common assumptions for example zhang et al 2008 derived a dynamic water balance model on monthly timescale from the concept of budyko hypothesis and compared the water balance models on different timescales yang et al 2008b proposed an analytical form of intra annual water balance model on short and long term periods and documented the impact of soil moisture wang and tang 2014 has analyzed the commonalities between darwinian hydrological models over event monthly and mean annual timescales demonstrating that they have the same generalized proportionality hypothesis furthermore wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2016 derived that proportionality hypothesis is a special case of maximum entropy production and proved the abcd model scs model l vovich formulations and budyko model share the same maximum entropy production theory even though the theoretical assumptions of water balance model on different timescales have been successfully unified by previous studies wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 a practical framework that can be used over different timescales remains rare and deserves further applications to this end the abcd model and budyko type equations were combined to derived a unified framework with varying number of parameters on different timescales the unified framework has four two and one parameter on monthly annual and mean annual timescales to suit the varying complexity of hydrological processes the unified framework was then applied in 437 catchments in contiguous united states conus to demonstrate the validity of unified framework on different timescales some catchment properties that significantly correlated with the performance of unified framework were also analyzed to give some guidance for future improvements and physical understanding of water balance models 2 methods 2 1 unified framework here a unified framework for conceptual water balance models was proposed by combining the abcd model thomas 1981 and the concept of budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 fu 1981 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 the unified framework includes two stages surface partitioning stage and groundwater storing stage a schematic diagram of the unified framework is shown in fig 1 a in the first stage precipitation p t and initial soil moisture s t 1 keep inputting water to the storage which produces direct streamflow q d t actual evapotranspiration e t recharge r t and updated soil moisture storage s t at the end of time interval t the water balance can be written as 1 p t s t 1 q d t e t r t s t then the water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t are defined by following the abcd model as 2 w t p t s t 1 3 y t e t s t where water availability w t represents the supply of water and evapotranspiration opportunity y t represents the amount of water that can be evaporated the possible maximum value for evapotranspiration opportunity y t is the potential evapotranspiration plus maximum soil moisture storage capacity then the summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum soil moisture storage is set as a parameter b in this framework the definition of parameter b is somewhat different from that in the abcd model where b is the upper bound of storage in the unsaturated zone above groundwater table with reference to budyko type equations budyko 1974 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 we can assume w t and y t satisfy the supply and demand limits in very dry conditions the precipitation and soil moisture are very small i e w t b b w t and nearly all of the available water is evaporated in this case the evapotranspiration opportunity y t is limited by the supply of water w t and approaches to the water availability y t w t in very wet condition there is a lot of water that greatly exceeds potential evapotranspiration opportunity i e w t b b w t 0 then the evapotranspiration opportunity y t is limited by the demand of evapotranspiration and storage capacity b and approaches to the its potential maximum value y t b therefore the supply and demand limits lead to the following hypothesis 4 s u p p l y l i m i t y t w t a s b w t v e r y d r y c o n d i t i o n s 5 d e m a n d l i m i t y t b a s b w t 0 v e r y w e t c o n d i t i o n s it can be noticed that w t y t and the ratio Œ≥ t b w t is analogous to p t e t and aridity index œÜ t pe t p t in budyko type equations respectively but our study incorporates the soil water storage s t as a result the relationship between y t and w t can be modeled using the budyko type equations as 6 y t w t b k i b w t a where bk i is the budyko equation i 1 2 3 4 which are represented by four commonly used budyko type equations including the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008a the fu equation fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 the zhang equation zhang et al 2001 and the wang tang equation wang and tang 2014 b w t is the ratio of potential demand to supply and termed general aridity index Œ≥ t because of the incorporation of water storage these four budyko type equations all contain a parameter i e a see table 1 controlling the relationship between y t w t and b w t it is noteworthy that the wang tang equation is the same as the equation in the original abcd model and was used a benchmark wang and tang 2014 assuming the change rate of soil moisture storage s is proportional to the potential evapotranspiration pe we obtained that thomas 1981 7 ds dt p e s b the potential evapotranspiration p e is determined by solar radiation wind speed and temperature which may not significantly change between two consecutive time steps therefore assuming pe t 1 pe t and s t 1 y t following the abcd model we can estimate the soil moisture storage s t after solving the differential equation 7 8 s t y t e x p pe t b the difference between water availability and evapotranspiration opportunity w t y t equals to the sum of direct runoff q d t and recharge r t then the recharge r t is estimated as a portion of quantity w t y t using a parameter c and the remaining is direct runoff q d t 9 r t c w t y t 10 q d t 1 c w t y t in the second stage the recharge r t replenishes the groundwater storage g t and then a portion of ground water constitutes the baseflow q b t 11 q b t d g t where g t is groundwater storage at the end of time step t parameter d is the ratio of groundwater becoming baseflow according to the groundwater balance we obtain following equations 12 g t g t 1 r t d g t plugging equation 9 to equation 12 we obtained 13 g t g t 1 c w t y t 1 d therefore the streamflow q t is calculated as the sum of direct flow q d t and baseflow q b t as 14 q t q d t q b t 1 c w t y t d g t a unified framework with four parameters i e a b c and d for water balance was established based on the abcd model with the concept of budyko hypothesis incorporated 2 2 applications to different timescales this framework is a little complicated for models on annual or mean annual timescales compared with other similar studies carmona et al 2014 chen et al 2013 ponce and shetty 1995 zhang et al 2008 some parts for example groundwater and water storage change may not be necessary for mean annual timescale redundant parameters may bring the difficulty for model convergency and overfitting therefore the unified framework sustains its form on monthly timescale but will be simplified on the annual and mean annual timescales with certain components neglected see fig 1 the parameters in the applications of unified framework to different timescales is summarized in table 2 2 2 1 model on monthly timescale this unified framework is directly applied to the water balance models on monthly timescale without any modification because all of the parts cannot be neglected with reference to the abcd model martinez and gupta 2010 thomas 1981 apart from equation 6 which is described by budyko hypothesis the other parts of this framework are the same as the abcd model in the application of a specific case the parameters can be estimated based on the least squared errors between observed and simulated values the first several years need to be used to train the initial values of soil moisture storage s 0 and groundwater storage g 0 and the remaining years can be used for parameters estimation specific information about training period and parameters estimation are provided in section 4 1 2 2 2 model on annual timescale previous studies indicated that the change in water storage is a main factor controlling the errors for water balance models at annual timescale istanbulluoglu et al 2012 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 therefore the annual water balance model emphasizes the water storage change and simplifies the groundwater component the surface water and groundwater are integrated and the soil moisture storage s t is generalized to water storage to represent the total influence of surface and ground water a schematic diagram of annual water balance model is shown in fig 1 c equations 1 to 8 in the unified framework are still valid on annual timescale the difference w t y t between water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t directly equals to streamflow q t and equations 9 to 14 are simplified to 15 q t w t y t thus water balance model on annual timescales includes two parameters a and b parameters c and d vanish because groundwater component is neglected on the annual timescale from a mathematical point of view parameters c and d on monthly timescale are equal to zero the first several years should be used as a warm up period to train initial soil water storage s o 2 2 3 model on mean annual timescale in a longer timescale e g ten years the water storage change is negligible jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 then the water storage s t in the unified framework is assumed to be a constant and can be eliminated the water availability w t is simplified to precipitation p t and the evapotranspiration opportunity y t is simplified to actual evapotranspiration e t parameter b representing summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum water storage capacity equal to potential evapotranspiration pe t thus the relationship between precipitation p t and actual evapotranspiration e t is modelled using a budyko type equation 16 e t p t b k i pe t p t a then based on the conservation of mass the discharge q t equals to the difference between precipitation p t and actual evapotranspiration e t 17 q t p t e t p t 1 b k i pe t p t a a schematic diagram of mean annual water balance model is shown in fig 1 d after simplification the mean annual water balance model equals to budyko type equation that is shown in table 1 parameters c d and water storage s t equal to zero on mean annual timescale we can find that with the increase in timescales the water balance models become simpler there are four two and one parameter in the water balance models on monthly annual and mean annual timescales respectively table 2 even though the water balance models on different timescales include different assumptions the core assumption is the same which is the concept of supply and demand limits in budyko type equations in equation 4 and 5 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 in the subsequent analysis the water balance models on monthly annual and mean annual times are termed monthly water balance model m wbm annual water balance model a wbm and mean annual water balance model ma wbm respectively 3 study area and data catchments in the conus were used in this study to evaluate the proposed unified framework the hydrometeorological time series and catchment attributes of 671 catchments were collected from catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset by newman et al 2015 and addor et al 2017 the hydrometeorological time series include daily precipitation temperature runoff and potential evapotranspiration in camels dataset daymet dataset was selected as the primary gridded meteorological dataset to derive daily observations of temperature and precipitation thornton et al 2017 daily streamflow data were obtained from the usgs national water information system server http waterdata usgs gov usa nwis sw the potential evapotranspiration is estimated from priestly taylor p t equation priestley and taylor 1972 catchment attributes include climate indices hydrological signatures land cover characteristics soil characteristics and geological characteristics which were used to find the controlling factors of performance of the unified framework before applying the framework we eliminated some catchments where 1 the data length is less than 30 years such restriction of data length is to ensure that we have enough years to average when evaluating mean annual variations 2 the snow fraction is larger than 0 2 the snow fraction is calculated as the fraction of precipitation on days with average temperature below 0 c hock 2003 streamflow coming from snowfall may take more time to generate compared with rainfall the different patterns in the formation of streamflow make the unified framework in this case not applicable in regions with large portion of snowfall berghuijs et al 2014 ehalt macedo et al 2019 3 runoff is larger than precipitation the equations in this case implicitly assume water is balance in the catchments and runoff larger than precipitation clearly violates our assumption ultimately 437 catchments across conus were selected and used for subsequent analysis fig 2 many catchments in the mid conus were eliminated because of large snow fraction the catchment areas range from 6 25 km2 to 25817 78 km2 aridity index ranges from 0 248 to 4 763 nearly covering extremely dry to wet conditions some specific catchment properties including elevation slope catchment area and fraction of forest were supplemented in tables s1 and s2 hydrological year starting from 1 october was used to derive monthly annual and mean annual hydrometeorological variables in addition nine catchments were randomly selected across conus to analyze the sensitivity of initial conditions in hydrological models fig 2 4 results 4 1 model performance on monthly timescale the performance of m wbm was evaluated based on the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 in this study the initial soil moisture storage s 0 and groundwater storage g 0 was set to 200 mm the parameters were estimated using a l bfgs b method proposed by byrd et al 1995 with the minimum of squared errors between observed and simulated runoff the first three years were used as a warming period for s 0 and g 0 thus runoff simulations after the first three years were used for parameters estimation and performance evaluations the feasible ranges of parameters a is constrained by budyko type equations and were shown in table 1 parameters c and d range from 0 to 1 parameter b millimeter which represent the maximum evapotranspiration opportunity is allowed to vary on 0 7000 with reference to previous studies gnann et al 2019 martinez and gupta 2010 other initial values of s 0 and g 0 were also tested in nine selected catchments and the runoff simulations with different initial values in three catchments were shown in fig 3 the results in other six catchments were provided in figs s1 and s2 all of the results indicate the initial values just influence the first several months therefore selecting the first three years as a warming period is very robust to the initial values of s 0 and g 0 and may not have significant influence on subsequent discussions the nse of m wbm using four budyko type equations after the first three years were shown in fig 4 models using choudhury yang equation fu equation and wang tang equation exhibit very similar performance and applicable results in conus the nse of m wbm using wang tang equation are larger than 0 5 in 89 7 of catchments in contrast zhang equation got very poor performance the main reason is the domain of parameter a in zhang equation which greatly restrict the usefulness of zhang equation in the original study by zhang et al 2001 the parameter a is allowed to range from 0 5 to 2 based on in situ observation however following studies provided theoretical basis and complementary relationship in budyko equations zhou et al 2015 if we want to make zhang equation strictly satisfy our supply and demand requirements of water resource in eqs 4 and 5 the parameter a cannot be larger than 1 please see generating equation g and section 3 2 in the study by zhou et al 2015 the domain from 0 to 1 was also applied in this case thus the extreme conditions previously expressed by parameter a from 1 to 2 cannot be quantified by zhang equation in this case it is noteworthy that the m wbm using wang tang equation is the same as abcd model the results of this study are consistent with previous applications of the abcd model in conus martinez and gupta 2010 models in central and northern conus perform poorly snow fraction may be a main reason based on the map of predominant snow cover type sturm et al 1995 using a threshold of temperature to estimate snowfall fraction is not very accurate and may make some mistakes in catchments selection another problem in our modelling is that we only used p in current month as an explanatory variable for streamflow simulation considering antecedent precipitation may be a possible solution to solve this problem humphrey et al 2016 thomas 1981 4 2 model performance on annual timescales parameters estimation on annual timescale is similar to the procedures on monthly timescale l bfgs b method proposed by byrd et al 1995 and nse were also used in a wbm the valid ranges of parameters a and b are the same as the counterparts at monthly timescale the hydrometeorological variables were summed over annual timescale based on hydrological years starting from 1 october with reference to previous studies berghuijs et al 2014 gnann et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2011 different values of initial water storage s 0 were also tested in nine catchments and the results were shown in fig 5 figs s3 and s4 the first six years were used as warming period for s 0 the nse of a wbm using four equations were shown in fig 6 a d zhang equations got the worst performance and the main reason is also the domain of parameter a in zhang equation zhou et al 2015 the performance of other three equations are very similar and applicable in summary a wbm using fu equation is the best one with the mean nse of 0 701 and used for comparison a wbm on western coasts and southeastern parts got the highest nse and this spatial pattern is similar to m wbm snow melt may be a main reason influencing the performance of a wbm as well a wbm can be seen as a budyko type equation with water storage change considered therefore two annual water balance models that don t incorporate water storage change were compared to demonstrate the function of considering water storage change this first is wang tang equation which is one of budyko type equations and includes one parameter the second is ponce shetty model ponce and shetty 1995 sivapalan et al 2011 which emphasizes baseflow generation and doesn t consider interannual water storage change the difference of nse between a wbm and wang tang equation ponce shetty model were shown in fig 6 e f the histogram of difference of nse was shown in fig 7 the a wbm improves the nse in 92 and 83 of catchments compared with wang tang equation and ponce shetty model respectively there are four parameters in ponce shetty model and the better performance of a wbm underlines the significant role of water storage change in quantifying annual hydrological processes in order to clearly test the role of interannual water storage change in improvement the standard deviation of annual water storage change is used as a variable for describing the magnitude water storage change the mean annual of water storage change should equal to zero because of water balance and the larger the standard deviation the larger the magnitude of water storage changes between two consecutive years the relationships between the increase in nse of a wmb and the standard deviation were shown in fig 8 results show the increase in nse have a significant positive relationship with the magnitude of interannual carrying water storage indicating that improvements in a wbm can be partly attributed to the incorporation of water storage change there are 8 and 17 of catchments where wang tang equation and ponce shetty model performed better than the a wbm the distribution of these catchments doesn t have any obvious spatial pattern but we can find other common properties of these catchments the baseflow indexes in the catchments where wang tang equation performed better are usually small indicating fast flow is dominant in this catchment wang tang equation doesn t consider the baseflow generation and inter annual water change but have a similar form as scs model zhao et al 2016 thus wang tang equation perform better in regions with large portion of fast flow in 17 of catchments where ponce shetty model performed better the catchment areas are always small the pearson coefficient between catchment area and nse of ponce shetty is 0 351 p value less than 0 05 demonstrating that ponce shetty mode is more suitable for small catchments small catchment area may bring less convergence time of drainage resulting in less water storage change thus the advantage of baseflow generation in ponce shetty model may bring better performance in contrast the pearson coefficient between catchment area and nse of a wbm is 0 100 indicating catchment area doesn t significantly influence the performance of a wbm 4 3 model performance on mean annual timescale the ma wbm in this case equals to traditional budyko type equations previous studies have done a lot of studies about the applications of traditional budyko type equations on mean annual timescale to the united states or other regions berghuijs and woods 2016 carmona et al 2014 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 the applications of ma wbm to camels dataset are shown in fig 9 these four budyko type equations performed very similarly and the results are consistent with previous studies carmona et al 2014 zhang equation is a little different from the other three equations and the domain of parameter a is a main reason some outlies were found when aridity index pe p is smaller than 0 5 showing e is much smaller than pe in very wet condition a very possible reason for the large difference between e and pe is temporal asynchronicity between p and pe precipitation seasonality index of these catchments are negative and close to 1 indicating p is very large in winter and small in summer however pe is small in winter and large in summer because of temporal pattern of temperature and solar radiation feng et al 2019 as a result even though p is much larger than pe on mean annual timescale p still limits evapotranspiration in summer resulting in larger deviations from budyko curve and these outliers when pe p 0 5 4 4 spatial distributions of model parameters the spatial distributions of four parameters in m wbm using wang tang equation were provided in fig 10 a d the parameters using other three equations were given in figs s5 s7 parameter a directly determines the relationship between supply and demand of water resources and are larger than 0 5 for most regions only the values at west coast is small parameter b represents the maximum capacity of demand of water resources and increase towards southeast the spatial distribution of parameter b nearly follows the pattern of annual precipitation in conus the regions with large precipitation for example eastern conus are accompanied by large parameter b parameters c and d determine the baseflow generation and groundwater table in catchments along west and northeastern conus parameter c is very close to 0 indicating baseflow component is not necessary and a wbm can also be applied at monthly timescale this accords with the studies by thomas 1981 and martinez and gupta 2010 in other regions parameter c falls into a normal range from 0 05 to 0 95 controlling the separation of recharge to direct flow and baseflow parameter d is likely to be extreme values i e 0 or 1 hence a simplified model may be deserved for quantifying the variations of groundwater table the parameters in a wbm using wang tang equation is provided in fig 10 e f a very interesting finding is spatial patterns of parameters a and b in a wbm are very similar to the patterns in m wbm even though they may differ by an order of magnitude please note the different legends in fig 10 b and f their relative distributions are very similar parameter a in a wbm is slightly smaller than the counterpart in m wbm parameter b which represent the summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum soil moisture storage is much larger at annual timescale this is consistent with our intuitive impression that annual potential evapotranspiration is larger than monthly potential evapotranspiration the results may be helpful for our future studies about temporal scaling of hydrological parameters across different timescales 4 5 controlling factors of model performance the performance of water balance models may be influenced by many climatic hydrological and anthropogenic factors finding reasons for the variations of model performance can help us find out where the models work well therefore over fifty catchment attributes in 437 catchments were collected from addor et al 2017 and used to find the correlated factors with model performance pearson coefficients between catchment attributes and nse for both m wbm and a wbm were shown in table s3 the scatterplot between nse and some factors that have top four pearson correlations were shown in fig 11 detailed information about the definitions and calculation of catchment attributes can be found in the study by addor et al 2017 for m wbm mean daily precipitation p mean has the strongest correlation with nse of m wbm the larger the precipitation the better the performance in areas with small precipitation interception of rainfall and initial evapotranspiration may be dominant factors in hydrologic dynamics however these two components are not incorporated in the abcd model apart from that runoff ratio has significant positive correlation with nse indicating regions with large runoff ratio is more appropriate for m wbm small runoff ratio implies only small portion of precipitation become runoff thus more complicated processes were involved in the generation of runoff causing large uncertainty and random errors in runoff simulation precipitation seasonality p seasonality have the largest negative correlation with nse p seasonality is calculated from sine curves and the greater less the value the more dominant the summer winter precipitation woods 2009 values equal to 0 indicate temporally uniform precipitation therefore the m wbm in this study is more appropriate for catchments with dominant winter precipitation the hfd mean represents mean half flow date date on which the cumulative discharge since october 1st reaches half of the annual discharge and is similar to p seasonality the date reaching half of annual discharge is like to be early in the regions with large portion of winter precipitation note hydrological years were used the high negative correlation of hfd mean can be partly predicted from precipitation seasonality the performance of a wbm may not be greatly influenced by selected catchment attributes even though some parameters i e p seasonality longitude have significant correlation the performance of a wbm seems not sensitive to these parameters see fig 11 5 discussions in this study a unified framework integrating the water balance models on different timescales was proposed and applied in 437 catchments in the conus the water balance models become simpler along with the increase in timescales the groundwater component is ignored at annual timescale the water storage change is assumed to be zero at mean annual timescale overall the water balance models got acceptable results on different timescales the main contribution of the present work is establishing and applying a practical unified framework that integrates water balance models on various timescales supply and demand limits in budyko type equations is the commonality through water balance models over various timescales there are some existing models which are analogous to the unified framework the m wbm resembles the abcd model the key difference is that we use the concept of budyko type equation to model the relationship between water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t in fact the relationship between w t and y t in original abcd model is a special case of the budyko hypothesis wang and tang 2014 zhou et al 2015 the present study just generalizes the relationship and extends it to a unified framework as a result four budyko type equations in table 1 and other similar budyko type equations are also applicable in principle apart from that the concept of budyko type equations should not be restricted to this field for example zhang et al 2008 estimated the fast flow and baseflow using the concept of budyko type equations lei et al 2018 predicted human water consumption at the catchment scale based on the concept of supply and demand limits in the budyko type equations gnann et al 2019 tried to derive a budyko type equation for baseflow in the future the concept of budyko type equations may be discussed and applied not only in hydrology but also in other fields such as sociology and meteorology the second difference is the physical meaning of parameter b which represents upper bound of storage in the unsaturated zone above groundwater table in the original abcd model the unified framework gives parameter b a different physical meaning which is the summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum soil moisture storage the new physical meaning of parameter b has also been confirmed by maximum entropy theory zhao et al 2016 even though this framework doesn t significantly improve model performance on individual timescale the main superiority of this framework is that we don t need to analyze water balance on different timescales separately in contrast we only need to apply one framework to adapt the varying complexity of monthly annual and mean annual water movement thus this framework is helpful for us to understand the temporal scaling of hydrological processes on annual timescale a wbm can be considered as a budyko model that incorporate the interannual changes in water storage previous studies using budyko type equations conclude that the budyko equations are not enough to describe the interannual variations in water balance berghuijs and woods 2016 and water storage change may be a main factor contributing to the errors wu et al 2018 accordingly the results in this study demonstrate that the fitting ability dramatically improved with the incorporation of water storage change apart from that ponce shetty model was also applied in this study for comparison baseflow generation was considered and interannual water storage change is neglected in ponce shetty model the results indicate that considering interannual water storage change is more meaningful because a wbm only use two parameters but reaches similar performance with a four parameters ponce shetty model therefore the a wbm may be a compelling tool to explain the regional anomaly behavior carmona et al 2014 and space time asymmetry berghuijs and woods 2016 in budyko spaces on annual timescale the causes of performance of m wbm and a wbm were analyzed using over fifty catchment attributes m wbm is more appropriate for regions with high precipitation large runoff ratio and dominant winter precipitation the results can also provide some reference for future studies about abcd model because of their same structure the significant influence of precipitation seasonality may be attributed to temperature current studies have shown that temperature determines the snowfall melt glacial melt and the form of precipitation hock 2003 precipitation in summer and winter have different mechanisms of streamflow generation berghuijs et al 2014 in addition some catchments with snow fraction 0 2 or imbalanced water are eliminated in this study based on previous budyko based or hydrological studies berghuijs et al 2014 carmona et al 2014 gnann et al 2019 greve et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 wu et al 2018 yang et al 2007 finding a unified framework for these regions is also meaningful even though fifty catchment attributes were collected in this study the factors controlling the performance of a wbm were not fully revealed and deserve further investigation many human activities factors and climatic factors that may significantly influence runoff generation were not incorporated in this study decomposition of runoff trend shown human activity may be a main reason for the decreasing trend in runoff in couns zhang et al 2019 anthropogenic carbon dioxide has been proved to influence the transpiration and need to be incorporated in hydrological model humphrey et al 2018 yang et al 2019 urbanization may change the drainage time of streamflow and baseflow generation rose and peters 2001 the magnitude of water storage change is also an important factor influencing the performance of water balance models ehalt macedo et al 2019 humphrey et al 2016 wu et al 2017 wu et al 2019 however water storage change cannot be easily derived from in situ observations partly increasing the difficulty of quantifying water storage change in water balance models at the same time the equation in the abcd model considering water storage change is very simple i e eq 8 and only consider a parameter b highly uncertainty water storage changes may decrease the performance of water balance model the results on annual timescale also shown that a wbm is better than wang tang equation and ponce shetty model because of the incorporation of water storage change apart from the factors we don t consider the collinearity between factors is another problem which may mislead and conceal the physical mechanisms as a result systematically evaluating and finding controlling factors of the unified framework is of great importance for future applications theoretical equality of the abcd model scs model and budyko model have been deeply analyzed by wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2016 a practical framework was proposed in this study however the linkage between water balance models on different timescales still deserves our future investigation seasonal timescale and daily timescale also deserve attentions there are still some questions that have not been solved up to our knowledge and deserve further investigation first is the relationship between supply and demand limits of water resources and maximum entropy theory even though proportionality hypothesis is a special case of maximum entropy theory the relationship between the supply and demand limits and maximum entropy theory has not been appropriately derived second is the scaling problems of hydrological parameters on temporal and spatial dimension parameters a and b are common at monthly and annual timescale the results in section 4 5 indicate there are some relationships between parameters at monthly and annual timescales however equations or a framework describing this temporal scaling relationship are not enough up to our best knowledge in addition downscaling parameters of hydrological models from large catchments to small areas is also of significance for reconstructing or predicting streamflow for ungauged area third is the uncertainty in parameters accurately quantifying the uncertainty can help us determine the significance of groundwater component and guide us for future researches 6 conclusions the present work integrates two typical conceptual water balance models on different timescales into a unified framework specifically the abcd model and budyko model were combined and applied on monthly annual and mean annual timescales with the increase in timescale we gradually simplify the models the main conclusions are as follows 1 the unified framework gets applicable results in 437 catchments in the contiguous united states on different timescales monthly water balance model incorporates two components the surface partitioning and interannual water storage change annual water balance model simplifies groundwater and mainly considers water storage change the nses of m wbm and a wbm are larger than 0 5 in 89 7 and 88 1 of catchments respectively 2 in the unified framework the supply and demand limit between the water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t is the key point and the commonality through water balance models over varying timescales budyko type equation is used to describe the supply and demand limits and three budyko type equations got similar results except zhang equation 3 interannual water storage change is an essential factor for an accurate description of annual water balance model the incorporation of water storage change can greatly improve the fitting capability especially for the regions with non negligible interannual water storage change 4 over fifty catchment attributes were used to find where the unified framework is appropriate the performance of a wbm seem not be largely influenced by geological factors in this case regions with high precipitation large runoff ratio and portion of winter precipitation are suitable for the m wbm credit authorship contribution statement xu zhang conceptualization methodology writing original draft

5261,at present many conceptual water balance models have been proposed on monthly annual and mean annual timescales with the increasing applications of these models an emerging question is whether the water balance models on different timescales have some commonalities and can be integrated to this end this study established and applied a practical unified framework of water balance models that can be applied to different timescales the framework was first developed on monthly timescale where the water balance was captured by combining the abcd model and budyko hypothesis with four parameters then this framework was extended to annual and mean annual timescales under which certain parameters can be eliminated or assumed to be certain values to be specific on the annual timescale the water balance was simulated by a budyko type model incorporating the water storage change on the mean annual timescale the water balance was further simplified into a budyko type model which neglects the water storage change thus all of the three typical water balance models on different timescales were unified to a general framework the models were applied to 437 catchments in the contiguous united states with satisfying results achieved considering the water storage changes can improve the performance of annual water balance models in regions with clear interannual carrying water storage furthermore the water balance models on different timescales share common supply and demand limits which is similar to budyko hypothesis keywords water balance models timescales budyko hypothesis water storage change 1 introduction water is a global resource that is moved between different media and plays an irreplaceable role in human lives understanding the mechanisms of water movement is imperative for practices of water resources management flood prediction and wastewater treatment builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 gao et al 2019 luke et al 2017 sivapalan et al 2011 conservation of mass is a globally recognized physical law that is applicable in water movement regardless of spatial and temporal scales however the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow and evapotranspiration is not only controlled by the conservation of mass but also subject to many other temporal and geologic natural factors dunne and black 1970 jetse et al 2010 todini 2007 wu et al 2018 in addition human activities have greatly increased the complexity of water movement and the hydrological connectivity leaving the accurate description of the water cycle a challenging and crucial task for hydrological and environmental researches milly et al 2008 milly and dunne 2017 at the catchment scale a widely used tool for the understanding of hydrological cycle is water balance model which quantitatively describes the water cycle at catchment scale zhang et al 2008 for different locations with special site characteristics numerous water balance models have been proposed to incorporate snowfall glacier vegetation and topography builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 carmona et al 2014 henley et al 2011 lindstrom et al 1997 ponce and shetty 1995 sivapalan et al 2011 wang et al 2016 apart from the spatial representativeness timescale is another critical aspect because the movement of water is determined by various factors which are subject to the variations in timescales ning et al 2019 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2008 for example the catchment water storage change can be neglected on mean annual timescale but cannot on monthly timescale greve et al 2016 likewise the precipitation intensity and spatial pattern greatly influence the daily water balance but may have little influence on the mean annual timescale beven and binley 1992 to consider the impact of timescale on the water balance different water balance models have been independently developed for monthly annual and mean annual timescales among water balance models on monthly timescale there are two components in general the first is the carrying water storage between time steps and the second is the infiltration component even though the forms of monthly water balance models vary with climatic conditions and locations these aforementioned two components are common for an effective monthly water balance model such as the abcd model thomas 1981 hydrologiska byr√•ns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model hagg et al 2007 lindstrom et al 1997 zhang and lindstrom 1997 and dynamic water balance model zhang et al 2008 among them the abcd model is a widely used tool al lafta et al 2013 fernandez et al 2000 martinez and gupta 2010 thomas 1981 and proved to have the same physical basis as the scs model and long term budyko equation wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 fast flow generation baseflow soil moisture groundwater storage and evapotranspiration can be appropriately estimated using only four parameters in the abcd model however the physical rationale and validity of the abcd models deserve further applications the key equation in the abcd model has been used as a budyko type equation wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 how to connect abcd model and budyko model is an important issue for understanding hydrological processes across different timescales annual water balance model is usually simpler than the monthly water balance model and includes less parameters for example the ponce shetty equation which is a two stage annual water balance model only contains four parameters with the neglect of water storage change ponce and shetty 1995 despite of its simplicity the ponce shetty equation still got acceptable results in the united states sivapalan et al 2011 and the united kingdom gnann et al 2019 apart from that budyko type equation which is initially used on mean annual timescale with only one or two parameters is also applied to annual timescale by assuming that the interannual water storage change is negligible carmona et al 2014 however berghuijs and woods 2016 shown the existence of space time asymmetry in budyko spaces and stated the asymmetry may underestimate the water yield assessment wu et al 2018 also demonstrated that soil moisture or water storage change is a non negligible factor when applying the budyko framework to annual or monthly timescale therefore incorporating water storage change to budyko model is required to achieve a more accurate annual water balance model water balance on mean annual timescale is mainly described by budyko type equation which is an empirical equation reflecting the supply and demand limits of water resources budyko 1974 first proposed a non parametric form of budyko equation which was then improved by incorporating several parameters to express geologic climatic or human activities impacts choudhury 1999 greve et al 2016 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008a zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 though a consensus is yet to be reached regarding the control factors in budyko type equations most studies acknowledged that aridity index i e the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation is the core climatic factor determining the water balance on mean annual timescale berghuijs et al 2017 gnann et al 2019 greve et al 2015 yang et al 2014a yang et al 2014b apart from the water balance model specified for a single timescale some studies showed that the conceptual water balance models on different timescales share some common assumptions for example zhang et al 2008 derived a dynamic water balance model on monthly timescale from the concept of budyko hypothesis and compared the water balance models on different timescales yang et al 2008b proposed an analytical form of intra annual water balance model on short and long term periods and documented the impact of soil moisture wang and tang 2014 has analyzed the commonalities between darwinian hydrological models over event monthly and mean annual timescales demonstrating that they have the same generalized proportionality hypothesis furthermore wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2016 derived that proportionality hypothesis is a special case of maximum entropy production and proved the abcd model scs model l vovich formulations and budyko model share the same maximum entropy production theory even though the theoretical assumptions of water balance model on different timescales have been successfully unified by previous studies wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 a practical framework that can be used over different timescales remains rare and deserves further applications to this end the abcd model and budyko type equations were combined to derived a unified framework with varying number of parameters on different timescales the unified framework has four two and one parameter on monthly annual and mean annual timescales to suit the varying complexity of hydrological processes the unified framework was then applied in 437 catchments in contiguous united states conus to demonstrate the validity of unified framework on different timescales some catchment properties that significantly correlated with the performance of unified framework were also analyzed to give some guidance for future improvements and physical understanding of water balance models 2 methods 2 1 unified framework here a unified framework for conceptual water balance models was proposed by combining the abcd model thomas 1981 and the concept of budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 fu 1981 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 the unified framework includes two stages surface partitioning stage and groundwater storing stage a schematic diagram of the unified framework is shown in fig 1 a in the first stage precipitation p t and initial soil

the water balance can be written as 1 p t s t 1 q d t e t r t s t then the water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t are defined by following the abcd model as 2 w t p t s t 1 3 y t e t s t where water availability w t represents the supply of water and evapotranspiration opportunity y t represents the amount of water that can be evaporated the possible maximum value for evapotranspiration opportunity y t is the potential evapotranspiration plus maximum soil moisture storage capacity then the summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum soil moisture storage is set as a parameter b in this framework the definition of parameter b is somewhat different from that in the abcd model where b is the upper bound of storage in the unsaturated zone above groundwater table with reference to budyko type equations budyko 1974 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 we can assume w t and y t satisfy the supply and demand limits in very dry conditions the precipitation and soil moisture are very small i e w t b b w t and nearly all of the available water is evaporated in this case the evapotranspiration opportunity y t is limited by the supply of water w t and approaches to the water availability y t w t in very wet condition there is a lot of water that greatly exceeds potential evapotranspiration opportunity i e w t b b w t 0 then the evapotranspiration opportunity y t is limited by the demand of evapotranspiration and storage capacity b and approaches to the its potential maximum value y t b therefore the supply and demand limits lead to the following hypothesis 4 s u p p l y l i m i t y t w t a s b w t v e r y d r y c o n d i t i o n s 5 d e m a n d l i m i t y t b a s b w t 0 v e r y w e t c o n d i t i o n s it can be noticed that w t y t and the ratio Œ≥ t b w t is analogous to p t e t and aridity index œÜ t pe t p t in budyko type equations respectively but our study incorporates the soil water storage s t as a result the relationship between y t and w t can be modeled using the budyko type equations as 6 y t w t b k i b w t a where bk i is the budyko equation i 1 2 3 4 which are represented by four commonly used budyko type equations including the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008a the fu equation fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 the zhang equation zhang et al 2001 and the wang tang equation wang and tang 2014 b w t is the ratio of potential demand to supply and termed general aridity index Œ≥ t because of the incorporation of water storage these four budyko type equations all contain a parameter i e a see table 1 controlling the relationship between y t w t and b w t it is noteworthy that the wang tang equation is the same as the equation in the original abcd model and was used a benchmark wang and tang 2014 assuming the change rate of soil moisture storage s is proportional to the potential evapotranspiration pe we obtained that thomas 1981 7 ds dt p e s b the potential evapotranspiration p e is determined by solar radiation wind speed and temperature which may not significantly change between two consecutive time steps therefore assuming pe t 1 pe t and s t 1 y t following the abcd model we can estimate the soil moisture storage s t after solving the differential equation 7 8 s t y t e x p pe t b the difference between water availability and evapotranspiration opportunity w t y t equals to the sum of direct runoff q d t and recharge r t then the recharge r t is estimated as a portion of quantity w t y t using a parameter c and the remaining is direct runoff q d t 9 r t c w t y t 10 q d t 1 c w t y t in the second stage the recharge r t replenishes the groundwater storage g t and then a portion of ground water constitutes the baseflow q b t 11 q b t d g t where g t is groundwater storage at the end of time step t parameter d is the ratio of groundwater becoming baseflow according to the groundwater balance we obtain following equations 12 g t g t 1 r t d g t plugging equation 9 to equation 12 we obtained 13 g t g t 1 c w t y t 1 d therefore the streamflow q t is calculated as the sum of direct flow q d t and baseflow q b t as 14 q t q d t q b t 1 c w t y t d g t a unified framework with four parameters i e a b c and d for water balance was established based on the abcd model with the concept of budyko hypothesis incorporated 2 2 applications to different timescales this framework is a little complicated for models on annual or mean annual timescales compared with other similar studies carmona et al 2014 chen et al 2013 ponce and shetty 1995 zhang et al 2008 some parts for example groundwater and water storage change may not be necessary for mean annual timescale redundant parameters may bring the difficulty for model convergency and overfitting therefore the unified framework sustains its form on monthly timescale but will be simplified on the annual and mean annual timescales with certain components neglected see fig 1 the parameters in the applications of unified framework to different timescales is summarized in table 2 2 2 1 model on monthly timescale this unified framework is directly applied to the water balance models on monthly timescale without any modification because all of the parts cannot be neglected with reference to the abcd model martinez and gupta 2010 thomas 1981 apart from equation 6 which is described by budyko hypothesis the other parts of this framework are the same as the abcd model in the application of a specific case the parameters can be estimated based on the least squared errors between observed and simulated values the first several years need to be used to train the initial values of soil moisture storage s 0 and groundwater storage g 0 and the remaining years can be used for parameters estimation specific information about training period and parameters estimation are provided in section 4 1 2 2 2 model on annual timescale previous studies indicated that the change in water storage is a main factor controlling the errors for water balance models at annual timescale istanbulluoglu et al 2012 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 therefore the annual water balance model emphasizes the water storage change and simplifies the groundwater component the surface water and groundwater are integrated and the soil moisture storage s t is generalized to water storage to represent the total influence of surface and ground water a schematic diagram of annual water balance model is shown in fig 1 c equations 1 to 8 in the unified framework are still valid on annual timescale the difference w t y t between water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t directly equals to streamflow q t and equations 9 to 14 are simplified to 15 q t w t y t thus water balance model on annual timescales includes two parameters a and b parameters c and d vanish because groundwater component is neglected on the annual timescale from a mathematical point of view parameters c and d on monthly timescale are equal to zero the first several years should be used as a warm up period to train initial soil water storage s o 2 2 3 model on mean annual timescale in a longer timescale e g ten years the water storage change is negligible jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 then the water storage s t in the unified framework is assumed to be a constant and can be eliminated the water availability w t is simplified to precipitation p t and the evapotranspiration opportunity y t is simplified to actual evapotranspiration e t parameter b representing summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum water storage capacity equal to potential evapotranspiration pe t thus the relationship between precipitation p t and actual evapotranspiration e t is modelled using a budyko type equation 16 e t p t b k i pe t p t a then based on the conservation of mass the discharge q t equals to the difference between precipitation p t and actual evapotranspiration e t 17 q t p t e t p t 1 b k i pe t p t a a schematic diagram of mean annual water balance model is shown in fig 1 d after simplification the mean annual water balance model equals to budyko type equation that is shown in table 1 parameters c d and water storage s t equal to zero on mean annual timescale we can find that with the increase in timescales the water balance models become simpler there are four two and one parameter in the water balance models on monthly annual and mean annual timescales respectively table 2 even though the water balance models on different timescales include different assumptions the core assumption is the same which is the concept of supply and demand limits in budyko type equations in equation 4 and 5 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 in the subsequent analysis the water balance models on monthly annual and mean annual times are termed monthly water balance model m wbm annual water balance model a wbm and mean annual water balance model ma wbm respectively 3 study area and data catchments in the conus were used in this study to evaluate the proposed unified framework the hydrometeorological time series and catchment attributes of 671 catchments were collected from catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset by newman et al 2015 and addor et al 2017 the hydrometeorological time series include daily precipitation temperature runoff and potential evapotranspiration in camels dataset daymet dataset was selected as the primary gridded meteorological dataset to derive daily observations of temperature and precipitation thornton et al 2017 daily streamflow data were obtained from the usgs national water information system server http waterdata usgs gov usa nwis sw the potential evapotranspiration is estimated from priestly taylor p t equation priestley and taylor 1972 catchment attributes include climate indices hydrological signatures land cover characteristics soil characteristics and geological characteristics which were used to find the controlling factors of performance of the unified framework before applying the framework we eliminated some catchments where 1 the data length is less than 30 years such restriction of data length is to ensure that we have enough years to average when evaluating mean annual variations 2 the snow fraction is larger than 0 2 the snow fraction is calculated as the fraction of precipitation on days with average temperature below 0 c hock 2003 streamflow coming from snowfall may take more time to generate compared with rainfall the different patterns in the formation of streamflow make the unified framework in this case not applicable in regions with large portion of snowfall berghuijs et al 2014 ehalt macedo et al 2019 3 runoff is larger than precipitation the equations in this case implicitly assume water is balance in the catchments and runoff larger than precipitation clearly violates our assumption ultimately 437 catchments across conus were selected and used for subsequent analysis fig 2 many catchments in the mid conus were eliminated because of large snow fraction the catchment areas range from 6 25 km2 to 25817 78 km2 aridity index ranges from 0 248 to 4 763 nearly covering extremely dry to wet conditions some specific catchment properties including elevation slope catchment area and fraction of forest were supplemented in tables s1 and s2 hydrological year starting from 1 october was used to derive monthly annual and mean annual hydrometeorological variables in addition nine catchments were randomly selected across conus to analyze the sensitivity of initial conditions in hydrological models fig 2 4 results 4 1 model performance on monthly timescale the performance of m wbm was evaluated based on the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 in this study the initial soil moisture storage s 0 and groundwater storage g 0 was set to 200 mm the parameters were estimated using a l bfgs b method proposed by byrd et al 1995 with the minimum of squared errors between observed and simulated runoff the first three years were used as a warming period for s 0 and g 0 thus runoff simulations after the first three years were used for parameters estimation and performance evaluations the feasible ranges of parameters a is constrained by budyko type equations and were shown in table 1 parameters c and d range from 0 to 1 parameter b millimeter which represent the maximum evapotranspiration opportunity is allowed to vary on 0 7000 with reference to previous studies gnann et al 2019 martinez and gupta 2010 other initial values of s 0 and g 0 were also tested in nine selected catchments and the runoff simulations with different initial values in three catchments were shown in fig 3 the results in other six catchments were provided in figs s1 and s2 all of the results indicate the initial values just influence the first several months therefore selecting the first three years as a warming period is very robust to the initial values of s 0 and g 0 and may not have significant influence on subsequent discussions the nse of m wbm using four budyko type equations after the first three years were shown in fig 4 models using choudhury yang equation fu equation and wang tang equation exhibit very similar performance and applicable results in conus the nse of m wbm using wang tang equation are larger than 0 5 in 89 7 of catchments in contrast zhang equation got very poor performance the main reason is the domain of parameter a in zhang equation which greatly restrict the usefulness of zhang equation in the original study by zhang et al 2001 the parameter a is allowed to range from 0 5 to 2 based on in situ observation however following studies provided theoretical basis and complementary relationship in budyko equations zhou et al 2015 if we want to make zhang equation strictly satisfy our supply and demand requirements of water resource in eqs 4 and 5 the parameter a cannot be larger than 1 please see generating equation g and section 3 2 in the study by zhou et al 2015 the domain from 0 to 1 was also applied in this case thus the extreme conditions previously expressed by parameter a from 1 to 2 cannot be quantified by zhang equation in this case it is noteworthy that the m wbm using wang tang equation is the same as abcd model the results of this study are consistent with previous applications of the abcd model in conus martinez and gupta 2010 models in central and northern conus perform poorly snow fraction may be a main reason based on the map of predominant snow cover type sturm et al 1995 using a threshold of temperature to estimate snowfall fraction is not very accurate and may make some mistakes in catchments selection another problem in our modelling is that we only used p in current month as an explanatory variable for streamflow simulation considering antecedent precipitation may be a possible solution to solve this problem humphrey et al 2016 thomas 1981 4 2 model performance on annual timescales parameters estimation on annual timescale is similar to the procedures on monthly timescale l bfgs b method proposed by byrd et al 1995 and nse were also used in a wbm the valid ranges of parameters a and b are the same as the counterparts at monthly timescale the hydrometeorological variables were summed over annual timescale based on hydrological years starting from 1 october with reference to previous studies berghuijs et al 2014 gnann et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2011 different values of initial water storage s 0 were also tested in nine catchments and the results were shown in fig 5 figs s3 and s4 the first six years were used as warming period for s 0 the nse of a wbm using four equations were shown in fig 6 a d zhang equations got the worst performance and the main reason is also the domain of parameter a in zhang equation zhou et al 2015 the performance of other three equations are very similar and applicable in summary a wbm using fu equation is the best one with the mean nse of 0 701 and used for comparison a wbm on western coasts and southeastern parts got the highest nse and this spatial pattern is similar to m wbm snow melt may be a main reason influencing the performance of a wbm as well a wbm can be seen as a budyko type equation with water storage change considered therefore two annual water balance models that don t incorporate water storage change were compared to demonstrate the function of considering water storage change this first is wang tang equation which is one of budyko type equations and includes one parameter the second is ponce shetty model ponce and shetty 1995 sivapalan et al 2011 which emphasizes baseflow generation and doesn t consider interannual water storage change the difference of nse between a wbm and wang tang equation ponce shetty model were shown in fig 6 e f the histogram of difference of nse was shown in fig 7 the a wbm improves the nse in 92 and 83 of catchments compared with wang tang equation and ponce shetty model respectively there are four parameters in ponce shetty model and the better performance of a wbm underlines the significant role of water storage change in quantifying annual hydrological processes in order to clearly test the role of interannual water storage change in improvement the standard deviation of annual water storage change is used as a variable for describing the magnitude water storage change the mean annual of water storage change should equal to zero because of water balance and the larger the standard deviation the larger the magnitude of water storage changes between two consecutive years the relationships between the increase in nse of a wmb and the standard deviation were shown in fig 8 results show the increase in nse have a significant positive relationship with the magnitude of interannual carrying water storage indicating that improvements in a wbm can be partly attributed to the incorporation of water storage change there are 8 and 17 of catchments where wang tang equation and ponce shetty model performed better than the a wbm the distribution of these catchments doesn t have any obvious spatial pattern but we can find other common properties of these catchments the baseflow indexes in the catchments where wang tang equation performed better are usually small indicating fast flow is dominant in this catchment wang tang equation doesn t consider the baseflow generation and inter annual water change but have a similar form as scs model zhao et al 2016 thus wang tang equation perform better in regions with large portion of fast flow in 17 of catchments where ponce shetty model performed better the catchment areas are always small the pearson coefficient between catchment area and nse of ponce shetty is 0 351 p value less than 0 05 demonstrating that ponce shetty mode is more suitable for small catchments small catchment area may bring less convergence time of drainage resulting in less water storage change thus the advantage of baseflow generation in ponce shetty model may bring better performance in contrast the pearson coefficient between catchment area and nse of a wbm is 0 100 indicating catchment area doesn t significantly influence the performance of a wbm 4 3 model performance on mean annual timescale the ma wbm in this case equals to traditional budyko type equations previous studies have done a lot of studies about the applications of traditional budyko type equations on mean annual timescale to the united states or other regions berghuijs and woods 2016 carmona et al 2014 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 the applications of ma wbm to camels dataset are shown in fig 9 these four budyko type equations performed very similarly and the results are consistent with previous studies carmona et al 2014 zhang equation is a little different from the other three equations and the domain of parameter a is a main reason some outlies were found when aridity index pe p is smaller than 0 5 showing e is much smaller than pe in very wet condition a very possible reason for the large difference between e and pe is temporal asynchronicity between p and pe precipitation seasonality index of these catchments are negative and close to 1 indicating p is very large in winter and small in summer however pe is small in winter and large in summer because of temporal pattern of temperature and solar radiation feng et al 2019 as a result even though p is much larger than pe on mean annual timescale p still limits evapotranspiration in summer resulting in larger deviations from budyko curve and these outliers when pe p 0 5 4 4 spatial distributions of model parameters the spatial distributions of four parameters in m wbm using wang tang equation were provided in fig 10 a d the parameters using other three equations were given in figs s5 s7 parameter a directly determines the relationship between supply and demand of water resources and are larger than 0 5 for most regions only the values at west coast is small parameter b represents the maximum capacity of demand of water resources and increase towards southeast the spatial distribution of parameter b nearly follows the pattern of annual precipitation in conus the regions with large precipitation for example eastern conus are accompanied by large parameter b parameters c and d determine the baseflow generation and groundwater table in catchments along west and northeastern conus parameter c is very close to 0 indicating baseflow component is not necessary and a wbm can also be applied at monthly timescale this accords with the studies by thomas 1981 and martinez and gupta 2010 in other regions parameter c falls into a normal range from 0 05 to 0 95 controlling the separation of recharge to direct flow and baseflow parameter d is likely to be extreme values i e 0 or 1 hence a simplified model may be deserved for quantifying the variations of groundwater table the parameters in a wbm using wang tang equation is provided in fig 10 e f a very interesting finding is spatial patterns of parameters a and b in a wbm are very similar to the patterns in m wbm even though they may differ by an order of magnitude please note the different legends in fig 10 b and f their relative distributions are very similar parameter a in a wbm is slightly smaller than the counterpart in m wbm parameter b which represent the summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum soil moisture storage is much larger at annual timescale this is consistent with our intuitive impression that annual potential evapotranspiration is larger than monthly potential evapotranspiration the results may be helpful for our future studies about temporal scaling of hydrological parameters across different timescales 4 5 controlling factors of model performance the performance of water balance models may be influenced by many climatic hydrological and anthropogenic factors finding reasons for the variations of model performance can help us find out where the models work well therefore over fifty catchment attributes in 437 catchments were collected from addor et al 2017 and used to find the correlated factors with model performance pearson coefficients between catchment attributes and nse for both m wbm and a wbm were shown in table s3 the scatterplot between nse and some factors that have top four pearson correlations were shown in fig 11 detailed information about the definitions and calculation of catchment attributes can be found in the study by addor et al 2017 for m wbm mean daily precipitation p mean has the strongest correlation with nse of m wbm the larger the precipitation the better the performance in areas with small precipitation interception of rainfall and initial evapotranspiration may be dominant factors in hydrologic dynamics however these two components are not incorporated in the abcd model apart from that runoff ratio has significant positive correlation with nse indicating regions with large runoff ratio is more appropriate for m wbm small runoff ratio implies only small portion of precipitation become runoff thus more complicated processes were involved in the generation of runoff causing large uncertainty and random errors in runoff simulation precipitation seasonality p seasonality have the largest negative correlation with nse p seasonality is calculated from sine curves and the greater less the value the more dominant the summer winter precipitation woods 2009 values equal to 0 indicate temporally uniform precipitation therefore the m wbm in this study is more appropriate for catchments with dominant winter precipitation the hfd mean represents mean half flow date date on which the cumulative discharge since october 1st reaches half of the annual discharge and is similar to p seasonality the date reaching half of annual discharge is like to be early in the regions with large portion of winter precipitation note hydrological years were used the high negative correlation of hfd mean can be partly predicted from precipitation seasonality the performance of a wbm may not be greatly influenced by selected catchment attributes even though some parameters i e p seasonality longitude have significant correlation the performance of a wbm seems not sensitive to these parameters see fig 11 5 discussions in this study a unified framework integrating the water balance models on different timescales was proposed and applied in 437 catchments in the conus the water balance models become simpler along with the increase in timescales the groundwater component is ignored at annual timescale the water storage change is assumed to be zero at mean annual timescale overall the water balance models got acceptable results on different timescales the main contribution of the present work is establishing and applying a practical unified framework that integrates water balance models on various timescales supply and demand limits in budyko type equations is the commonality through water balance models over various timescales there are some existing models which are analogous to the unified framework the m wbm resembles the abcd model the key difference is that we use the concept of budyko type equation to model the relationship between water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t in fact the relationship between w t and y t in original abcd model is a special case of the budyko hypothesis wang and tang 2014 zhou et al 2015 the present study just generalizes the relationship and extends it to a unified framework as a result four budyko type equations in table 1 and other similar budyko type equations are also applicable in principle apart from that the concept of budyko type equations should not be restricted to this field for example zhang et al 2008 estimated the fast flow and baseflow using the concept of budyko type equations lei et al 2018 predicted human water consumption at the catchment scale based on the concept of supply and demand limits in the budyko type equations gnann et al 2019 tried to derive a budyko type equation for baseflow in the future the concept of budyko type equations may be discussed and applied not only in hydrology but also in other fields such as sociology and meteorology the second difference is the physical meaning of parameter b which represents upper bound of storage in the unsaturated zone above groundwater table in the original abcd model the unified framework gives parameter b a different physical meaning which is the summation of potential evapotranspiration and maximum soil moisture storage the new physical meaning of parameter b has also been confirmed by maximum entropy theory zhao et al 2016 even though this framework doesn t significantly improve model performance on individual timescale the main superiority of this framework is that we don t need to analyze water balance on different timescales separately in contrast we only need to apply one framework to adapt the varying complexity of monthly annual and mean annual water movement thus this framework is helpful for us to understand the temporal scaling of hydrological processes on annual timescale a wbm can be considered as a budyko model that incorporate the interannual changes in water storage previous studies using budyko type equations conclude that the budyko equations are not enough to describe the interannual variations in water balance berghuijs and woods 2016 and water storage change may be a main factor contributing to the errors wu et al 2018 accordingly the results in this study demonstrate that the fitting ability dramatically improved with the incorporation of water storage change apart from that ponce shetty model was also applied in this study for comparison baseflow generation was considered and interannual water storage change is neglected in ponce shetty model the results indicate that considering interannual water storage change is more meaningful because a wbm only use two parameters but reaches similar performance with a four parameters ponce shetty model therefore the a wbm may be a compelling tool to explain the regional anomaly behavior carmona et al 2014 and space time asymmetry berghuijs and woods 2016 in budyko spaces on annual timescale the causes of performance of m wbm and a wbm were analyzed using over fifty catchment attributes m wbm is more appropriate for regions with high precipitation large runoff ratio and dominant winter precipitation the results can also provide some reference for future studies about abcd model because of their same structure the significant influence of precipitation seasonality may be attributed to temperature current studies have shown that temperature determines the snowfall melt glacial melt and the form of precipitation hock 2003 precipitation in summer and winter have different mechanisms of streamflow generation berghuijs et al 2014 in addition some catchments with snow fraction 0 2 or imbalanced water are eliminated in this study based on previous budyko based or hydrological studies berghuijs et al 2014 carmona et al 2014 gnann et al 2019 greve et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 wu et al 2018 yang et al 2007 finding a unified framework for these regions is also meaningful even though fifty catchment attributes were collected in this study the factors controlling the performance of a wbm were not fully revealed and deserve further investigation many human activities factors and climatic factors that may significantly influence runoff generation were not incorporated in this study decomposition of runoff trend shown human activity may be a main reason for the decreasing trend in runoff in couns zhang et al 2019 anthropogenic carbon dioxide has been proved to influence the transpiration and need to be incorporated in hydrological model humphrey et al 2018 yang et al 2019 urbanization may change the drainage time of streamflow and baseflow generation rose and peters 2001 the magnitude of water storage change is also an important factor influencing the performance of water balance models ehalt macedo et al 2019 humphrey et al 2016 wu et al 2017 wu et al 2019 however water storage change cannot be easily derived from in situ observations partly increasing the difficulty of quantifying water storage change in water balance models at the same time the equation in the abcd model considering water storage change is very simple i e eq 8 and only consider a parameter b highly uncertainty water storage changes may decrease the performance of water balance model the results on annual timescale also shown that a wbm is better than wang tang equation and ponce shetty model because of the incorporation of water storage change apart from the factors we don t consider the collinearity between factors is another problem which may mislead and conceal the physical mechanisms as a result systematically evaluating and finding controlling factors of the unified framework is of great importance for future applications theoretical equality of the abcd model scs model and budyko model have been deeply analyzed by wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2016 a practical framework was proposed in this study however the linkage between water balance models on different timescales still deserves our future investigation seasonal timescale and daily timescale also deserve attentions there are still some questions that have not been solved up to our knowledge and deserve further investigation first is the relationship between supply and demand limits of water resources and maximum entropy theory even though proportionality hypothesis is a special case of maximum entropy theory the relationship between the supply and demand limits and maximum entropy theory has not been appropriately derived second is the scaling problems of hydrological parameters on temporal and spatial dimension parameters a and b are common at monthly and annual timescale the results in section 4 5 indicate there are some relationships between parameters at monthly and annual timescales however equations or a framework describing this temporal scaling relationship are not enough up to our best knowledge in addition downscaling parameters of hydrological models from large catchments to small areas is also of significance for reconstructing or predicting streamflow for ungauged area third is the uncertainty in parameters accurately quantifying the uncertainty can help us determine the significance of groundwater component and guide us for future researches 6 conclusions the present work integrates two typical conceptual water balance models on different timescales into a unified framework specifically the abcd model and budyko model were combined and applied on monthly annual and mean annual timescales with the increase in timescale we gradually simplify the models the main conclusions are as follows 1 the unified framework gets applicable results in 437 catchments in the contiguous united states on different timescales monthly water balance model incorporates two components the surface partitioning and interannual water storage change annual water balance model simplifies groundwater and mainly considers water storage change the nses of m wbm and a wbm are larger than 0 5 in 89 7 and 88 1 of catchments respectively 2 in the unified framework the supply and demand limit between the water availability w t and evapotranspiration opportunity y t is the key point and the commonality through water balance models over varying timescales budyko type equation is used to describe the supply and demand limits and three budyko type equations got similar results except zhang equation 3 interannual water storage change is an essential factor for an accurate description of annual water balance model the incorporation of water storage change can greatly improve the fitting capability especially for the regions with non negligible interannual water storage change 4 over fifty catchment attributes were used to find where the unified framework is appropriate the performance of a wbm seem not be largely influenced by geological factors in this case regions with high precipitation large runoff ratio and portion of winter precipitation are suitable for the m wbm credit authorship contribution statement xu zhang conceptualization methodology writing original draft

5262,in august 2017 south asia was affected by devastating floods that caused widespread death and destruction in nepal india and bangladesh the brahmaputra river experienced a record flow in bangladesh however the prediction of a 200 year flood from an international forecasting agency did not materialize in fact the evolution and dynamics of 2017 flood was very different from previous floods in the region localized in nature and short lived in duration we examine the hydrometeorology of the ganges brahmaputra and meghna river basins to show how the 2017 august flood emerged differently from past major floods in the region assessment of available rainfall datasets reveals the usefulness of satellite sources such as tmpa gpm era interim cpc global precipitation and wrf to capture the extreme events and highlights the poor spatial coverage of in situ measurements we then present a data driven requisitely simple reqsim flood forecast model findings from the real time application of reqsim during the 2017 flood provide encouraging results with accurate predictions of peak flood timing and magnitude for several locations for example the reqsim provides 10 day

49 0 68 and mae 0 32 0 48 m for 10 day forecasts and nse 0 62 0 78 and mae 0 36 0 68 m for 7 day forecasts comparison of 2017 flood with past major regional floods suggests that it is not the intensity of rainfall or severity of flood in either the ganges or the brahmaputra basin but the lack of peak flow synchronization of these two rivers may help explain why 2017 flood did not become as severe as the floods of 1998 and 2007 in bangladesh ease of operationalization and reliable forecasting accuracy of reqsim for 2017 flood is of particular relevance for large rivers where access to upstream gauge measured rainfall and flow data are limited and detailed modeling approaches are operationally prohibitive and functionally ineffective plain language summary vast areas of south asia across the border regions of nepal india and bangladesh were flooded by intense rainfall and overflowing rivers in august 2017 this record flood event killed over a thousand people and affected over 40 million people however forecasts of a 200 year flood event issued by an international agency and covered widely in local media outlets did not materialize it was found that the evolution and dynamics of 2017 flood was very different from previous major floods in the region localized in nature and short lived in duration we examine the rainfall and flood generating processes before and during the floods and the performance of a simple flood forecast model in detail to identify the mechanisms that led to these apparent false forecasts including the nature and timing of the peak rainfall events and subsequent floods 1 introduction 1 1 background mounting losses from catastrophic floods are driving an intense effort to increase preparedness and improve response to disastrous flood events by providing early warnings floods cause more than 40 billion in damage annually across the globe oecd 2016 as the world experiences unprecedented environmental degradation andincreased climate variability and change flooding has become a barrier to sustainable development globally glantz 2018 improvements in the skill of numerical weather prediction nwp models have led many recent studies to suggest that flood forecasts might be extended to longer lead times emerton et al 2016 alfieri et al 2013 hirpa et al 2018 however improvements in the prediction of precipitation have lagged behind the improvements made by operational nwp models in forecasting aspects of the large scale circulation cloke and pappenberger 2009 charba and samplatsky 2011 dravitzki and mcgregor 2011 yet significant efforts continue to be devoted in developing mechanistic hydrological models and statistical and satellite driven methods to increase the forecasting lead time e g webster et al 2010 hopson and webster 2010 hossain et al 2014a b yucel et al 2015 alfieri et al 2018 hirpa et al 2018 without fully exploring the functional utility of these complicated methods palash et al 2018 a case in point is the 2017 flood in south asia in august 2017 major river basins of south asia the ganges and the brahmaputra gb in particular were affected by devastating floods fig 1 a that caused widespread death destruction and agricultural loss in india nepal and bangladesh over a thousand people died and 40 45 million people were affected gettleman 2017 siddique 2017 chloe 2017 the brahmaputra river experienced a recorded highest streamflow in bangladesh however a 200 year flood prediction ercc 2017 from the global flood awareness system glofas jointly developed by the european commission ec and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf did not materialize in reality the brahmaputra flood flow measured inside bangladesh during mid august corresponded to a 65 75 year return period flood according to our analysis this is also the recorded highest flood event for this river basin to date we examine why despite recorded highest streamflow in brahmaputra 2017 flood did not emerge as a major regional flood the prevailing hydrometeorology before and during the 2017 flood has been partly discussed in several recent publications e g alfieri et al 2018 hossain et al 2019 and philip et al 2018 we examine the hydrometeorology of the ganges and brahmaputra river basins to show how the 2017 august flood emerged differently from past major floods in the region as such we examine the evolution of 2017 flood from observational and modeling perspectives first we analyze the gb rainfall and streamflow data for both the peak flood and the entire 2017 monsoon period june september and compare those with past major flood events from 1998 and 2007 second we examine the utility of a data driven modeling framework with a requisite simplicity approach ward 2005 stirzaker et al 2010 cilliers et al 2013 palash et al 2018 this simplified modeling approach called requisitely simple reqsim model identifies key flood generating variables and processes to forecast streamflow and water level by using the outputs from a basin scale ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm river basin model we also explore the utility of a local scale reqsim model 1 2 current flood forecasting capabilities in the gbm basins currently bangladesh water development board bwdb disseminates one official and two experimental forecasts for flood prone areas of the country these are 1 5 day deterministic forecasts jakobsen et al 2005 iwm 2013 1 10 day probabilistic forecasts hopson and webster 2010 webster et al 2010 and satellite altimetry based 1 8 day deterministic forecasts hossain et al 2014a b the first two forecasting techniques rely on detailed hydrologic modeling of the gbm river basins to predict flood flows along the three major transboundary rivers of bangladesh and then run a one dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate forecasts at major river points inside bangladesh palash et al 2018 the forecasting schemes that rely on both hydrologic and hydrodynamic models were developed over many years jakobsen et al 2005 webster et al 2010 for upstream river points of the gbm basins in india the central water commission cwc of india gives a deterministic forecast of 1 3 day priya et al 2017 http www cwc nic in the commission uses a number of techniques to generate forecasts including gauge to gauge statistical correlations and translating upstream rainfall and soil moisture information to possible downstream streamflow or river stage condition priya et al 2017 the national center for atmospheric research ncar united states with the support of the world bank has recently developed a probabilistic forecasting scheme based on hydrologic and multi model concept to provide 1 16 day water level forecasts for 87 river locations across the gbm river basins hopson and satya 2017 the dissemination of the ncar forecast is still in the experimental phase these forecasting tools for the gbm basins have shown mixed results palash et al 2018 in addition these schemes are resource intensive and difficult to use for operational purposes as shown for other regions bierkens et al 2015 emerton et al 2016 here we present a simple data driven model that is less resource intensive easy to implement for operational purposes and comparable in terms of forecasting accuracy 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area we begin by examining the prevailing hydrometeorological situation of the ganges and brahmaputra gb river basins before and during the august 2017 flood our domain of interest is thus the gb river basins and its downstream alluvial river system within bangladesh fig 1 the ganges and the brahmaputra along with the meghna gbm with a combined drainage area of approximately 1 7 million km2 is the third largest freshwater outlet to the ocean chowdhury and ward 2004 although the gbm system is often referred to be one large river basin three river basins of this system feature unique geomorphology and flow regimes and the tributaries of these river basins flow through different ecological social economic and political realm biswas 2008 akanda 2012 the ganges river draining about 1087 103 km2 of land area originates in the gangotri glacier of the northeastern himalaya india and travels about 2000 km towards southeast before entering bangladesh in bangladesh the river continues to travel 225 km southeast further and joins with the brahmaputra river in the central region of the country the brahmaputra river draining about 543 103 km2 of land area originates in the kailas range of southwestern tibet china the river with the name yarlung tsangpo travels about 2000 km from west to east across the tibetan plateau first then another 1000 km from northeast to southwest through assam valley india and enters bangladesh the river travels another 230 km south and joins with the ganges river the meghna basin compared to other two is much smaller in size with drainage area about 82 103 km2 the barak is the upstream tributary of the basin that drains 30 of the meghna from northeast india while several other upstream tributaries drains 13 of basin area from north in the meghalaya mountains in india khan et al 2005 the remaining 57 of the basin area covers most of the northeast bangladesh region ibid the combined flow of the ganges and brahmaputra travels about 100 km towards southeast with name the padma joins with the meghna river near chandpur and travels 140 km further south with name the lower meghna river before empties into the bay of bengal palash 2008 2 2 datasets to analyze the gb hydrometeorology before and during 2017 august flood and to develop and operationalize a data driven reqsim model we collected observed rainfall water level and streamflow data of these river basins for the august 2017 flood and the historical period from bangladesh water development board bwdb https www bwdb gov bd and the institute of water modeling iwm www iwmbd org to examine the usefulness of satellite measured rainfall and output from weather model rainfall forecasts in capturing the space time variability of rainfall before and during the 2017 august flood we collected rainfall datasets from

tmpa data with respect to aphrodite for 2008 2017 for data driven flood forecast model development we used observational tmpa 3b42rt and forecasted wrf and gfs data 3 materials and methods 3 1 observational analysis of prevailing hydrometeorology before and during flood satellite and weather model generated rainfall are known to produce significant variations for day to day or point to point data comparisons bajracharya et al 2015 these datasets however show reasonable accuracy in capturing synoptic rainfall pattern over a large area or temporal aggregation of point rainfall or space time aggregated rainfall bajracharya et al 2015 palash et al 2018 we begin by comparing the spatial coverage of five day august 9 13 total rainfall that led to the mid august flood then we analyze and compare daily rainfall for the entire 2017 monsoon june september aggregated over four large domains of gb river basins fig 1 b with gauge measured rainfall data we analyzed prevailing gb hydrometeorology before and during the august 2017 flood examined the river conditions and sequences of monsoon rainfall in an attempt to understand the mechanism that led to a 200 year flood warning in the brahmaputra basin then we examined the august 2017 flood with two previous large floods from the region 1998 and 2007 to compare and contrast mechanisms related to these major floods 3 2 an operational basin scale model to forecast 2017 flood the reqsim model relies on easily available precipitation datasets like the tmpa and gpm imerg products and ground observations at forecast locations e g water level or streamflow the details of this model required data and applications are available in palash et al 2018 we have used reqsim model with a daily time step for the 2017 flood season and generated real time forecasts of three most important basin locations of the gbm river basins fig 1 b streamflow through these three locations represent about 80 of the flood season flow into bangladesh palash et al 2014 providing reliable forecasts of these three river points is thus considered a major challenge to existing flood forecast and disaster management activities in bangladesh hopson and webster 2010 hossain et al 2014a b we have also expanded the forecasts of reqsim model to another 32 downstream river points in the north east and central region of bangladesh for 2017 flood forecasts we use the flow persistence coupled with observed and forecasted rain modeling framework from palash et al 2018 as 1 q t n Œ± n q t Œ≤ n q t 1 a n r i n b n r ii n c n r iii n d n r iv n Œ≥ n 2 r i n average r i t t i m a x n r i t t i m i n n where q t n is the forecasted streamflow water level of n day lead time q t and q t 1 are observed streamflow water level on forecast day t and previous day t 1 respectively Œ± n and Œ≤ n are model coefficients related to persistence and Œ≥ n is a regression interception coefficient r i r ii r iii and r iv are lagged space time aggregated rainfall of four domains i to iv fig 1b and a n b n c n d n are corresponding model coefficients t i m a x and t i m i n are maximum and minimum flow travel time in days for domain i i to iv while t is the forecast day i e 0 day and n is the forecast lead time i e 1 to 10 day if t t i m a x n and or t t i m i n n t where t is the forecast day i e 0 day then forecasted rain of m lead time is considered in the model for domain i providing that t t i m a x n and t i m i n n t m 3 3 reqsim model structure for local scale application the forecast results of reqsim basin scale gbm model encouraged us to develop a local scale model for the river system within bangladesh by using the outputs from basin scale model section 3 2 we applied a simple flow transferring mechanism from the three base stations i e hardinge bridge bahadurabad and amalshid to 32 river points figs 1 b and 2 by using both temporal and spatial persistence with a regression framework the spatial streamflow correlation has been found to be effective in transferring flow characteristics from gauged river points to ungauged river points archÔ¨Åeld and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2017 the structure of the forecast transfer from base stations to immediate upstream downstream points and then from those points to further upstream downstream points is as follows 3 q t n Œ± n q t Œ≤ n q t n us d s Œ≥ n where q t n is the forecasted streamflow water level on n day lead time at forecast location q t is the observed streamflow water level on forecast day i e t 0 at the same location q t n us d s is already generated forecasted streamflow water level at upstream or downstream river points from where forecasts are about to transfer to target location on n day lead time and Œ± n Œ≤ n and Œ≥ n are coefficients of the regression model the idea of transferring forecast from one river point to another is thus very simple the linear regression model includes forecast day s streamflow water level at target or to river point i e q t and forecasted streamflow water level of from river points i e q t n us d s to generate forecasts at to river point for n day lead time i e q t n we have used cross correlation function ccf between daily streamflow water level data of two neighboring river points to identify whether those points share similar flow pattern for instance we set a ccf value of 0 8 to identify those points for which a forecast transfer from one river points to another is possible the ccf is computed by using the following equation 4 c c f x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i and y i are two daily time series data of two river points x and y are mean of x i and y i respectively fig 2 shows river points for which a similar riverine hydrologic regime has been found encircling the highly correlated river points as shown by black transparent polygon in the figure thus identifies the rivers and forecast locations of the downstream alluvial river system of the gbm basins within bangladesh for which the reqsim local scale model has been applied during 2017 flood season once those river points are identified the forecast transfer begins from base stations to their immediate downstream or upstream river points and from those points to further downstream or upstream points respectively to evaluate the forecast performance we used commonly used statistical parameters such as mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse for details of these statistical techniques please see gupta et al 1999 singh et al 2005 and moriasi et al 2007 4 results 4 1 peak rainfall events and performance of rainfall datasets observational analysis anomalous heavy rainfall occurred during the second week of august across southeast nepal south sikkim north west bengal and west assam states of india southwest bhutan and northwest bangladesh region according to gauge measured and satellite data some places in these areas received more than 500 mm rain over a 5 days period from august 9 13 fig 3 a an extreme value analysis reveals that annual maximum 5 9 days total rain in the brahmaputra domain iv occurred over august 9 13 august 7 15 were 45 15 year return period events they were 8 5 year events in the domain iii of the basin considering entire basin the peak rainfalls were 50 20 year events which led to a 65 75 year flood flow in the downstream with respect to non gauge rainfall dataset s ability to capture extreme rainfall events tmpa and gpm show a much better coverage of rainfall observations across the region they also show a close similarity to the distribution of gauge rainfall along the nepal and india border south sikkim north west bengal and east assam in india east bhutan and northwest bangladesh region fig 3 b c the rainfall patterns in the southern coastal and southeast hilly regions of bangladesh are also captured by these two datasets era interim rainfall also captured the overall rainfall patterns well in the gb basins fig 3 d cpc global precipitation shows high rainfall in lower parts of the gb e g in bangladesh but failed completely along the india nepal border in assam india and bhutan fig 3 e wrf is the only forecasted rainfall considered here that provides 1 6 day rainfall forecast which overestimates rain significantly in areas where gauge or other datasets do not show much rain fig 3 f the domain average daily rainfall of all non gauge dataset shows strong agreement with gauge data over the entire ganges and brahmaputra basin fig 4 however the non gauge rainfall estimates work better in wet regions e g the eastern ganges and the southern brahmaputra compared to arid regions e g the western ganges and norther brahmaputra tmpa and gpm datasets show significantly higher correspondence to gauge data for example the r2 of domain i iv rainfall of tmpa gpm vary from 0 43 to 0 82 0 32 0 78 in the ganges and from 0 14 to 0 78 0 14 0 73 in the brahmaputra basin the accuracy of wrf forecasts drops significantly as forecast lead time increases these comparisons suggest that tmpa and gpm s data are superior in capturing large scale rainfall over the gb river basin for 2017 flood 4 2 performance of reqsim forecasts the reqsim regional i e gbm river basins and local scale i e selected river points of the gbm inside bangladesh models were used for operational forecasts during the 2017 flood season for three major entry points to bangladesh and 32 dowsntream river stations the mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse of the ganges river at hardinge bridge are 0 33 m 0 97 and 0 97 respectively for 10 day lead time the brahmaputra forecasts at bahadurabad was reliable up to 7 day lead time corresponding mae r2 nse are 0 4 m 0 74 0 7 respectively the performance in the barak upper meghna river at amalshid was limited up to 5 day lead time corresponding mae r2 nse are 0 86 m 0 59 0 51 respectively fig 5 show reqsim s ability to predict august 2017 flood at three key gbm basin points for different forecasting lead time the model provides encouraging results table 1 and fig 6 for several locations inside bangladesh with accurate predictions of peak flood timing and magnitude for example the reqsim provides 10 day forecasts with nse values 0 89 0 97 and mae 0 33 0 54 m for the ganges mahananda gorai system in the west of country for the brahmaputra and old brahmaputra river system nse value ranges 0 49 0 68 and mae 0 32 0 48 m for 10 day forecasts and nse 0 62 0 78 and mae 0 36 0 68 m for 7 day forecasts the model performed reasonably well in the padma kumar and other rivers in the central part of bangladesh for up to 7 day lead time and moderately in the surma kushiyara system in the east for up to 5 day lead time table 1 presents performance statistics of different river system in detail forecasting magnitude and timing of the peak flood is a challenging endeavor for any flood forecasting system we have examined both these aspects of the reqsim forecasts for 2017 flood both the ganges and brahmaputra forecast show that up to 5 day lead time peak flood came either on the same day or within one day of predicted peak flow for 6 10 day lead times it arrived within 1 2 day of predicted peak flow for example on august 6 2017 reqsim predicted that a record 21 08 m brahmaputra peak flood would occur on august 16 2017 but the actual event 20 85 m occurred on august 15 the reqsim prediction for the brahmaputra for august 15 was 20 46 m for the ganges on august 12 2017 reqsim predicted that a peak flood 13 91 m would come on august 22 but the actual event 13 84 m occurred on august 21 the reqsim prediction for the ganges for august 21 was 13 80 m since the forecast is updated daily and the model is able to provide accurate peak flood timing within 5 to 6 days the accuracy of the reqsim s peak flood timing is deemed useful for real time operational management of flooding for the ganges and brahmaputra basin in their downstream region 5 discussion the observed rainfall events in the lower brahmaputra basin preceding the august 2017 flood were very large very high flood levels were reported at several monitoring stations along the brahmaputra and its tributaries in assam india bhutan and north bangladesh between august 11 and 17 sandrp 2017 but the observed flood event was found to have a 70 year return period yet on august 12 2017 glofas predicted large scale flooding in the gb basins for the next 7 10 days and warned that the brahmaputra basin might experience a flood likely to be more than a 200 year return period due to continuous heavy rain in the upstream ercc 2017 why did this forecast not materialize a closer look at earlier major floods may provide few clues past analyses of the basin s hydrometeorology suggest that a 50 year rain could led to a disproportionately large flood had the basin s rainfall sequence been steady and streamflow conditions were at or near bankfull stage before that peak rain event for example in 1998 mid september an average 2 33 year return period rain event over a 5 9 days period generated a 30 year peak flow in the brahmaputra basin while for the ganges a rainfall event with 5 year return period generated a 45 year peak flow during the same time because by early september 1998 soil for both the basins were already saturated following heavy rainfall from the preceding monsoon months june august and both the rivers were in almost at the bank full stage fig 7 a c consequently a relatively small rainfall event contributed to a very large runoff into already filled rivers and made the 1998 flood to be one of the most severe and longest lasting flood for the gbm basins the flood became even more severe due to peak flood flow synchronization of the ganges and brahmaputra river over a 10 day window in early september generally synchronization of peak flows of these two rivers is considered to be a major determinant of the extent of flooding in bangladesh rahman and salehin 2013 in fact the combined flow of these two rivers flowing into the padma river fig 2 in bangladesh remained above danger level for nearly two and a half months from early july to late september in 1998 fig 7 c in 2007 the ganges received moderate rainfall from the beginning of july to the first week of september as a result an average flooding was experienced in the ganges river in early august on the other hand the brahmaputra received two heavy rainfalls in late july and early september yet the basin did not face very large flood from these two events for example the late july rainfall which was a 10 year return period event and larger than the september event led to a 10 year flood in the basin however although the ganges river experienced an average flood 2 33 year return period and the brahmaputra encountered a moderate flood 10 year return period 2007 flood in downstream region of the gbm basin in bangladesh was more severe and found to have combined flow in the padma river well above danger level for about two months from late july to late september fig 7 f a key driver for the 2007 gbm flood was also found to be the flow synchronization of these two rivers over a 10 day window in early august in 2017 the brahmaputra basin was relatively dry and river bank was not full before the large rainfall events in early august as a result extreme rainfall events of early august produced large runoff raised the river water level above danger level rapidly but the floods were short lived and localized because of reduced rainfall from mid august onward fig 7 h i also the lower level of flow in the ganges fig 7 g and i helped to minimize the impact of higher flow from the brahmaputra in the central region of bangladesh more importantly the peak flood flow from the ganges and the brahmaputra did not synchronize with each other over a 10 day window during august 2017 flood fig 7 i as they did in 1998 and 2007 as a result the combined flow in the padma remained above danger level for less than two weeks during the second half of august fig 7 i this asynchronization of the ganges and brahmaputra peak may help explain why gbm basin in bangladesh did not experience a large and widespread flood in 2017 in this study we also investigated water level forecasting performance of a local reqsim model section 4 2 in reqsim local scale application the use of persistence both in space and time to transfer forecasts from one river point to another appears to be useful however this transfer of flow forecasting information is only possible for rivers that are relatively slow rising and between river points that have similar flow characteristics for example the model performed exceptionally well in the ganges mahananda gorai system in the west of bangladesh for up to 10 day lead time with nse values above 0 8 reasonably well in the brahmaputra old brahmaputra padma kumar and other rivers in the central part for up to 7 day lead time with nse values above 0 6 0 7 and moderately in the surma kushiyara system in the east for up to 5 day lead time with nse values 0 5 0 6 table 1 and fig 6 these results suggest that a local scale application of the reqsim model may be used as an operational tool to enhance country s ongoing flood forecasting activities 6 conclusion in august 2017 the middle brahmaputra basin in india experienced series of intense rainfall events and the brahmaputra river experienced a record high streamflow in bangladesh yet the prediction of a flood event with a 200 year return period made by forecasting agencies and widely circulated by news media did not materialize we have examined the hydrometeorology of the ganges and brahmaputra basins to show how the 2017 august flood emerged differently from past major floods in the region it is not the high rainfall or flood in either the ganges or the brahmaputra basin but the lack of peak flow synchronization of these two rivers in august 2017 may help explain why 2017 flood did not become as severe as those of 1998 and 2007 findings from this study also show that the evolution and dynamics of 2017 flood was localized in nature and short lived in duration assessment of available rainfall datasets reveals the usefulness of satellite sources such as tmpa gpm era interim cpc global precipitation and wrf to capture the extreme events and highlights the poor spatial coverage of in situ measurements comparison of rainfall from multiple sources suggests that the tmpa 3b42 rt and gpm imerge datasets provide better spatial coverage and higher accuracy compared to era interim cpc global precipitation and wrf forecasts particularly in high rainfall regions of the ganges and brahmaputra basins we have also examined the utility of a data driven requisitely simple reqsim flood forecast model findings from the real time application of reqsim during the 2017 flood provide encouraging results with accurate predictions of peak flood timing and magnitude for several locations of gbm basins in bangladesh for example the reqsim provides 10 day forecasts with nse values 0 89 0 97 and mae 0 33 0 54 m for the ganges river system inside bangladesh for the brahmaputra river system nse value ranges 0 49 0 68 and mae 0 32 0 48 m for 10 day forecasts and nse 0 62 0 78 and mae 0 36 0 68 m for 7 day forecasts the findings from the operational application of the reqsim model for the 2017 flood suggest that large scale rainfall patterns captured by the satellites or weather models are useful in a data driven model to obtain skillful flood forecasts for up to 10 day lead time for the ganges 7 day lead time for the brahmaputra and 5 day lead time for the meghna basin ease of operationalization and reliable forecasting accuracy of reqsim is of particular relevance for large rivers where access to upstream gauge measured rainfall and flow data are limited and detailed modeling approaches are operationally prohibitive and functionally ineffective credit authorship contribution statement wahid palash conceptualization

5262,in august 2017 south asia was affected by devastating floods that caused widespread death and destruction in nepal india and bangladesh the brahmaputra river experienced a record flow in

49 0 68 and mae 0 32 0 48 m for 10 day forecasts and nse 0 62 0 78 and mae 0 36 0 68 m for 7 day forecasts comparison of 2017 flood with past major regional floods suggests that it is not the intensity of rainfall or severity of flood in either the ganges or the brahmaputra basin but the lack of peak flow synchronization of these two rivers may help explain why 2017 flood did not become as severe as the floods of 1998 and 2007 in bangladesh ease of operationalization and reliable forecasting accuracy of reqsim for 2017 flood is of particular relevance for large rivers where access to upstream gauge measured rainfall and flow data are limited and detailed modeling approaches are operationally prohibitive and functionally ineffective plain language summary vast areas of south asia across the border regions of nepal india and bangladesh were flooded by intense rainfall and overflowing rivers in august 2017 this record flood event killed over a thousand people and affected over 40 million people however forecasts of a 200 year flood event issued by an international agency and covered widely in local media outlets did not materialize it was found that the evolution and dynamics of 2017 flood was very different from previous major floods in the region localized in nature and short lived in duration we examine the rainfall and flood generating processes before and during the floods and the performance of a simple flood forecast model in detail to identify the mechanisms that led to these apparent false forecasts including the nature and timing of the peak rainfall events and subsequent floods 1 introduction 1 1 background mounting losses from catastrophic floods are driving an intense effort to increase preparedness and improve response to disastrous flood events by providing early warnings floods cause more than 40 billion in damage annually across the globe oecd 2016 as the world experiences unprecedented environmental degradation andincreased climate variability and change flooding has become a barrier to sustainable development globally glantz 2018 improvements in the skill of numerical weather prediction nwp models have led many recent studies to suggest that flood forecasts might be extended to longer lead times emerton et al 2016 alfieri et al 2013 hirpa et al 2018 however improvements in the prediction of precipitation have lagged behind the improvements made by operational nwp models in forecasting aspects of the large scale circulation cloke and pappenberger 2009 charba and samplatsky 2011 dravitzki and mcgregor 2011 yet significant efforts continue to be devoted in developing mechanistic hydrological models and statistical and satellite driven methods to increase the forecasting lead time e g webster et al 2010 hopson and webster 2010 hossain et al 2014a b yucel et al 2015 alfieri et al 2018 hirpa et al 2018 without fully exploring the functional utility of these complicated methods palash et al 2018 a case in point is the 2017 flood in south asia in august 2017 major river basins of south asia the ganges and the brahmaputra gb in particular were affected by devastating floods fig 1 a that caused widespread death destruction and agricultural loss in india nepal and bangladesh over a thousand people died and 40 45 million people were affected gettleman 2017 siddique 2017 chloe 2017 the brahmaputra river experienced a recorded highest streamflow in bangladesh however a 200 year flood prediction ercc 2017 from the global flood awareness system glofas jointly developed by the european commission ec and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf did not materialize in reality the brahmaputra flood flow measured inside bangladesh during mid august corresponded to a 65 75 year return period flood according to our analysis this is also the recorded highest flood event for this river basin to date we examine why despite recorded highest streamflow in brahmaputra 2017 flood did not emerge as a major regional flood the prevailing hydrometeorology before and during the 2017 flood has been partly discussed in several recent publications e g alfieri et al 2018 hossain et al 2019 and philip et al 2018 we examine the hydrometeorology of the ganges and brahmaputra river basins to show how the 2017 august flood emerged differently from past major floods in the region as such we examine the evolution of 2017 flood from observational and modeling perspectives first we analyze the gb rainfall and streamflow data for both the peak flood and the entire 2017 monsoon period june september and compare those with past major flood events from 1998 and 2007 second we examine the utility of a data driven modeling framework with a requisite simplicity approach ward 2005 stirzaker et al 2010 cilliers et al 2013 palash et al 2018 this simplified modeling approach called requisitely simple reqsim model identifies key flood generating variables and processes to forecast streamflow and water level by using the outputs from a basin scale ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm river basin model we also explore the utility of a local scale reqsim model 1 2 current flood forecasting capabilities in the gbm basins currently bangladesh water development board bwdb disseminates one official and two experimental forecasts for flood prone areas of the country these are 1 5 day deterministic forecasts jakobsen et al 2005 iwm 2013 1 10 day probabilistic forecasts hopson and webster 2010 webster et al 2010 and satellite altimetry based 1 8 day deterministic forecasts hossain et al 2014a b the first two forecasting techniques rely on detailed hydrologic modeling of the gbm river basins to predict flood flows along the three major transboundary rivers of bangladesh and then run a one dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate forecasts at major river points inside bangladesh palash et al 2018 the forecasting schemes that rely on both hydrologic and hydrodynamic models were developed over many years jakobsen et al 2005 webster et al 2010 for upstream river points of the gbm basins in india the central water commission cwc of india gives a deterministic forecast of 1 3 day priya et al 2017 http www cwc nic in the commission uses a number of techniques to generate forecasts including gauge to gauge statistical correlations and translating upstream rainfall and soil moisture information to possible downstream streamflow or river stage condition priya et al 2017 the national center for atmospheric research ncar united states with the support of the world bank has recently developed a probabilistic forecasting scheme based on hydrologic and multi model concept to provide 1 16 day water level forecasts for 87 river locations across the gbm river basins hopson and satya 2017 the dissemination of the ncar forecast is still in the experimental phase these forecasting tools for the gbm basins have shown mixed results palash et al 2018 in addition these schemes are resource intensive and difficult to use for operational purposes as shown for other regions bierkens et al 2015 emerton et al 2016 here we present a simple data driven model that is less resource intensive easy to implement for operational purposes and comparable in terms of forecasting accuracy 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area we begin by examining the prevailing hydrometeorological situation of the ganges and brahmaputra gb river basins before and during the august 2017 flood our domain of interest is thus the gb river basins and its downstream alluvial river system within bangladesh fig 1 the ganges and the brahmaputra along with the meghna gbm with a combined drainage area of approximately 1 7 million km2 is the third largest freshwater outlet to the ocean chowdhury and ward 2004 although the gbm system is often referred to be one large river basin three river basins of this system feature unique geomorphology and flow regimes and the tributaries of these river basins flow through different ecological social economic and political realm biswas 2008 akanda 2012 the ganges river draining about 1087 103 km2 of land area originates in the gangotri glacier of the northeastern himalaya india and travels about 2000 km towards southeast before entering bangladesh in bangladesh the river continues to travel 225 km southeast further and joins with the brahmaputra river in the central region of the country the brahmaputra river draining about 543 103 km2 of land area originates in the kailas range of southwestern tibet china the river with the name yarlung tsangpo travels about 2000 km from west to east across the tibetan plateau first then another 1000 km from northeast to southwest through assam valley india and enters bangladesh the river travels another 230 km south and joins with the ganges river the meghna basin compared to other two is much smaller in size with drainage area about 82 103 km2 the barak is the upstream tributary of the basin that drains 30 of the meghna from northeast india while several other upstream tributaries drains 13 of basin area from north in the meghalaya mountains in india khan et al 2005 the remaining 57 of the basin area covers most of the northeast bangladesh region ibid the combined flow of the ganges and brahmaputra travels about 100 km towards southeast with name the padma joins with the meghna river near chandpur and travels 140 km further south with name the lower meghna river before empties into the bay of bengal palash 2008 2 2 datasets to analyze the gb hydrometeorology before and during 2017 august flood and to develop and operationalize a data driven reqsim model we collected observed rainfall water level and streamflow data of these river basins for the august 2017 flood and the historical period from bangladesh water development board bwdb https www bwdb gov bd and the institute of water modeling iwm www iwmbd org to examine the usefulness of satellite measured rainfall and output from weather model rainfall forecasts in capturing the space time variability of rainfall before and during the 2017 august flood we collected rainfall datasets from

tmpa data with respect to aphrodite for 2008 2017 for data driven flood forecast model development we used observational tmpa 3b42rt and forecasted wrf and gfs data 3 materials and methods 3 1 observational analysis of prevailing hydrometeorology before and during flood satellite and weather model generated rainfall are known to produce significant variations for day to day or point to point data comparisons bajracharya et al 2015 these datasets however show reasonable accuracy in capturing synoptic rainfall pattern over a large area or temporal aggregation of point rainfall or space time aggregated rainfall bajracharya et al 2015 palash et al 2018 we begin by comparing the spatial coverage of five day august 9 13 total rainfall that led to the mid august flood then we analyze and compare daily rainfall for the entire 2017 monsoon june september aggregated over four large domains of gb river basins fig 1 b with gauge measured rainfall data we analyzed prevailing gb hydrometeorology before and during the august 2017 flood examined the river conditions and sequences of monsoon rainfall in an attempt to understand the mechanism that led to a 200 year flood warning in the brahmaputra basin then we examined the august 2017 flood with two previous large floods from the region 1998 and 2007 to compare and contrast mechanisms related to these major floods 3 2 an operational basin scale model to forecast 2017 flood the reqsim model relies on easily available precipitation datasets like the tmpa and gpm imerg products and ground observations at forecast locations e g water level or streamflow the details of this model required data and applications are available in palash et al 2018 we have used reqsim model with a daily time step for the 2017 flood season and generated real time forecasts of three most important basin locations of the gbm river basins fig 1 b streamflow through these three locations represent about 80 of the flood season flow into bangladesh palash et al 2014 providing reliable forecasts of these three river points is thus considered a major challenge to existing flood forecast and disaster management activities in bangladesh hopson and webster 2010 hossain et al 2014a b we have also expanded the forecasts of reqsim model to another 32 downstream river points in the north east and central region of bangladesh for 2017 flood forecasts we use the flow persistence coupled with observed and forecasted rain modeling framework from palash et al 2018 as 1 q t n Œ± n q t Œ≤ n q t 1 a n r i n b n r ii n c n r iii n d n r iv n Œ≥ n 2 r i n average r i t t i m a x n r i t t i m i n n where q t n is the forecasted streamflow water level of n day lead time q t and q t 1 are observed streamflow water level on forecast day t and previous day t 1 respectively Œ± n and Œ≤ n are model coefficients related to persistence and Œ≥ n is a regression interception coefficient r i r ii r iii and r iv are lagged space time aggregated rainfall of four domains i to iv fig 1b and a n b n c n d n are corresponding model coefficients t i m a x and t i m i n are maximum and minimum flow travel time in days for domain i i to iv while t is the forecast day i e 0 day and n is the forecast lead time i e 1 to 10 day if t t i m a x n and or t t i m i n n t where t is the forecast day i e 0 day then forecasted rain of m lead time is considered in the model for domain i providing that t t i m a x n and t i m i n n t m 3 3 reqsim model structure for local scale application the forecast results of reqsim basin scale gbm model encouraged us to develop a local scale model for the river system within bangladesh by using the outputs from basin scale model section 3 2 we applied a simple flow transferring mechanism from the three base stations i e hardinge bridge bahadurabad and amalshid to 32 river points figs 1 b and 2 by using both temporal and spatial persistence with a regression framework the spatial streamflow correlation has been found to be effective in transferring flow characteristics from gauged river points to ungauged river points archÔ¨Åeld and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2017 the structure of the forecast transfer from base stations to immediate upstream downstream points and then from those points to further upstream downstream points is as follows 3 q t n Œ± n q t Œ≤ n q t n us d s Œ≥ n where q t n is the forecasted streamflow water level on n day lead time at forecast location q t is the observed streamflow water level on forecast day i e t 0 at the same location q t n us d s is already generated forecasted streamflow water level at upstream or downstream river points from where forecasts are about to transfer to target location on n day lead time and Œ± n Œ≤ n and Œ≥ n are coefficients of the regression model the idea of transferring forecast from one river point to another is thus very simple the linear regression model includes forecast day s streamflow water level at target or to river point i e q t and forecasted streamflow water level of from river points i e q t n us d s to generate forecasts at to river point for n day lead time i e q t n we have used cross correlation function ccf between daily streamflow water level data of two neighboring river points to identify whether those points share similar flow pattern for instance we set a ccf value of 0 8 to identify those points for which a forecast transfer from one river points to another is possible the ccf is computed by using the following equation 4 c c f x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i and y i are two daily time series data of two river points x and y are mean of x i and y i respectively fig 2 shows river points for which a similar riverine hydrologic regime has been found encircling the highly correlated river points as shown by black transparent polygon in the figure thus identifies the rivers and forecast locations of the downstream alluvial river system of the gbm basins within bangladesh for which the reqsim local scale model has been applied during 2017 flood season once those river points are identified the forecast transfer begins from base stations to their immediate downstream or upstream river points and from those points to further downstream or upstream points respectively to evaluate the forecast performance we used commonly used statistical parameters such as mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse for details of these statistical techniques please see gupta et al 1999 singh et al 2005 and moriasi et al 2007 4 results 4 1 peak rainfall events and performance of rainfall datasets observational analysis anomalous heavy rainfall occurred during the second week of august across southeast nepal south sikkim north west bengal and west assam states of india southwest bhutan and northwest bangladesh region according to gauge measured and satellite data some places in these areas received more than 500 mm rain over a 5 days period from august 9 13 fig 3 a an extreme value analysis reveals that annual maximum 5 9 days total rain in the brahmaputra domain iv occurred over august 9 13 august 7 15 were 45 15 year return period events they were 8 5 year events in the domain iii of the basin considering entire basin the peak rainfalls were 50 20 year events which led to a 65 75 year flood flow in the downstream with respect to non gauge rainfall dataset s ability to capture extreme rainfall events tmpa and gpm show a much better coverage of rainfall observations across the region they also show a close similarity to the distribution of gauge rainfall along the nepal and india border south sikkim north west bengal and east assam in india east bhutan and northwest bangladesh region fig 3 b c the rainfall patterns in the southern coastal and southeast hilly regions of bangladesh are also captured by these two datasets era interim rainfall also captured the overall rainfall patterns well in the gb basins fig 3 d cpc global precipitation shows high rainfall in lower parts of the gb e g in bangladesh but failed completely along the india nepal border in assam india and bhutan fig 3 e wrf is the only forecasted rainfall considered here that provides 1 6 day rainfall forecast which overestimates rain significantly in areas where gauge or other datasets do not show much rain fig 3 f the domain average daily rainfall of all non gauge dataset shows strong agreement with gauge data over the entire ganges and brahmaputra basin fig 4 however the non gauge rainfall estimates work better in wet regions e g the eastern ganges and the southern brahmaputra compared to arid regions e g the western ganges and norther brahmaputra tmpa and gpm datasets show significantly higher correspondence to gauge data for example the r2 of domain i iv rainfall of tmpa gpm vary from 0 43 to 0 82 0 32 0 78 in the ganges and from 0 14 to 0 78 0 14 0 73 in the brahmaputra basin the accuracy of wrf forecasts drops significantly as forecast lead time increases these comparisons suggest that tmpa and gpm s data are superior in capturing large scale rainfall over the gb river basin for 2017 flood 4 2 performance of reqsim forecasts the reqsim regional i e gbm river basins and local scale i e selected river points of the gbm inside bangladesh models were used for operational forecasts during the 2017 flood season for three major entry points to bangladesh and 32 dowsntream river stations the mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse of the ganges river at hardinge bridge are 0 33 m 0 97 and 0 97 respectively for 10 day lead time the brahmaputra forecasts at bahadurabad was reliable up to 7 day lead time corresponding mae r2 nse are 0 4 m 0 74 0 7 respectively the performance in the barak upper meghna river at amalshid was limited up to 5 day lead time corresponding mae r2 nse are 0 86 m 0 59 0 51 respectively fig 5 show reqsim s ability to predict august 2017 flood at three key gbm basin points for different forecasting lead time the model provides encouraging results table 1 and fig 6 for several locations inside bangladesh with accurate predictions of peak flood timing and magnitude for example the reqsim provides 10 day forecasts with nse values 0 89 0 97 and mae 0 33 0 54 m for the ganges mahananda gorai system in the west of country for the brahmaputra and old brahmaputra river system nse value ranges 0 49 0 68 and mae 0 32 0 48 m for 10 day forecasts and nse 0 62 0 78 and mae 0 36 0 68 m for 7 day forecasts the model performed reasonably well in the padma kumar and other rivers in the central part of bangladesh for up to 7 day lead time and moderately in the surma kushiyara system in the east for up to 5 day lead time table 1 presents performance statistics of different river system in detail forecasting magnitude and timing of the peak flood is a challenging endeavor for any flood forecasting system we have examined both these aspects of the reqsim forecasts for 2017 flood both the ganges and brahmaputra forecast show that up to 5 day lead time peak flood came either on the same day or within one day of predicted peak flow for 6 10 day lead times it arrived within 1 2 day of predicted peak flow for example on august 6 2017 reqsim predicted that a record 21 08 m brahmaputra peak flood would occur on august 16 2017 but the actual event 20 85 m occurred on august 15 the reqsim prediction for the brahmaputra for august 15 was 20 46 m for the ganges on august 12 2017 reqsim predicted that a peak flood 13 91 m would come on august 22 but the actual event 13 84 m occurred on august 21 the reqsim prediction for the ganges for august 21 was 13 80 m since the forecast is updated daily and the model is able to provide accurate peak flood timing within 5 to 6 days the accuracy of the reqsim s peak flood timing is deemed useful for real time operational management of flooding for the ganges and brahmaputra basin in their downstream region 5 discussion the observed rainfall events in the lower brahmaputra basin preceding the august 2017 flood were very large very high flood levels were reported at several monitoring stations along the brahmaputra and its tributaries in assam india bhutan and north bangladesh between august 11 and 17 sandrp 2017 but the observed flood event was found to have a 70 year return period yet on august 12 2017 glofas predicted large scale flooding in the gb basins for the next 7 10 days and warned that the brahmaputra basin might experience a flood likely to be more than a 200 year return period due to continuous heavy rain in the upstream ercc 2017 why did this forecast not materialize a closer look at earlier major floods may provide few clues past analyses of the basin s hydrometeorology suggest that a 50 year rain could led to a disproportionately large flood had the basin s rainfall sequence been steady and streamflow conditions were at or near bankfull stage before that peak rain event for example in 1998 mid september an average 2 33 year return period rain event over a 5 9 days period generated a 30 year peak flow in the brahmaputra basin while for the ganges a rainfall event with 5 year return period generated a 45 year peak flow during the same time because by early september 1998 soil for both the basins were already saturated following heavy rainfall from the preceding monsoon months june august and both the rivers were in almost at the bank full stage fig 7 a c consequently a relatively small rainfall event contributed to a very large runoff into already filled rivers and made the 1998 flood to be one of the most severe and longest lasting flood for the gbm basins the flood became even more severe due to peak flood flow synchronization of the ganges and brahmaputra river over a 10 day window in early september generally synchronization of peak flows of these two rivers is considered to be a major determinant of the extent of flooding in bangladesh rahman and salehin 2013 in fact the combined flow of these two rivers flowing into the padma river fig 2 in bangladesh remained above danger level for nearly two and a half months from early july to late september in 1998 fig 7 c in 2007 the ganges received moderate rainfall from the beginning of july to the first week of september as a result an average flooding was experienced in the ganges river in early august on the other hand the brahmaputra received two heavy rainfalls in late july and early september yet the basin did not face very large flood from these two events for example the late july rainfall which was a 10 year return period event and larger than the september event led to a 10 year flood in the basin however although the ganges river experienced an average flood 2 33 year return period and the brahmaputra encountered a moderate flood 10 year return period 2007 flood in downstream region of the gbm basin in bangladesh was more severe and found to have combined flow in the padma river well above danger level for about two months from late july to late september fig 7 f a key driver for the 2007 gbm flood was also found to be the flow synchronization of these two rivers over a 10 day window in early august in 2017 the brahmaputra basin was relatively dry and river bank was not full before the large rainfall events in early august as a result extreme rainfall events of early august produced large runoff raised the river water level above danger level rapidly but the floods were short lived and localized because of reduced rainfall from mid august onward fig 7 h i also the lower level of flow in the ganges fig 7 g and i helped to minimize the impact of higher flow from the brahmaputra in the central region of bangladesh more importantly the peak flood flow from the ganges and the brahmaputra did not synchronize with each other over a 10 day window during august 2017 flood fig 7 i as they did in 1998 and 2007 as a result the combined flow in the padma remained above danger level for less than two weeks during the second half of august fig 7 i this asynchronization of the ganges and brahmaputra peak may help explain why gbm basin in bangladesh did not experience a large and widespread flood in 2017 in this study we also investigated water level forecasting performance of a local reqsim model section 4 2 in reqsim local scale application the use of persistence both in space and time to transfer forecasts from one river point to another appears to be useful however this transfer of flow forecasting information is only possible for rivers that are relatively slow rising and between river points that have similar flow characteristics for example the model performed exceptionally well in the ganges mahananda gorai system in the west of bangladesh for up to 10 day lead time with nse values above 0 8 reasonably well in the brahmaputra old brahmaputra padma kumar and other rivers in the central part for up to 7 day lead time with nse values above 0 6 0 7 and moderately in the surma kushiyara system in the east for up to 5 day lead time with nse values 0 5 0 6 table 1 and fig 6 these results suggest that a local scale application of the reqsim model may be used as an operational tool to enhance country s ongoing flood forecasting activities 6 conclusion in august 2017 the middle brahmaputra basin in india experienced series of intense rainfall events and the brahmaputra river experienced a record high streamflow in bangladesh yet the prediction of a flood event with a 200 year return period made by forecasting agencies and widely circulated by news media did not materialize we have examined the hydrometeorology of the ganges and brahmaputra basins to show how the 2017 august flood emerged differently from past major floods in the region it is not the high rainfall or flood in either the ganges or the brahmaputra basin but the lack of peak flow synchronization of these two rivers in august 2017 may help explain why 2017 flood did not become as severe as those of 1998 and 2007 findings from this study also show that the evolution and dynamics of 2017 flood was localized in nature and short lived in duration assessment of available rainfall datasets reveals the usefulness of satellite sources such as tmpa gpm era interim cpc global precipitation and wrf to capture the extreme events and highlights the poor spatial coverage of in situ measurements comparison of rainfall from multiple sources suggests that the tmpa 3b42 rt and gpm imerge datasets provide better spatial coverage and higher accuracy compared to era interim cpc global precipitation and wrf forecasts particularly in high rainfall regions of the ganges and brahmaputra basins we have also examined the utility of a data driven requisitely simple reqsim flood forecast model findings from the real time application of reqsim during the 2017 flood provide encouraging results with accurate predictions of peak flood timing and magnitude for several locations of gbm basins in bangladesh for example the reqsim provides 10 day forecasts with nse values 0 89 0 97 and mae 0 33 0 54 m for the ganges river system inside bangladesh for the brahmaputra river system nse value ranges 0 49 0 68 and mae 0 32 0 48 m for 10 day forecasts and nse 0 62 0 78 and mae 0 36 0 68 m for 7 day forecasts the findings from the operational application of the reqsim model for the 2017 flood suggest that large scale rainfall patterns captured by the satellites or weather models are useful in a data driven model to obtain skillful flood forecasts for up to 10 day lead time for the ganges 7 day lead time for the brahmaputra and 5 day lead time for the meghna basin ease of operationalization and reliable forecasting accuracy of reqsim is of particular relevance for large rivers where access to upstream gauge measured rainfall and flow data are limited and detailed modeling approaches are operationally prohibitive and functionally ineffective credit authorship contribution statement wahid palash conceptualization

and promotes expanded and improved usage of grace and grace fo products by the scientific community end users and decision makers around the globe keywords groundwater sustainability fossil aquifers grace fo northern africa 1 introduction groundwater represents 30 50 of all global freshwater that represents only 2 5 of all water in the world shiklomanov and rodda 2003 wwap 2006 it has supported significant social economic agricultural and industrial development across the globe giordano 2009 giordano and villholth 2007 siebert et al 2010 for example groundwater currently supports 40 of the area equipped for irrigation globally and 60 within the united states siebert et al 2010 due to the pervasiveness of and ready access to this resource the minimal infrastructure required to use it and the general continuity of this supply that provide a buffer against droughts giordano 2009 groundwater resources can be developed and used to meet current and future needs as long as doing so does not cause unacceptable environmental or socioeconomic consequences this is usually referred to as groundwater sustainability when the average annual extracted groundwater exceeds the average annual recharge the groundwater system becomes unsustainable grogan et al 2017 unsustainable groundwater utilization has caused water tables in some areas to decline this in turn causes springs and wells to dry up it also causes increased pumping costs declines in the reservoirs and streams levels declines in groundwater quality land subsidence and conflict among water users e g essam et al 2020 gebremichael et al 2018 gido et al 2020 miller et al 2017 groundwater is the only natural strategic freshwater reserve in northern africa groundwater sustainability in this area is more crucial and challenging than in any other part of the globe aquifer systems in this region are shared by two or more countries i e transboundary aquifer systems and there is often very limited or no integrative collaboration between countries to sustain these shared systems sharma et al 1996 northern africa s groundwater resources are affected by both anthropogenic and natural drivers the dry climate in the region is forecast to become increasingly drier hulme et al 2001 which could decrease recharge rates to aquifer systems the mean summer june july august september precipitation over the sahel and majority of the sahara is projected to decrease between 0 5 and 2 mm day by the end of 21st century raj et al 2019 additionally both sahara and sahel are experiencing warming 1 6 k during summer season by the end of 21st century raj et al 2019 northern africa s growing population 2007 195 106 2017 235 106 worldometers 2018 urbanization and development are expected to accelerate pressure on and degradation of groundwater resources developing sustainable management scenarios for northern africa s groundwater resources is extremely critical to maintaining the region s food security and economic growth sustainable management scenarios for groundwater resources have traditionally been developed by examining field observations and or constructing comprehensive numerical models ahmed et al 2013 scanlon et al 2002 sultan et al 2011 although modelling approaches are effective they require the collection of broad field data e g groundwater levels hydraulic variables and lithologic data that are challenging to find on a regular and or high quality basis e g sultan et al 2013 additionally field observations do not adequately represent the entire hydrogeologic system under investigations for instance large scale flow diversification in deltaic regions floodplain inundation direct groundwater flow and drainage into wetlands are some of the many basin outflow pathways that are not registered by conventional stream flow gauges syed et al 2009 satellite remote sensing observations offer an alternative and or complement to field observations and numerical models these observations were successfully used to monitor both the quality and quantity of water resources in multiple hydrogeologic systems given the fact that they are globally distributed publicly available at no cost and temporally and spatially homogeneous the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data provide practical strategies to develop sustainable management scenarios for northern africa s groundwater resources e g rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 several studies have used grace data to investigate the dynamics of africa s aquifer systems abd elmotaal et al 2019 abdelmohsen et al 2019 agutu et al 2019 ahmed et al 2019 2016 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 ahmed and wiese 2019 carvalho resende et al 2019 gon√ßalv√®s et al 2013 henry 2011 kolusu et al 2019 lezzaik et al 2018 mazzoni

and integration techniques to investigate the sustainability of groundwater resources in africa s fossil aquifer systems in this study we developed and utilized an integrated approach that combines 17 years april 2002 september 2019 of terrestrial water storage tws data derived from the grace april 2002 june 2017 and grace follow on grace fo june 2018 present missions with soil moisture outputs of the global land data assimilation system gldas as well as altimetry and rainfall e g global precipitation climatology project gpcp data to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources in northern africa s largest fossil aquifer systems the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas and the northwestern saharan aquifer system nwsas fig 1 examining tws data provides significant feedback on both localized and instantaneous aquifer responses to rainfall changes as well as regional variability related to changes in the aquifers groundwater storage and soil moisture storage specifically we suggest management practices that could support the sustainable use of fossil groundwater resources in nsas and nwsas these practices were developed based on integrated assessments of aquifer dynamics that have been conducted by quantifying spatiotemporal changes in tws and groundwater storage gws and exploring their natural and anthropogenic controlling factors in our approach we assume that sustainable groundwater extraction is accomplished when gws trends are equal to recharge discharge or greater than recharge discharge zero but not less than zero recharge discharge 2 geologic and hydrogeologic settings of the study area we investigated the sustainability of groundwater resources in two of the largest fossil aquifer systems in africa and the entire globe the nsas and the nwsas fig 1 in northern africa the nsas and the nwsas sustain populations of 160 106 and 60 106 respectively worldometers 2018 both aquifers currently receive minimal annual rainfall nwsas 75 mm nsas 35 mm and are believed to have recharged during previous pluvial periods in the quaternary due to the intensification of paleomonsoons yan and petit maire 1994 or the intensification of paleo westerlies abouelmagd et al 2014 the nsas area 2 0 106 km2 fig 1 is shared by egypt 38 libya 34 sudan 17 and chad 11 it contains three sub basins separated by basement uplift the dakhla sub basin in egypt nse area 0 66 106 km2 the kufra sub basin in libya northeastern chad and northwestern sudan nsl area 0 88 106 km2 and the northern sudan sub basin in northern sudan nss area 0 44 106 km2 fig 1 we are developing sustainable management scenarios for the entire nsas as well as for each of these individual sub basins the nsas consists mainly of continental sandstone nubian sandstone with intercalated shale origin deltaic marine age pre upper cretaceous overlying basement rocks proterozoic hesse et al 1987 the thickness of the nsas ranges from 500 to 4000 m thorweihe and heinl 2002 the nsas is confined within central and northern egypt and libya e g north latitude 25th beneath thick shale formations marine upper cretaceous within the nsas regional groundwater flows from recharge areas in the south sudan and chad to discharge areas in the north egypt and libya the nwsas area 1 0 106 km2 fig 1 is shared by algeria 70 libya 25 and tunisia 5 it is mainly composed of continental deposits that include the continental intercalary ci equivalent to the nubian sandstone of nsas and the carbonaceous complex terminal ct which occupies the central part of the nwsas the ct unconfined upper cretaceous to the miocene shallow and the ci confined middle jurassic to the lower cretaceous deep represent the main aquifer units within the nwsas these two units are separated by semi permeable layers aquitard cenomanian oss 2008 the depth to the nwsas ranges from 400 and 2000 m below ground surface al gamal 2011 the regional groundwater flow in the nwsas proceeds roughly from south to north and from southwest to northeast besbes et al 2004 3 data and methods grace april 2002 june 2017 and its successor grace fo may 2018 present are joint national aeronautics and space administration usa and german aerospace center germany missions that measure the spatiotemporal variations in the dynamic compartments of tws these include groundwater surface water soil moisture snow and ice tapley et al 2019 2004 wahr et al 1998 grace and grace fo can resolve tws changes with sufficient accuracy over spatial scales that range from 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 to 63 000 km2 vishwakarma et al 2018 in this study we used five sources of monthly tws data that span the period from april 2002 through september 2019 table 1 we used three spherical harmonic sh solutions from the university of texas center for space research csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the german research centre for geosciences gfz bettadpur 2018 landerer and swenson 2012 as well as two mass concentration mascon solutions from csr csrm and jpl jplm save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 sh solutions were generated by parameterizing the earth s gravity field using global spherical harmonics basis functions whereas the mascon solutions were extracted by parameterizing the gravity field using regional mass concentration functions landerer and swenson 2012 save et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 compared to the sh solutions the mascon solutions provide higher signal to noise ratio higher spatial resolution and reduced error and do not require spectral and spatial filtering luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 however rescaling sh solutions significantly increases agreement with mascon solutions scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 tws data was processed by removing temporal mean replacing the c20 coefficient cheng et al 2011 adding geocenter motion swenson et al 2008 and removing solid earth effects a et al 2013 postprocessing techniques such as destriping swenson and wahr 2006 smoothing radius 300 km wahr et al 1998 and subsequent application of scale factors were applied to remove correlated errors and compensate for gain damping in sh solutions landerer and swenson 2012 tws trends were extracted by simultaneously fitting seasonal and trend parameters to each tws time series e g fallatah et al 2019 2017 niyazi et al 2019 2018 spatial variation in tws trends over the nsas and the nwsas are shown in fig 2 we extracted tws time series over the investigated aquifers as the average of the five tws sources fig 3 the average was found to reduce the noise in the gravity field solutions within the available scatter of the solutions e g sakumura et al 2014 these aquifers include the nwsas and the nsas as well as the nsas sub basins in egypt nse libya northeastern chad northwestern sudan nsl and northern sudan nss refer to fig 1 for locations errors in the monthly tws estimates fig 4 and trend errors were quantified using the approach described in ahmed and wiese 2019 and ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 breakpoint detection algorithms bai and perron 2003 forkel et al 2013 zeileis et al 2003 were used to detect breakpoints in tws time series after annual cycle removal fig 5 the extracted tws trends were statistically tested to identify confidence levels gws time series and associated errors fig 6 were quantified by removing the contributions of surface water storage sws and soil moisture storage sms from the tws time series according to the following equations 1 gws t w s s m s s w s 2 œÉ gws œÉ tws 2 œÉ sms 2 œÉ sws 2 where œÉ tws œÉ gws œÉ sms and œÉ sws represent errors in tws gws sms and sws respectively breakpoint detection algorithms were used to detect breakpoints in gws time series after we removed the annual cycle fig 7 gldas is a nasa developed land surface modeling system that simulates land surface states e g soil moisture snow surface temperature and fluxes e g evapotranspiration ground heat flux using both ground and satellite based observations rodell et al 2004 our previous study over africa ahmed et al 2016 has shown that gldas provides more reasonable estimates of sms in arid environments compared to other land surface models sms data were extracted as average of soil moisture estimates from four versions of the gldas model vic clm noah and mosaic rodell et al 2004 the average was used to minimize differences in trends and seasonal amplitudes between simulated and measured sms ahmed et al 2016 kato et al 2007 scanlon et al 2019 2018 the monthly standard deviations of the four versions were used to quantify monthly sms errors e g ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the standard deviation estimate was reported to be larger than the difference between any one model or the average of several models and observed sms kato et al 2007 voss et al 2013 sms time series over each of the examined aquifer systems are shown in fig s1 sws data were extracted for lake nasser and the tushka lakes within the nse fig 1 lake nasser levels were generated from the hydroweb database cr√©taux et al 2011 temporal variations in the tushka lakes volume and areas were extracted from chipman 2019 sws monthly errors were calculated using the same approach described in ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the time series of lake nasser and the tushka lakes are shown in fig s2 we used rainfall data extracted from the gpcp to explore the control of rainfall variability on tws and gws spatiotemporal variabilities within the investigated aquifer systems gpcp derived rainfall estimates were calculated by combining satellite and ground based measurements adler et al 2018 gpcp are provided on a monthly basis from 1979 through 2020 at a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 and a spatial coverage of 88 75 n to 88 75 s average annual rainfall aar and long term 1979 2019 mean annual rainfall ltmar were calculated over the investigated aquifer systems 4 results and discussion fig 2 illustrates the spatial variations in tws trends during the period from april 2002 to september 2019 over nsas and nwsas and the surrounding areas these trends were generated from three sh csr fig 2a jpl fig 2b gfz fig 2c and two mascon csrm fig 2d jplm fig 2e tws solutions the average of the tws trend estimates is shown in fig 2f cold colors in fig 2 indicate that tws is decreasing over time e g depletion negative trends whereas warm colors indicate that tws is increasing over time e g wetting positive trends examination of fig 2 reveals that tws wetting trends are concentrated only over southern portions of the nsas specifically the southern portions of the nsl and the nss severe tws depletion trends are concentrated over the northern portions of the nwsas and the central parts of the nse fig 2 to compare tws trends generated from different grace and grace fo solutions four statistical measures were used minimum maximum average and standard deviation these statistical measures are shown in the lower left corner of each panel in fig 2 they were calculated for the entire tws trend images shown in fig 2 note that these images extend slightly beyond the boundaries of the nsas and the nwsas inspection of these statistical measures indicates that there is an overall agreement between tws trend estimates generated from different grace and grace fo derived tws solutions for example average tws trend rates of 1 64 1 59 1 92 1 46 and 1 19 mm yr are estimated from the csr jpl gfz csrm and jplm solutions respectively the standard deviations in tws trends are estimated to be 2 24 2 22 2 23 2 64 and 3 28 mm yr respectively the higher standard deviation in the jplm solution might be attributable to the mascon basis functions used to extract these solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 similarly the minimum maximum tws trends extracted from csr jpl gfz csrm and jplm are estimated to be 7 43 2 95 7 54 2 95 7 98 2 38 8 31 8 28 and 9 17 mm yr 6 00 mm yr respectively the higher range of tws trends of csrm and jplm may be attributable to a better reduction of leakage errors and improved signal localization in case of mascons solutions compared to the sh solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 rodell et al 2018 fig 3 shows temporal variability in tws averaged over the nwsas fig 3a nsas fig 3b nsl fig 3c nss fig 3d and nse fig 3e from different tws solutions fig 3 indicates that there is good agreement among all the tws estimates extracted from different grace and grace fo data in phases trends and amplitudes over each of the investigated aquifer systems over the investigated aquifer systems figs 4 and 6 show tws time series averaged from five different grace and grace fo solutions and gws time series generated from eqs 1 and 2 and associated uncertainty bounds respectively breakpoint trend analyses for the tws and gws time series are shown in figs 5 and 7 respectively in the next few sections we show the magnitude and drivers of tws and gws spatiotemporal variabilities over the investigated aquifer systems these estimates are then used to suggest optimal management practices that could be adapted to sustainably utilize fossil groundwater resources in the investigated aquifer systems table 2 4 1 northwestern saharan aquifer system nwsas figs 4a and 5a indicate that the nwsas experienced tws depletion 3 54 0 12 mm yr 3 70 0 12 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period april 2002 september 2019 breakpoint trend analysis shows variable tws trends over three periods april 2002 january 2006 february 2006 october 2008 and november 2008 september 2019 the nwsas experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 55 tws wetting trend of 0 60 0 90 mm yr 0 62 0 94 km3 yr between april 2002 and january 2006 a severe tws depletion 10 05 1 21 mm yr 10 52 1 26 km3 yr between february 2006 and october 2008 and a moderate tws depletion rate 4 99 0 18 mm yr 5 22 0 18 km3 yr between november 2008 and september 2019 figs 6a and 7a show temporal variabilities in gws over the nwsas during the entire investigated period april 2002 september2019 the nwsas experienced a gws depletion trend 3 03 0 10 mm yr 3 17 0 10 km3 yr the observed gws depletion trend was weak 0 31 0 57 mm yr 0 32 0 59 km3 yr and nonsignificant p value 0 61 during the first 5 years april 2002 june 2007 and relatively strong 3 32 0 15 mm yr 3 47 0 15 km3 yr during the remaining 12 years july 2007 september 2019 it is difficult to explain the tws and gws spatiotemporal variabilities over nwsas based on variations in rainfall rates since no significant decline in rainfall was observed over the nwsas the aar was reported to be 85 98 and 85 mm during 2002 2006 2006 2008 and 2008 2019 respectively representing 100 115 and 100 of the ltmar 85 mm temporal variations in tws and gws trends over the nwsas can be attributed to the observed rise in groundwater extraction activities the groundwater withdrawal in the nwsas increased from 0 60 km3 yr in 1970 to 2 50 km3 yr in 2000 and 2 85 km3 yr in 2013 gon√ßalv√®s et al 2013 the minute difference between grace derived gws depletion 3 03 0 10 mm yr 3 17 0 10 km3 yr and reported groundwater extraction rates may be related to natural discharge rates 0 45 0 15 mm yr 0 47 0 15 km3 yr gon√ßalv√®s et al 2013 that tws and gws data take into account in addition the average depth to water table in the northern parts of the nwsas was constant at 22 5 m during 2002 2005 a 5 m decline in water table depth was observed during 2006 2015 carvalho resende et al 2019 massuel and riaux 2017 this observation is consistent with the observed severe tws decline in the northern parts of the nwsas fig 2 examination of spatiotemporal variabilities in gws indicates that the nwsas is not being sustainably managed and is becoming depleted in other words the average annual recharge rates are less than current groundwater extraction rates sustainable groundwater utilization could be accomplished if the average annual groundwater withdrawal from the nwsas is reduced by 2 70 km3 table 2 we calculated this number by subtracting the grace derived gws depletion rate from the reported natural discharge rates 4 2 nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas the nsas experienced a weak tws depletion of 0 89 0 11 mm yr 1 87 0 21 km3 yr during the investigated period figs 4b and 5b however during the first four years april 2002 october2006 and the following seven years november 2006 december 2013 of the investigation the nsas experienced moderate tws depletion 2 59 0 71 mm yr 5 16 1 41 km3 yr 3 29 0 29 mm yr 6 55 0 57 km3 yr this was followed by a weak tws wetting trend 0 99 0 53 mm yr 1 98 1 05 km3 yr during the remaining six years january 2014 september 2019 the nsas also experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 15 gws increasing trend 0 16 0 10 mm yr 0 32 0 19 km3 yr during the investigated period figs 6b and 7b a weak gws increasing trend 1 69 0 54 mm yr 3 37 1 07 km3 yr was observed during the first five years april 2002 august 2007 this was followed by a moderate gws increasing trend 3 41 0 48 mm yr 6 79 0 95 km3 yr during the next five years september 2007 july 2012 and nonsignificant p value 0 97 steady state gws conditions 0 01 0 35 mm yr 0 03 0 69 km3 yr during the remaining seven years august 2012 september2019 of the investigation fig 7b over the nsas temporal variabilities in tws and gws trends can be attributed to combined natural e g rainfall variability and anthropogenic variabilities e g groundwater extraction below we explain magnitudes and factors that control the variability of the tws and gws over each individual nsas sub basin however because gws trends are not negative the entire nsas could be used sustainably at the current rate of groundwater extraction table 2 4 3 kufra sub basin nsl the nsl experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 15 tws depletion trend 0 17 0 11 mm yr 0 15 0 09 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period figs 4c and 5c the observed rates of tws vary over time during the first three years april 2002 january 2005 the nsl experienced a severe tws depletion 6 53 1 32 mm yr 5 79 1 16 km3 yr during the following three years february 2005 august 2008 the nsl experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 27 tws wetting trend 0 90 0 76 mm yr 0 79 0 67 km3 yr followed by a weak tws wetting trend 1 18 0 18 mm yr 1 05 0 15 km3 yr during the remaining 11 years of the investigation september 2008 september 2019 examination of figs 6c and 7c indicates that the nsl witnessed a nonsignificant p value 0 02 gws increasing trend 0 26 0 10 mm yr 0 23 0 08 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period april2002 september2019 however a moderate gws depletion rate 2 40 0 68 mm yr 2 13 0 60 km3 yr was observed during the first four years april 2002 october 2006 followed by a weak gws depletion rate 1 91 0 28 mm yr 1 69 0 24 km3 yr over the next seven years november2006 december2013 and a nonsignificant p value 0 03 gws increasing trend 1 25 0 47 mm yr 1 10 0 41 km3 yr during the remaining five years january 2014 september 2019 of the investigation fig 7c temporal variabilities in tws and gws trends over the nsl can be attributed to both natural and anthropogenic variability natural variabilities e g rainfall variability are believed to control tws in the southern portions of the nsl e g in chad and sudan where there are higher annual rainfall rates aar 90 mm anthropogenic variabilities e g groundwater extraction on the other hand are believed to control the tws and gws rates in the northern portions of the nsl e g in libya where the annual rainfall rates are lower aar 5 mm and groundwater extraction rates are higher the observed decline in both tws and gws during 2002 2006 can be attributed partially to a decline in rainfall rates aar 33 mm 76 of the ltmar 44 mm during that period the tws increase during 2005 2008 and 2008 2019 can be attributed to rainfall increase we estimate that the aar rates over the nsl were 46 and 49 mm during 2005 2008 and 2008 2019 respectively these rates represent 104 and 111 of the ltmar respectively declines in gws trends during 2002 2006 and 2006 2013 can be partially attributed to excessive groundwater extraction hamad and ahweej 2020 reported a significant groundwater drawdown average 5 54 m minimum 0 32 m maximum 15 2 m between 2005 and 2015 in 26 wells located in the southeastern parts of libya northern parts of the nsl groundwater extraction rates increased from 0 857 km3 in 1998 to 1 90 0 19 km3 in 2015 mohamed 2019 in the northern parts of the nsl generally at the current levels of extraction the nsl could be used in a sustainable manner since the current gws overall trend 0 23 0 08 km3 yr is greater than zero table 2 4 4 northern sudan sub basin nss the nss experienced a weak wetting tws trend 0 95 0 12 mm yr 0 42 0 05 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period figs 4d and 5d the magnitude of the observed tws wetting trends varies over time a weaker tws wetting trend 0 77 0 28 mm yr 0 34 0 12 km3 yr was observed during the first nine years april 2002 may 2011 compared to that 2 66 0 34 mm yr 1 18 0 15 km3 yr observed during the remaining eight years june 2011 september 2019 of the investigation in addition the nss experienced an increasing gws trend of 1 42 0 12 mm yr 0 63 0 05 km3 yr during the investigated period fig 6d and 7d this increasing gws trend was weak 1 72 0 14 mm yr 0 76 0 06 km3 yr during the first 13 years april 2002 september 2015 and strong 5 33 1 26 mm yr 2 36 0 55 km3 yr during the remaining four years october 2015 september 2019 of the investigation fig 7d tws and gws variabilities over the nss can be attributed to rainfall variability we estimated that the aar rates over the nss were 107 107 133 and 155 mm during 2002 2011 2002 2015 2011 2019 and 2015 2019 respectively these rates represent 100 100 122 and 143 of the ltmar 107 mm respectively because the overall trend in gws over the nsl is positive the nsl could be used in a sustainable manner at the current utilization rate table 2 4 5 dakhla sub basin nse the nse experienced a moderate tws depletion trend 3 46 0 13 mm yr 2 28 0 08 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period figs 4e and 5e the tws depletion rate over the nse exhibits temporal variability during the first four years april 2002 october 2006 and the following seven

27 0 10 mm yr 1 50 0 06 km3 yr declining gws trends derived from this study during entire investigated period april 2002 september2019 contradict the trends reported by ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 and abdelmohsen et al 2019 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 showed that the groundwater resources of the nse locally respond to changes in lake nasser levels as well as changes in rainfall rates over the recharge domains an average annual groundwater recharge rate of 1 66 km3 was reported during the 2002 2006 and 2008 2016 wet periods under excessive precipitation 146 of ltmar over the nubian recharge domains and or under a significant rise 1 10 m in lake nasser levels using isotopic and static gravity measurements abdelmohsen et al 2019 showed that the nse recharge from the recharge domains and from lake nasser during 2013 2016 occurred along networks of densely fractured and karstified bedrocks that provide preferential pathways for groundwater flow differences between this study and previous studies could be attributed to longer and enhanced tws sms and sws time series as well as innovative data processing and integration techniques used in this study specifically 1 previous studies used one abdelmohsen et al 2019 or three ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 release 5 grace solutions whereas this study used five release 6 grace solutions 3 sh and 2 mascon solutions table 1 2 this study broaden the investigated period by three years and included grace fo solutions current study april 2002 to september 2019 previous studies april 2002 to june 2016 3 missing months in tws time series were filled in by linear interpolation in previous studies whereas no data were assigned to missing months in this study 3 automatic breakpoint detection algorithms were used in this study previous studies manually divided tws and gws time series into different segments 4 this study used enhanced sws data extracted by multisensor e g visible thermal and radar remote sensing datasets e g tushka lakes and 5 previous studies e g abdelmohsen et al 2019 reported only spatiotemporal variability in tws whereas this study used enhanced sms e g outputs of four versions of gldas and sws to report spatiotemporal variability in gws the temporal variations in the tws trends over the nse cannot be explained by variations in rainfall rates since the aar rates are very small we estimated that they were 7 11 and 12 mm during 2002 2006 2006 2013 and 2013 2019 respectively over the nse both the tws and the gws are controlled by groundwater extraction groundwater withdrawal increased from 0 47 km3 yr in 1979 to 1 1 km3 yr in 2003 and 2 20 km3 yr in 2009 e g ahmed et al 2014 ebraheem et al 2003 sustainable groundwater utilization could be achieved if the average annual groundwater withdrawal rate over the nse is reduced by 1 50 km3 table 2 we expect these groundwater extraction rates from the nse to increase in the future because egypt is currently seeking additional water resources to support an ambitious desert farming project that would reclaim 1 5 106 acres ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 in addition there is political tension between egypt and ethiopia regarding the nile river water ethiopia recently began construction of the renaissance dam which will decrease egypt s surface water allocation from the blue nile water 85 of egypt s allocation for several years ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 construction of the renaissance dam will reduce egypt s annual allocation 55 km3 by at least 27 and will cause the loss of more than 27 of the agricultural land in egypt ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 sultan et al 2014 this could translate into a significant loss of economic activity in egypt as well as putting significant pressure on the available groundwater resources 5 summary and conclusions achieving sustainable use of groundwater resources in northern africa is challenging because majority of northern africa s aquifer systems cross country borders rainfall rates and associated recharge rates are predicted to decrease and the population and associated degradation of groundwater resources in the region are predicted to increase in situ observations in this region are very limited in both availability and quality maintaining field networks that cover all of northern africa would be prohibitively economically expensive and labor intensive fortunately tws data derived from the grace and grace fo missions provide an economical and effective way to monitor northern africa s groundwater resources and develop sustainable management scenarios for the region we integrated 17 years april 2002 september 2019 of tws data with soil moisture products derived from land surface models as well as rainfall and altimetry data to develop sustainable management scenarios for groundwater resources in northern africa s largest aquifer systems the nsas in egypt libya chad and sudan and the nwsas in algeria libya and tunisia we investigated the sustainability of the nwsas and the nsas as a whole as well as each of the individual sub basin within the nsas our results indicate that the entire nwsas is currently being depleted and that sustainable groundwater utilization could be accomplished if the average groundwater withdrawal is reduced by 2 70 km3 yr the nsas in egypt e g the dakhla sub basin is also experiencing groundwater depletion in this case sustainable groundwater utilization could be achieved if the average withdrawal rate is reduced by 1 50 km3 yr depletion in both the nwsas and the dakhla sub basin is related to excessive groundwater extraction from these systems in contrast the entire nsas the kufra sub basin in libya northeastern chad and northwestern sudan and the northern sudan sub basin in northern sudan are healthy and could be used sustainably at the current rate of groundwater extraction our findings signal an urgent need for integrated responses to overcome the current groundwater depletion and develop sustainable utilization plans for groundwater resources in the nwsas and the nsas in egypt management practices that could help minimize groundwater depletion in this area include but are not limited to reducing irrigated areas and wells drilling replacing conventional crops with drought tolerant crops adopting groundwater allocation for each acre of farmland replacing conventional flood and pivot irrigation with drip irrigation systems implementing modern irrigation technology e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration sensors to minimize irrigated runoff conserve water and nutrient resources and reduce pumping and associated energy and costs minimizing water loss from surface reservoirs e g lake nasser in egypt to direct evaporation by deepening reservoirs covering surface water with shade balls and constructing barriers to reduce wind speed adopting a combined surface water and groundwater management plan by channeling the excess water from surface water bodies to regions that have aquifer outcrops in order to recharge the underlying aquifer systems and enhancing local people s awareness of both sustainable groundwater development and local practices that degrade the quality of available groundwater resources results of this study confirm the unique capabilities of grace and grace fo derived tws data for monitoring the health of northern africa s aquifer systems and their potential for developing near real time monitoring systems for globally distributed aquifer systems however it is worth mentioning that we only examined 17 years including missing months of tws data in this study the acquisition of additional grace fo and grace ii data will enhance our understanding of sustainability within different hydrogeologic systems this study also promises to improve our understanding of northern africa s aquifer dynamics and sustainability and it promotes expanded and improved use of grace and grace fo products by the scientific community end users and decision

significant social economic agricultural and industrial development across the globe giordano 2009 giordano and villholth 2007 siebert et al 2010 for example groundwater currently supports 40 of the area equipped for irrigation globally and 60 within the united states siebert et al 2010 due to the pervasiveness of and ready access to this resource the minimal infrastructure required to use it and the general continuity of this supply that provide a buffer against droughts giordano 2009 groundwater resources can be developed and used to meet current and future needs as long as doing so does not cause unacceptable environmental or socioeconomic consequences this is usually referred to as groundwater sustainability when the average annual extracted groundwater exceeds the average annual recharge the groundwater system becomes unsustainable grogan et al 2017 unsustainable groundwater utilization has caused water tables in some areas to decline this in turn causes springs and wells to dry up it also causes increased pumping costs declines in the reservoirs and streams levels declines in groundwater quality land subsidence and conflict among water users e g essam et al 2020 gebremichael et al 2018 gido et al 2020 miller et al 2017 groundwater is the only natural strategic freshwater reserve in northern africa groundwater sustainability in this area is more crucial and challenging than in any other part of the globe aquifer systems in this region are shared by two or more countries i e transboundary aquifer systems and there is often very limited or no integrative collaboration between countries to sustain these shared systems sharma et al 1996 northern africa s groundwater resources are affected by both anthropogenic and natural drivers the dry climate in the region is forecast to become increasingly drier hulme et al 2001 which could decrease recharge rates to aquifer systems the mean summer june july august september precipitation over the sahel and majority of the sahara is projected to decrease between 0 5 and 2 mm day by the end of 21st century raj et al 2019 additionally both sahara and sahel are experiencing warming 1 6 k during summer season by the end of 21st century raj et al 2019 northern africa s growing population 2007 195 106 2017 235 106 worldometers 2018 urbanization and development are expected to accelerate pressure on and degradation of groundwater resources developing sustainable management scenarios for northern africa s groundwater resources is extremely critical to maintaining the region s food security and economic growth sustainable management scenarios for groundwater resources have traditionally been developed by examining field observations and or constructing comprehensive numerical models ahmed et al 2013 scanlon et al 2002 sultan et al 2011 although modelling approaches are effective they require the collection of broad field data e g groundwater levels hydraulic variables and lithologic data that are challenging to find on a regular and or high quality basis e g sultan et al 2013 additionally field observations do not adequately represent the entire hydrogeologic system under investigations for instance large scale flow diversification in deltaic regions floodplain inundation direct groundwater flow and drainage into wetlands are some of the many basin outflow pathways that are not registered by conventional stream flow gauges syed et al 2009 satellite remote sensing observations offer an alternative and or complement to field observations and numerical models these observations were successfully used to monitor both the quality and quantity of water resources in multiple hydrogeologic systems given the fact that they are globally distributed publicly available at no cost and temporally and spatially homogeneous the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data provide practical strategies to develop sustainable management scenarios for northern africa s groundwater resources e g rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 several studies have used grace data to investigate the dynamics of africa s aquifer systems abd elmotaal et al 2019 abdelmohsen et al

and integration techniques to investigate the sustainability of groundwater resources in africa s fossil aquifer systems in this study we developed and utilized an integrated approach that combines 17

the global land data assimilation system gldas as well as altimetry and rainfall e g global precipitation climatology project gpcp data to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources in northern africa s largest fossil aquifer systems the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas and the northwestern saharan aquifer system nwsas fig 1 examining tws data provides significant feedback on both localized and instantaneous aquifer responses to rainfall changes as well as regional variability related to changes in the aquifers groundwater storage and soil moisture storage specifically we suggest management practices that could support the sustainable use of fossil groundwater resources in nsas and nwsas these practices were developed based on integrated assessments of aquifer dynamics that have been conducted by quantifying spatiotemporal changes in tws and groundwater storage gws and exploring their natural and anthropogenic controlling factors in our approach we assume that sustainable groundwater extraction is accomplished when gws trends are equal to recharge discharge or greater than recharge discharge zero but not less than zero recharge discharge 2 geologic and hydrogeologic settings of the study area we investigated the sustainability of groundwater resources in two of the largest fossil aquifer systems in africa and the entire globe the nsas and the nwsas fig 1 in northern africa the nsas and the nwsas sustain populations of 160 106 and 60 106 respectively worldometers 2018 both aquifers currently receive minimal annual rainfall nwsas 75 mm nsas 35 mm and are believed to have recharged during previous pluvial periods in the quaternary due to the intensification of paleomonsoons yan and petit maire 1994 or the intensification of paleo westerlies abouelmagd et al 2014 the nsas area 2 0 106 km2 fig 1 is shared by egypt 38 libya 34 sudan 17 and chad 11 it contains three sub basins separated by basement uplift the dakhla sub basin in egypt nse area 0 66 106 km2 the kufra sub basin in libya northeastern chad and northwestern sudan nsl area 0 88 106 km2 and the northern sudan sub basin in northern sudan nss area 0 44 106 km2 fig 1 we are developing sustainable management scenarios for the entire nsas as well as for each of these individual sub basins the nsas consists mainly of continental sandstone nubian sandstone with intercalated shale origin deltaic marine age pre upper cretaceous overlying basement rocks proterozoic hesse et al 1987 the thickness of the nsas ranges from 500 to 4000 m thorweihe and heinl 2002 the nsas is confined within central and northern egypt and libya e g north latitude 25th beneath thick shale formations marine upper cretaceous within the nsas regional groundwater flows from recharge areas in the south sudan and chad to discharge areas in the north egypt and libya the nwsas area 1 0 106 km2 fig 1 is shared by algeria 70 libya 25 and tunisia 5 it is mainly composed of continental deposits that include the continental intercalary ci equivalent to the nubian sandstone of nsas and the carbonaceous complex terminal ct which occupies the central part of the nwsas the ct unconfined upper cretaceous to the miocene shallow and the ci confined middle jurassic to the lower cretaceous deep represent the main aquifer units within the nwsas these two units are separated by semi permeable layers aquitard cenomanian oss 2008 the depth to the nwsas ranges from 400 and 2000 m below ground surface al gamal 2011 the regional groundwater flow in the nwsas proceeds roughly from south to north and from southwest to northeast besbes et al 2004 3 data and methods grace april 2002 june 2017 and its successor grace fo may 2018 present are joint national aeronautics and space administration usa and german aerospace center germany missions that measure the spatiotemporal variations in the dynamic compartments of tws these include groundwater surface water soil moisture snow and ice tapley et al 2019 2004 wahr et al 1998 grace and grace fo can resolve tws changes with sufficient accuracy over spatial scales that range from 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 to 63 000 km2 vishwakarma et al 2018 in this study we used five sources of monthly tws data that span the period from april 2002 through september 2019 table 1 we used three spherical harmonic sh solutions from the university of texas center for space research csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the german research centre for geosciences gfz bettadpur 2018 landerer and swenson 2012 as well as two mass concentration mascon solutions from csr csrm and jpl jplm save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 sh solutions were generated by parameterizing the earth s gravity field using global spherical harmonics basis functions whereas the mascon solutions were extracted by parameterizing the gravity field using regional mass concentration functions landerer and swenson 2012 save et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 compared to the sh solutions the mascon solutions provide higher signal to noise ratio higher spatial resolution and reduced error and do not require spectral and spatial filtering luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 however rescaling sh solutions significantly increases agreement with mascon solutions scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 tws data was processed by removing temporal mean replacing the c20 coefficient cheng et al 2011 adding geocenter motion swenson et al 2008 and removing solid earth effects a et al 2013 postprocessing techniques such as destriping swenson and wahr 2006 smoothing radius 300 km wahr et al 1998 and subsequent application of scale factors were applied to remove correlated errors and compensate for gain damping in sh solutions landerer and swenson 2012 tws trends were extracted by simultaneously fitting seasonal and trend parameters to each tws time series e g fallatah et al 2019 2017 niyazi et al 2019 2018 spatial variation in tws trends over the nsas and the nwsas are shown in fig 2 we extracted tws time series over the investigated aquifers as the average of the five tws sources fig 3 the average was found to reduce the noise in the gravity field solutions within the available scatter of the solutions e g sakumura et al 2014 these aquifers include the nwsas and the nsas as well as the nsas sub basins in egypt nse libya northeastern chad northwestern sudan nsl and northern sudan nss refer to fig 1 for locations errors in the monthly tws estimates fig 4 and trend errors were quantified using the approach described in ahmed and wiese 2019 and ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 breakpoint detection algorithms bai and perron 2003 forkel et al 2013 zeileis et al 2003 were used to detect breakpoints in tws time series after annual cycle removal fig 5 the extracted tws trends were statistically tested to identify confidence levels gws time series and associated errors fig 6 were quantified by removing the contributions of surface water storage sws and soil moisture storage sms from the tws time series according to the following equations 1 gws t w s s m s s w s 2 œÉ gws œÉ tws 2 œÉ sms 2 œÉ sws 2 where œÉ tws œÉ gws œÉ sms and œÉ sws represent errors in tws gws sms and sws respectively breakpoint detection algorithms were used to detect breakpoints in gws time series after we removed the annual cycle fig 7 gldas is a nasa developed land surface modeling system that simulates land surface states e g soil moisture snow surface temperature and fluxes e g evapotranspiration ground heat flux using both ground and satellite based observations rodell et al 2004 our previous study over africa ahmed et al 2016 has shown that gldas provides more reasonable estimates of sms in arid environments compared to other land surface models sms data were extracted as average of soil moisture estimates from four versions of the gldas model vic clm noah and mosaic rodell et al 2004 the average was used to minimize differences in trends and seasonal amplitudes between simulated and measured sms ahmed et al 2016 kato et al 2007 scanlon et al 2019 2018 the monthly standard deviations of the four versions were used to quantify monthly sms errors e g ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the standard deviation estimate was reported to be larger than the difference between any one model or the average of several models and observed sms kato et al 2007 voss et al 2013 sms time series over each of the examined aquifer systems are shown in fig s1 sws data were extracted for lake nasser and the tushka lakes within the nse fig 1 lake nasser levels were generated from the hydroweb database cr√©taux et al 2011 temporal variations in the tushka lakes volume and areas were extracted from chipman 2019 sws monthly errors were calculated using the same approach described in ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the time series of lake nasser and the tushka lakes are shown in fig s2 we used rainfall data extracted from the gpcp to explore the control of rainfall variability on tws and gws spatiotemporal variabilities within the investigated aquifer systems gpcp derived rainfall estimates were calculated by combining satellite and ground based measurements adler et al 2018 gpcp are provided on a monthly basis from 1979 through 2020 at a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 and a spatial coverage of 88 75 n to 88 75 s average annual rainfall aar and long term 1979 2019 mean annual rainfall ltmar were calculated over the investigated aquifer systems 4 results and discussion fig 2 illustrates the spatial variations in tws trends during the period from april 2002 to september 2019 over nsas and nwsas and the surrounding areas these trends were generated from three sh csr fig 2a jpl fig 2b gfz fig 2c and two mascon csrm fig 2d jplm fig 2e tws solutions the average of the tws trend estimates is shown in fig 2f cold colors in fig 2 indicate that tws is decreasing over time e g depletion negative trends whereas warm colors indicate that tws is increasing over time e g wetting positive trends examination of fig 2 reveals that tws wetting trends are concentrated only over southern portions of the nsas specifically the southern portions of the nsl and the nss severe tws depletion trends are concentrated over the northern portions of the nwsas and the central parts of the nse fig 2 to compare tws trends generated from different grace and grace fo solutions four statistical measures were used minimum maximum average and standard deviation these statistical measures are shown in the lower left corner of each panel in fig 2 they were calculated for the entire tws trend images shown in fig 2 note that these images extend slightly beyond the boundaries of the nsas and the nwsas inspection of these statistical measures indicates that there is an overall agreement between tws trend estimates generated from different grace and grace fo derived tws solutions for example average tws trend rates of 1 64 1 59 1 92 1 46 and 1 19 mm yr are estimated from the csr jpl gfz csrm and jplm solutions respectively the standard deviations in tws trends are estimated to be 2 24 2 22 2 23 2 64 and 3 28 mm yr respectively the higher standard deviation in the jplm solution might be attributable to the mascon basis functions used to extract these solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 similarly the minimum maximum tws trends extracted from csr jpl gfz csrm and jplm are estimated to be 7 43 2 95 7 54 2 95 7 98 2 38 8 31 8 28 and 9 17 mm yr 6 00 mm yr respectively the higher range of tws trends of csrm and jplm may be attributable to a better reduction of leakage errors and improved signal localization in case of mascons solutions compared to the sh solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 rodell et al 2018 fig 3 shows temporal variability in tws averaged over the nwsas fig 3a nsas fig 3b nsl fig 3c nss fig 3d and nse fig 3e from different tws solutions fig 3 indicates that there is good agreement among all the tws estimates extracted from different grace and grace fo data in phases trends and amplitudes over each of the investigated aquifer systems over the investigated aquifer systems figs 4 and 6 show tws time series averaged from five different grace and grace fo solutions and gws time series generated from eqs 1 and 2 and associated uncertainty bounds respectively breakpoint trend analyses for the tws and gws time series are shown in figs 5 and 7 respectively in the next few sections we show the magnitude and drivers of tws and gws spatiotemporal variabilities over the investigated aquifer systems these estimates are then used to suggest optimal management practices that could be adapted to sustainably utilize fossil groundwater resources in the investigated aquifer systems table 2 4 1 northwestern saharan aquifer system nwsas figs 4a and 5a indicate that the nwsas experienced tws depletion 3 54 0 12 mm yr 3 70 0 12 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period april 2002 september 2019 breakpoint trend analysis shows variable tws trends over three periods april 2002 january 2006 february 2006 october 2008 and november 2008 september 2019 the nwsas experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 55 tws wetting trend of 0 60 0 90 mm yr 0 62 0 94 km3 yr between april 2002 and january 2006 a severe tws depletion 10 05 1 21 mm yr 10 52 1 26 km3 yr between february 2006 and october 2008 and a moderate tws depletion rate 4 99 0 18 mm yr 5 22 0 18 km3 yr between november 2008 and september 2019 figs 6a and 7a show temporal variabilities in gws over the nwsas during the entire investigated period april 2002 september2019 the nwsas experienced a gws depletion trend 3 03 0 10 mm yr 3 17 0 10 km3 yr the observed gws depletion trend was weak 0 31 0 57 mm yr 0 32 0 59 km3 yr and nonsignificant p value 0 61 during the first 5 years april 2002 june 2007 and relatively strong 3 32 0 15 mm yr 3 47 0 15 km3 yr during the remaining 12 years july 2007 september 2019 it is difficult to explain the tws and gws spatiotemporal variabilities over nwsas based on variations in rainfall rates since no significant decline in rainfall was observed over the nwsas the aar was reported to be 85 98 and 85 mm during 2002 2006 2006 2008 and 2008 2019 respectively representing 100 115 and 100 of the ltmar 85 mm temporal variations in tws and gws trends over the nwsas can be attributed to the observed rise in groundwater extraction activities the groundwater withdrawal in the nwsas increased from 0 60 km3 yr in 1970 to 2 50 km3 yr in 2000 and 2 85 km3 yr in 2013 gon√ßalv√®s et al 2013 the minute difference between grace derived gws depletion 3 03 0 10 mm yr 3 17 0 10 km3 yr and reported groundwater extraction rates may be related to natural discharge rates 0 45 0 15 mm yr 0 47 0 15 km3 yr gon√ßalv√®s et al 2013 that tws and gws data take into account in addition the average depth to water table in the northern parts of the nwsas was constant at 22 5 m during 2002 2005 a 5 m decline in water table depth was observed during 2006 2015 carvalho resende et al 2019 massuel and riaux 2017 this observation is consistent with the observed severe tws decline in the northern parts of the nwsas fig 2 examination of spatiotemporal variabilities in gws indicates that the nwsas is not being sustainably managed and is becoming depleted in other words the average annual recharge rates are less than current groundwater extraction rates sustainable groundwater utilization could be accomplished if the average annual groundwater withdrawal from the nwsas is reduced by 2 70 km3 table 2 we calculated this number by subtracting the grace derived gws depletion rate from the reported natural discharge rates 4 2 nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas the nsas experienced a weak tws depletion of 0 89 0 11 mm yr 1 87 0 21 km3 yr during the investigated period figs 4b and 5b however during the first four years april 2002 october2006 and the following seven years november 2006 december 2013 of the investigation the nsas experienced moderate tws depletion 2 59 0 71 mm yr 5 16 1 41 km3 yr 3 29 0 29 mm yr 6 55

years april 2002 august 2007 this was followed by a moderate gws increasing trend 3 41 0 48 mm yr 6 79 0 95 km3 yr during the next five years september 2007 july 2012 and nonsignificant p value 0 97

trends can be attributed to combined natural e g rainfall variability and anthropogenic variabilities e g groundwater extraction below we explain magnitudes and factors that control the variability of the tws and gws over each individual nsas sub basin however because gws trends are not negative the entire nsas could be used sustainably at the current rate of groundwater extraction table 2 4 3 kufra sub basin nsl the nsl experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 15 tws depletion trend 0 17 0 11 mm yr 0 15 0 09 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period figs 4c and 5c the observed rates of tws vary over time during the first three years april 2002 january 2005 the nsl experienced a severe tws depletion 6 53 1 32 mm yr 5 79 1 16 km3 yr during the following three years february 2005 august 2008 the nsl experienced a nonsignificant p value 0 27 tws wetting trend 0 90 0 76 mm yr 0 79 0 67 km3 yr followed by a weak tws wetting trend 1 18 0 18 mm yr 1 05 0 15 km3 yr during the remaining 11 years of the investigation september 2008 september 2019 examination of figs 6c and 7c indicates that the nsl witnessed a nonsignificant p value 0 02 gws increasing trend 0 26 0 10 mm yr

0 47 mm yr 1 10 0 41 km3 yr during the remaining five years january 2014 september 2019 of the investigation fig 7c temporal variabilities in tws and gws trends over the nsl can be attributed to both

rainfall rates aar 90 mm anthropogenic variabilities e g groundwater extraction on the other hand are believed to control the tws and gws rates in the northern portions of the nsl e g in libya where the annual rainfall rates are lower aar 5 mm and groundwater extraction rates are higher the observed decline in both tws and gws during 2002 2006 can be attributed partially to a decline in rainfall rates aar 33 mm 76 of the ltmar 44 mm during that period the tws increase during 2005 2008 and 2008 2019 can be attributed to rainfall increase we estimate that the aar rates over the nsl were 46 and 49 mm during 2005 2008 and 2008 2019 respectively these rates represent 104 and 111 of the ltmar respectively declines in gws trends during 2002 2006 and 2006 2013 can be partially attributed to excessive groundwater extraction hamad and ahweej 2020 reported a significant groundwater drawdown average 5 54 m minimum 0 32 m maximum 15 2 m between 2005 and 2015 in 26 wells located in the southeastern parts of libya northern parts of the nsl groundwater extraction rates increased from 0 857 km3 in 1998 to 1 90 0 19 km3 in 2015 mohamed 2019 in the northern parts of the nsl generally at the current levels of extraction the nsl could be used in a sustainable manner since the current gws overall trend 0 23 0 08 km3 yr is greater than zero table 2 4 4 northern sudan sub basin nss the nss experienced a weak wetting tws trend 0 95 0 12 mm yr 0 42 0 05 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period figs 4d and 5d the magnitude of the observed tws wetting trends varies over time a

eight years june 2011 september 2019 of the investigation in addition the nss experienced an increasing gws trend of 1 42 0 12 mm yr 0 63 0 05 km3 yr during the investigated period fig 6d and 7d this increasing gws trend was weak 1 72 0 14 mm yr 0 76 0 06 km3 yr during the first 13 years april 2002 september 2015 and strong 5 33 1 26 mm yr 2 36 0 55 km3 yr during the remaining four years october 2015 september 2019 of the investigation fig 7d tws and gws variabilities over the nss can be attributed to rainfall variability we estimated that the aar rates over the nss were 107 107 133 and 155 mm during 2002 2011 2002 2015 2011 2019 and 2015 2019 respectively these rates represent 100 100 122 and 143 of the ltmar 107 mm respectively because the overall trend in gws over the nsl is positive the nsl could be used in a sustainable manner at the current utilization rate table 2 4 5 dakhla sub basin nse the nse experienced a moderate tws depletion trend 3 46 0 13 mm yr 2 28 0 08 km3 yr throughout the entire investigated period figs 4e and 5e the tws depletion rate over the nse exhibits temporal variability during the first four years april 2002 october 2006 and the following seven

27 0 10 mm yr 1 50 0 06 km3 yr declining gws trends derived from this study during entire investigated period april 2002 september2019 contradict the trends reported by ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 and abdelmohsen et al 2019 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 showed that the groundwater resources of the nse locally respond to changes in lake nasser levels as well as changes in rainfall rates over the recharge domains an average annual groundwater recharge rate of 1 66 km3 was reported during the 2002 2006 and 2008 2016 wet periods under excessive precipitation 146 of ltmar over the nubian recharge domains and or under a significant rise 1 10 m in lake nasser levels using isotopic and static gravity measurements abdelmohsen et al 2019 showed that the nse recharge from the recharge domains and from lake nasser during 2013 2016 occurred along networks of densely fractured and karstified bedrocks that provide preferential pathways for groundwater flow differences between this study and previous studies could be attributed to longer and enhanced tws sms and sws time series as well as innovative data processing and integration techniques used in this study specifically 1 previous studies used one abdelmohsen et al 2019 or three ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 release 5 grace solutions whereas this study used five release 6 grace solutions 3 sh and 2 mascon solutions table 1 2 this study broaden the investigated period by three years and included grace fo solutions current study april 2002 to september 2019 previous studies april 2002 to june 2016 3 missing months in tws time series were filled in by linear interpolation in previous studies whereas no data were assigned to missing months in this study 3 automatic breakpoint detection algorithms were used in this study previous studies manually divided tws and gws time series into different segments 4 this study used enhanced sws data extracted by multisensor e g visible thermal and radar remote sensing datasets e g tushka lakes and 5 previous studies e g abdelmohsen et al 2019 reported only spatiotemporal variability in tws whereas this study used enhanced sms e g outputs of four versions of gldas and sws to report spatiotemporal variability in gws the temporal variations in the tws trends over the nse cannot be explained by variations in rainfall rates since the aar rates are very small we estimated that they were 7 11 and 12 mm during 2002 2006 2006 2013 and 2013 2019 respectively over the nse both the tws and the gws are controlled by groundwater extraction groundwater withdrawal increased from 0 47 km3 yr in 1979 to 1 1 km3 yr in 2003 and 2 20 km3 yr in 2009 e g ahmed et al 2014 ebraheem et al 2003 sustainable groundwater utilization could be achieved if the average annual groundwater withdrawal rate over the nse is reduced by 1 50 km3 table 2 we expect these groundwater extraction rates from the nse to increase in the future because egypt is currently seeking additional water resources to support an ambitious desert farming project that would reclaim 1 5 106 acres ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 in addition there is political tension between egypt and ethiopia regarding the nile river water ethiopia recently began construction of the renaissance dam which will decrease egypt s surface water allocation from the blue nile water 85 of egypt s allocation for several years ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 construction of the renaissance dam will reduce egypt s annual allocation 55 km3 by at least 27 and will cause the loss of more than 27 of the agricultural land in egypt ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 sultan et al 2014 this could translate into a significant loss of economic activity in egypt as well as putting significant pressure on the available groundwater resources 5 summary and conclusions achieving sustainable use of groundwater resources in northern africa is challenging because majority of northern africa s aquifer systems cross country borders rainfall rates and associated recharge rates are predicted to decrease and the population and associated degradation of groundwater resources in the region are predicted to increase in situ observations in this region are very limited in both availability and quality maintaining field networks that cover all of northern africa would be prohibitively economically expensive and labor intensive fortunately tws data derived from the grace and grace fo missions provide an economical and effective way to monitor northern africa s groundwater resources and develop sustainable management scenarios for the region we integrated 17 years april 2002 september 2019 of tws data with soil moisture products derived from land surface models as well as rainfall and altimetry data to develop sustainable management scenarios for groundwater resources in northern africa s largest aquifer systems the nsas in egypt libya chad and sudan and the nwsas in algeria libya and tunisia we investigated the sustainability of the nwsas and the nsas as a whole as well as each of the individual sub basin within the nsas our results indicate that the entire nwsas is currently being depleted and that sustainable groundwater utilization could be accomplished if the average groundwater withdrawal is reduced by 2 70 km3 yr the nsas in egypt e g the dakhla sub basin is also experiencing groundwater depletion in this case sustainable groundwater utilization could be achieved if the average withdrawal rate is reduced by 1 50 km3 yr depletion in both the nwsas and the dakhla sub basin is related to excessive groundwater extraction from these systems in contrast the entire nsas the kufra sub basin in libya northeastern chad and northwestern sudan and the northern sudan sub basin in northern sudan are healthy and could be used sustainably at the current rate of groundwater extraction our findings signal an urgent need for integrated responses to overcome the current groundwater depletion and develop sustainable utilization plans for groundwater resources in the nwsas and the nsas in egypt management practices that could help minimize groundwater depletion in this area include but are not limited to reducing irrigated areas and wells drilling replacing conventional crops with drought tolerant crops adopting groundwater allocation for each acre of farmland replacing conventional flood and pivot irrigation with drip irrigation systems implementing modern irrigation technology e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration sensors to minimize irrigated runoff conserve water and nutrient resources and reduce pumping and associated energy and costs minimizing water loss from surface reservoirs e g lake nasser in egypt to direct evaporation by deepening reservoirs covering surface water with shade balls and constructing barriers to reduce wind speed adopting a combined surface water and groundwater management plan by channeling the excess water from surface water bodies to regions that have aquifer outcrops in order to recharge the underlying aquifer systems and enhancing local people s awareness of both sustainable groundwater development and local practices that degrade the quality of available groundwater resources results of this study confirm the unique capabilities of grace and grace fo derived tws data for monitoring the health of northern africa s aquifer systems and their potential for developing near real time monitoring systems for globally distributed aquifer systems however it is worth mentioning that we only examined 17 years including missing months of tws data in this study the acquisition of additional grace fo and grace ii data will enhance our understanding of sustainability within different hydrogeologic systems this study also promises to improve our understanding of northern africa s aquifer dynamics and sustainability and it promotes expanded and improved use of grace and grace fo products by the scientific community end users and decision

5264,groundwater gw resources provide a large share of the world s water demand for various sections such as agriculture industry and drinking water particularly in the arid and semi arid regions with surface water scarcity and high evaporation gw is a valuable commodity yet gw data are often incomplete or nonexistent therefore it is a challenge to achieve a gw potential assessment in this study we developed methods to produce reliable gw potential maps gwpm with only digital elevation model dem derived data as inputs to achieve this objective a case study area in iran was selected and 13 factors were extracted from the dem a spring location dataset was obtained from the water sector organizations and along with the non spring locations fed into machine learning algorithms for training and validation for delineating reliable gw potential algorithms including random forest rf and its developed version parallel rf prf as well as extreme gradient boosting xgb with different boosters were used the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve indicated that the prf and xgb with linear booster give similar high accuracy about 86 for gwpm the most important factors for accurate gwpm in the modeling procedure were convergence topographic wetness index river density and altitude overall we conclude that high accuracy gwpms can be produced with only dem derived factors with acceptable accuracy the developed methodology can be employed to produce initial information for gw exploitation in areas facing a lack of data keywords groundwater potential data scarcity parallel random forest extreme gradient boosting gis 1 introduction groundwater gw provides a large portion of the water requirements for different sectors hashemi et al 2013 in particular gw reserves are a major source for supplying water needs in iran razandi et al 2015 hashemi et al 2015 gw is cheap to exploit and less vulnerable to different kinds of pollution when compared to surface water however over exploitation of gw has caused severe water table declines across the world leading to land subsidence and gw quality deterioration gw potential is complex and depends on many factors cheremisinoff 1998 hence without comprehensive conceptualization and analysis it is difficult to formulate an appropriate plan for sustainable gw management gw potential mapping is an efficient technique for identifying the state of gw resources and quantitative potential in the last decade many scholars have implemented diverse algorithms to analyze and model gw potential e g golkarian et al 2018 these include statistical machine learning ml and combinations of these two approaches the most frequently employed statistical methods in this field are frequency ratio razandi et al 2015 mousavi et al 2017 and weights of evidence pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 which have generated high quality maps the most widespread ml algorithms that have been implemented in gw investigations include boosted regression trees support vector machines random forest rf c5 0 and artificial neural networks rahmati et al 2016 naghibi et al 2016 lee et al 2018 golkarian et al 2018 sameen et al 2019 kim et al 2019 a study by naghibi and moradi dashtpagerdi 2016 implemented linear and quadratic discriminant analysis algorithms k nearest neighbors and multivariate adaptive regression splines to assess gw potential and the results were reported as satisfactory in another study rahmati and melesse 2016 used evidential belief function to assess gw potential and considered nitrate concentration to validate and finalize the best locations for gw exploitation naghibi et al 2017a presented a new hybrid model which combines the outputs of four ml algorithms by frequency ratio and reported that the novel ensemble algorithm enhanced the total accuracy by 1 3 area under curve auc compared to the second best single algorithm naghibi et al 2017b executed a genetic algorithm to define the parameters of the rf algorithm in mapping gw potential they indicated that the new method for tuning the rf algorithm led to highly accurate outputs and was more reliable than previously used optimization methods such as trial and error chen et al 2019 applied the genetic algorithm to optimize some previously applied algorithms in gw potential such as rf na√Øve bayes and support vector machines the models predicted gw potential with significantly higher performance when they were optimized by the genetic algorithm arabameri et al 2019 assessed the efficiency of the rf weights of evidence logistic regression and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis in generating a gw potential map gwpm regarding well data they stated that logistic regression yielded the best accuracy in another study pham et al 2019 assessed the robustness of three ensemble algorithms constructed by rotation forest decision stump multi boost and bagging in mapping gw potential and found the first algorithm to be the best previous researches have mainly focused on using different spring driving factors sdfs such as land use lithology fault related characteristics soil normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and digital elevation model dem derived properties in modeling gw potential ozdemir 2011a b zabihi et al 2016 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 naghibi et al 2017a b golkarian et al 2018 kordestani et al 2019 rahmati et al 2018a chen et al 2019 however obtaining high quality data on land use lithology soil and fault related information in data poor regions can be problematic another critique of previous studies is that they have only concentrated on improving algorithms without examining the input sdfs furthermore for larger country or continental scale modeling it is more feasible to work mainly with dem derived sdfs and the production of more generalized gwpm outputs hence the aforementioned methods may not be applicable in some regions due to the lack of sufficient input data based on the above this study focuses on the output quality when using only dem derived sdfs thus the study attempts to fill this gap by introducing a new methodology to generate low time cost but accurate gwpms we selected only dem derived factors that are commonly available for this purpose two new algorithms parallel random forest prf and extreme gradient boosting xgb were employed the prf and xgb algorithms were both developed to eliminate or alleviate overfitting in their previous versions such as when using rf and gradient boosting respectively chen et al 2017a fan et al 2018 for previous use of xgb we refer to climent et al 2018 and carmona et al 2019 who investigated the us banking system and bank distress in the european banking system prf has worked satisfactorily with big data and its output has proven to be more reliable than the rf in terms of accuracy chen et al 2017a in summary the core novelties of this study are i mapping gw potential by using only dem derived sdfs ii applying two state of the art algorithms prf and xgb with three boosters and comparing them with the benchmark algorithm rf iii prioritizing the sdfs in gw potential assessment and iv using new sdfs such as vertical distance to channel and convergence 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area gw potential mapping approach and the spring dataset the borujerd region is located between 33 35 and 34 07 latitude and from 48 27 to 49 05 longitude in the lorestan province iran having an area of 1676 km2 fig 1 a the chief land use patterns in the borujerd region are in order agriculture forest orchard rangeland and residential areas from a climate perspective borujerd region receives an average rainfall of 770 mm per year lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 which is about three times greater than in general for the entire country about 240 mm year gw potential can be explained as a spatial prediction method to evaluate the extraction potential of gw resources on the basis of indirect indicators d√≠az alcaide and mart√≠nez santos 2019 these indicators comprise spring well and qanat data for studies in iran however spring and well data are used for a wider range of studies for different purposes under diverse hydrogeological circumstances based on this we decided to use spring data as a gw indicator as it is readily available in many countries thus the output would be highly generalizable and ultimately the indicator allows us to work on larger spatial scales in the borujerd region 944 springs have been detected through field surveys by thelorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 the average ph of the springs is about 8 04 in addition the mean electrical conductivity of the spring water is about 364 3 ¬µmhos cm lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 the discharge varies significantly from one spring to another and the average discharge of all springs has been estimated at about 2 4 l s lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 the observed maximum discharge of the studied springs is about 300 l s lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 it is noted that in the classification issues like our study both presence and absence datapoints are indispensable and in this case are spring and non spring locations respectively with this in mind 944 non springs datapoints i e absence data were generated through a random algorithm along with observed 944 spring datapoints in borujerd region fig 1b the training set used 70 of all spring and 70 of all non spring datapoints this left 30 of spring and non spring datapoints to the validation sets in relation to geology a significant portion of the borujerd region comprises low level piedmont fan and early paleocene granite to diorite intrusive rocks geology survey of iran gsi 1997 fig 1c table 1 there exist a number of other lithological features as illustrated in table 1 it should be noted that using only dem derived driving factors is recommended when topography is the major controlling element of gw potential martinez santos and renard 2019 and it might not lead to acceptable outputs at aquifer scale where gw potential is driven by hydro geological variables in other words this methodology is not suitable for determining gw potential using well indicator for plain areas to investigate this issue a landform map of the study region was prepared using satellite images and then the distribution of the springs in each landform was determined the landform map is presented in fig 1d most of the area are covered by mountains valleys and alluvial fans and only 22 4 are covered by plain landform further only 3 6 of the springs are situated at plain landform this shows that gw condition is mainly controlled by topographical factors in this area 2 2 methods a flowchart of the implemented methodology comprising data provision the modeling scheme and the validation phase is schematized in fig 2 as reflected above a dataset of springs comprising location discharge ph and electrical conductivity was obtained from the lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 later 13 sdfs were derived from the dem of the borujerd region in western iran in the subsequent stage prf rf as well as xgb algorithms with three boosters were applied with the intention to compute the gwpms the output of the algorithms was transformed into gwpms and compared to a validation dataset for accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and receiver operating characteristics roc curve finally suitable locations with greater gw potential were proposed for gw exploitation 2 3 gw spring driving factors this study used the 30 30 m dem product advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster called global dem gdem as an input to create different dem based sdfs we chose this product as it is broadly available and simple to obtain and thus can be used to produce a generalizable and large scale framework for gw studies subsequently 13 sdfs were extracted from the gdem gw potential is impacted by slope aspect since each aspect receives a particular sunshine duration that specifies the rate of snowmelt in the northern hemisphere north aspects have a lower sunshine duration which means the snow melts over a prolonged time period dehnavi et al 2015 leading to an increase of infiltration time zapata rios et al 2016 investigated the impact of different slope aspects on water and vegetation features in a northern hemisphere watershed and demonstrated that eastern aspects receive prolonged solar radiation leading to higher biomass production vegetation cover and subsequently better soil condition for infiltration looking at the referred impact of the slope aspect on infiltration rate in either direct or indirect ways and the existing complexities this factor can be viewed as a highly probable sdf for gw potential mapping accordingly the slope aspect was created and categorized into nine classes as shown in fig 3 a slope degree has a direct influence on runoff erosion and the transport of sediments zaidi et al 2015 pakparvar et al 2018 for mild slopes less runoff is generated implying that a greater portion of the precipitation is infiltrated or evaporated further a direct relationship exists between slope degree and flow velocity while there is an inverse relationship between slope and infiltration rate the slope degree of the borujerd region was generated using gdem varying from 0 to 69 fig 3b altitude is a frequently employed sdf in previous investigations within this field e g mousavi et al 2017 altitude has an indirect influence on gw potential since generally a greater altitude generates higher slope degrees leading to lower infiltration rates rahmati et al 2018b drainage system development is also significantly related to altitude this sdf was created by implementing gdem and employed in the current research the altitude of borujerd region has a range between 1458 and 3637 m above mean sea level fig 3c convergence index relates to the concavity or convexity of the ground at a smaller scale k√∂the et al 1996 a negative convergence refers to concavities e g valleys whereas positive values reflect convex features e g ridges conoscenti et al 2015 this sdf was calculated by the system for automated geoscientific analyses saga conrad et al 2015 the minimum maximum and mean values of convergence were 99 23 99 61 and 0 0005 respectively fig 3d plan curvature reveals curvature along the opposite direction of the highest slope degree ayalew et al 2004 plan curvature is an indicator of the divergence and convergence of basins on the contrary profile curvature reflects a vertical plane parallel to the slope direction that impacts acceleration of the flow hence resulting in an impact erosion process kannan et al 2013 chen et al 2017b these sdfs impact slope stability by affecting the concentration and dispersion of the surface and subsurface flow further impacting both erosion and flow velocity and consequently infiltration rate either directly or indirectly the maps of these two sdfs are demonstrated in fig 3e f the relative slope position rsp demonstrates the slope position of each point and its relative position among valleys and ridges and could impact infiltration and flow in a given area rsp was calculated by the gdem of the borujerd region by the saga software conrad et al 2015 the rsp map ranges between 0 and 1 with a mean value of 0 26 for the borujerd region fig 3g another factor is vertical distance to channel which was calculated by the saga conrad et al 2015 this sdf influences soil moisture greater distances usually mean a lower amount of moisture thus it is beneficial for determining gw potential in a given territory the vertical distance to the channel was obtained by the interpolation of the channel network and elevation layer of the borujerd region fig 3h slope length ls has a direct impact on water accumulation at the downslope a longer ls leads to higher flow velocity and consequently greater erosion rate pourghasemi et al 2013 erosion deteriorates the topsoil and vegetation cover enhances flow velocity and consequently reduces infiltration rate hence extensively eroded slopes have lower infiltration capacity decreasing gw availability ls is computed by the following equation developed by moore and burch 1986 fig 3i 1 ls a 22 13 0 6 sin Œ≤ 0 0896 1 3 where a is the flow accumulative area which flows to a certain pixel and Œ≤ is the slope of the pixel the ls factor varied from 0 to 71 58 m with a mean of 3 34 m the topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi impact soil moisture gw flow and stability of the slope lee et al 2012 thus they are substantial contributors to the spatial variation of soil moisture and eventually affect gw potential moore et al 1991 spi is a measure of erosion strength by flowing water regmi et al 2014 twi is a prominent factor to determine wetness features preferably at a greater spatial resolution i e 10 30 m grabs et al 2009 twi is correlated with other hydrological variables and in particular with runoff and infiltration rates radu≈Ça et al 2018 twi points to the likelihood of runoff flowing to a certain pixel on the ground a larger twi reflects a greater amount of water flowing to a certain point and vice versa beven and kirkby 1979 the spi and twi can be calculated as moore et al 1991 fig 3j k 2 twi ln a tan Œ≤ 3 spi a tan Œ≤ rivers are the core natural recharge sources of gw xi et al 2010 in arid and semiarid parts of the world aquifers close to high discharge rivers benefit from a high recharge rate whereas aquifers further from such rivers depend more on other gw recharge sources such as precipitation snowmelt fault and subsurface flow apart from this greater drainage density generally occurs on highlands with steep slopes and subsequently lower infiltration rates the impact of the rivers on infiltration natural recharge and gw potential can be scrutinized from diverse viewpoints concerning this the drainage system was extracted from the gdem of borujerd region and employed to create distance from river and river density layers using euclidean distance and line density equations respectively a maximum distance of 6590 m from a river was observed with an average distance of 859 m fig 3l the river density layer of the borujerd region varied between 0 and 15 14 km km2 fig 3m 2 4 machine learning algorithms 2 4 1 gwpm production by random forest rf and parallel random forest prf algorithms rf is admired for its broadly successful implementation in diverse subjects particularly in spatial modeling the core elements of rf are decision trees dts that produce an estimate of classes rf takes apart the training into several smaller sets through bootstrap sampling and then builds a dt for each set golkarian et al 2018 for estimating an unused instance the ultimate decision is acquired through voting of a vast number of dts to optimize the rf algorithm the user has to select the best set of parameters for number of trees number of variables at each node mtry and node size to reach the best estimates we used a 10 fold cross validation it is noteworthy we conducted the training phase based on a grid search including number of trees between 100 and 1000 with 100 intervals mtry values between 2 and 5 and node sizes between 2 and 7 prf is an advanced version of rf in which the effectiveness of the primary algorithm has been improved to cope with larger data sets chen et al 2017a each dt of the prf is set up irrespective of other dts and each sub node of a dt is segregated individually chen et al 2017a the architecture of the prf and dt algorithms make the computing tasks parallel overfitting is a repeatedly reported problem for rf dwindling its accuracy when applied to complex areas the prf sorts out this challenge by employing a gain ratio with the intention to make a decision with respect to the features resulting in the greatest participation in the modeling process chen et al 2017a in prf the simulation is fixed at 500 trees by default and only mtry is optimized mean decrease in gini impurity denotes allocated error for the case where a factor is eliminated from the algorithm this parameter includes the mean of the variation in impurity observed throughout the entire node system in other words this parameter computes the role of each factor in dividing spring and non spring classes and is seen as an importance metric cassidy and deviney 2015 the selected values of the mtry range from 1 to 10 the training phase is done based on 10 fold cross validation 2 4 2 gpm production by extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithm with three different boosters xgb was introduced to the literature by chen and guestrin 2016 and is now a known ml algorithm in view of its superior efficacy when compared to other algorithms bandara et al 2020 xgb employs a gradient boosting structure with the advantage of parallel tree boosting it implements a more regularized algorithm than gradient boosting to tackle overfitting leading to greater performance bandara et al 2020 xgb makes use of a boosting method to combine a huge number of weak learners to predict the output linard et al 2013 apart from that xgb uses parallel processes that reduce the total calculation time fan et al 2018 xgb is superior when missing values are included in the data sets here we employed three boosters to optimize the xgb algorithm linear tree and dropouts meet multiple additive regression trees dart based on artificial neural networks the linear booster is useful for cases where the relationships follow linear behavior while tree and dart boosters are more suitable for more complex non linear patterns to apply xgb with its boosters the caret package was used benefitting from a 10 fold cross validation the parameters of xgb that require calibration by each booster are listed in table 2 2 5 validation of the models validation is renowned as a prime phase in spatial analysis without which the outcomes cannot be affirmed chang jo and fabbri 2003 this work implemented a roc curve accuracy kappa specificity sensitivity proportion correctly classified f score and matthews correlation coefficient to authenticate the gwpms by the used algorithms chen et al 2017b c to achieve this a validation dataset which was not considered in the training phase was employed the roc plot exhibits false and true positive rates on the x and y axis respectively hong et al 2016 the area under roc curve auc varies between 0 and 1 a greater value points to a higher performance of the algorithm in the gw potential modeling whereas a smaller value is a sign of weaker efficacy hong et al 2017 accuracy index depicts the ratio of correctly classified springs and non springs to all cases sensitivity also recognized as recall denotes the ratio of correctly classified springs to the sum of correctly classified springs and incorrectly classified non springs it denotes the proportion of springs that are correctly determined on the other hand specificity refers to proportion of non springs that are correctly categorized proportion correctly classified reveals the total accuracy neglecting the nature of error matthews correlation coefficient is like a balanced index that is suitable for cases where binary categories own dissimilar members it ranges between 1 and 1 where 1 implies perfect prediction f score is the harmonic

the greatest accuracy was achieved with 200 trees mtry of 2 and a node size of 7 at the training stage the confusion matrix was calculated for the training set and based on the findings the rf predicted 517 out of 662 non spring locations as well as 508 out of 662 spring locations correctly which leads to class errors of 0 219 and 0 232 for prediction of non spring and spring locations respectively the only parameter in the prf that was calibrated was mtry and a value of 2 was selected for this parameter with accuracy and kappa indices of 0 779 and 0 558 respectively fig 4 fig 4 illustrates that when the number of randomly selected variables goes up from 1 to 2 accuracy rises whereas more than 2 factors cause a reduction in performance it is noted that the number of trees was fixed at 500 for the prf calibration based on the default of the algorithm the confusion matrix for the prf indicates the correct prediction of the locations of 516 non springs and 521 springs out of 662 resulting in a class error of 0 220 and 0 212 for non spring and spring locations respectively 3 2 gwpms produced by xgb using different boosters the xgb algorithm was calibrated with three boosters through xgboost and caret packages in r software the linear booster resulted in an eta of 0 3 nrounds of 150 lambda of 0 0001 and alpha of 0 0001 fig 5 xgb was calibrated by the dart booster with the final parameters of gamma of 0 minimum child weight of 1 nrounds of 0 6 rate drop of 0 01 and skip drop of 0 05 in addition xgb was calibrated using tree booster resulting in a gamma of 1 nrounds of 0 colsample bytree of 0 8 minimum child weight of 1 and subsample of 1 it is important to mention that all the boosters were applied through ten fold cross validation 3 3 gwpms produced by the prf and xgb linear algorithms fig 6 a and b show the classified gwpms produced by the prf and xgb linear respectively further table 3 refers to the probability range and area percentage of every gwpm for the mentioned algorithms based on table 3 low moderate high and very high potential classes obtained by the xgb linear algorithm occupy 63 0 13 6 10 0 and 13 4 of the borujerd region respectively on the other hand low moderate high and very high gw potential classes produced by the prf occupy 33 6 31 1 22 5 and 12 8 of the borujerd region respectively the major distinction between the gwpms produced by the prf and xgb linear algorithms is the area assigned to the low class with the xgb linear considering a larger portion of the area as low gw potential as compared to the prf in the case of the very high gw potential category it was observed that both algorithms defined about 13 of the area for this class with a visual investigation of the gwpms it can be verified that the models are consistent in assigning areas as very high gw potential mainly those located in the vicinity of the main rivers as a supplementary phase we present a discrepancy map through a subtraction of the xgb and prf algorithms outputs i e probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 to provide an insight about the prediction differences between the two algorithms using the absolute values fig 6c shows the abs xgb prf map and fig 6d represents the classified discrepancy map we assumed the differences less than 0 3 is negligible and the higher values imply major differences according to the results xgb and prf predictions led to 80 similarity having an probability absolute differences 0 3 only a small portion 20 of the area depicted higher differences 0 3 between the two algorithms 3 4 evaluation of the algorithms the auc for the rf and prf as well as the auc for different boosters of the xgb are presented in fig 7 a and b evidently the prf auc 86 3 showed slightly better performance in comparison with the rf the xgb linear was more accurate auc 86 2 than the other boosters tables 4 and 5 demonstrate the success and predictive rates for the prf and xgb algorithms considering the training and validation data point sets respectively looking at the accuracy and kappa the prf showed slightly better performance than the xgb algorithm in the training stage table 3 similarly the prf yielded slightly higher accuracy and kappa compared to xgb for validation phase table 4 more detailed findings for the validation datapoint set demonstrated that the prf had greater specificity while the xgb linear had greater sensitivity table 4 this points to the fact that the prf is more robust when the algorithm deals with estimating non spring locations while the xgb is more robust when the algorithm deals with predicting spring locations f score and proportion correctly classified depicted superior performance of the prf whereas matthew correlation coefficient implied better outputs of the xgb linear all in all the prf and xgb linear algorithms were found to be considerably accurate in exploring gw potential 3 5 sensitivity analysis of spring driving factors by the prf fig 8 illustrates the importance of the sdfs fed into the prf based on the mean decrease in gini according to the figure the convergence factor had the highest impact on the algorithm accuracy followed by the twi river density altitude spi ls and slope degree it can be observed that vertical distance to channel and rsp were also relatively effective sdfs in gw potential in the study region 4 discussion the auc results implied the superiority of the prf relative to other algorithms followed by the xgb linear overall the findings of this research proved that the new methodology feeding dem derived sdfs into the suggested algorithms is useful in determining gw potential in data poor regions of the world investigation of the generated gwpms by the selected algorithms the prf and xgb linear indicated the similarity of both algorithms results in identifying the very high gw potential areas 13 with major consistency in location prediction although the prf and xgb linear are based on different methodologies and use different ml techniques in building the final algorithm their outcome was similar this reduces uncertainty leading to a more robust and trustable output according to our findings the gw managers in the borujerd region are advised to focus on the area adjacent to rivers in the eastern part of the basin for the expansion of gw exploitation and agricultural activities these areas showed higher gw potential as they are under greater natural recharge the results highlighted the major contributions of convergence twi river density altitude spi ls and slope degree to gw potential analysis convergence influences the flow speed on the slopes and subsequently impacts erosion and sedimentation which indirectly impacts the infiltration rate and gw potential twi is a hydrological sdf that refers to the probability of water accumulation at different parts of the basin and as a consequence impacts gw potential at the basin river density is another important sdf which refers to the level of development of the drainage network this factor influences the volume of water flowing through a specific area and indirectly impacts vegetation cover leading to a change in the infiltration rate and gw potential altitude was the fourth most important contributor in the modeling at higher altitudes the slope is steeper and flow velocity is greater and ultimately drainage density tends to be higher while at lower altitudes the situation is reversed regarding the great topographical variation in the borujerd region 1458 3620 m this sdf showed a high contribution to the gw potential in this work other important sdfs including spi ls and slope degree impact flow speed and infiltration rate and therefore are ranked as high contributors in this study rahmati et al 2016 showed the importance of the two categorical sdfs of land use and lithology in modeling gw potential in addition they claimed that twi was the least important sdf which is different from the results of this study mousavi et al 2017 stated that twi altitude distance from rivers river density distance from faults and fault density are the highest contributing sdfs a more recent paper by yousefi et al 2020 emphasized the importance of twi and altitude factors in groundwater potential mapping that is in line with output of our study although this study did not consider the two important sdfs related to the fault layer the algorithms produced high accuracy gwpms this fact shows that the important factor s replacement in gw modeling by simpler calculation process factors such as dem derived sdfs can still achieve high accuracy the prf as a developed version of the rf has several advantages such as its ability to confine outliers and work with a variety of scales for the input variables rahmati et al 2016 another benefit of the prf as a dt based algorithm is the ability to recognize nonlinear relationships among variables hansen et al 1996 golkarian et al 2018 it is noted that the rf algorithm as basis of the prf algorithm has proven to be a reliable technique for generating gwpms in other studies e g chen et al 2020 davoudi moghaddam et al 2020 moghaddam et al 2020 naghibi et al 2016 rahmati et al 2016 additionally the xgb indicated a high efficiency in analyzing gw potential in this study babajide mustapha and saeed 2016 investigated the performance of the xgb for bioactive molecule modeling and found it to be a robust ml algorithm they stated that the xgb dealt well with both homogenous and heterogeneous input data fan et al 2018 claimed that there were smaller fluctuations in xgb efficiency between diverse training and validation sets in comparison to the support vector machines that refer to its further superior ability to be generalized this feature goes back to the main objective of developing the xgb algorithm which is to tackle overfitting and lower uncertainty additionally based on timofeev and denisov 2020 xgb does not seek for data pre processing phases i e taking care of missing values and normalization which makes it faster and more straightforward the xgb features become important in the case of large scale modeling such as at the country or continental scales when the algorithm must be built on a huge amount of data and predict for a wide variety of areas with diverse hydrogeological climatic and topographical characteristics another benefit of the prf and xgb is that they are both based on parallel computations which enhances their calculation speed the stated advantages of the prf and xgb could be the reason for their higher performance in the borujerd region 5 conclusion this study aimed at introducing a new methodology for delineating gw potential using a small amount of input data the proposed framework implemented the prf and xgb with three different boosters and compared them with a benchmark algorithm rf the outcome showed that the prf and xgb with linear booster outperformed the rf and produced reliable gwpms the greater accuracy of the xgb might be caused by its ability to produce more general outputs and to tackle overfitting the prf and xgb linear predicted similar locations of very high gw potential this consistency of the gwpms proves that the methodology is reliable the main aim of this research was to use only dem derived factors to achieve accurate gwpms in the study area in the absence of other important sdfs the applicability of the new methodology was proved because of the high auc values of the algorithms the findings revealed that the convergence twi river density altitude spi and ls highly contribute to the success of the algorithms hence it can be concluded that in the absence of other important sdfs such as land use lithology soil and fault related sdfs the employed ml algorithms succeeded in extracting relationships among the dem derived factors and gw potential generally the proposed framework can be used for large scale gw potential mapping at the country and continent levels as we only need a limited number of data sets encompassing dem and spring locations it should be pointed out that the developed methodology is recommended for gw potential assessment through spring locations that are driven by topography this methodology can generate necessary information for water sector managers and gw professionals to implement proper water resources plans for future research scholars may focus on the spatial resolution of the dem and consider other dem derived factors in order to improve the methodology and hence the modeling results the new methodology can be of use especially in areas confronted by a lack of accurate and high resolution data including land use lithology soil hydrogeology and fault related factors like fault density and distance from faults credit authorship contribution statement seyed amir naghibi conceptualization methodology investigation software validation writing original draft writing review

5264,groundwater gw resources provide a large share of the world s water demand for various sections such as agriculture industry and drinking water particularly in the arid and semi arid regions with surface water scarcity and high evaporation gw is a valuable commodity yet gw data are often incomplete or nonexistent therefore it is a challenge to achieve a gw potential assessment in this study we developed methods to produce reliable gw potential maps gwpm with only digital elevation model dem derived data as inputs to achieve this objective a case study area in iran was selected and 13 factors were extracted from the dem a spring location dataset was obtained from the water sector organizations and along with the non spring locations fed into machine learning algorithms for training and validation for delineating reliable gw potential algorithms including random forest rf and its developed version parallel rf prf as well as extreme gradient boosting xgb with different boosters were used the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve indicated that the prf and xgb with linear booster give similar high accuracy about 86 for gwpm the most important factors for accurate gwpm in the modeling procedure were convergence topographic wetness index river density and altitude overall we conclude that high accuracy gwpms can be produced with only dem derived factors with acceptable accuracy the developed methodology can be employed to produce initial information for gw exploitation in areas facing a lack of data keywords groundwater potential data scarcity parallel random forest extreme gradient boosting gis 1 introduction groundwater gw provides a large portion of the water requirements for different sectors hashemi et al 2013 in particular gw reserves are a major source for supplying water needs in iran razandi et al 2015 hashemi et al 2015 gw is cheap to exploit and less vulnerable to different kinds of pollution when compared to surface water however over exploitation of gw has caused severe water table declines across the world leading to land subsidence and gw quality deterioration gw potential is complex and depends on many factors cheremisinoff 1998 hence without comprehensive conceptualization and analysis it is difficult to formulate an appropriate plan for sustainable gw management gw potential mapping is an efficient technique for identifying the state of gw resources and quantitative potential in the last decade many scholars have implemented diverse algorithms to analyze and model gw potential e g golkarian et al 2018 these include statistical machine learning ml and combinations of these two approaches the most frequently employed statistical methods in this field are frequency ratio razandi et al 2015 mousavi et al 2017 and weights of evidence pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 which have generated high quality maps the most widespread ml algorithms that have been implemented in gw investigations include boosted regression trees support vector machines random forest rf c5 0 and artificial neural networks rahmati et al 2016 naghibi et al 2016 lee et al 2018 golkarian et al 2018 sameen et al 2019 kim et al 2019 a study by naghibi and moradi dashtpagerdi 2016 implemented linear and quadratic discriminant analysis algorithms k nearest neighbors and multivariate adaptive regression splines to assess gw potential and the results were reported as satisfactory in another study rahmati and melesse 2016 used evidential belief function to assess gw potential and considered nitrate concentration to validate and finalize the best locations for gw exploitation naghibi et al 2017a presented a new hybrid model which combines the outputs of four ml algorithms by frequency ratio and reported that the novel ensemble algorithm enhanced the total accuracy by 1 3 area under curve auc compared to the second best single algorithm naghibi et al 2017b executed a genetic algorithm to define the parameters of the rf algorithm in mapping gw potential they indicated that the new method for tuning the rf algorithm led to highly accurate outputs and was more reliable than previously used optimization methods such as trial and error chen et al 2019 applied the genetic algorithm to optimize some previously applied algorithms in gw potential such as rf na√Øve bayes and support vector machines the models predicted gw potential with significantly higher performance when they were optimized by the genetic algorithm arabameri et al 2019 assessed the efficiency of the rf weights of evidence logistic regression and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis in generating a gw potential map gwpm regarding well data they stated that logistic regression yielded the best accuracy in another study pham et al 2019 assessed the robustness of three ensemble algorithms constructed by rotation forest decision stump multi boost and bagging in mapping gw potential and found the first algorithm to be the best previous researches have mainly focused on using different spring driving factors sdfs such as land use lithology fault related characteristics soil normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and digital elevation model dem derived properties in modeling gw potential ozdemir 2011a b zabihi et al 2016 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 naghibi et al 2017a b golkarian et al 2018 kordestani et al 2019 rahmati et al 2018a chen et al 2019 however obtaining high quality data on land use lithology soil and fault related information in data poor regions can be problematic another critique of previous studies is that they have only concentrated on improving algorithms without examining the input sdfs furthermore for larger country or continental scale modeling it is more feasible to work mainly with dem derived sdfs and the production of more generalized gwpm outputs hence the aforementioned methods may not be applicable in some regions due to the lack of sufficient input data based on the above this study focuses on the output quality when using only dem derived sdfs thus the study attempts to fill this gap by introducing a new methodology to generate low time cost but accurate gwpms we selected only dem derived factors that are commonly available for this purpose two new algorithms parallel random forest prf and extreme gradient boosting xgb were employed the prf and xgb algorithms were both developed to eliminate or alleviate overfitting in their previous versions such as when using rf and gradient boosting respectively chen et al 2017a fan et al 2018 for previous use of xgb we refer to climent et al 2018 and carmona et al 2019 who investigated the us banking system and bank distress in the european banking system prf has worked satisfactorily with big data and its output has proven to be more reliable than the rf in terms of accuracy chen et al 2017a in summary the core novelties of this study are i mapping gw potential by using only dem derived sdfs ii applying two state of the art algorithms prf and xgb with three boosters and comparing them with the benchmark algorithm rf iii prioritizing the sdfs in gw potential assessment and iv using new sdfs such as vertical distance to channel and convergence 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area gw potential mapping approach and the spring dataset the borujerd region is located between 33 35 and 34 07 latitude and from 48 27 to 49 05 longitude in the lorestan province iran having an area of 1676 km2 fig 1 a the chief land use patterns in the borujerd region are in order agriculture forest orchard rangeland and residential areas from a climate perspective borujerd region receives an average rainfall of 770 mm per year lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 which is about three times greater than in general for the entire country about 240 mm year gw potential can be explained as a spatial prediction method to evaluate the extraction potential of gw resources on the basis of indirect indicators d√≠az alcaide and mart√≠nez santos 2019 these indicators comprise spring well and qanat data for studies in iran however spring and well data are used for a wider range of studies for different purposes under diverse hydrogeological circumstances based on this we decided to use spring data as a gw indicator as it is readily available in many countries thus the output would be highly generalizable and ultimately the indicator allows us to work on larger spatial scales in the borujerd region 944 springs have been detected through field surveys by thelorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 the average ph of the springs is about 8 04 in addition the mean electrical conductivity of the spring water is about 364 3 ¬µmhos cm lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 the discharge varies significantly from one spring to another and the average discharge of all springs has been estimated at about 2 4 l s lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 the observed maximum discharge of the studied springs is about 300 l s lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 it is noted that in the classification issues like our study both presence and absence datapoints are indispensable and in this case are spring and non spring locations respectively with this in mind 944 non springs datapoints i e absence data were generated through a random algorithm along with observed 944 spring datapoints in borujerd region fig 1b the training set used 70 of all spring and 70 of all non spring datapoints this left 30 of spring and non spring datapoints to the validation sets in relation to geology a significant portion of the borujerd region comprises low level piedmont fan and early paleocene granite to diorite intrusive rocks geology survey of iran gsi 1997 fig 1c table 1 there exist a number of other lithological features as illustrated in table 1 it should be noted that using only dem derived driving factors is recommended when topography is the major controlling element of gw potential martinez santos and renard 2019 and it might not lead to acceptable outputs at aquifer scale where gw potential is driven by hydro geological variables in other words this methodology is not suitable for determining gw potential using well indicator for plain areas to investigate this issue a landform map of the study region was prepared using satellite images and then the distribution of the springs in each landform was determined the landform map is presented in fig 1d most of the area are covered by mountains valleys and alluvial fans and only 22 4 are covered by plain landform further only 3 6 of the springs are situated at plain landform this shows that gw condition is mainly controlled by topographical factors in this area 2 2 methods a flowchart of the implemented methodology comprising data provision the modeling scheme and the validation phase is schematized in fig 2 as reflected above a dataset of springs comprising location discharge ph and electrical conductivity was obtained from the lorestan regional water authority lrwa 2018 later 13 sdfs were derived from the dem of the borujerd region in western iran in the subsequent stage prf rf as well as xgb algorithms with three boosters were applied with the intention to compute the gwpms the output of the algorithms was transformed into gwpms and compared to a validation dataset for accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and receiver operating characteristics roc curve finally suitable locations with greater gw potential were proposed for gw exploitation 2 3 gw spring driving factors this study used the 30 30 m dem product advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster called global dem gdem as an input to create different dem based sdfs we chose this product as it is broadly available and simple to obtain and thus can be used to produce a generalizable and large scale framework for gw studies subsequently 13 sdfs were extracted from the gdem gw potential is impacted by slope aspect since each aspect receives a particular sunshine duration that specifies the rate of snowmelt in the northern hemisphere north aspects have a lower sunshine duration which means the snow melts over a prolonged time period dehnavi et al 2015 leading to an increase of infiltration time zapata rios et al 2016 investigated the impact of different slope aspects on water and vegetation features in a northern hemisphere watershed and demonstrated that eastern aspects receive prolonged solar radiation leading to higher biomass production vegetation cover and subsequently better soil condition for infiltration looking at the referred impact of the slope aspect on infiltration rate in either direct or indirect ways and the existing complexities this factor can be viewed as a highly probable sdf for gw potential mapping accordingly the slope aspect was created and categorized into nine classes as shown in fig 3 a slope degree has a direct influence on runoff erosion and the transport of sediments zaidi et al 2015 pakparvar et al 2018 for mild slopes less runoff is generated implying that a greater portion of the precipitation is infiltrated or evaporated further a direct relationship exists between slope degree and flow velocity while there is an inverse relationship between slope and infiltration rate the slope degree of the borujerd region was generated using gdem varying from 0 to 69 fig 3b altitude is a frequently employed sdf in previous investigations within this field e g mousavi et al 2017 altitude has an indirect influence on gw potential since generally a greater altitude generates higher slope degrees leading to lower infiltration rates rahmati et al 2018b drainage system development is also significantly related to altitude this sdf was created by implementing gdem and employed in the current research the altitude of borujerd region has a range between 1458 and 3637 m above mean sea level fig 3c convergence index relates to the concavity or convexity of the ground at a smaller scale k√∂the et al 1996 a negative convergence refers to concavities e g valleys whereas positive values reflect convex features e g ridges conoscenti et al 2015 this sdf was calculated by the system for automated geoscientific analyses saga conrad et al 2015 the minimum maximum and mean values of convergence were 99 23 99 61 and 0 0005 respectively fig 3d plan curvature reveals curvature along the opposite direction of the highest slope degree ayalew et al 2004 plan curvature is an indicator of the divergence and convergence of basins on the contrary profile curvature reflects a vertical plane parallel to the slope direction that impacts acceleration of the flow hence resulting in an impact erosion process kannan et al 2013 chen et al 2017b these sdfs impact slope stability by affecting the concentration and dispersion of the surface and subsurface flow further impacting both erosion and flow velocity and consequently infiltration rate either directly or indirectly the maps of these two sdfs are demonstrated in fig 3e f the relative slope position rsp demonstrates the slope position of each point and its relative position among valleys and ridges and could impact infiltration and flow in a given area rsp was calculated by the gdem of the borujerd region by the saga software conrad et al 2015 the rsp map ranges between 0 and 1 with a mean value of 0 26 for the borujerd region fig 3g another factor is vertical distance to channel which was calculated by the saga conrad et al 2015 this sdf influences soil moisture greater distances usually mean a lower amount of moisture thus it is beneficial for determining gw potential in a given territory the vertical distance to the channel was obtained by the interpolation of the channel network and elevation layer of the borujerd region fig 3h slope length ls has a direct impact on water accumulation at the downslope a longer ls leads to higher flow velocity and consequently greater erosion rate pourghasemi et al 2013 erosion deteriorates the topsoil and vegetation cover enhances flow velocity and consequently reduces infiltration rate hence extensively eroded slopes have lower infiltration capacity decreasing gw availability ls is computed by the following equation developed by moore and burch 1986 fig 3i 1 ls a 22 13 0 6 sin Œ≤ 0 0896 1 3 where a is the flow accumulative area which flows to a certain pixel and Œ≤ is the slope of the pixel the ls factor varied from 0 to 71 58 m with a mean of 3 34 m the topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi impact soil moisture gw flow and stability of the slope lee et al 2012 thus they are substantial contributors to the spatial variation of soil moisture and eventually affect gw potential moore et al 1991 spi is a measure of erosion strength by flowing water regmi et al 2014 twi is a prominent factor to determine wetness features preferably at a greater spatial resolution i e 10 30 m grabs et al 2009 twi is correlated with other hydrological variables and in particular with runoff and infiltration rates radu≈Ça et al 2018 twi points to the likelihood of runoff flowing to a certain pixel on the ground a larger twi reflects a greater amount of water flowing to a certain point and vice versa beven and kirkby 1979 the spi and twi can be calculated as moore et al 1991 fig 3j k 2 twi ln a tan Œ≤ 3 spi a tan Œ≤ rivers are the core natural recharge sources of gw xi et al 2010 in arid and semiarid parts of the world aquifers close to high discharge rivers benefit from a high recharge rate whereas aquifers further from such rivers depend more on other gw recharge sources such as precipitation snowmelt fault and subsurface flow apart from this greater drainage density generally occurs on highlands with steep slopes and subsequently lower infiltration rates the impact of the rivers on infiltration natural recharge and gw potential can be scrutinized from diverse viewpoints concerning this the drainage system was extracted from the gdem of borujerd region and employed to create distance from river and river density layers using euclidean distance and line density equations respectively a maximum distance of 6590 m from a river was observed with an average distance of 859 m fig 3l the river density layer of the borujerd region varied between 0 and 15 14 km km2 fig 3m 2 4 machine learning algorithms 2 4 1 gwpm production by random forest rf and parallel random forest prf algorithms rf is admired for its broadly successful implementation in diverse subjects particularly in spatial modeling the core elements of rf are decision trees dts that produce an estimate of classes rf takes apart the training into several smaller sets through bootstrap sampling and then builds a dt for each set golkarian et al 2018 for estimating an unused instance the ultimate decision is acquired through voting of a vast number of dts to optimize the rf algorithm the user has to select the best set of parameters for number of trees number of variables at each node mtry and node size to reach the best estimates we used a 10 fold cross validation it is noteworthy we conducted the training phase based on a grid search including number of trees between 100 and 1000 with 100 intervals mtry values between 2 and 5 and node sizes between 2 and 7 prf is an advanced version of rf in which the effectiveness of the primary algorithm has been improved to cope with larger data sets chen et al 2017a each dt of the prf is set up irrespective of other dts and each sub node of a dt is segregated individually chen et al 2017a the architecture of the prf and dt algorithms make the computing tasks parallel overfitting is a repeatedly reported problem for rf dwindling its accuracy when applied to complex areas the prf sorts out this challenge by employing a gain ratio with the intention to make a decision with respect to the features resulting in the greatest participation in the modeling process chen et al 2017a in prf the simulation is fixed at 500 trees by default and only mtry is optimized mean decrease in gini impurity denotes allocated error for the case where a factor is eliminated from the algorithm this parameter includes the mean of the variation in impurity observed throughout the entire node system in other words this parameter computes the role of each factor in dividing spring and non spring classes and is seen as an importance metric cassidy and deviney 2015 the selected values of the mtry range from 1 to 10 the training phase is done based on 10 fold cross validation 2 4 2 gpm production by extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithm with three different boosters xgb was introduced to the literature by chen and guestrin 2016 and is now a known ml algorithm in view of its superior efficacy when compared to other algorithms bandara et al 2020 xgb employs a gradient boosting structure with the advantage of parallel tree boosting it implements a more regularized algorithm than gradient boosting to tackle overfitting leading to greater performance bandara et al 2020 xgb makes use of a boosting method to combine a huge number of weak learners to predict the output linard et al 2013 apart from that xgb uses parallel processes that reduce the total calculation time fan et al 2018 xgb is superior when missing values are included in the data sets here we employed three boosters to optimize the xgb algorithm linear tree and dropouts meet multiple additive regression trees dart based on artificial neural networks the linear booster is useful for cases where the relationships follow linear behavior while tree and dart boosters are more suitable for more complex non linear patterns to apply xgb with its boosters the caret package was used benefitting from a 10 fold cross validation the parameters of xgb that require calibration by each booster are listed in table 2 2 5 validation of the models validation is renowned as a prime phase in spatial analysis without which the outcomes cannot be affirmed chang jo and fabbri 2003 this work implemented a roc curve accuracy kappa specificity sensitivity proportion correctly classified f score and matthews correlation coefficient to authenticate the gwpms by the used algorithms chen et al 2017b c to achieve this a validation dataset which was not considered in the training phase was employed the roc plot exhibits false and true positive rates on the x and y axis respectively hong et al 2016 the area under roc curve auc varies between 0 and 1 a greater value points to a higher performance of the algorithm in the gw potential modeling whereas a smaller value is a sign of weaker efficacy hong et al 2017 accuracy index depicts the ratio of correctly classified springs and non springs to all cases sensitivity also recognized as recall denotes the ratio of correctly classified springs to the sum of correctly classified springs and incorrectly classified non springs it denotes the proportion of springs that are correctly determined on the other hand

the greatest accuracy was achieved with 200 trees mtry of 2 and a node size of 7 at the training stage the confusion matrix was calculated for the training set and based on the findings the rf predicted 517 out of 662 non spring locations as well as 508 out of 662 spring locations correctly which leads to class errors of 0 219 and 0 232 for prediction of non spring and spring locations respectively the only parameter in the prf that was calibrated was mtry and a value of 2 was selected for this parameter with accuracy and kappa indices of 0 779 and 0 558 respectively fig 4 fig 4 illustrates that when the number of randomly selected variables goes up from 1 to 2 accuracy rises whereas more than 2 factors cause a reduction in performance it is noted that the number of trees was fixed at 500 for the prf calibration based on the default of the algorithm the confusion matrix for the prf indicates the correct prediction of the locations of 516 non springs and 521 springs out of 662 resulting in a class error of 0 220 and 0 212 for non spring and spring locations respectively 3 2 gwpms produced by xgb using different boosters the xgb algorithm was calibrated with three boosters through xgboost and caret packages in r software the linear booster resulted in an eta of 0 3 nrounds of 150 lambda of 0 0001 and alpha of 0 0001 fig 5 xgb was calibrated by the dart booster with the final parameters of gamma of 0 minimum child weight of 1 nrounds of 0 6 rate drop of 0 01 and skip drop of 0 05 in addition xgb was calibrated using tree booster resulting in a gamma of 1 nrounds of 0 colsample bytree of 0 8 minimum child weight of 1 and subsample of 1 it is important to mention that all the boosters were applied through ten fold cross validation 3 3 gwpms produced by the prf and xgb linear algorithms fig 6 a and b show the classified gwpms produced by the prf and xgb linear respectively further table 3 refers to the probability range and area percentage of every gwpm for the mentioned algorithms based on table 3 low moderate high and very high potential classes obtained by the xgb linear algorithm occupy 63 0 13 6 10 0 and 13 4 of the borujerd region respectively on the other hand low moderate high and very high gw potential classes produced by the prf occupy 33 6 31 1 22 5 and 12 8 of the borujerd region respectively the major distinction between the gwpms produced by the prf and xgb linear algorithms is the area assigned to the low class with the xgb linear considering a larger portion of the area as low gw potential as compared to the prf in the case of the very high gw potential category it was observed that both algorithms defined about 13 of the area for this class with a visual investigation of the gwpms it can be verified that the models are consistent in assigning areas as very high gw potential mainly those located in the vicinity of the main rivers as a supplementary phase we present a discrepancy map through a subtraction of the xgb and prf algorithms outputs i e probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 to provide an insight about the prediction differences between the two algorithms using the absolute values fig 6c shows the abs xgb prf map and fig 6d represents the classified discrepancy map we assumed the differences less than 0 3 is negligible and the higher values imply major differences according to the results xgb and prf predictions led to 80 similarity having an probability absolute differences 0 3 only a small portion 20 of the area depicted higher differences 0 3 between the two algorithms 3 4 evaluation of the algorithms the auc for the rf and prf as well as the auc for different boosters of the xgb are presented in fig 7 a and b evidently the prf auc 86 3 showed slightly better performance in comparison with the rf the xgb linear was more accurate auc 86 2 than the other boosters tables 4 and 5 demonstrate the success and predictive rates for the prf and xgb algorithms considering the training and validation data point sets respectively looking at the accuracy and kappa the prf showed slightly better performance than the xgb algorithm in the training stage table 3 similarly the prf yielded slightly higher accuracy and kappa compared to xgb for validation phase table 4 more detailed findings for the validation datapoint set demonstrated that the prf had greater specificity while the xgb linear had greater sensitivity table 4 this points to the fact that the prf is more robust when the algorithm deals with estimating non spring locations while the xgb is more robust when the algorithm deals with predicting spring locations f score and proportion correctly classified depicted superior performance of the prf whereas matthew correlation coefficient implied better outputs of the xgb linear all in all the prf and xgb linear algorithms were found to be considerably accurate in exploring gw potential 3 5 sensitivity analysis of spring driving factors by the prf fig 8 illustrates the importance of the sdfs fed into the prf based on the mean decrease in gini according to the figure the convergence factor had the highest impact on the algorithm accuracy followed by the twi river density altitude spi ls and slope degree it can be observed that vertical distance to channel and rsp were also relatively effective sdfs in gw potential in the study region 4 discussion the auc results implied the superiority of the prf relative to other algorithms followed by the xgb linear overall the findings of this research proved that the new methodology feeding dem derived sdfs into the suggested algorithms is useful in determining gw potential in data poor regions of the world investigation of the generated gwpms by the selected algorithms the prf and xgb linear indicated the similarity of both algorithms results in identifying the very high gw potential areas 13 with major consistency in location prediction although the prf and xgb linear are based on different methodologies and use different ml techniques in building the final algorithm their outcome was similar this reduces uncertainty leading to a more robust and trustable output according to our findings the gw managers in the borujerd region are advised to focus on the area adjacent to rivers in the eastern part of the basin for the expansion of gw exploitation and agricultural activities these areas showed higher gw potential as they are under greater natural recharge the results highlighted the major contributions of convergence twi river density altitude spi ls and slope degree to gw potential analysis convergence influences the flow speed on the slopes and subsequently impacts erosion and sedimentation which indirectly impacts the infiltration rate and gw potential twi is a hydrological sdf that refers to the probability of water accumulation at different parts of the basin and as a consequence impacts gw potential at the basin river density is another important sdf which refers to the level of development of the drainage network this factor influences the volume of water flowing through a specific area and indirectly impacts vegetation cover leading to a change in the infiltration rate and gw potential altitude was the fourth most important contributor in the modeling at higher altitudes the slope is steeper and flow velocity is greater and ultimately drainage density tends to be higher while at lower altitudes the situation is reversed regarding the great topographical variation in the borujerd region 1458 3620 m this sdf showed a high contribution to the gw potential in this work other important sdfs including spi ls and slope degree impact flow speed and infiltration rate and therefore are ranked as high contributors in this study rahmati et al 2016 showed the importance of the two categorical sdfs of land use and lithology in modeling gw potential in addition they claimed that twi was the least important sdf which is different from the results of this study mousavi et al 2017 stated that twi altitude distance from rivers river density distance from faults and fault density are the highest contributing sdfs a more recent paper by yousefi et al 2020 emphasized the importance of twi and altitude factors in groundwater potential mapping that is in line with output of our study although this study did not consider the two important sdfs related to the fault layer the algorithms produced high accuracy gwpms this fact shows that the important factor s replacement in gw modeling by simpler calculation process factors such as dem derived sdfs can still achieve high accuracy the prf as a developed version of the rf has several advantages such as its ability to confine outliers and work with a variety of scales for the input variables rahmati et al 2016 another benefit of the prf as a dt based algorithm is the ability to recognize nonlinear relationships among variables hansen et al 1996 golkarian et al 2018 it is noted that the rf algorithm as basis of the prf algorithm has proven to be a reliable technique for generating gwpms in other studies e g chen et al 2020 davoudi moghaddam et al 2020 moghaddam et al 2020 naghibi et al 2016 rahmati et al 2016 additionally the xgb indicated a high efficiency in analyzing gw potential in this study babajide mustapha and saeed 2016 investigated the performance of the xgb for bioactive molecule modeling and found it to be a robust ml algorithm they stated that the xgb dealt well with both homogenous and heterogeneous input data fan et al 2018 claimed that there were smaller fluctuations in xgb efficiency between diverse training and validation sets in comparison to the support vector machines that refer to its further superior ability to be generalized this feature goes back to the main objective of developing the xgb algorithm which is to tackle overfitting and lower uncertainty additionally based on timofeev and denisov 2020 xgb does not seek for data pre processing phases i e taking care of missing values and normalization which makes it faster and more straightforward the xgb features become important in the case of large scale modeling such as at the country or continental scales when the algorithm must be built on a huge amount of data and predict for a wide variety of areas with diverse hydrogeological climatic and topographical characteristics another benefit of the prf and xgb is that they are both based on parallel computations which enhances their calculation speed the stated advantages of the prf and xgb could be the reason for their higher performance in the borujerd region 5 conclusion this study aimed at introducing a new methodology for delineating gw potential using a small amount of input data the proposed framework implemented the prf and xgb with three different boosters and compared them with a benchmark algorithm rf the outcome showed that the prf and xgb with linear booster outperformed the rf and produced reliable gwpms the greater accuracy of the xgb might be caused by its ability to produce more general outputs and to tackle overfitting the prf and xgb linear predicted similar locations of very high gw potential this consistency of the gwpms proves that the methodology is reliable the main aim of this research was to use only dem derived factors to achieve accurate gwpms in the study area in the absence of other important sdfs the applicability of the new methodology was proved because of the high auc values of the algorithms the findings revealed that the convergence twi river density altitude spi and ls highly contribute to the success of the algorithms hence it can be concluded that in the absence of other important sdfs such as land use lithology soil and fault related sdfs the employed ml algorithms succeeded in extracting relationships among the dem derived factors and gw potential generally the proposed framework can be used for large scale gw potential mapping at the country and continent levels as we only need a limited number of data sets encompassing dem and spring locations it should be pointed out that the developed methodology is recommended for gw potential assessment through spring locations that are driven by topography this methodology can generate necessary information for water sector managers and gw professionals to implement proper water resources plans for future research scholars may focus on the spatial resolution of the dem and consider other dem derived factors in order to improve the methodology and hence the modeling results the new methodology can be of use especially in areas confronted by a lack of accurate and high resolution data including land use lithology soil hydrogeology and fault related factors like fault density and distance from faults credit authorship contribution statement seyed amir naghibi conceptualization methodology investigation software validation writing original draft writing review
