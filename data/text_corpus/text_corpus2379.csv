study is to investigate the impact of lulc changes on groundwater table in the region the outcomes of this study not only facilitate hydrologists and policy makers to better understand the impact of land use and land cover changes on groundwater stability but also help them to enhance the mitigation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area al ain uae is one of the fastest growing cities in the uae located between 24 09 24 20 n latitude and 55 36 55 48 e longitude as shown in fig 1 it is also known as the city of garden in uae this city covers an area of 77 002 ha 770 02 km2 the area is sourrounded towards east south and north by the sultanate of oman the region is attractive because of its low humidity oasis and the fact that it represents a transit between the arabian gulf and inland areas yagoub and al bizreh 2014 scad 2016 the average annual precipitation in al ain is 72 mm and average temperature is about 27 8 c elmahdy et al 2020 menges et al 1993 characterized the geomorphology of al ain into wide alluvial plain near the city center mountains of exposed urban bedrock piedmonts alluvial plain and piedmonts related to ephemeral streams on the west flank of oman mountains and aeolian sand dune areas in terms of hydrological perspective the area is divided into shallow and deep aquifer system the water of these aquifers are used for agriculture domestic and industrial use elmahdy et al 2016 the knowledge and understanding of its urban growth trends and groundwater changes are needed for the sustainable planning and management of its resources such as urban planning and management of water and land resources therefore the rs and gis techniques were employed in the study in order to monitor the urban growth rate and its impacts on groundwater resources 2 2 data collection landsat satellite 7 and 8 images with spectral bands 3 0 63 0 69 mm and band 4 0 77 0 90 mm for etm and band 4 0 636 0 673 mm and band 5 0 851 0 879 mm of operational land imager oli sensors were used for the year 2006 and 2016 respectively for lulc mapping the strips in landsat etm were removed using gapfilling tool in environment for visualizing images envi the erdas 2014 envi and the arcgis version 10 3 were used because of their capabilities for raster analysis and map production the ground values were taken from field and high resolution google earth images for improving classification accuracy among different objects such as farms parks built up and sandy areas due to similar spectral signature values table 1 summarises the data used in the study and their sources 2 3 vegetation indices calculation the spectral vegetation indices vis are mathematical expressions of various spectral bands mostly in the visible and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum which provide composite property of leaf chlorophyll leaf area optical measures of canopy greenness and canopy architecture hussein et al 2020 jia et al 2014 in this study the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of landsat 8 and landsat 7 were download from https ers cr usgs gov the ndvi of landsat 7 and 8 were based on red and near infrared bands the value of vegetation indices field information and expert knowledge were used to understand and classify the image a higher value of the vegetation index indicates an agricultural area whereas lower values differentiate among other classes such as urban barren and water bodies erdas 2014 spectra signature development function was used for the development of spectral signatures the ndvi threshold 0 1 1 and spectral signatures were used for the discrimination among different classes especially agricultural parks garden and lake differentiation classes between urban and sand dune areas were established by using spectral signatures high resolution google earth imagery open street maps and previously published reports from the al ain city municipality after a several trials initially developed 80 classes were merged into 6 major classes based on the criteria mentioned earlier 2 4 image classification a semi supervised classification apporach was incoporated in this study envi and arcgis software were employed to process the satellite data the reliability of landsat data dependent upon atmosphere correction all landsat scenes were reprojected wgs84 utm zone 39 n for geometric and atmosphere correction initially an unsupervised classification was applied to the raw image the isodata classification assigns pixels to the nearest cluster based on the spectral distances richards and jia 2006 the algorithm is iterative in that it repeatedly performs an entire classification and afterwards recalculates the new statistics of the cluster during this classification a number of trials were performed to know the accurate number of spectral classes for the image classification at the beginning 80 lulc classes were developed afterwards overlapping behaviours of classes were analyzed additionally training of classes were generated using present information from field survey high resolution google earth maps al ain muncipility aacm 2016 statistical center of abu dhabi scad 2016 and previous land use maps the second step followed in the semi supervised classification was to join the classes on the basis of similar spectral profiles spectral signatures were developed based on novel running trend analysis initially running trend analysis is only used in climatic studies to see trends in time series data brunetti et al 2012 this novel running trend analysis would help to develop precise discrimination among different objects which often difficult based on general classification ground truth points were taken from the high resolution google earth maps and from field visits for training and testing of classified map and their accuracy assessment the maximum likelihood algorithm was used to classify the area into six major classes using developed spectral signatures due to its reliability and accessibility in all mapping software guo et al 2010 finally six developed classes were used to detect broad land use land cover area in this region 2 5 change detection impact on water demand the comparative analysis of the classified images with different time span offers an opportunity to detect changes within the classes a post classification method was used which is one of the most widely used change detection techniques that differentiates pixel by pixel combination of images from two different intervals in addition the technique provides statistics of geographical changes and their extent bhatta 2010 regarding the water demand in the region the geo statistical analysis was used to develop spatial maps of groundwater depth of al ain area the inverse distance weight idw method of interpolation was used for the delineation of detailed groundwater depth maps the idw is an interpolation technique which estimate the parameter values at unknown location using linear combination of observed points weighted by an inverse function of distance from the point of interest to the observed points khan et al 2019 khan 2018 the primary reason for choosing idw than other spatial interpolation techniques that its relability when the distribution of the estimated parameters is not a normal distribution chen and liu 2012 a comprehensive field visit was conducted and 52 groundwater well values were collected randomly for area interpolation within boundary of al ain region in different areas based on accessibility well conditions and permission of owners for modelling and cross validation to assist in well selection process each well owner was interviewed to confirm the selected well is in operational condition and used for irrigation purposes the mathematical expression of idw equation is given below 1 z x o i 1 n z x i d i 0 r i 1 n d i 0 r where x0 is the prediction function of neighbouring observations z x i 1 2 n r is value of exponent that estimates the weight assigned to each observation d is distance between known and unknown points as the distance between these two points increases the weight decreases mirzaei and sakizadeh 2016 in addition the abu dhabi global environment data initiative aegdi 2016 was used in this study the data initiative provides a regional water strategy which was reviewed in order to understand the water share between various sectors and then a link was established between the lulc change and a change in water demand in the study region the equation 2 serves as the algorithm of idw which works behind the idw technique in arcgis 2 6 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment of classified image 2006 and 2016 was analyzed to monitor the quality of information extracted from ground data an error matrix was developed to evaluate the accuracy of the classified images the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are the two most extensively used accuracy assessment methods of classified images bogoliubova and tymków 2014 the standard criteria for training and accuracy assessment of classified images were adopted using ground values i e 70 of data i e 37 points were used for image classification and the remaining 30 data i e 15 points were used accuracy assesment in order to access the performance of interpolation method for groundwater mapping the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean squared errors rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were incorporated in the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 land use land cover change detection fig 2 a and 2 b show the lulc classification of the al ain region for the year 2006 and 2016 respectively six lulc classes were developed as shown in fig 2 a b these six classes were represented into different colors in ordor to see and feature on the direction of changes the total area of the al ain region is 77 002 ha 770 02 km2 the results depicted that the agriculture including farms and oasis occupies the major portion of the region in both years in 2006 the estimated agriculture farm oasis area was 41 500 ha whereas in 2016 it was 46 970 ha increased by 7 38 it was attributed by the desert greening policy of the abu dhabi economic vision 2030 according to this plan the abu dhabi food control authority adfca is working to achieve food security in order to fulfil conunrty s rising food demand by increasing the local agricultural production agedi 2016 similarly the advancement in industrialisation and economic progress has led to the expansion in urban areas from 8150 ha in 2006 to 9105 ha in 2016 an increase by about 10 49 additonally as urban areas increased the crossponding pixels of sandy areas and mix urban sandy area class 8 1 and 32 5 were transformed into urban area class at a rate 5 5 and 22 45 it is also noted that pixels from sandy area and mixed urban sandy area class were also converted at a rate of 2 6 from sandy area class and 10 05 from mixed mixed urban and sandy area into agricultural and landscape features e g parks play ground and roadside vegetation such urban and infrastrcture expansion associated with pillar of national roadmap of the uae economic plan uae 2021 ovaerll all classes of 2006 and 2016 classified images are recognized visually however crop types and accurate mall buildings were not dected by landsat images the agricultural and urban areas within and around al ain city were clearly recognized despite dense clusters within city during 2006 2016 whereas bareland of sand dunes carbonates rock and desert plains were reduced during this same time interval as shown in table 2 and fig 2 a b the land use changes in the region are shown in table 2 the water demand change in three major lulc classes reported by goad 2013 and agedi 2016 is shown in table 3 it shows that water demand increased by about 22 2 from 2006 to 2016 which can be linked with an increased urban area of 10 49 during that period 3 2 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment is considered an integral part of land use and land cover classification the reliability of land use classification highly depends on the data quality its processing and classification techniques usman et al 2015 in this study an error matrix was developed with the help of google earth data field survey information and results of previous studies used to check the accuracy level of the classified maps the user and producer accuracy of classified map is shown in table 4 and table 5 and for 2006 and 2016 images respectively the overall accuracy of the classified maps for the year 2006 is 77 14 with a kappa coefficient value of 0 7024 similarly accuracy analysis was also carried out for the year 2016 it was shown that the reliable accuracy was achieved by 80 with a kappa coefficient value of 0 720 for the year 2016 there are no specific criteria to check the accuracy of classified maps because of the nature of lulc which varies in different circumstances in various regions and also due to lack of availability of ground values in case of object based image classification jiang et al 2012 argued that the values of classification in the range between 61 and 80 can be considered to be good in the agreement satisfactory results were reported in some previous studies on lulc changes in order to establish a relationship between land use changes and water quality and demand im et al 2015 wilson et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 3 3 impacts of lulc change on water demand land use changes have a significant effect on water supply and demand information obtained from lulc change detection can help policy makers and spatial managers to better understand the underlying relation of human induced factors on the environment and for the integrated water resources management al naber and molle 2017 elmahdy and mohamed 2015 kalhor and emaminejad 2019 miettinen et al 2016 in order to monitor the urban sprawl impact on water demand change analysis based on urban sprawl has been carried out using the postclassification techniques in the arc gis expansion of urban areas in the al ain region is shown in fig 3 although we employed medium resolution landsat images for lulc and urban sprawl some small buildings and farms were unable to differentiate that distributed in the sand dune fields hence we applied 60 40 probability i e 60 sand and 40 urban area for extracting features of individual pixels from this class we merged this 40 area while examining urban sprawl it can be inferred that the extent of urban expansion in the al ain region is higher in the north west and south west directions which is mainly due to the construction of al ain abu dhabi road as well as the easy access of water and electricity facilities in that directions a slight expansion of urban areas is also observed in the northeast direction the results are aligned with previous study yagoub and al bizreh 2014 moreover percentage change in lulc results were also compared with the abu dhabi global environmental data initiative agedi outcomes as shown in fig 4 the agricultural and garden areas were increased by 7 38 and 5 88 respectively from 2006 to 2016 which reflects the progress of the desert greening policy of the abu dhabi government moreover the abu dhabi food control authority adfca planned to partially fulfil the food demand of the country s growing population from local agricultural production in order to meet this desert green policy and rising food demand substantial amount of water have been consumed in both sectors for last 10 years which clearly evident the rising water demand in agriculture 9 78 and play grounds 8 89 similarly al ain region is one of the fastest growing cities in the uae fig 4 shows that from 2006 to 2016 urban areas and their population were increased by 10 49 and 25 45 respectively and the corresponding water demand was increased by more than 22 2 to quantify and assess the impact of land use land cover especially urban area changes and increase in water demand a spatial maps of groundwater depth were developed for 2006 and 2016 as shown in fig 5 by comparing the spatial maps in fig 5 and land use in fig 2 a direct relationship were observed between land use changes and decline in groundwater level groundwater is a major source of water in al ain in order to meet water demand of expanding built up areas as well as for agricultural sector continuous withdrawal of water has been examined in the last 10 years it was also found that average groundwater depth declined up to 40 44 in different areas of al ain in the previous decade which is evident that water demand is dramatically increasing in the city the higher decrease in groundwater level were seen in the south west directions such rapid drop in groundwater depth associated with substaintal land use land cover alterations especially new sites that were earlier uninfluenced as agriculture farms oasis and garden play grounds shared major proportion in lulc for both time period 2006 and 2016 moreover linear relationship between ndvi and groundwater depth were also developed in order to examine the impact of vegetation from these two primarly classified classes on groundwater depth as shown in fig 6 the relationship between ndvi and groundwater depth gwd also confirms upward trend in last ten years which support the results in fig 5 about decline in groundwater depth moreover cross validation technique was incorporated to check the efficiency of interpolation method for developing groundwater depth map a total of 15 points n 15 were considered for developing the statistical relationship for groundwater depth mapping between observed and ground values as shown in fig 6 the coefficient of determination r2 value nash scuffle efficiency nse and the root mean square error rmse were used to check the accuracy of idw spatial mapping between observed and estimated groundwater depth as shown in fig 7 the regression analysis shown in fig 7 depicted that reliable relationship developed between observed and estimated gwd were found good in agreement with r2 0 78 nse 0 705 and rmse 0 123 for 2006 and r2 0 82 nse 0 745 and rmse 0 132 for 2016 the results were also compared with some previous studies bhunia et al 2018 magesh et al 2012 and satisfactory agreement were found between observed and estimated groundwater depth the obtained lulc maps in combination with groundwater delinated maps would be viable for examining impact of urban expansion and intesnsive farming on groundwater depletion quantitatively and qualitatively 4 conclusions this study illustrates the trends of land use change and water demand in al ain region of the uae from 2006 to 2016 the results showed that digital images processing techniques multi spectral and multi temporal satellite data and their integration with ground information can be very effective and practical for land use land cover studies the study also investigated the water demand change during the same time period it was observed that agricultural area was increased by 7 38 in the last ten years accompanying with a rise in water demand by 9 78 an increasing trend was also found in another two lulc classes gardens playgrounds and urban areas with a remarkable rise in water demand urban area was increased by 10 49 and the corresponding water demand was raised by more than 22 2 although urban expansion depicted the development of infrastructure and rise in economic activities which creates a concern for town planners for the management of resources especially water resources the country is dependent on expensive desalinated water for its municipal water supply therefore an increase of 22 2 water demand in the urban sector in the last 10 years was a big challenge for the authorities in order to meet such rising water demand continuous withdrawal of groundwater has been occurring which resulted in a 40 44 declanation of the groundwater level in the agriculture and gardens sectors an increase in water demand exerted a pressure on the country s scarce groundwater resources there is no doubt that a coordinated land and water resources development is inevitable for the sustainability of the region the outcome of this study would be useful for land use planning and for managing groundwater resources in the study region in terms of lulc classification in some areas spectral signatures of urban land were intermixed with sandy areas due to moderate resolution of the landsat satellite data which creates ambiguity to mark these places in specific classes these uncertainties would be removed by incorporating high resolution datasets in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this study is supported by the uaeu national water center grant 31r191

on groundwater resources 2 2 data collection landsat satellite 7 and 8 images with spectral bands 3 0 63 0 69 mm and band 4 0 77 0 90 mm for etm and band 4 0 636 0 673 mm and band 5 0 851 0 879 mm of operational land imager oli sensors were used for the year 2006 and 2016 respectively for lulc mapping the strips in landsat etm were removed using gapfilling tool in environment for visualizing images envi the erdas 2014 envi and the arcgis version 10 3 were used because of their capabilities for raster analysis and map production the ground values were taken from field and high resolution google earth images for improving classification accuracy among different objects such as farms parks built up and sandy areas due to similar spectral signature values table 1 summarises the data used in the study and their sources 2 3 vegetation indices calculation the spectral vegetation indices vis are mathematical expressions of various spectral bands mostly in the visible and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum which provide composite property of leaf chlorophyll leaf area optical measures of canopy greenness and canopy architecture hussein et al 2020 jia et al 2014 in this study the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of landsat 8 and landsat 7 were download from https ers cr usgs gov the ndvi of landsat 7 and 8 were based on red and near infrared bands the value of vegetation indices field information and expert knowledge were used to understand and classify the image a higher value of the vegetation index indicates an agricultural area whereas lower values differentiate among other classes such as urban barren and water bodies erdas 2014 spectra signature development function was used for the development of spectral signatures the ndvi threshold 0 1 1 and spectral signatures were used for the discrimination among different classes especially agricultural parks garden and lake differentiation classes between urban and sand dune areas were established by using spectral signatures high resolution google earth imagery open street maps and previously published reports from the al ain city municipality after a several trials initially developed 80 classes were merged into 6 major classes based on the criteria mentioned earlier 2 4 image classification a semi supervised classification apporach was incoporated in this study envi and arcgis software were employed to process the satellite data the reliability of landsat data dependent upon atmosphere correction all landsat scenes were reprojected wgs84 utm zone 39 n for geometric and atmosphere correction initially an unsupervised classification was applied to the raw image the isodata classification assigns pixels to the nearest cluster based on the spectral distances richards and jia 2006 the algorithm is iterative in that it repeatedly performs an entire classification and afterwards recalculates the new statistics of the cluster during this classification a number of trials were performed to know the accurate number of spectral classes for the image classification at the beginning 80 lulc classes were developed afterwards overlapping behaviours of classes were analyzed additionally training of classes were generated using present information from field survey high resolution google earth maps al ain muncipility aacm 2016 statistical center of abu dhabi scad 2016 and previous land use maps the second step followed in the semi supervised classification was to join the classes on the basis of similar spectral profiles spectral signatures were developed based on novel running trend analysis initially running trend analysis is only used in climatic studies to see trends in time series data brunetti et al 2012 this novel running trend analysis would help to develop precise discrimination among different objects which often difficult based on general classification ground truth points were taken from the high resolution google earth maps and from field visits for training and testing of classified map and their accuracy assessment the maximum likelihood algorithm was used to classify the area into six major classes using developed spectral signatures due to its reliability and accessibility in all mapping software guo et al 2010 finally six developed classes were used to detect broad land use land cover area in this region 2 5 change detection impact on water demand the comparative analysis of the classified images with different time span offers an opportunity to detect changes within the classes a post classification method was used which is one of the most widely used change detection techniques that differentiates pixel by pixel combination of images from two different intervals in addition the technique provides statistics of geographical changes and their extent bhatta 2010 regarding the water demand in the region the geo statistical analysis was used to develop spatial maps of groundwater depth of al ain area the inverse distance weight idw method of interpolation was used for the delineation of detailed groundwater depth maps the idw is an interpolation technique which estimate the parameter values at unknown location using linear combination of observed points weighted by an inverse function of distance from the point of interest to the observed points khan et al 2019 khan 2018 the primary reason for choosing idw than other spatial interpolation techniques that its relability when the distribution of the estimated parameters is not a normal distribution chen and liu 2012 a comprehensive field visit was conducted and 52 groundwater well values were collected randomly for area interpolation within boundary of al ain region in different areas based on accessibility well conditions and permission of owners for modelling and cross validation to assist in well selection process each well owner was interviewed to confirm the selected well is in operational condition and used for irrigation purposes the mathematical expression of idw equation is given below 1 z x o i 1 n z x i d i 0 r i 1 n d i 0 r where x0 is the prediction function of neighbouring observations z x i 1 2 n r is value of exponent that estimates the weight assigned to each observation d is distance between known and unknown points as the distance between these two points increases the weight decreases mirzaei and sakizadeh 2016 in addition the abu dhabi global environment data initiative aegdi 2016 was used in this study the data initiative provides a regional water strategy which was reviewed in order to understand the water share between various sectors and then a link was established between the lulc change and a change in water demand in the study region the equation 2 serves as the algorithm of idw which works behind the idw technique in arcgis 2 6 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment of classified image 2006 and 2016 was analyzed to monitor the quality of information extracted from ground data an error matrix was developed to evaluate the accuracy of the classified images the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are the two most extensively used accuracy assessment methods of classified images bogoliubova and tymków 2014 the standard criteria for training and accuracy assessment of classified images were adopted using ground values i e 70 of data i e 37 points were used for image classification and the remaining 30 data i e 15 points were used accuracy assesment in order to access the performance of interpolation method for groundwater mapping the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean squared errors rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were incorporated in the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 land use land cover change detection fig 2 a and 2 b show the lulc classification of the al ain region for the year 2006 and 2016 respectively six lulc classes were developed as shown in fig 2 a b these six classes were represented into different colors in ordor to see and feature on the direction of changes the total area of the al ain region is 77 002 ha 770 02 km2 the results depicted that the agriculture including farms and oasis occupies the major portion of the region in both years in 2006 the estimated agriculture farm oasis area was 41 500 ha whereas in 2016 it was 46 970 ha increased by 7 38 it was attributed by the desert greening policy of the abu dhabi economic vision 2030 according to this plan the abu dhabi food control authority adfca is working to achieve food security in order to fulfil conunrty s rising food demand by increasing the local agricultural production agedi 2016 similarly the advancement in industrialisation and economic progress has led to the expansion in urban areas from 8150 ha in 2006 to 9105 ha in 2016 an increase by about 10 49 additonally as urban areas increased the crossponding pixels of sandy areas and mix urban sandy area class 8 1 and 32 5 were transformed into urban area class at a rate 5 5 and 22 45 it is also noted that pixels from sandy area and mixed urban sandy area class were also converted at a rate of 2 6 from sandy area class and 10 05 from mixed mixed urban and sandy area into agricultural and landscape features e g parks play ground and roadside vegetation such urban and infrastrcture expansion associated with pillar of national roadmap of the uae economic plan uae 2021 ovaerll all classes of 2006 and 2016 classified images are recognized visually however crop types and accurate mall buildings were not dected by landsat images the agricultural and urban areas within and around al ain city were clearly recognized despite dense clusters within city during 2006 2016 whereas bareland of sand dunes carbonates rock and desert plains were reduced during this same time interval as shown in table 2 and fig 2 a b the land use changes in the region are shown in table 2 the water demand change in three major lulc classes reported by goad 2013 and agedi 2016 is shown in table 3 it shows that water demand increased by about 22 2 from 2006 to 2016 which can be linked with an increased urban area of 10 49 during that period 3 2 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment is considered an integral part of land use and land cover classification the reliability of land use classification highly depends on the data quality its processing and classification techniques usman et al 2015 in this study an error matrix was developed with the help of google earth data field survey information and results of previous studies used to check the accuracy level of the classified maps the user and producer accuracy of classified map is shown in table 4 and table 5 and for 2006 and 2016 images respectively the overall accuracy of the classified maps for the year 2006 is 77 14 with a kappa coefficient value of 0 7024 similarly accuracy analysis was also carried out for the year 2016 it was shown that the reliable accuracy was achieved by 80 with a kappa coefficient value of 0 720 for the year 2016 there are no specific criteria to check the accuracy of classified maps because of the nature of lulc which varies in different circumstances in various regions and also due to lack of availability of ground values in case of object based image classification jiang et al 2012 argued that the values of classification in the range between 61 and 80 can be considered to be good in the agreement satisfactory results were reported in some previous studies on lulc changes in order to establish a relationship between land use changes and water quality and demand im et al 2015 wilson et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 3 3 impacts of lulc change on water demand land use changes have a significant effect on water supply and demand information obtained from lulc change detection can help policy makers and spatial managers to better understand the underlying relation of human induced factors on the environment and for the integrated water resources management al naber and molle 2017 elmahdy and mohamed 2015 kalhor and emaminejad 2019 miettinen et al 2016 in order to monitor the urban sprawl impact on water demand change analysis based on urban sprawl has been carried out using the postclassification techniques in the arc gis expansion of urban areas in the al ain region is shown in fig 3 although we employed medium resolution landsat images for lulc and urban sprawl some small buildings and farms were unable to differentiate that distributed in the sand dune fields hence we applied 60 40 probability i e 60 sand and 40 urban area for extracting features of individual pixels from this class we merged this 40 area while examining urban sprawl it can be inferred that the extent of urban expansion in the al ain region is higher in the north west and south west directions which is mainly due to the construction of al ain abu dhabi road as well as the easy access of water and electricity facilities in that directions a slight expansion of urban areas is also observed in the northeast direction the results are aligned with previous study yagoub and al bizreh 2014 moreover percentage change in lulc results were also compared with the abu dhabi global environmental data initiative agedi outcomes as shown in fig 4 the agricultural and garden areas were increased by 7 38 and 5 88 respectively from 2006 to 2016 which reflects the progress of the desert greening policy of the abu dhabi government moreover the abu dhabi food control authority adfca planned to partially fulfil the food demand of the country s growing population from local agricultural production in order to meet this desert green policy and rising food demand substantial amount of water have been consumed in both sectors for last 10 years which clearly evident the rising water demand in agriculture 9 78 and play grounds 8 89 similarly al ain region is one of the fastest growing cities in the uae fig 4 shows that from 2006 to 2016 urban areas and their population were increased by 10 49 and 25 45 respectively and the corresponding water demand was increased by more than 22 2 to quantify and assess the impact of land use land cover especially urban area changes and increase in water demand a spatial maps of groundwater depth were developed for 2006 and 2016 as shown in fig 5 by comparing the spatial maps in fig 5 and land use in fig 2 a direct relationship were observed between land use changes and decline in groundwater level groundwater is a major source of water in al ain in order to meet water demand of expanding built up areas as well as for agricultural sector continuous withdrawal of water has been examined in the last 10 years it was also found that average groundwater depth declined up to 40 44 in different areas of al ain in the previous decade which is evident that water demand is dramatically increasing in the city the higher decrease in groundwater level were seen in the south west directions such rapid drop in groundwater depth associated with substaintal land use land cover alterations especially new sites that were earlier uninfluenced as agriculture farms oasis and garden play grounds shared major proportion in lulc for both time period 2006 and 2016 moreover linear relationship between ndvi and groundwater depth were also developed in order to examine the impact of vegetation from these two primarly classified classes on groundwater depth as shown in fig 6 the relationship between ndvi and groundwater depth gwd also confirms upward trend in last ten years which support the results in fig 5 about decline in groundwater depth moreover cross validation technique was incorporated to check the efficiency of interpolation method for developing groundwater depth map a total of 15 points n 15 were considered for developing the statistical relationship for groundwater depth mapping between observed and ground values as shown in fig 6 the coefficient of determination r2 value nash scuffle efficiency nse and the root mean square error rmse were used to check the accuracy of idw spatial mapping between observed and estimated groundwater depth as shown in fig 7 the regression analysis shown in fig 7 depicted that reliable relationship developed between observed and estimated gwd were found good in agreement with r2 0 78 nse 0 705 and rmse 0 123 for 2006 and r2 0 82 nse 0 745 and rmse 0 132 for 2016 the results were also compared with some previous studies bhunia et al 2018 magesh et al 2012 and satisfactory agreement were found between observed and estimated groundwater depth the obtained lulc maps in combination with groundwater delinated maps would be viable for examining impact of urban expansion and intesnsive farming on groundwater depletion quantitatively and qualitatively 4 conclusions this study illustrates the trends of land use change and water demand in al ain region of the uae from 2006 to 2016 the results showed that digital images processing techniques multi spectral and multi temporal satellite data and their integration with ground information can be very effective and practical for land use land cover studies the study also investigated the water demand change during the same time period it was observed that agricultural area was increased by 7 38 in the last ten years accompanying with a rise in water demand by 9 78 an increasing trend was also found in another two lulc classes gardens playgrounds and urban areas with a remarkable rise in water demand urban area was increased by 10 49 and the corresponding water demand was raised by more than 22 2 although urban expansion depicted the development of infrastructure and rise in economic activities which creates a concern for town planners for the management of resources especially water resources the country is dependent on expensive desalinated water for its municipal water supply therefore an increase of 22 2 water demand in the urban sector in the last 10 years was a big challenge for the authorities in order to meet such rising water demand continuous withdrawal of groundwater has been occurring which resulted in a 40 44 declanation of the groundwater level in the agriculture and gardens sectors an increase in water demand exerted a pressure on the country s scarce groundwater resources there is no doubt that a coordinated land and water resources development is inevitable for the sustainability of the region the outcome of this study would be useful for land use planning and for managing groundwater resources in the study region in terms of lulc classification in some areas spectral signatures of urban land were intermixed with sandy areas due to moderate resolution of the landsat satellite data which creates ambiguity to mark these places in specific classes these uncertainties would be removed by incorporating high resolution datasets in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this study is

11896,low cost eco friendly and efficient charcoal based composites have been developed to remove arsenic from two argentine naturally contaminated groundwater samples iron compounds have been added to the charcoals both to enhance the composites sorption capacities and to provide permanent magnetization to the materials the raw charcoals one made from eucalyptus wood charcoal ewc and a commercial activated carbon csc as well as their magnetic variants mewc and mcsc respectively have been characterized by several techniques and tested for arsenic sorption in the magnetic analogues mössbauer spectroscopy enabled the identification of magnetite as the main fe oxide together with some paramagnetic fe phases and goethite the magnetization saturation values of 11 2 0 5 am2 kg 1 for mewc and 10 7 0 5 am2 kg 1 for mcsc agree with mössbauer results these saturation values indicate that it is possible to separate the sorbents from the liquid phase with an external magnetic field arsenic removal was higher for mewc than for mcsc and arsenic sorption from naturally contaminated water samples resulted lower than in the synthetic one for natural waters as residual concentrations resulted lower than 50 μg l 1 which is the limit for drinking water in argentina the satisfactory results achieved for the homemade eucalyptus derived composite indicate that it is a promising material to be used in simple technological systems for water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic charcoal fe oxides sorbent materials arsenic groundwater argentina 1 introduction environmental monitoring in argentina reveals that four million people are chronically exposed to arsenic as through drinking water and it has been documented that up to 30 of patients with arsenicosis will likely die of skin liver lung bladder stomach or pancreas cancer bardach et al 2015 the current situation demands the development of eco friendly simple and low cost as sorbents to provide potable water sources to these communities carbonaceous materials such as activated carbons charcoals and biochars derived from lignocellulosic biomass have been proposed as promising materials to remove pollutants from water danish and ahmad 2018 li et al 2017 oliveira et al 2017 shaheen et al 2019 however biomass pyrolysis and activation require specific and sophisticated equipment for instance commercial carbons are usually physically activated with steam co2 air or gas mixtures or are chemically activated by adding zinc salts koh or h3po4 adib et al 2015 b wang et al 2017a which make them expensive alternative methodologies are required to attain efficient and low cost carbonaceous sorbents and to improve their sorption capacity by modifying their internal and external surfaces supporting iron oxide particles onto carbon has proven to be an efficient way to remove pollutants such as arsenic dhanasekaran and sahu 2020 singh et al 2018 avoiding the frequent problems of agglomeration and oxidation that result from using these particles in isolation shaikh et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 also the magnetic properties that those particles confer to the composite allow quick separation from the liquid phase after the pollutant removal by applying an external magnetic field ahmad et al 2019 hu et al 2018 however the syntheses of magnetic carbons generally include multiple steps the vast majority of which involve specialized procedures and laboratory equipment like high temperature muffle furnaces with controlled n2 atmosphere reddy and lee 2014 yang et al 2008 chemical co precipitation with n2 bubbling han et al 2015 or microwave systems yap et al 2017 the aim of this paper is to synthesize a magnetic composite with a high as sorption capacity using locally available biomass and relatively easy and low cost techniques toward this goal local eucalyptus wood has been turned into charcoal using an easy and inexpensive charring system and fe oxide particles were synthesized onto the charcoal using a versatile and simple procedure a commercial carbon has been also used as contrast material in addition a thorough characterization of the synthesized composites was carried out to better understand the as removal performance being a crucial stage in the development of sorbent materials aimed at providing environmental technological solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents two carbon precursors were used for the composites synthesis one charcoal was produced from eucalyptus wood a residual biomass which is abundantly available in argentina following the procedure presented in detail in a previous work bursztyn fuentes et al 2020 the carbonization was performed inside an open kiln the fire was started with small branches diameter d about 1 cm and it was continuously fed with the addition of new larger branches d 4 cm when all the available biomass was used distilled water was poured to put out the fire the charcoal thus obtained was then filtered dried at 105 c for 48 h and labeled ewc for eucalyptus wood charcoal the other precursor was a commercial steam activated carbon clarimex s a produced from coconut shell labeled csc for coconut shell charcoal and it was used here as a contrast to the homemade charcoal both carbons were ground and sieved between mesh 30 and 60 astm to obtain particles with sizes in the range 600 250 μm the magnetic composites were synthesized using analytical grade reagents kno3 and koh 99 biopack and feso4 7h2o analytical degree cicarelli for arsenic removal tests the control synthetic solution was prepared by dilution with ultrapure water of a 1000 mg l 1 as v standard solution merck analytical grade 2 2 magnetic composite synthesis the magnetic composites were synthesized according to the method described by bartonkova et al 2007 this procedure was chosen because of its simplicity and versatility i e it allows to achieve magnetic adsorbents for the removal of pollutants with an adequate magnetic response in a reproducible way and without the need to use nitrogen gas to avoid the oxidation of materials barraqué et al 2018 2020 2021 montes et al 2020 zelaya soulé et al 2021 briefly the precursor ewc or csc was suspended in distilled water under magnetic stirring 2 5 g 425 ml water then 25 ml of feso4 7h2o 0 3 m were added and left to interact for 2 h finally 25 ml of kno3 0 49 m and 25 ml of koh 1 25 m were added sequentially and the temperature of the suspension was raised to 90 c with the hotplate stirrer then the suspension was cooled at room temperature the supernatant was filtered and 100 ml of distilled water was used to wash the solid phase retained in the filter afterward the solid was placed in a crucible and oven dried at 40 c overnight the obtained products were labeled mewc for magnetic eucalyptus wood charcoal and mcsc for magnetic coconut shell charcoal respectively 2 3 characterization of the materials nitrogen sorption isotherms were obtained at 196 c using an automatic equipment asap 2020 micromeritics the raw charcoals were previously outgassed at 110 c under secondary vacuum for at least 48 h while the magnetic variants were outgassed at 80 c for at least 48 h not exceeding the synthesis temperature so as not to alter the loaded iron particles specific surface area sbet was estimated with the bet equation in the adequate pressure range as recommended by iupac cychosz and thommes 2018 thommes et al 2015 and the total pore volume v t cm3 g 1 at p p 0 0 97 the micropore volume v dr cm3 g 1 was determined from the application of the dubinin radushkevich dr equation dubinin 1989 the mesopore volume v meso cm3 g 1 was calculated as the difference between v t and v dr the morphology of the magnetic composites was studied with a transmission electron microscope cm200 philips the samples were dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath and they were further deposited on a carbon coated copper grid micrographs were taken at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv in bright field mode and acquired using a gatan orius ccd camera with an exposure time of 1 s field the particle size distribution of iron oxide was determined from these images using the software imagej rasband 1997 with n 90 particles per material x ray diffraction xrd patterns were collected using a philips pw 1710 diffractometer with cukα radiation operated at 40 kv and 30 ma with counting time 10 s step and 0 02 2θ step size the main reflections were defined and contrasted with reference patterns the scherrer equation was used to estimate the mean crystalline size of fe oxide particles 1 d h k l k λ β c o s θ where k is the shape factor 0 89 λ the cu radiation wavelength 0 154 nm and β and θ the full width at half maximum fwhm at half maximum and the diffraction angle of the reflection peak respectively x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps of the magnetic composites was performed using a thermo scientific nexsa system equipped with a monochromatic al kα x ray source e 1486 6 ev measurements were done in the constant analyzer energy mode with a spot size of 400 μm the survey spectra were taken at an energy pass of 200 ev while the high resolution hr core level spectra were taken at a 50 ev pass energy 0 100 ev step the room temperature 57fe mössbauer spectra of the magnetic variants were taken in transmission geometry using a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer of 512 channels with a 5 mci nominal activity 57co source in rh matrix the absorbers were powdered samples of a suitable thickness to apply the approximate method by montes et al 2016 that enables estimating the total fe content from the mössbauer spectra which were collected between 11 and 11 mm s 1 the hyperfine parameters are the result of fitting the data to hyperfine magnetic fields and quadrupole splitting distributions using a least squares computer code with voigt lineshape isomer shift was calibrated against an α fe foil at room temperature the high field susceptibility χhifi saturation magnetization ms coercitive field hc and remnant magnetization mr were determined from the hysteresis loops acquired in a vsm magnetometer lakeshore 7404 using external magnetic fields between 1 9 t and 1 9 t samples were supported in a diamagnetic sample holder with a negligible magnetic response 2 4 arsenic removal essays arsenic removal from aqueous solution was performed in batch conditions a fixed amount of adsorbent was weighed in amber stoppered bottles and the corresponding volume of test solution 100 μg l 1 as v ph 7 was added so as to keep a solid to liquid ratio of 5 g l 1 the tightly closed bottles were placed in a platform shaker after 24 h of contact time at room temperature 25 c the liquid and solid phases were separated with a neodymium magnet solid phases were dried at 50 c and reserved for further analysis total arsenic concentration in the liquid phase was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 7800 icp ms agilent the same procedure was repeated with natural groundwater samples gathered in october 2019 from private wells located in castelli and 9 de julio cities province of buenos aires argentina these cities are known to have high as concentrations in groundwaters litter et al 2019 the water samples were characterized using standardized procedures american public health association 2018 the as removal percentage was calculated according to equation 2 2 a s r e m o v a l c i c f c i 100 where c i is the initial as concentration μg l 1 and c f is the remaining as concentration μg l 1 after 24 h of contact time the sorption capacity q μg g 1 was calculated according to equation 3 3 q c i c f w v where v is the volume of test solution l and w is the sorbent material mass g for removal experiments two independent batch systems were performed including a control test with the test solution and no solid results are expressed as the mean of the independent experiments and plotted as mean standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 magnetic composite characterization the synthesis of magnetic particles lowered the surface area abet in comparison with that of the raw charcoals ewc and csc table 1 for ewc the surface area went from 392 m2 g 1 to 73 m2 g 1 and for csc from 1029 m2 g 1 to 836 m2 g 1 this may be related to the blockage of carbon pores by the iron particles which do not offer significant surface area themselves being lower than 20 m2 g 1 zelaya soulé et al 2021 in agreement with other magnetic carbons almeida et al 2017 cazzeta et al 2016 spessato et al 2020 however abet values for the magnetic materials resulted higher than those of other activated carbons made from biomass residues such as peanut hulls almeida et al 2017 and coconut shells cazzeta et al 2016 micropores were the major contribution to the porosity of the raw material a decrease in microporosity was observed for the composites related to the iron particles deposition on the material surface blocking the micropores connected to the surface spessato et al 2020 tem images of both composites exhibited an abundant and homogeneous surface deposit of fe oxide particles with a rhombic shape characteristic of magnetite fig 1 the particle size distribution was estimated from the tem images histograms were fitted to a normal distribution to estimate the mean particle size and the standard deviation mewc presented a mean value of 61 20 nm while mcsc presented 52 13 nm with sizes ranging between 26 and 118 nm and between 25 and 75 nm respectively the particle size range resulted narrower for mcsc than mewc indicating that fe oxide particles were more homogeneously formed on the commercial carbon probably as a consequence of a more regular surface other magnetic materials synthesized with the same procedure had a similar mean particle size barraqué et al 2018 montes et al 2020 indicating that fe oxide particle sizes do not depend strongly on the characteristics of the support material diffraction patterns in fig 2 showed differences between the carbon precursors used while csc did not display crystalline structures ewc exhibited the characteristic peaks of calcite pdf 00 047 1743 a compound that has been observed for other wood derived charcoals khanna et al 1994 the main identified calcite diffraction peaks with the corresponding miller indices were 23 04 012 29 32 104 35 92 110 39 36 113 43 08 202 47 24 024 and 018 and 48 40 116 in addition all the materials exhibited a broad peak at 2θ 22 7 characteristic of carbons and biochars which belongs to the diffraction from the conversion of the lignin cellulose crystal structure to a more amorphous structure after pyrolysis regmi et al 2012 but it decreases significantly after iron particles synthesis as observed for a magnetic douglas fir biochar karunanayake et al 2019 the magnetic composites showed the presence of iron oxides such as magnetite pdf 01 075 0033 or maghemite pdf 00 39 1346 which cannot be distinguished from each other with this technique pecharromán et al 1995 eight diffraction peaks were identified for both diffraction patterns with the following positions and miller indices 18 29 111 30 11 220 35 45 311 37 00 222 43 10 400 53 41 422 56 99 511 and 63 59 440 the most intense line is that located at 35 45 mewc also maintained the reflections that correspond to calcite the crystalline structure that is present in the precursor indicating that magnetic composite synthesis did not disturb significantly the structural properties of the precursors as also observed for montmorillonite and beidellites composites synthesized with the same procedure barraqué et al 2018 montes et al 2020 the fe oxide particles mean crystalline size was estimated using the scherrer equation equation 1 the peaks used for the estimation were 30 11 220 35 45 311 43 10 400 56 99 511 and 63 59 440 the mean value and the respective standard deviation resulted in 23 1 nm for mcsc and 21 3 nm for mewc the average particle sizes calculated considering the 4 crystallographic directions mentioned were lower than the particle size determined by tem this could indicate that the fwhm diffraction peacks corresponding to magnetite maghemite could have other contributions as microstrains and small crystallite sizes maniammal et al 2017 low resolution xps of mewc and mcsc gave information about the surface chemical composition table s1 and high resolution hr xps enabled to go deeper into the analysis of c o and fe oxidation states the low resolution xps results indicated that oxygen carbon and iron are the principal components of magnetic carbons with trace concentrations of k and ca the c1s o1s and fe2p spectra collected and fitted to gaussian curves are shown in fig 3 their binding energies fwhms and atomic percentages are included in the supplementary material tables s2 s3 and s4 in both magnetic composites c1s spectra were deconvoluted into 3 peaks which are listed in table s2 together with the corresponding parameters the fittings show the binding energies characteristic of bondings in carbonaceous structures the peak at 284 0 ev was assigned to c c and c h while the peak at 285 5 ev could be associated to c o c and c oh the binding energy peak between 290 2 and 289 4 ev corresponds to co co3 2 alchouron et al 2020 navarathna et al 2019 spessato et al 2020 it could also be associated to cooh but it is less probable given the alkaline nature of the synthesis performed o1s spectra were deconvoluted into 4 peaks which are listed in table s3 together with the corresponding parameters while the main peak at 529 66 ev is due to fe o fe fe2 o fe2 fe2 o fe3 or fe3 o fe3 the peak centered at 531 07 ev could belong to fe oh octahedral 111 plane of magnetite and c o compounds in addition the peaks at 532 38 and 533 63 ev can be related to c o fe and co3 2 cooh r navarathna et al 2019 the fe2p hr xps spectra of mewc and mcsc resulted relatively complex with many possible fittings and multiple deconvolutions the information about the proposed fittings is listed in table s4 considering that many fe compounds can contribute to the peaks observed in the xps spectra the fe phases identification attempt was completed using mössbauer spectroscopy fig 4 shows the mössbauer spectra collected for both composites table 3 exhibits the hyperfine parameters determined for each proposed fe site together with the relative spectral area the estimated total fe concentration is also presented the mössbauer spectra of both magnetic composites were fitted to two ferric paramagnetic sites fe3 two magnetic sites of hyperfine parameters similar to those of magnetite and a third magnetic environment that can be assigned to goethite the xps spectra revealed only the existence of c o and fe atoms in addition they showed that the c atoms are bound only to o atoms and not to fe ones hence the components of the mössbauer spectra can originate in fe oxides like β feooh akaganeite fe5ho8 4h2o ferrihydrite or γ feooh lepidocrocite the mössbauer spectrum of akaganeite displays two paramagnetic fe3 signals with hyperfine parameters δ 0 39 mm s 1 and δ 0 95 and δ 0 38 mm s 1 and δ 0 55 the spectrum of ferrihydrite is made up of only one fe3 singlet of δ 0 35 mm s 1 and δ 0 62 mm s 1 and that of lepidocrocite exhibits a single line of parameters δ 0 30 mm s 1 and δ 0 55 mm s 1 mccammon 1995 therefore the fe3 paramagnetic environments of mewc might belong to akaganeite but because of the overlapping lines the presence of lepidocrocite or ferrihydrite cannot be fully discarded the hyperfine parameters of fe3 paramagnetic environments corresponding to mcsc cannot be unequivocally assigned however taking into account that the sample is synthesized in the same way as mewc the observed signals might be associated to not well formed akaganeite if the identification described above is correct the three fe compounds mentioned should reveal several peaks and their respective xps spectra including their satellite peaks frau et al 2010 grosvenor et al 2004 zhang and jia 2014 thus the following peaks should be noticed in the xps spectra of ferrihydrite 724 5 732 2 710 8 and 719 3 ev peaks at 711 0 718 9 724 7 and 733 5 ev must show up for akaganeite and 711 8 ev 725 7 ev and 720 5 ev for lepidocrocite although not unambiguously because of the broadening and overlap of peaks the current mössbauer and xps results are evidence of the existence of these fe compounds in both composites considering the magnetic phases since magnetite and goethite formation was confirmed by mössbauer spectroscopy the xps spectra fitting at lower energies can be associated to the overlap of signals coming from these fe oxides magnetite 708 3 709 3 and 710 4 ev for fe2 with a satellite signal around 715 ev 710 2 711 3 712 4 and 713 6 ev for fe3 and goethite 710 2 711 2 712 1 713 2 ev with surface and satellite peaks around 714 and 720 ev respectively grosvenor et al 2004 the mössbauer results showed that although mewc and mcsc spectra displayed equivalent sites the relative areas assigned to magnetite differ taking into account the total fe concentration estimated and the rsa for both magnetite sites the approximate magnetite concentrations were roughly 81 11 g kg 1 and 108 15 g kg 1 for mcsc and mewc respectively this difference might arise from different magnetite degrees of oxidation for pure magnetite the rsa of site b should be 1 8 times that of site a vandenberghe and grave 2013 the ratio of areas for the signals assigned to magnetite in mcsc lie within the range of non oxidized magnetite mewc instead exhibited areas that depart from the ideal ratio if the current assumptions are valid the degree of oxidation of magnetite in mewc would lead to a structural formula of fe2 87o4 murad and cashion 2004 the samples also differed in the concentration of goethite that in mcsc was about twice that in mewc 20 g kg 1 and 8 g kg 1 something similar happened to the relative abundance of fe3 environments these differences might be relevant in the removal stage for pollutants that have high affinity to iron compounds such as arsenic fig 5 displays the hysteresis loops and table 3 presents the magnetic parameters extracted from them the magnetic response of the composites revealed that they can be manipulated by external magnetic fields photograph in fig 5 enabling the easy recovery from the suspension both composites revealed mr and hc values different from zero i e they have hysteresis behavior the samples are also paramagnetic with saturation not achieved even for the highest external magnetic field these results are supported by the mössbauer spectra and tem results indicating that the paramagnetic behavior may be associated to magnetite particles with sizes lower than 36 nm while the hysteresis may be originated in the magnetite particles with larger size dunlop 1973 the saturation magnetization ms is related to the attraction capacity of materials by a magnet the higher the ms value the higher the magnetic interaction mewc exhibited a ms value of 11 2 0 5 am2 kg 1 while mcsc had 10 7 0 5 am2 kg 1 the saturation magnetization of these composites resulted higher than the values achieved for magnetic natural montmorillonite barraqué et al 2018 and some synthetic beidellite montes et al 2020 subjected to the same synthesis procedure besides these values resulted lower than for magnetic activated carbons derived from coconut shells cazzeta et al 2016 and wild rice wang et al 2017b but higher than for those materials obtained from rice husks yang et al 2008 from a magnetic point of view both materials can be manipulated efficiently by an external magnetic field considering the fe environments revealed by mössbauer spectroscopy magnetite is the major responsible for the achieved saturation magnetization values the fact that both samples exhibited similar ms values despite the higher content of magnetite in mewc could be related to the different oxidation degree of magnetite spessato et al 2020 the above results indicate that the use of local eucalyptus wood subjected to a relatively easy procedure to achieve fe particle nucleation seems to be adequate for magnetic composite production 3 2 arsenic removal trials 3 2 1 synthetic water sample fig 6 shows the as sorption capacity and removal percentage of ewc csc mewc and mcsc from a synthetic water sample the nucleation of fe oxide particles onto charcoals produced a positive effect on the as removal as reported for magnetic biochars derived from bamboo residues alchouron et al 2020 timber industry waste wood navarathna et al 2019 and pinewood wang et al 2015 among others a removal efficiency increase from 7 to 99 for ewc and from 4 to 69 for csc was observed in addition a higher increase was observed for ewc than for csc the final as concentration after sorption experiments with ewc and mewc were 93 μg l 1 and 1 μg l 1 respectively while for csc and mcsc resulted in 96 μg l 1 and 31 μg l 1 only in the case of mewc the as concentration resulted lower than the who recommended drinking water limit sorption on raw charcoals may be related to the existence of carbonyl and carboxyl groups but magnetite seems to play a key role for the magnetic variants the fe and o atoms could act as lewis acids in the arsenate sorption on magnetic adsorbents and then arsenate may be sorbed selectively by inner sphere complex formation zhang et al 2010 3 2 2 natural water samples table 4 displays the physicochemical properties of the natural groundwater samples in general the sample from 9 de julio presented higher absolute values than those determined in castelli water sample except for ph ca2 and arsenic both water samples exhibit arsenic concentrations exceeding the limit established by the who 10 μg l 1 oms 2004 and the local limit of 50 μg l 1 anmat 2002 fig 6 shows the arsenic sorption capacity of the materials as well as the removal percentage from naturally contaminated groundwater samples similarly to synthetic water trials sorption capacities were higher for mewc and mcsc than for their respective raw charcoals likewise mewc presented the highest as removal capacity the adsorption efficiency of mcsc resulted satisfactorily for 9 de julio water sample considering the argentine limit but insufficient for castelli sample for which the remaining concentration was 62 μg l 1 arsenic concentration after sorption on ewc and csc remained higher than who and argentine suggested limits 102 and 97 μg l 1 for castelli sample and 78 and 76 μg l 1 for 9 de julio sample besides as remaining concentration after sorption on mewc resulted lower than the argentine limit 30 and 16 μg l 1 for castelli and 9 de julio samples respectively but higher than the who suggested limit given that mcsc had a higher surface area micropores and particle size than mewc these parameters would not account for the differences observed in as sorption in addition the total iron concentration estimated by mössbauer showed that there were no significant differences between the composites considering the experimental uncertainty table 2 the distribution of iron among the different detected phases and the level of oxidation of magnetite may explain the different performance in the removal essays in agreement with the different as affinity to fe oxides giménez et al 2007 the higher as sorption capacity of mewc than mcsc in all cases might be related to both its higher magnetite concentration and the higher oxidation degree of magnetite besides q values obtained for the water sample from castelli resulted higher than those obtained for 9 de julio this could be associated to two facts the higher as initial concentration and the lower concentration of other water constituents table 4 it is interesting to highlight that the sorption capacities of the composites were lower in natural samples than in synthetic ones this could be related to the as sorption mechanism and the presence of other anions nitrate phosphate sulfate chloride in high concentrations in the groundwater samples alchouron et al 2020 these anions could be adsorbed on magnetite sites by the mechanism proposed by zhang et al 2010 decreasing the sorption sites available for as v in particular given the chemical similarity of phosphate and arsenate the presence of the former in the natural water samples could account for the lower removal exhibited in comparison to synthetic water in fact the water sample from 9 de julio had the highest concentration of phosphate ions and the performance of the magnetic composites was diminished finally it is interesting to note that the magnetic response of the dried samples after the arsenic removal trials did not seem to change significantly table 3 this result is crucial for the later retrieval of the sorbent these results indicate that the use of natural biomass such as eucalyptus wood as raw material for the development of magnetic charcoal is possible especially in places where well established technologies are not available table 5 presents sorption capacities q μg g 1 determined on previous relevant articles a wide range of q values is observed the results achieved in this study are not directly comparable with the ones reported given the variable experimental conditions however the sorption capacity is within the reported range which indicates that the synthesized composite is a promising material for as removal from naturally polluted waters rt room temperature ci initial as concentration s l solid liquid ratio t temperature q sorption capacity for the considered initial concentration estimated from the sorption isotherms reported by the authors it must be highlighted that the immobilization of the retrieved pollutant is compatible with local ceramics production simón et al 2019 the saturated as loaded composite may be included in bricks the as presence might contribute to the sintering of the final ceramic and the decomposition of the charcoal might promote the development of pores which is a property usually achieved by the incorporation of organic matter into the brick mixture it is likely that as leaching be negligible because this type of ceramics are able to immobilize compounds in the amorphous phases and red clays used in brick production have a high iron content however further trials have to be performed to fully study the final product 4 conclusions two charcoal based composites with magnetic response were synthesized by simple procedures and tested for arsenic removal from synthetic and naturally contaminated argentine water samples the products were carefully characterized by several techniques their likely magnetic oxide composition could be derived by mössbauer spectroscopy its results indicated that the main fe oxide formed in both magnetic composites was magnetite although goethite and fe3 in paramagnetic environments like akaganeite ferrihydrite or lepidocrocite might also be present the iron content estimated with mössbauer spectroscopy was similar in both composites but the eucalyptus derived composite showed the highest magnetite concentration as well as the highest saturation magnetization which facilitates its removal after as sorption with a neodymium magnet the presence of fe oxide particles significantly enhanced the arsenic removal ability of the composites in comparison to the raw charcoals and the magnetic response of magnetic variants did not change after the arsenic sorption the magnetic composite synthesis reported here which is relatively easy inexpensive and makes use of local biomass gave promising results since after the composite s use arsenic concentrations in naturals waters were reduced from about 100 μg l 1 to less than 50 μg l 1 which is the argentine established limit for drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11896,low cost eco friendly and efficient charcoal based composites have been developed to remove arsenic from two argentine naturally contaminated groundwater samples iron compounds have been added to the charcoals both to enhance the composites sorption capacities and to provide permanent magnetization to the materials the raw charcoals one made from eucalyptus wood charcoal ewc and a commercial activated carbon csc as well as their magnetic variants mewc and mcsc respectively have been characterized by several techniques and tested for arsenic sorption in the magnetic analogues mössbauer spectroscopy enabled the identification of magnetite as the main fe oxide together with some paramagnetic fe phases and goethite the magnetization saturation values of 11 2 0 5 am2 kg 1 for mewc and 10 7 0 5 am2 kg 1 for mcsc agree with mössbauer results these saturation values indicate that it is possible to separate the sorbents from the liquid phase with an external magnetic field arsenic removal was higher for mewc than for mcsc and arsenic sorption from naturally contaminated water samples resulted lower than in the synthetic one for natural waters as residual concentrations resulted lower than 50 μg l 1 which is the limit for drinking water in argentina the satisfactory results achieved for the homemade eucalyptus derived composite indicate that it is a promising material to be used in simple technological systems for water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic charcoal fe oxides sorbent materials arsenic groundwater argentina 1 introduction environmental monitoring in argentina reveals that four million people are chronically exposed to arsenic as through drinking water and it has been documented that up to 30 of patients with arsenicosis will likely die of skin liver lung bladder stomach or pancreas cancer bardach et al 2015 the current situation demands the development of eco friendly simple and low cost as sorbents to provide potable water sources to these communities carbonaceous materials such as activated carbons charcoals and biochars derived from lignocellulosic biomass have been proposed as promising materials to remove pollutants from water danish and ahmad 2018 li et al 2017 oliveira et al 2017 shaheen et al 2019 however biomass pyrolysis and activation require specific and sophisticated equipment for instance commercial carbons are usually physically activated with steam co2 air or gas mixtures or are chemically activated by adding zinc salts koh or h3po4 adib et al 2015 b wang et al 2017a which make them expensive alternative methodologies are required to attain efficient and low cost carbonaceous sorbents and to improve their sorption capacity by modifying their internal and external surfaces supporting iron oxide particles onto carbon has proven to be an efficient way to remove pollutants such as arsenic dhanasekaran and sahu 2020 singh et al 2018 avoiding the frequent problems of agglomeration and oxidation that result from using these particles in isolation shaikh et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 also the magnetic properties that those particles confer to the composite allow quick separation from the liquid phase after the pollutant removal by applying an external magnetic field ahmad et al 2019 hu et al 2018 however the syntheses of magnetic carbons generally include multiple steps the vast majority of which involve specialized procedures and laboratory equipment like high temperature muffle furnaces with controlled n2 atmosphere reddy and lee 2014 yang et al 2008 chemical co precipitation with n2 bubbling han et al 2015 or microwave systems yap et al 2017 the aim of this paper is to synthesize a magnetic composite with a high as sorption capacity using locally available biomass and relatively easy and low cost techniques toward this goal local eucalyptus wood has been turned into charcoal using an easy and inexpensive charring system and fe oxide particles were synthesized onto the charcoal using a versatile and simple procedure a commercial carbon has been also used as contrast material in addition a thorough characterization of the synthesized composites was carried out to better understand the as removal performance being a crucial stage in the development of sorbent materials aimed at providing environmental technological solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents two carbon precursors were used for the composites synthesis one charcoal was produced from eucalyptus wood a residual biomass which is abundantly available in argentina following the procedure presented in detail in a previous work bursztyn fuentes et al 2020 the carbonization was performed inside an open kiln the fire was started with small branches diameter d about 1 cm and it was continuously fed with the addition of new larger branches d 4 cm when all the available biomass was used distilled water was poured to put out the fire the charcoal thus obtained was then filtered dried at 105 c for 48 h and labeled ewc for eucalyptus wood charcoal the other precursor was a commercial steam activated carbon clarimex s a produced from coconut shell labeled csc for coconut shell charcoal and it was used here as a contrast to the homemade charcoal both carbons were ground and sieved between mesh 30 and 60 astm to obtain particles with sizes in the range 600 250 μm the magnetic composites were synthesized using analytical grade reagents kno3 and koh 99 biopack and feso4 7h2o analytical degree cicarelli for arsenic removal tests the control synthetic solution was prepared by dilution with ultrapure water of a 1000 mg l 1 as v standard solution merck analytical grade 2 2 magnetic composite synthesis the magnetic composites were synthesized according to the method described by bartonkova et al 2007 this procedure was chosen because of its simplicity and versatility i e it allows to achieve magnetic adsorbents for the removal of pollutants with an adequate magnetic response in a reproducible way and without the need to use nitrogen gas to avoid the oxidation of materials barraqué et al 2018 2020 2021 montes et al 2020 zelaya soulé et al 2021 briefly the precursor ewc or csc was suspended in distilled water under magnetic stirring 2 5 g 425 ml water then 25 ml of feso4 7h2o 0 3 m were added and left to interact for 2 h finally 25 ml of kno3 0 49 m and 25 ml of koh 1 25 m were added sequentially and the temperature of the suspension was raised to 90 c with the hotplate stirrer then the suspension was cooled at room temperature the supernatant was filtered and 100 ml of distilled water was used to wash the solid phase retained in the filter afterward the solid was placed in a crucible and oven dried at 40 c overnight the obtained products were labeled mewc for magnetic eucalyptus wood charcoal and mcsc for magnetic coconut shell charcoal respectively 2 3 characterization of the materials nitrogen sorption isotherms were obtained at 196 c using an automatic equipment asap 2020 micromeritics the raw charcoals were previously outgassed at 110 c under secondary vacuum for at least 48 h while the magnetic variants were outgassed at 80 c for at least 48 h not exceeding the synthesis temperature so as not to alter the loaded iron particles specific surface area sbet was estimated with the bet equation in the adequate pressure range as recommended by iupac cychosz and thommes 2018 thommes et al 2015 and the total pore volume v t cm3 g 1 at p p 0 0 97 the micropore volume v dr cm3 g 1 was determined from the application of the dubinin radushkevich dr equation dubinin 1989 the mesopore volume v meso cm3 g 1 was calculated as the difference between v t and v dr the morphology of the magnetic composites was studied with a transmission electron microscope cm200 philips the samples were dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath and they were further deposited on a carbon coated copper grid micrographs were taken at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv in bright field mode and acquired using a gatan orius ccd camera with an exposure time of 1 s field the particle size distribution of iron oxide was determined from these images using the software imagej rasband 1997 with n 90 particles per material x ray diffraction xrd patterns were collected using a philips pw 1710 diffractometer with cukα radiation operated at 40 kv and 30 ma with counting time 10 s step and 0 02 2θ step size the main reflections were defined and contrasted with reference patterns the scherrer equation was used to estimate the mean crystalline size of fe oxide particles 1 d h k l k λ β c o s θ where k is the shape factor 0 89 λ the cu radiation wavelength 0 154 nm and β and θ the full width at half maximum fwhm at half maximum and the diffraction angle of the reflection peak respectively x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps of the magnetic composites was performed using a thermo scientific nexsa system equipped with a monochromatic al kα x ray source e 1486 6 ev measurements were done in the constant analyzer energy mode with a spot size of 400 μm the survey spectra were taken at an energy pass of 200 ev while the high resolution hr core level spectra were taken at a 50 ev pass energy 0 100 ev step the room temperature 57fe mössbauer spectra of the magnetic variants were taken in transmission geometry using a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer of 512 channels with a 5 mci nominal activity 57co source in rh matrix the absorbers were powdered samples of a suitable thickness to apply the approximate method by montes et al 2016 that enables estimating the total fe content from the mössbauer spectra which were collected between 11 and 11 mm s 1 the hyperfine parameters are the result of fitting the data to hyperfine magnetic fields and quadrupole splitting distributions using a least squares computer code with voigt lineshape isomer shift was calibrated against an α fe foil at room temperature the high field susceptibility χhifi saturation magnetization ms coercitive field hc and remnant magnetization mr were determined from the hysteresis loops acquired in a vsm magnetometer lakeshore 7404 using external magnetic fields between 1 9 t and 1 9 t samples were supported in a diamagnetic sample holder with a negligible magnetic response 2 4 arsenic removal essays arsenic removal from aqueous solution was performed in batch conditions a fixed amount of adsorbent was weighed in amber stoppered bottles and the corresponding volume of test solution 100 μg l 1 as v ph 7 was added so as to keep a solid to liquid ratio of 5 g l 1 the tightly closed bottles were placed in a platform shaker after 24 h of contact time at room temperature 25 c the liquid and solid phases were separated with a neodymium magnet solid phases were dried at 50 c and reserved for further analysis total arsenic concentration in the liquid phase was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 7800 icp ms agilent the same procedure was repeated with natural groundwater samples gathered in october 2019 from private wells located in castelli and 9 de julio cities province of buenos aires argentina these cities are known to have high as concentrations in groundwaters litter et al 2019 the water samples were characterized using standardized procedures american public health association 2018 the as removal percentage was calculated according to equation 2 2 a s r e m o v a l c i c f c i 100 where c i is the initial as concentration μg l 1 and c f is the remaining as concentration μg l 1 after 24 h of contact time the sorption capacity q μg g 1 was calculated according to equation 3 3 q c i c f w v where v is the volume of test solution l and w is the sorbent material mass g for removal experiments two independent batch systems were performed including a control test with the test solution and no solid results are expressed as the mean of the independent experiments and plotted as mean standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 magnetic composite characterization the synthesis of magnetic particles lowered the surface area abet in comparison with that of the raw charcoals ewc and csc table 1 for ewc the surface area went from 392 m2 g 1 to 73 m2 g 1 and for csc from 1029 m2 g 1 to 836 m2 g 1 this may be related to the blockage of carbon pores by the iron particles which do not offer significant surface area themselves being lower than 20 m2 g 1 zelaya soulé et al 2021 in agreement with other magnetic carbons almeida et al 2017 cazzeta et al 2016 spessato et al 2020 however abet values for the magnetic materials resulted higher than those of other activated carbons made from biomass residues such as peanut hulls almeida et al 2017 and coconut shells cazzeta et al 2016 micropores were the major contribution to the porosity of the raw material a decrease in microporosity was observed for the composites related to the iron particles deposition on the material surface blocking the micropores connected to the surface spessato et al 2020 tem images of both composites exhibited an abundant and homogeneous surface deposit of fe oxide particles with a rhombic shape characteristic of magnetite fig 1 the particle size distribution was estimated from the tem images histograms were fitted to a normal distribution to estimate the mean particle size and the standard deviation mewc presented a mean value of 61 20 nm while mcsc presented 52 13 nm with sizes ranging between 26 and 118 nm and between 25 and 75 nm respectively the particle size range resulted narrower for mcsc than mewc indicating that fe oxide particles were more homogeneously formed on the commercial carbon probably as a consequence of a more regular surface other magnetic materials synthesized with the same procedure had a similar mean particle size barraqué et al 2018 montes et al 2020 indicating that fe oxide particle sizes do not depend strongly on the characteristics of the support material diffraction patterns in fig 2 showed differences between the carbon precursors used while csc did not display crystalline structures ewc exhibited the characteristic peaks of calcite pdf 00 047 1743 a compound that has been observed for other wood derived charcoals khanna et al 1994 the main identified calcite diffraction peaks with the corresponding miller indices were 23 04 012 29 32 104 35 92 110 39 36 113 43 08 202 47 24 024 and 018 and 48 40 116 in addition all the materials exhibited a broad peak at 2θ 22 7 characteristic of carbons and biochars which belongs to the diffraction from the conversion of the lignin cellulose crystal structure to a more amorphous structure after pyrolysis regmi et al 2012 but it decreases significantly after iron particles synthesis as observed for a magnetic douglas fir biochar karunanayake et al 2019 the magnetic composites showed the presence of iron oxides such as magnetite pdf 01 075 0033 or maghemite pdf 00 39 1346 which cannot be distinguished from each other with this technique pecharromán et al 1995 eight diffraction peaks were identified for both diffraction patterns with the following positions and miller indices 18 29 111 30 11 220 35 45 311 37 00 222 43 10 400 53 41 422 56 99 511 and 63 59 440 the most intense line is that located at 35 45 mewc also maintained the reflections that correspond to calcite the crystalline structure that is present in the precursor indicating that magnetic composite synthesis did not disturb significantly the structural properties of the precursors as also observed for montmorillonite and beidellites composites synthesized with the same procedure barraqué et al 2018 montes et al 2020 the fe oxide particles mean crystalline size was estimated using the scherrer equation equation 1 the peaks used for the estimation were 30 11 220 35 45 311 43 10 400 56 99 511 and 63 59 440 the mean value and the respective standard deviation resulted in 23 1 nm for mcsc and 21 3 nm for mewc the average particle sizes calculated considering the 4 crystallographic directions mentioned were lower than the particle size determined by tem this could indicate that the fwhm diffraction peacks corresponding to magnetite maghemite could have other contributions as microstrains and small crystallite sizes maniammal et al 2017 low resolution xps of mewc and mcsc gave information about the surface chemical composition table s1 and high resolution hr xps enabled to go deeper into the analysis of c o and fe oxidation states the low resolution xps results indicated that oxygen carbon and iron are the principal components of magnetic carbons with trace concentrations of k and ca the c1s o1s and fe2p spectra collected and fitted to gaussian curves are shown in fig 3 their binding energies fwhms and atomic percentages are included in the supplementary material tables s2 s3 and s4 in both magnetic composites c1s spectra were deconvoluted into 3 peaks which are listed in table s2 together with the corresponding parameters the fittings show the binding energies characteristic of bondings in carbonaceous structures the peak at 284 0 ev was assigned to c c and c h while the peak at 285 5 ev could be associated to c o c and c oh the binding energy peak between 290 2 and 289 4 ev corresponds to co co3 2 alchouron et al 2020 navarathna et al 2019 spessato et al 2020 it could also be associated to cooh but it is less probable given the alkaline nature of the synthesis performed o1s spectra were deconvoluted into 4 peaks which are listed in table s3 together with the corresponding parameters while the main peak at 529 66 ev is due to fe o fe fe2 o fe2 fe2 o fe3 or fe3 o fe3 the peak centered at 531 07 ev could belong to fe oh octahedral 111 plane of magnetite and c o compounds in addition the peaks at 532 38 and 533 63 ev can be related to c o fe and co3 2 cooh r navarathna et al 2019 the fe2p hr xps spectra of mewc and mcsc resulted relatively complex with many possible fittings and multiple deconvolutions the information about the proposed fittings is listed in table s4 considering that many fe compounds can contribute to the peaks observed in the xps spectra the fe phases identification attempt was completed using mössbauer spectroscopy fig 4 shows the mössbauer spectra collected for both composites table 3 exhibits the hyperfine parameters determined for each proposed fe site together with the relative spectral area the estimated total fe concentration is also presented the mössbauer spectra of both magnetic composites were fitted to two ferric paramagnetic sites fe3 two magnetic sites of hyperfine parameters similar to those of magnetite and a third magnetic environment that can be assigned to goethite the xps spectra revealed only the existence of c o and fe atoms in addition they showed that the c atoms are bound only to o atoms and not to fe ones hence the components of the mössbauer spectra can originate in fe oxides like β feooh akaganeite fe5ho8 4h2o ferrihydrite or γ feooh lepidocrocite the mössbauer spectrum of akaganeite displays two paramagnetic fe3 signals with hyperfine parameters δ 0 39 mm s 1 and δ 0 95 and δ 0 38 mm s 1 and δ 0 55 the spectrum of ferrihydrite is made up of only one fe3 singlet of δ 0 35 mm s 1 and δ 0 62 mm s 1 and that of lepidocrocite exhibits a single line of parameters δ 0 30 mm s 1 and δ 0 55 mm s 1 mccammon 1995 therefore the fe3 paramagnetic environments of mewc might belong to akaganeite but because of the overlapping lines the presence of lepidocrocite or ferrihydrite cannot be fully discarded the hyperfine parameters of fe3 paramagnetic environments corresponding to mcsc cannot be unequivocally assigned however taking into account that the sample is synthesized in the same way as mewc the observed signals might be associated to not well formed akaganeite if the identification described above is correct the three fe compounds mentioned should reveal several peaks and their respective xps spectra including their satellite peaks frau et al 2010 grosvenor et al 2004 zhang and jia 2014 thus the following peaks should be noticed in the xps spectra of ferrihydrite 724 5 732 2 710 8 and 719 3 ev peaks at 711 0 718 9 724 7 and 733 5 ev must show up for akaganeite and 711 8 ev 725 7 ev and 720 5 ev for lepidocrocite although not unambiguously because of the broadening and overlap of peaks the current mössbauer and xps results are evidence of the existence of these fe compounds in both composites considering the magnetic phases since magnetite and goethite formation was confirmed by mössbauer spectroscopy the xps spectra fitting at lower energies can be associated to the overlap of signals coming from these fe oxides magnetite 708 3 709 3 and 710 4 ev for fe2 with a satellite signal around 715 ev 710 2 711 3 712 4 and 713 6 ev for fe3 and goethite 710 2 711 2 712 1 713 2 ev with surface and satellite peaks around 714 and 720 ev respectively grosvenor et al 2004 the mössbauer results showed that although mewc and mcsc spectra displayed equivalent sites the relative areas assigned to magnetite differ taking into account the total fe concentration estimated and the rsa for both magnetite sites the approximate magnetite concentrations were roughly 81 11 g kg 1 and 108 15 g kg 1 for mcsc and mewc respectively this difference might arise from different magnetite degrees of oxidation for pure magnetite the rsa of site b should be 1 8 times that of site a vandenberghe and grave 2013 the ratio of areas for the signals assigned to magnetite in mcsc lie within the range of non oxidized magnetite mewc instead exhibited areas that depart from the ideal ratio if the current assumptions are valid the degree of oxidation of magnetite in mewc would lead to a structural formula of fe2 87o4 murad and cashion 2004 the samples also differed in the concentration of goethite that in mcsc was about twice that in mewc 20 g kg 1 and 8 g kg 1 something similar happened to the relative abundance of fe3 environments these differences might be relevant in the removal stage for pollutants that have high affinity to iron compounds such as arsenic fig 5 displays the hysteresis loops and table 3 presents the magnetic parameters extracted from them the magnetic response of the composites revealed that they can be manipulated by external magnetic fields photograph in fig 5 enabling the easy recovery from the suspension both composites revealed mr and hc values different from zero i e they have hysteresis behavior the samples are also paramagnetic with saturation not achieved even for the highest external magnetic field these results are supported by the mössbauer spectra and tem results indicating that the paramagnetic behavior may be associated to magnetite particles with sizes lower than 36 nm while the hysteresis may be originated in the magnetite particles with larger size dunlop 1973 the saturation magnetization ms is related to the attraction capacity of materials by a magnet the higher the ms value the higher the magnetic interaction mewc exhibited a ms value of 11 2 0 5 am2 kg 1 while mcsc had 10 7 0 5 am2 kg 1 the saturation magnetization of these composites resulted higher than the values achieved for magnetic natural montmorillonite barraqué et al 2018 and some synthetic beidellite montes et al 2020 subjected to the same synthesis procedure besides these values resulted lower than for magnetic activated carbons derived from coconut shells cazzeta et al 2016 and wild rice wang et al 2017b but higher than for those materials obtained from rice husks yang et al 2008 from a magnetic point of view both materials can be manipulated efficiently by an external magnetic field considering the fe environments revealed by mössbauer spectroscopy magnetite is the major responsible for the achieved saturation magnetization values the fact that both samples exhibited similar ms values despite the higher content of magnetite in mewc could be related to the different oxidation degree of magnetite spessato et al 2020 the above results indicate that the use of local eucalyptus wood subjected to a relatively easy procedure to achieve fe particle nucleation seems to be adequate for magnetic composite production 3 2 arsenic removal trials 3 2 1 synthetic water sample fig 6 shows the as sorption capacity and removal percentage of ewc csc mewc and mcsc from a synthetic water sample the nucleation of fe oxide particles onto charcoals produced a positive effect on the as removal as reported for magnetic biochars derived from bamboo residues alchouron et al 2020 timber industry waste wood navarathna et al 2019 and pinewood wang et al 2015 among others a removal efficiency increase from 7 to 99 for ewc and from 4 to 69 for csc was observed in addition a higher increase was observed for ewc than for csc the final as concentration after sorption experiments with ewc and mewc were 93 μg l 1 and 1 μg l 1 respectively while for csc and mcsc resulted in 96 μg l 1 and 31 μg l 1 only in the case of mewc the as concentration resulted lower than the who recommended drinking water limit sorption on raw charcoals may be related to the existence of carbonyl and carboxyl groups but magnetite seems to play a key role for the magnetic variants the fe and o atoms could act as lewis acids in the arsenate sorption on magnetic adsorbents and then arsenate may be sorbed selectively by inner sphere complex formation zhang et al 2010 3 2 2 natural water samples table 4 displays the physicochemical properties of the natural groundwater samples in general the sample from 9 de julio presented higher absolute values than those determined in castelli water sample except for ph ca2 and arsenic both water samples exhibit arsenic concentrations exceeding the limit established by the who 10 μg l 1 oms 2004 and the local limit of 50 μg l 1 anmat 2002 fig 6 shows the arsenic sorption capacity of the materials as well as the removal percentage from naturally contaminated groundwater samples similarly to synthetic water trials sorption capacities were higher for mewc and mcsc than for their respective raw charcoals likewise mewc presented the highest as removal capacity the adsorption efficiency of mcsc resulted satisfactorily for 9 de julio water sample considering the argentine limit but insufficient for castelli sample for which the remaining concentration was 62 μg l 1 arsenic concentration after sorption on ewc and csc remained higher than who and argentine suggested limits 102 and 97 μg l 1 for castelli sample and 78 and 76 μg l 1 for 9 de julio sample besides as remaining concentration after sorption on mewc resulted lower than the argentine limit 30 and 16 μg l 1 for castelli and 9 de julio samples respectively but higher than the who suggested limit given that mcsc had a higher surface area micropores and particle size than mewc these parameters would not account for the differences observed in as sorption in addition the total iron concentration estimated by mössbauer showed that there were no significant differences between the composites considering the experimental uncertainty table 2 the distribution of iron among the different detected phases and the level of oxidation of magnetite may explain the different performance in the removal essays in agreement with the different as affinity to fe oxides giménez et al 2007 the higher as sorption capacity of mewc than mcsc in all cases might be related to both its higher magnetite concentration and the higher oxidation degree of magnetite besides q values obtained for the water sample from castelli resulted higher than those obtained for 9 de julio this could be associated to two facts the higher as initial concentration and the lower concentration of other water constituents table 4 it is interesting to highlight that the sorption capacities of the composites were lower in natural samples than in synthetic ones this could be related to the as sorption mechanism and the presence of other anions nitrate phosphate sulfate chloride in high concentrations in the groundwater samples alchouron et al 2020 these anions could be adsorbed on magnetite sites by the mechanism proposed by zhang et al 2010 decreasing the sorption sites available for as v in particular given the chemical similarity of phosphate and arsenate the presence of the former in the natural water samples could account for the lower removal exhibited in comparison to synthetic water in fact the water sample from 9 de julio had the highest concentration of phosphate ions and the performance of the magnetic composites was diminished finally it is interesting to note that the magnetic response of the dried samples after the arsenic removal trials did not seem to change significantly table 3 this result is crucial for the later retrieval of the sorbent these results indicate that the use of natural biomass such as eucalyptus wood as raw material for the development of magnetic charcoal is possible especially in places where well established technologies are not available table 5 presents sorption capacities q μg g 1 determined on previous relevant articles a wide range of q values is observed the results achieved in this study are not directly comparable with the ones reported given the variable experimental conditions however the sorption capacity is within the reported range which indicates that the synthesized composite is a promising material for as removal from naturally polluted waters rt room temperature ci initial as concentration s l solid liquid ratio t temperature q sorption capacity for the considered initial concentration estimated from the sorption isotherms reported by the authors it must be highlighted that the immobilization of the retrieved pollutant is compatible with local ceramics production simón et al 2019 the saturated as loaded composite may be included in bricks the as presence might contribute to the sintering of the final ceramic and the decomposition of the charcoal might promote the development of pores which is a property usually achieved by the incorporation of organic matter into the brick mixture it is likely that as leaching be negligible because this type of ceramics are able to immobilize compounds in the amorphous phases and red clays used in brick production have a high iron content however further trials have to be performed to fully study the final product 4 conclusions two charcoal based composites with magnetic response were synthesized by simple procedures and tested for arsenic removal from synthetic and naturally contaminated argentine water samples the products were carefully characterized by several techniques their likely magnetic oxide composition could be derived by mössbauer spectroscopy its results indicated that the main fe oxide formed in both magnetic composites was magnetite although goethite and fe3 in paramagnetic environments like akaganeite ferrihydrite or lepidocrocite might also be present the iron content estimated with mössbauer spectroscopy was similar in both composites but the eucalyptus derived composite showed the highest magnetite concentration as well as the highest saturation magnetization which facilitates its removal after as sorption with a neodymium magnet the presence of fe oxide particles significantly enhanced the arsenic removal ability of the composites in comparison to the raw charcoals and the magnetic response of magnetic variants did not change after the arsenic sorption the magnetic composite synthesis reported here which is relatively easy inexpensive and makes use of local biomass gave promising results since after the composite s use arsenic concentrations in naturals waters were reduced from about 100 μg l 1 to less than 50 μg l 1 which is the argentine established limit for drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11897,groundwater is the most important and valuable water resource in arid and semi arid regions nevertheless the high salinity of these resources remains the major constraint to remedy this problem the present study aims to investigate and develop a novel sustainable solar desalination technology a passive and active single slope solar still combined with phase change material pcm for the thermal energy storage system have been numerically modeled and simulated the active system has been made by coupling passive solar still with a parabolic trough collector ptc via a heat exchanger as an external heat source for each desalination system a flat absorber and others with corrugated surfaces rectangular triangular and spherical were tested to compare their performances and the effect of absorber shape on both passive and active systems conservation equations of the two models were solved using comsol multiphysics software simulation results showed that for the passive system the corrugated surface with rectangular ripples increases pure water productivity by 109 and 42 by comparison with the conventional distiller and the distiller with an absorber of flatform with storage system respectively furthermore it was revealed that solar still integrated with ptc and modified by different absorber geometry has higher freshwater productivity of 15 39 and 15 01 kg m2 day compared to 2 37 and 2 11 kg m2 day for the passive still by using rectangular and spherical absorbers respectively consequently the percentage improvement of the developed active system is about 549 36 and 611 37 respectively from this investigation it is observed that the passive solar still with rectangular absorber is the most suitable for household use however by coupling ptc to the modified passive solar still with rectangular absorber configuration we have the appropriate design for industrial applications such as hospitals irrigation processes for agricultural greenhouses in arid and semi arid regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination solar still sustainability absorber shape parabolic through collector daily productivity comsol multiphysics 1 introduction the water demand in the world is extremely increasing particularly in the southern mediterranean periphery arid and semi arid zones cover a large part of several countries where the use of groundwater is recommended through which freshwater is produced lyazidi et al 2020 however in many parts of the world groundwater is not suitable for direct consumption thus most of the water extracted from groundwater reserves has a salinity varying between 1 and 10 g l tahiri et al 2020 mastrocicco et al 2021 in fact to meet the growing need for fresh pure and clean drinking water much research has been conducted to find suitable methods and processes to treat or desalinate brackish groundwater therefore solar desalination technology is considered a strategic option and suitable solution for satisfying water demand the use of sustainable sources to produce purified water remains an ecological and economical solution especially for poor countries extensive researches show clearly that technological advancements afford a means of developing new and highly efficient desalination processes kalogirou 2014 1 1 passive solar still with different basin modification particular attention has been paid to various types of solar still with tremendous studies incorporating several innovative technologies indeed many studies were carried out on different basin solar still configurations including single slope double slope multi effect distillation systems panchal et al 2020a jobrane et al 2020 muthu manokar et al 2020a sathyamurthy et al 2017 yousef and hassan 2019 hamed et al 2016 gang et al 2019 singh and tiwari 2017 therefore various modified designs and parameters were suggested to augment the productivity of freshwater el sebaii et al el sebaii et al 2015 el sebaii and el naggar 2017 investigated theoretically and experimentally effects of dimensions fins height and thickness and also those of fabrication material type on single basin solar still performances manokar and winston manokar and winston 2017a 2017b developed experimentally single slope solar still with fins and acrylic sheets as a new material to reduce the loss of heat from the still to the bottom panchal et al 2020b check the performance of passive solar still with vertical and inclined fins it has been found that the increment yield of 26 77 and 24 19 obtained by inclined and vertical fins as compared with traditional solar still samuel hansen and kalidasa murugavel samuel hansen and kalidasa murugavel 2017 conducted an experimental study of a new hybrid desalination system with three different absorber configurations flat grooved and fin shape by integrating still with hot water thermal storage it can be concluded that the highest daily distillate output of 9 72 ℓ was registered by using the fin shape absorber jani and modi 2019 tested experimentally a double slope single basin solar still with circular and square cross sectional hollow fins it was registered that the productivity of freshwater using circular fins increase by 54 22 compared to square fins solar still and for the basin water depth of 10 mm in other works manokar et al 2020b developed experimentally a novel design of inclined solar still with photovoltaic pv panel as an absorber plate the effect of different masse flow rates was investigated and tested to enhance productivity it was revealed that an increase in flow rate has a negative impact on the performance of inclined pv panel solar still 1 2 different types of active solar still to enhance the productivity of pure water some researchers developed the solar desalination systems by integrating additional thermal sources particularly heat storage systems and or concentrated solar power csp units via a heat exchanger pv panel pansal et al 2020 dudul et al 2020 hafs et al 2018 in this context park et al 2016 evaluated experimentally the performance of hybrid solar still with simpler seawater feeding devices using dual heat sources of solar thermal energy and waste heat in optimum operating conditions this study showed that productivity increases by increasing heat input to 18 02 kg m2 at a waste heat amount of 22 37 mj day bhargva and yadav 2019a examined and compared experimentally the combined solar still with evacuated tubes and a heat exchanger at different water depths 4 5 and 6 cm their results showed that the daily efficiency of 30 5 achieved by using 4 cm water depth in their other research work bhargva and yadav 2019b reported that the maximum daily freshwater productivity is 2 114 ℓ d a y for the case of ½ shading and cooling of glass cover which means an increase of 16 4 for the previous system compared to solar still without glass cover shading and cooling rahbar and esfahani rahbar and esfahani 2012 developed experimentally a novel portable solar still by utilizing heat pipe cooling and thermoelectric module it was concluded that this combination gives a maximum daily efficiency of 7 moreover kabeel and abdelgaied 2017a assessed experimentally modified solar still with heat exchanger and pcm connected with cylindrical parabolic concentrator as the external heat source a comparison between modified solar still and a conventional one is carried out to investigate the influences of high heat exchanger oil temperature on the performance of developed solar still also hassan et al 2019 proposed an experimentally new design of double acting solar still combined with tracked parabolic trough collector tptc they studied the effect of three media in the basin only pure saline water saline water with steel wire mesh and sand saturated with saline water on the productivity of modified solar still with tptc it was concluded that using mesh and send with saline water increase the efficiency by 3 3 and 15 3 respectively in summer days and by 3 9 and 13 8 in winter bahrami et al 2019 developed a new design of the active solar still coupled to a solar dish concentrator a parametric study was performed in this work structural optical and operational parameters are taken into account from the results of the current model it was deduced that with an aperture of 2 m when parabolic dish optical efficiency increases from 0 5 to 0 8 and the absorber plate reflectivity reduces from 0 7 to 0 4 the distilled water produced increases up to 120 and 80 respectively muraleedharan et al 2019 studied the thermal performance of modified active solar still employing absorbing therminol 55 as heat transfer fluid with al2o3 nanoparticles nhtf and fresnel lens concentrator the productivity was increased by 250 27 than conventional still with 0 1 volumetric concentration of al2o3 in nhtf 1 3 solar still with heat storage medium performances of all the technologies mentioned above could be promoted by using innovative designs or combining them with storage systems nanofluids fins indeed el sebaii et al 2009 developed as a first step single basin solar still by integrating a thin layer of stearic acid phase change storage material to act as a heat source during the night it was concluded that the daily efficiency registered is 9 005 kg m2 day for the modified solar still compared to 4 998 kg m2 day without pcm for the same goals ansari et al 2013 presented a numerical study by integrating three kinds of pcm paraffin c18 paraffin 52 54 paraffin wax as a storage medium it has essentially been deduced that using heat energy storage ameliorates the efficiency of the solar desalination system and depends closely on the maximum value of the daily brackish water temperature reached furthermore the results of this last research work were undertaken by asbik et al 2016 for a numerical study of exergy losses during the charging discharging periods cheng et al 2019 highlighted experimentally and numerically the performance of a solar still by applying a new shape stabilized phase change material sspcm with high solar absorption and high thermal conductivity it was concluded that the daily productivity of solar still with sspcm was 43 3 higher than that of conventional solar still without sspcm further the performance of solar stills was investigated with the use of nanofluids so sahota et al sahota and tiwari 2016 used the nanofluid made by mixing aluminum oxide al2o3 nanoparticles with saline water to raise the pure water productivity in passive double slope solar still as a result productivity increases by 12 2 and 8 4 for water masses of 35 and 80 kg respectively in the next step they modeled the effect of integrating three nanoparticles al2o3 cuo and tio2 in saline water for the active dual slope solar still they founded that the thermal and exergy efficiencies of the solar still were maximized by using al2o3 sahota et al 2017 mahian et al 2017 investigated experimentally and theoretically the performance of solar still using two types of nanofluids as a working fluid in the heat exchanger integrated into the bottom of the basin liner the results reveal that the performance indices were raised by 10 kabeel et al 2017b reported that using nanofluids in solar still coupled with an external condenser and also providing low pressure to increase the daily efficiency also hafs et al 2019a b and el kaddadi et al 2017 studied the performance analysis of single slope solar still by implementing fins on the absorber surface and using the specific nanofluid brackish water cu2o their results showed that daily productivity increases by 20 for the modified single slope solar still ssss with fins and nanofluid because of the high thermal conductivity of cu2o 76 5 w m k and by 12 6 for the modifier solar still with fins compared to the conventional solar still afterward patel et al 2020 examined experimentally the performance of conventional triple basin solar still with evacuated heat pipes corrugated sheets and storage materials distillate yield of the lower basin of the developed system in both storage materials granite gravel and pebbles was found higher as compared with the middle and upper basin otherwise most researchers focused on the use of different storage materials such as nanoparticles and pcm as well as the integration of external heat sources however there is a lack of research work on absorber shape effects on a passive and an active system in the southeast of morocco the issue of saltwater is an extremely common phenomenon that influences the quality of water resources as a result the fertility of agricultural soils tahiri et al 2020 however it is important to note that solar power is undeniably one of the most important sources of renewable energy in morocco with well over 3000 h year of sunshine the equivalent of the radiance of about 55 kwh ft2 day halimi et al 2018 in the present work and based on the above analysis the main objective is to provide the necessary water supply to underserved and water stressed communities and sustainably protect the environment using renewable solar energy emitting zero carbon emissions and zero liquid discharge in fact a passive and active single slope solar still which were combined with a pcm storage system have been numerically modeled and simulated under the climatic conditions of rabat city morocco the active system has been made by coupling passive solar still with a ptc via a heat exchanger as an external heat source for each desalination system a flat absorber and others with corrugated surfaces rectangular triangular and spherical were tested to compare their performances the effect of absorber shape on each desalination system has been highlighted and a comparative study was conducted between the passive and the active solar stills 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the system to embrace solar desalination technologies in water scarce countries and factors that influence desalinate brackish groundwater we developed a novel design with different absorber configurations to select the appropriate geometry for productivity enhancement in this goal passive solar still with corrugated absorber shapes see table 1 coupled with pcm heat storage system is considered fig 1 these shapes are designed in such a way that they contain the same volume of pcm accordingly the passive solar still system consists of 1 m2 of surface area covered by inclined glass and insulated from all sides by 5 cm of foam to minimize heat losses the basin of the desalination system is connected to the water tank to keep the mass of water constant 40 kg the absorber is located at the bottom of the basin liner above the storage material the desalination system using different absorber shapes is oriented in the south direction to receive the maximum solar radiation during sunshine hours a part of solar radiation has been reflected from the external surface of the glass cover however maximum intensity is transmitted through the transparent condensing glass cover and saline water and then the basin liner to be transferred by conduction to the pcm and be stored as sensible heat and or latent heat when the melting temperature is reached absorbs it moreover convection transfer of thermal energy is taken place between the absorber and brackish water and hence the temperature difference between saline water and glass cover increases as a result pure water is gotten by condensation process on the inner glass cover surface area as shown in fig 2 the above modified solar still is connected to the ptc through a heat exchanger which is placed at the bottom of the water and in contact with the basin liner surface fig 2a the used receiver tube is composed of an absorber transporting and realizing heat surrounded by a specific glass envelope with 3 8 cm of inner diameter fig 2b and c the absorber made of copper with a diameter of 1 9 cm and a length of 2 m has an outer selective coating surface appropriate to provide the required radiative and optical properties to minimize heat losses and to protect the absorber surface against oxidation a vacuum is created between the glass envelope and the absorber tube a part of the solar energy absorbed by the received tube is transferred to the heat transfer fluid htf by convection and conduction whereas the rest of the energy is transferred back to the glass envelope surface by radiation and natural convection the energy transported by the oil is released to the desalination system and yields it to the saline water through the heat exchanger which is fabricated from a copper pipe of 9 514 m in length and 1 cm diameter the oil flow rate has the value of 6 ℓ min at the pipe inlet and the properties of ptc and heat exchanger used in the present study are listed in table a1 see appendix 2 2 formulation of the problem the passive and the active solar systems described above were used to raise the yield and productivity of pure water a dynamic 3d model of heat transfer with source terms was used for both systems the following assumptions have been made each solar still component is considered as a lumped system thermo physical properties are taken constant the system is insulated on all outer surfaces except the glass cover thermal contact is supposed perfect between the storage material pcm and the absorber thermal convection within the pcm liquid phase is assumed to be negligible and for the active system amount heat released by the heat exchanger is entirely received by the brackish water accordingly the heat balance equation can be written for each system component as follows 1 ρ i e i c p i t i t q i t the subscript i and q i t refer respectively to each solar still component and heat flux densities exchanged with its surroundings see table 2 2 2 1 identification of heat exchanges various involved heat exchanges are summarized in table 2 they are essentially composed of heat flux densities exchanged between each component and its surroundings those quantities which govern energy balance equations will be identified in the subsections above were q g t q w t q b t and q p c m t are heat flux densities for glass cover brackish water absorber and pcm q c o n d q c o n v and q r a d are the conductive convective and radiative heat flux densities q e x c h w is the heat flux between the heat exchanger and brackish water α g α

the glass cover involve internal and external heat transfer it received incident solar radiations α g g t and exchanges heat with its surrounding area especially the ambient air and the sky in fact a part of heat q c o n d is transferred by conduction from the outer to the inner surface of the glass cover whereas other amounts are respectively lost by convection q c o n v g a and radiation q r a d

between glass ambient and radiative heat transfer coefficient between glass sky 2 2 3 heat transfer in brackish water in this fundamental component area an important fraction of solar energy is absorbed τ g α w g t additionally convective heat transfer takes place simultaneously between brackish water and its neighboring solar still components namely absorber q c o n v b w and condensing glass cover surface q w g a temperature difference between the brackish water surface and the inner glass cover entails a water evaporation process q e v a p besides in the case of the active system the serpentine heat exchanger placed at the bottom of the water is considered as an additional heat source of the solar still that transfers q e x c h w to the water finally heat flux densities that support heat transfer processes relative to the brackish water are 3 q c o n v b w h c o n v b w t b t w q w g h w g t w t g q e x c h w q c p o i l a w t i e x c h t e e x c h where h w g h r a d w g

and convection q c o n v b w to the pcm and brackish water respectively the use of different absorber designs would promote heat transfer exchanges 2 2 5 heat transfer in pcm the heat balance equation that governs the thermal behavior inside the used pcm is given by sharifi et al 2015 4 ρ p c m c p p c m t p c m t q p c m t where 5 ρ p c m θ ρ s 1 θ ρ l 6 c p p c m 1 ρ θ ρ s c p s 1 θ ρ l c p l l p

phase and 0 in the liquid phase whereas 0 θ 1 during phase change furthermore the mass fraction of solid pcm can be expressed as 7 α m 1 2 1 θ ρ l θ ρ s θ ρ s 1 θ ρ l the thermal csp model concerns the energy balance of each component of csp system namely htf glass envelope and absorber tube the direct normal irradiance dni is included in energy balance equations when it is needed in this section the model is investigated and developed under the following assumptions related to the active system the oil htf flow rate is constant at the inlet of absorber pipe thermophysical properties are constant and the htf is non isothermal oil flow through a htf pipe is laminar the contact between absorber tube and htf is assumed perfect and the optical losses due to imperfections in the collector mirrors tracking errors shading and mirrors cleanliness are neglected 2 2 6 glass envelope in this important component the heat conduction equation is given by 8 ρ g e c p g e t g e t k g e

active are assumed to have a uniform initial temperature value t 0 regarding the passive solar still it is not concerned by boundary conditions because it is considered as a lumped system the biot number bi 0 1 at any time t 0 for the solar receiver tube of parabolic trough collector the htf inlet flow rate is a constant value of 6 ℓ min and a specific pressure was given at the outlet pgage 0 at the tube wall the no slip condition is imposed and boundary conditions relative to perfect contact between two media are also required as illustrated in fig 3 all the outside boundaries of the active system are exposed to ambient environmental conditions 2 4 mesh generation comsol multiphysics is a commercial solver and simulation software based on the finite element method which has appropriate criteria to generate the best suited mesh the most adequate mesh ensuring the convergence of numerical solutions was adopted for this simulation study which consisted of 48 260 free tetrahedral elements in the case of the passive solar still and 233 784 elements for the ptc 3 results and discussion our aim within this framework outline is to study the effect of the developed passive and active solar still designs on productivity enhancement besides desalination of brackish groundwater mw 40 kg was conducted with two desalination systems passive and active with the integration of different absorber surfaces namely flat plate and other wavy shapes rectangular triangular and spherical they could enhance heat transfer between the absorber and brackish water since the heat exchange surface has been increased also these physical models figs 1 and 2 contain 11 34 kg of paraffin c18 pcm used as a storage material first and foremost climatic operating and simulation conditions should be specified and mathematical models must be validated 3 1 climatic operating and simulation conditions to perform this study it is fundamental to have meteorological data at any given time for the considered site which is rabat city lat 34 00 47 n long 6 49 57 w these data namely global solar irradiation g t and ambient temperature ta t were measured experimentally by the sma sunny web box measuring instrument installed on the roof of erte laboratory at the ensam mohammed v university in rabat as for the dni t used for the simulation of ptc it was calculated from empirical correlations found in the literature see the appendix on a typical day june 15th 2017 the aforementioned meteorological data are shown in fig 4 whereas thermophysical properties of used materials solar still component thicknesses and its dimensions are given in tables a2 and a3 see the appendix 3 2 validation of the current model to validate the mathematical model associated with each solar distillation system it is necessary to compare its results to those available in the literature el sebaii et al 2009 2015 kabeel and abdelgaied 2017 and abdel rehim and lasheen 2007 firstly results corresponding to the passive system were compared to experimental measurements of el sebaii et al el sebaii et al 2009 2015 obviously this comparison confirmed the accuracy of the proposed model since the relative error does not exceed 7 fig 5 a and c regarding the validation of the desalination active system model fig 5b and d correlates simulation results of htf synthetic oil obtained with comsol multiphysics software and those of kabeel and abdelgaied abdel rehim and lasheen kabeel and abdelgaied 2017 abdel rehim and lasheen 2007 carried out experimentally the discrepancy between these results is around 15 28 in the worst case but it remains acceptable for the validation of the active system model 3 3 passive solar still this section is reserved for the passive solar still with four absorber shapes first of all the dissipation of global incident solar radiation during sunshine hours inside the whole system is illustrated in the case of absorber rectangular shape fig 6 the initial temperature of the system is considered to be 19 8 c in the early hours of june 15 2017 a small portion of solar irradiation is absorbed by the glass cover because of its lower coefficient of absorptivity αg 0 05 the power of solar energy transmitted through the inclined glass and saline water is captured by the absorber copper for his part it transfers heat by thermal conduction to the pcm for storage in the form of sensible and latent heat moreover the absorber gives off a substantial amount of heat and can act as a secondary source of water heating consequently the transport of water particles takes place instantaneously by free convection which is assumed to be laminar during the night of this typical day the storage medium pcm provides heat to the passive solar still on the other hand fig 7 shows temporal temperature variation of pcm at chosen times so the rectangular shape of the absorber contributes to improving the heat transfer between the storage medium and the absorber for the same reason that has been highlighted previously now let us turn to the main numerical results comparing performances of the proposed physical models and conventional desalination systems figures presented here versus time figs 8 10 are essentially temperatures heat transfer coefficients and freshwater productivity thus fig 8a shows temperature variation inside the brackish water and storage material pcm whereas fig 8b displays the temperature difference between the saline water and internal glass cover tw tg for each absorber shape which is the main responsible for evaporation and hence pure water productivity furthermore temporal variations of these graphical representations are virtually identical except for the case without storage conventional system a passive system without pcm they illustrate that temperatures follow solar irradiation variation and their respective peak values were localized around 2 p m it can be observed that for the first hours of the day temperatures increase gradually for all configurations and decrease slowly in the evening hours these last results fig 8a and b allow us to get to explain the effect of absorber shape on the behavior of the solar distiller component temperatures as well as the desalinated water production in the thermal point of view curves of evaporative heat transfer coefficient hevap and convective heat transfer coefficient between the absorber and saline water hconv b w are respectively displayed in fig 9a b and their expressions are given in the appendix from the five curves of fig 9a it is clearly seen that the evaporative heat transfer coefficient follows practically the same variation that tw tg since they are dependent see the appendix as for the heat transfer coefficient hconv b w fig 9b the influence of absorber shape is only significant during discharging period night time and the triangular ripples seem to generate the best possible heat exchange with fluid water this result can be confirmed by the fluid motion represented by free convection velocity v w g l β t b t w fig 9b which is globally the most important in the case of absorber triangular form this is mainly due to the production of free convection cells asbik et al 2002 2005 in the final analysis the productivity of instantaneous and daily pure water productivity are respectively defined by the following formula 17 p h h e w g t w t g 3600 l w 18 p d p h the effect of using different absorber shapes on instantaneous productivity is summarized in fig 10a which shows that pure water production behavior is identical to that of h evap in the daytime the relative deviation between different curves and that of conventional solar still is depicted in fig 10b accordingly it seems that rectangular absorber permits to produce more desalinated brackish water fig 10b this result is certified by the comparison given in table 3 and also by fig 10a in which the daily productivity concerning absorber shapes is presented it has been shown that the corrugated surface with rectangular shape contributes to increasing the passive solar still performance by 109 and 41 86 relative to conventional distiller cv and to that of absorber flat form with storage system fl respectively to further highlight the feasibility of the proposed design a comparison has been conducted with different passive solar stills based on their daily productivity as detailed in table 4 as preceded the variation of freshwater yield depends closely on the most important influential parameters as climatic conditions parameters design etc otherwise it can be observed from table 4 that the modified solar still with vertical and inclined fins el sebaii et al 2015 panchal et al 2020b gives a higher efficiency of 26 77 and 24 19 for the inclined and vertical fins compared to the traditional distiller similarly novel designs of inclined solar still with pv panel presents a maximum value of 3 7 kg at the minimum flow rate the relative deviation is estimated by 19 e r ξ p d i p d ξ p d ξ where i refers to the absorber shape and ξ designates conventional solar still cv or solar still with flat form absorber placed on pcm fl 3 4 active desalination system from the previous part of the results it was concluded that the rectangular configuration of absorber gives the highest distillate yield for passive solar still at the same time particular attention was paid to the active solar system which is intended to increase desalination system performances it should be emphasized that the active desalination system consists of coupling the solar still with parabolic trough through a heat exchanger hx see fig 2a the htf considered is thermal oil see appendix table a1 with a constant flow rate of 6 ℓ min at the heat exchanger inlet moreover thermal efficiencies of ptc and hx are reported in fig 11 whose curves are plotted using literature correlations kumar and kumar 2015 2017 forristall 2003 the instantaneous output temperature of htf increases with dni to attain its maximum value which exceeds 130 c fig 12 so an auxiliary heat source is guaranteed to compare passive and active system performances the curves of tw tpcm tw tg hevap and ph are plotted in figs 13 19 in the same way as for the passive desalination system it is obvious that their profiles are almost identical to those of passive solar still but their magnitudes are so different as an illustration for each absorber type of the active system the water temperature reaches a maximum value of 79 96 c 78 72 c 76 81 c 68 12 c and 47 89 c by using the rectangular spherical triangular flat forms and the conventional solar still respectively as expected pcm temperature undergoes a tangible increase by comparison with the passive system fig 15 hence the choice of the pcm must be questioned since its phase change period would be reduced and heat storage would carry only out in sensible mode ansari et al 2013 as for the temperature difference fig 14 its maximum value is almost twice that for the passive system which would generate higher productivity subsequently evaporative heat coefficient fig 16 and water productivity figs 17 and 19 increase to a higher degree than those for a passive system this fact is quantified and presented in table 5 indeed the daily productivity exceeds 15 kg m2 day slightly over 2 kg m2 day for the passive system for rectangular and spherical absorber ripples and hence their rates of increase seem to be high 549 36 and 611 37 respectively compared to passive solar stills with the same absorber shapes after these profitable results it seems appropriate to return to the influence of absorber shapes on the active desalination system so the previously established hierarchy is ultimately followed figs 17 19 in other words water productivity is relevant for the rectangular configuration of the absorber by comparison with other absorber shapes these results are entirely confirmed by table 5 in addition of that the productivity of the studied system was compared with other types of active solar desalination systems as mentioned in table 6 it can be concluded that the results obtained from the present work are acceptable and much better than other active solar stills available in the literature accordingly to further highlight the economic feasibility of the design proposed in this study a comparison has been conducted with some passive and active designs found in the literature table 7 from their results it can be noted that both designs currently proposed passive and active solar stills are promising in terms of being not only efficient but less costly as well hence the unit cost of distillate freshwater is in the lower range of 0 0014 0 0392 l m2 for passive solar still modified with fins while the highest cost from the modified solar still with ptc is estimated as 0 0174 l m2 with pd is the daily productivity er cv and er fl are the relative deviations of conventional distiller cv and solar still with flat form absorber placed on pcm fl 4 conclusion the desalination process of the studied system deals with one of the most original technologies to remedy the problem of groundwater salinity for arid and semi arid zones where solar energy and underground water are abundant the developed technology was founded to be of real benefit to many communities that are struggling with the problem of saline intrusion it will provide a real alternative to increasing shortages of groundwater the passive and active solar desalination devices were equipped with various absorbers each with a corrugated surface in rectangular triangular or spherical shape besides its classical flat form the main results obtained from the thermal modeling and simulation of the passive solar still are as follows temperatures of all components follow solar irradiation variation and their respective peak values were localized around 2 p m the corrugated surface with rectangular shape contributes to increasing the passive solar still performance by 109 and 41 86 relative to the conventional distiller and to the distiller with absorber flat form and storage system respectively as for the active solar desalination system the results below are generally encouraging for each absorber type the water temperature reaches a maximum value of 79 96 c 78 72 c 76 81 c 68 12 c and 47 89 c by using the rectangular spherical triangular flatforms and the conventional solar still respectively pcm temperature undergoes tangible increase a maximum value of 90 c by comparison with the passive system and hence the choice of the pcm must be questioned the comparative results between the passive and the active solar still configurations showed that the daily productivity is 2 37 and 2 11 kg m2 day for rectangular and spherical absorbers coupled with passive solar stills whereas it reaches 15 39 and 15 01 kg m2 day when considering the same absorbers configurations with active solar still representing thus an increase of the pure water productivity of respectively 549 36 and 611 37 under the active configuration finally in the present work the important challenge is to ensure the availability of pure water for the sustainable development of the arid and semi arid regions by using the most abundant resource on the earth furthermore the proposed modified systems perform better and appropriate designs for household use by integrating passive solar still with rectangular shape and storage medium also for irrigation and industrial applications by coupling the active system with more distillate output and higher efficiency the prospects suggested for the future scope are to release experimental study of the developed systems

11897,groundwater is the most important and valuable water resource in arid and semi arid regions nevertheless the high salinity of these resources remains the major constraint to remedy this problem the present study aims to investigate and develop a novel sustainable solar desalination technology a passive and active single slope solar still combined with phase change material pcm for the thermal energy storage system have been numerically modeled and simulated the active system has been made by coupling passive solar still with a parabolic trough collector ptc via a heat exchanger as an external heat source for each desalination system a flat absorber and others with corrugated surfaces rectangular triangular and spherical were tested to compare their performances and the effect of absorber shape on both passive and active systems conservation equations of the two models were solved using comsol multiphysics software simulation results showed that for the passive system the corrugated surface with rectangular ripples increases pure water productivity by 109 and 42 by comparison with the conventional distiller and the distiller with an absorber of flatform with storage system respectively furthermore it was revealed that solar still integrated with ptc and modified by different absorber geometry has higher freshwater productivity of 15 39 and 15 01 kg m2 day compared to 2 37 and 2 11 kg m2 day for the passive still by using rectangular and spherical absorbers respectively consequently the percentage improvement of the developed active system is about 549 36 and 611 37 respectively from this investigation it is observed that the passive solar still with rectangular absorber is the most suitable for household use however by coupling ptc to the modified passive solar still with rectangular absorber configuration we have the appropriate design for industrial applications such as hospitals irrigation processes for agricultural greenhouses in arid and semi arid regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination solar still sustainability absorber shape parabolic through collector daily productivity comsol multiphysics 1 introduction the water demand in the world is extremely increasing particularly in the southern mediterranean periphery arid and semi arid zones cover a large part of several countries where the use of groundwater is recommended through which freshwater is produced lyazidi et al 2020 however in many parts of the world groundwater is not suitable for direct consumption thus most of the water extracted from groundwater reserves has a salinity varying between 1 and 10 g l tahiri et al 2020 mastrocicco et al 2021 in fact to meet the growing need for fresh pure and clean drinking water much research has been conducted to find suitable methods and processes to treat or desalinate brackish groundwater therefore solar desalination technology is considered a strategic option and suitable solution for satisfying water demand the use of sustainable sources to produce purified water remains an ecological and economical solution especially for poor countries extensive researches show clearly that technological advancements afford a means of developing new and highly efficient desalination processes kalogirou 2014 1 1 passive solar still with different basin modification particular attention has been paid to various types of solar still with tremendous studies incorporating several innovative technologies indeed many studies were carried out on different basin solar still configurations including single slope double slope multi effect distillation systems panchal et al 2020a jobrane et al 2020 muthu manokar et al 2020a sathyamurthy et al 2017 yousef and hassan 2019 hamed et al 2016 gang et al 2019 singh and tiwari 2017 therefore various modified designs and parameters were suggested to augment the productivity of freshwater el sebaii et al el sebaii et al 2015 el sebaii and el naggar 2017 investigated theoretically and experimentally effects of dimensions fins height and thickness and also those of fabrication material type on single basin solar still performances manokar and winston manokar and winston 2017a 2017b developed experimentally single slope solar still with fins and acrylic sheets as a new material to reduce the loss of heat from the still to the bottom panchal et al 2020b check the performance of passive solar still with vertical and inclined fins it has been found that the increment yield of 26 77 and 24 19 obtained by inclined and vertical fins as compared with traditional solar still samuel hansen and kalidasa murugavel samuel hansen and kalidasa murugavel 2017 conducted an experimental study of a new hybrid desalination system with three different absorber configurations flat grooved and fin shape by integrating still with hot water thermal storage it can be concluded that the highest daily distillate output of 9 72 ℓ was registered by using the fin shape absorber jani and modi 2019 tested experimentally a double slope single basin solar still with circular and square cross sectional hollow fins it was registered that the productivity of freshwater using circular fins increase by 54 22 compared to square fins solar still and for the basin water depth of 10 mm in other works manokar et al 2020b developed experimentally a novel design of inclined solar still with photovoltaic pv panel as an absorber plate the effect of different masse flow rates was investigated and tested to enhance productivity it was revealed that an increase in flow rate has a negative impact on the performance of inclined pv panel solar still 1 2 different types of active solar still to enhance the productivity of pure water some researchers developed the solar desalination systems by integrating additional thermal sources particularly heat storage systems and or concentrated solar power csp units via a heat exchanger pv panel pansal et al 2020 dudul et al 2020 hafs et al 2018 in this context park et al 2016 evaluated experimentally the performance of hybrid solar still with simpler seawater feeding devices using dual heat sources of solar thermal energy and waste heat in optimum operating conditions this study showed that productivity increases by increasing heat input to 18 02 kg m2 at a waste heat amount of 22 37 mj day bhargva and yadav 2019a examined and compared experimentally the combined solar still with evacuated tubes and a heat exchanger at different water depths 4 5 and 6 cm their results showed that the daily efficiency of 30 5 achieved by using 4 cm water depth in their other research work bhargva and yadav 2019b reported that the maximum daily freshwater productivity is 2 114 ℓ d a y for the case of ½ shading and cooling of glass cover which means an increase of 16 4 for the previous system compared to solar still without glass cover shading and cooling rahbar and esfahani rahbar and esfahani 2012 developed experimentally a novel portable solar still by utilizing heat pipe cooling and thermoelectric module it was concluded that this combination gives a maximum daily efficiency of 7 moreover kabeel and abdelgaied 2017a assessed experimentally modified solar still with heat exchanger and pcm connected with cylindrical parabolic concentrator as the external heat source a comparison between modified solar still and a conventional one is carried out to investigate the influences of high heat exchanger oil temperature on the performance of developed solar still also hassan et al 2019 proposed an experimentally new design of double acting solar still combined with tracked parabolic trough collector tptc they studied the effect of three media in the basin only pure saline water saline water with steel wire mesh and sand saturated with saline water on the productivity of modified solar still with tptc it was concluded that using mesh and send with saline water increase the efficiency by 3 3 and 15 3 respectively in summer days and by 3 9 and 13 8 in winter bahrami et al 2019 developed a new design of the active solar still coupled to a solar dish concentrator a parametric study was performed in this work structural optical and operational parameters are taken into account from the results of the current model it was deduced that with an aperture of 2 m when parabolic dish optical efficiency increases from 0 5 to 0 8 and the absorber plate reflectivity reduces from 0 7 to 0 4 the distilled water produced increases up to 120 and 80 respectively muraleedharan et al 2019 studied the thermal performance of modified active solar still employing absorbing therminol 55 as heat transfer fluid with al2o3 nanoparticles nhtf and fresnel lens concentrator the productivity was increased by 250 27 than conventional still with 0 1 volumetric concentration of al2o3 in nhtf 1 3 solar still with heat storage medium performances of all the technologies mentioned above could be promoted by using innovative designs or combining them with storage systems nanofluids fins indeed el sebaii et al 2009 developed as a first step single basin solar still by integrating a thin layer of stearic acid phase change storage material to act as a heat source during the night it was concluded that the daily efficiency registered is 9 005 kg m2 day for the modified solar still compared to 4 998 kg m2 day without pcm for the same goals ansari et al 2013 presented a numerical study by integrating three kinds of pcm paraffin c18 paraffin 52 54 paraffin wax as a storage medium it has essentially been deduced that using heat energy storage ameliorates the efficiency of the solar desalination system and depends closely on the maximum value of the daily brackish water temperature reached furthermore the results of this last research work were undertaken by asbik et al 2016 for a numerical study of exergy losses during the charging discharging periods cheng et al 2019 highlighted experimentally and numerically the performance of a solar still by applying a new shape stabilized phase change material sspcm with high solar absorption and high thermal conductivity it was concluded that the daily productivity of solar still with sspcm was 43 3 higher than that of conventional solar still without sspcm further the performance of solar stills was investigated with the use of nanofluids so sahota et al sahota and tiwari 2016 used the nanofluid made by mixing aluminum oxide al2o3 nanoparticles with saline water to raise the pure water productivity in passive double slope solar still as a result productivity increases by 12 2 and 8 4 for water masses of 35 and 80 kg respectively in the next step they modeled the effect of integrating three nanoparticles al2o3 cuo and tio2 in saline water for the active dual slope solar still they founded that the thermal and exergy efficiencies of the solar still were maximized by using al2o3 sahota et al 2017 mahian et al 2017 investigated experimentally and theoretically the performance of solar still using two types of nanofluids as a working fluid in the heat exchanger integrated into the bottom of the basin liner the results reveal that the performance indices were raised by 10 kabeel et al 2017b reported that using nanofluids in solar still coupled with an external condenser and also providing low pressure to increase the daily efficiency also hafs et al 2019a b and el kaddadi et al 2017 studied the performance analysis of single slope solar still by implementing fins on the absorber surface and using the specific nanofluid brackish water cu2o their results showed that daily productivity increases by 20 for the modified single slope solar still ssss with fins and nanofluid because of the high thermal conductivity of cu2o 76 5 w m k and by 12 6 for the modifier solar still with fins compared to the conventional solar still afterward patel et al 2020 examined experimentally the performance of conventional triple basin solar still with evacuated heat pipes corrugated sheets and storage materials distillate yield of the lower basin of the developed system in both storage materials granite gravel and pebbles was found higher as compared with the middle and upper basin otherwise most researchers focused on the use of different storage materials such as nanoparticles and pcm as well as the integration of external heat sources however there is a lack of research work on absorber shape effects on a passive and an active system in the southeast of morocco the issue of saltwater is an extremely common phenomenon that influences the quality of water resources as a result the fertility of agricultural soils tahiri et al 2020 however it is important to note that solar power is undeniably one of the most important sources of renewable energy in morocco with well over 3000 h year of sunshine the equivalent of the radiance of about 55 kwh ft2 day halimi et al 2018 in the present work and based on the above analysis the main objective is to provide the necessary water supply to underserved and water stressed communities and sustainably protect the environment using renewable solar energy emitting zero carbon emissions and zero liquid discharge in fact a passive and active single slope solar still which were combined with a pcm storage system have been numerically modeled and simulated under the climatic conditions of rabat city morocco the active system has been made by coupling passive solar still with a ptc via a heat exchanger as an external heat source for each desalination system a flat absorber and others with corrugated surfaces rectangular triangular and spherical were tested to compare their performances the effect of absorber shape on each desalination system has been highlighted and a comparative study was conducted between the passive and the active solar stills 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the system to embrace solar desalination technologies in water scarce countries and factors that influence desalinate brackish groundwater we developed a novel design with different absorber configurations to select the appropriate geometry for productivity enhancement in this goal passive solar still with corrugated absorber shapes see table 1 coupled with pcm heat storage system is considered fig 1 these shapes are designed in such a way that they contain the same volume of pcm accordingly the passive solar still system consists of 1 m2 of surface area covered by inclined glass and insulated from all sides by 5 cm of foam to minimize heat losses the basin of the desalination system is connected to the water tank to keep the mass of water constant 40 kg the absorber is located at the bottom of the basin liner above the storage material the desalination system using different absorber shapes is oriented in the south direction to receive the maximum solar radiation during sunshine hours a part of solar radiation has been reflected from the external surface of the glass cover however maximum intensity is transmitted through the transparent condensing glass cover and saline water and then the basin liner to be transferred by conduction to the pcm and be stored as sensible heat and or latent heat when the melting temperature is reached absorbs it moreover convection transfer of thermal energy is taken place between the absorber and brackish water and hence the temperature difference between saline water and glass cover increases as a result pure water is gotten by condensation process on the inner glass cover surface area as shown in fig 2 the above modified solar still is connected to the ptc through a heat exchanger which is placed at the bottom of the water and in contact with the basin liner surface fig 2a the used receiver tube is composed of an absorber transporting and realizing heat surrounded by a specific glass envelope with 3 8 cm of inner diameter fig 2b and c the absorber made of copper with a diameter of 1 9 cm and a length of 2 m has an outer selective coating surface appropriate to provide the required radiative and optical properties to minimize heat losses and to protect the absorber surface against oxidation a vacuum is created between the glass envelope and the absorber tube a part of the solar energy absorbed by the received tube is transferred to the heat transfer fluid htf by convection and conduction whereas the rest of the energy is transferred back to the glass envelope surface by radiation and natural convection the energy transported by the oil is released to the desalination system and yields it to the saline water through the heat exchanger which is fabricated from a copper pipe of 9 514 m in length and 1 cm diameter the oil flow rate has the value of 6 ℓ min at the pipe inlet and the properties of ptc and heat exchanger used in the present study are listed in table a1 see appendix 2 2 formulation of the problem the passive and the active solar systems described above were used to raise the yield and productivity of pure water a dynamic 3d model of heat transfer with source terms was used for both systems the following assumptions have been made each solar still component is considered as a lumped system thermo physical properties are taken constant the system is insulated on all outer surfaces except the glass cover thermal contact is supposed perfect between the storage material pcm and the absorber thermal convection within the pcm liquid phase is assumed to be negligible and for the active system amount heat released by the heat exchanger is entirely received by the brackish water accordingly the heat balance equation can be written for each system component as follows 1 ρ i e i c p i t i t q i t the subscript i and q i t refer respectively to each solar still component and heat flux densities exchanged with its surroundings see table 2 2 2 1 identification of heat exchanges various involved heat exchanges are summarized in table 2 they are essentially composed of heat flux densities exchanged between each component and its surroundings those quantities which govern energy balance equations will be identified in the subsections above were q g t q w t q b t and q p c m t are heat flux densities for glass cover brackish water absorber and pcm q c o n d q c o n v and q r a d are the conductive convective and radiative heat flux densities q e x c h w is the heat flux between the heat exchanger and brackish water α g α w a n d α b are absorptivity of the glass cover water and absorber τ g a n d τ w are transmissivity of glass and brackish water 2 2 2 heat transfer in the glass cover thermal processes associated with the glass cover involve internal and external heat transfer it received incident solar radiations α g g t and exchanges heat with its surrounding area especially the ambient air and the sky in fact a part of heat q c o n d is transferred by conduction from the outer to the inner surface of the glass cover whereas other amounts are respectively lost by convection q c o n v g a and radiation q r a d

between glass ambient and radiative heat transfer coefficient between glass sky 2 2 3 heat transfer in brackish water in this fundamental component area an important fraction of solar energy is absorbed τ g α w g t additionally convective heat transfer takes place simultaneously between brackish water and its neighboring solar still components namely absorber q c o n v b w and condensing glass cover surface q w g a temperature difference between the brackish water surface and the inner glass cover entails a water evaporation process q e v a p besides in the case of the active system the serpentine heat exchanger placed at the bottom of the water is considered as an additional heat source of the solar still that transfers q e x c h w to the water finally heat flux densities that support heat transfer processes relative to the brackish water are 3 q c o n v b w h c o n v b w t b t w q w g h w g t w t g q e x c h w q c p o i l a w t i e x c h t e e x c h where h w g h r a d w g h c o n v w g h e v a p defines the total internal heat transfer coefficient between fluid and glass cover h c o n v b w is the convective heat transfer coefficient from the absorber to the brackish water 2 2 4 heat transfer in absorber during sunshine hours the absorber with various designs stores substantial solar energy τ g τ w α b g t which will be transferred by conduction q c o n d b p c m and convection q c o n v b w to the pcm and brackish water respectively the use of different absorber designs would promote heat transfer exchanges 2 2 5 heat transfer in pcm the heat balance equation that governs the thermal behavior inside the used pcm is given by sharifi et al 2015 4 ρ p c m c p p c m t p c m t q p c m t where 5 ρ p c m θ ρ s 1 θ ρ l 6 c p p c m 1 ρ θ ρ s c p s 1 θ ρ l c p l l p

phase and 0 in the liquid phase whereas 0 θ 1 during phase change furthermore the mass fraction of solid pcm can be expressed as 7 α m 1 2 1 θ ρ l θ ρ s θ ρ s 1 θ ρ l the thermal csp model concerns the energy balance of each component of csp system namely htf glass envelope and absorber tube the direct normal irradiance dni is included in energy balance equations when it is needed in this section the model is investigated and developed under the following assumptions related to the active system the oil htf flow rate is constant at the inlet of absorber pipe thermophysical properties are constant and the htf is non isothermal oil flow through a htf pipe is laminar the contact between absorber tube and htf is assumed perfect and the optical losses due to imperfections in the collector mirrors tracking errors shading and mirrors cleanliness are neglected 2 2 6 glass envelope in this important component the heat conduction equation is given by 8 ρ g e c p g e t g e t k g e

solar receiver tube and htf similarly to the glass envelope heat transfers in the absorber tube and htf are governed by the following energy balance equations respectively 12 ρ a t c p a t t a t t k a

active are assumed to have a uniform initial temperature value t 0 regarding the passive solar still it is not concerned by boundary conditions because it is considered as a lumped system the biot number bi 0 1 at any time t 0 for the solar receiver tube of parabolic trough collector the htf inlet flow rate is a constant value of 6 ℓ min and a specific pressure was given at the outlet pgage 0 at the tube wall the no slip condition is imposed and boundary conditions relative to perfect contact between two media are also required as illustrated in fig 3 all the outside boundaries of the active system are exposed to ambient environmental conditions 2 4 mesh generation comsol multiphysics is a commercial solver and simulation software based on the finite element method which has appropriate criteria to generate the best suited mesh the most adequate mesh ensuring the convergence of numerical solutions was adopted for this simulation study which consisted of 48 260 free tetrahedral elements in the case of the passive solar still and 233 784 elements for the ptc 3 results and discussion our aim within this framework outline is to study the effect of the developed passive and active solar still designs on productivity enhancement besides desalination of brackish groundwater mw 40 kg was conducted with two desalination systems passive and active with the integration of different absorber surfaces namely flat plate and other wavy shapes rectangular triangular and spherical they could enhance heat transfer between the absorber and brackish water since the heat exchange surface has been increased also these physical models figs 1 and 2 contain 11 34 kg of paraffin c18 pcm used as a storage material first and foremost climatic operating and simulation conditions should be specified and mathematical models must be validated 3 1 climatic operating and simulation conditions to perform this study it is fundamental to have meteorological data at any given time for the considered site which is rabat city lat 34 00 47 n long 6 49 57 w these data namely global solar irradiation g t and ambient temperature ta t were measured experimentally by the sma sunny web box measuring instrument installed on the roof of erte laboratory at the ensam mohammed v university in rabat as for the dni t used for the simulation of ptc it was calculated from empirical correlations found in the literature see the appendix on a typical day june 15th 2017 the aforementioned meteorological data are shown in fig 4 whereas thermophysical properties of used materials solar still component thicknesses and its dimensions are given in tables a2 and a3 see the appendix 3 2 validation of the current model to validate the mathematical model associated with each solar distillation system it is necessary to compare its results to those available in the literature el sebaii et al 2009 2015 kabeel and abdelgaied 2017 and abdel rehim and lasheen 2007 firstly results corresponding to the passive system were compared to experimental measurements of el sebaii et al el sebaii et al 2009 2015 obviously this comparison confirmed the accuracy of the proposed model since the relative error does not exceed 7 fig 5 a and c regarding the validation of the desalination active system model fig 5b and d correlates simulation results of htf synthetic oil obtained with comsol multiphysics software and those of kabeel and abdelgaied abdel rehim and lasheen kabeel and abdelgaied 2017 abdel rehim and lasheen 2007 carried out experimentally the discrepancy between these results is around 15 28 in the worst case but it remains acceptable for the validation of the active system model 3 3 passive solar still this section is reserved for the passive solar still with four absorber shapes first of all the dissipation of global incident solar radiation during sunshine hours inside the whole system is illustrated in the case of absorber rectangular shape fig 6 the initial temperature of the system is considered to be 19 8 c in the early hours of june 15 2017 a small portion of solar irradiation is absorbed by the glass cover because of its lower coefficient of absorptivity αg 0 05 the power of solar energy transmitted through the inclined glass and saline water is captured by the absorber copper for his part it transfers heat by thermal conduction to the pcm for storage in the form of sensible and latent heat moreover the absorber gives off a substantial amount of heat and can act as a secondary source of water heating consequently the transport of water particles takes place instantaneously by free convection which is assumed to be laminar during the night of this typical day the storage medium pcm provides heat to the passive solar still on the other hand fig 7 shows temporal temperature variation of pcm at chosen times so the rectangular shape of the absorber contributes to improving the heat transfer between the storage medium and the absorber for the same reason that has been highlighted previously now let us turn to the main numerical results comparing performances of the proposed physical models and conventional desalination systems figures presented here versus time figs 8 10 are essentially temperatures heat transfer coefficients and freshwater productivity thus fig 8a shows temperature variation inside the brackish water and storage material pcm whereas fig 8b displays the temperature difference between the saline water and internal glass cover tw tg for each absorber shape which is the main responsible for evaporation and hence pure water productivity furthermore temporal variations of these graphical representations are virtually identical except for the case without storage conventional system a passive system without pcm they illustrate that temperatures follow solar irradiation variation and their respective peak values were localized around 2 p m it can be observed that for the first hours of the day temperatures increase gradually for all configurations and decrease slowly in the evening hours these last results fig 8a and b allow us to get to explain the effect of absorber shape on the behavior of the solar distiller component temperatures as well as the desalinated water production in the thermal point of view curves of evaporative heat transfer coefficient hevap and convective heat transfer coefficient between the absorber and saline water hconv b w are respectively displayed in fig 9a b and their expressions are given in the appendix from the five curves of fig 9a it is clearly seen that the evaporative heat transfer coefficient follows practically the same variation that tw tg since they are dependent see the appendix as for the heat transfer coefficient hconv b w fig 9b the influence of absorber shape is only significant during discharging period night time and the triangular ripples seem to generate the best possible heat exchange with fluid water this result can be confirmed by the fluid motion represented by free convection velocity v w g l β t b t w fig 9b which is globally the most important in the case of absorber triangular form this is mainly due to the production of free convection cells asbik et al 2002 2005 in the final analysis the productivity of instantaneous and daily pure water productivity are respectively defined by the following formula 17 p h h e w g t w t g 3600 l w 18 p d p h the effect of using different absorber shapes on instantaneous productivity is summarized in fig 10a which shows that pure water production behavior is identical to that of h evap in the daytime the relative deviation between different curves and that of conventional solar still is depicted in fig 10b accordingly it seems that rectangular absorber permits to produce more desalinated brackish water fig 10b this result is certified by the comparison given in table 3 and also by fig 10a in which the daily productivity concerning absorber shapes is presented it has been shown that the corrugated surface with rectangular shape contributes to increasing the passive solar still performance by 109 and 41 86 relative to conventional distiller cv and to that of absorber flat form with storage system fl respectively to further highlight the feasibility of the proposed design a comparison has been conducted with different passive solar stills based on their daily productivity as detailed in table 4 as preceded the variation of freshwater yield depends closely on the most important influential parameters as climatic conditions parameters design etc otherwise it can be observed from table 4 that the modified solar still with vertical and inclined fins el sebaii et al 2015 panchal et al 2020b gives a higher efficiency of 26 77 and 24 19 for the inclined and vertical fins compared to the traditional distiller similarly novel designs of inclined solar still with pv panel presents a maximum value of 3 7 kg at the minimum flow rate the relative deviation is estimated by 19 e r ξ p d i p d ξ p d ξ where i refers to the absorber shape and ξ designates conventional solar still cv or solar still with flat form absorber placed on pcm fl 3 4 active desalination system from the previous part of the results it was concluded that the rectangular configuration of absorber gives the highest distillate yield for passive solar still at the same time particular attention was paid to the active solar system which is intended to increase desalination system performances it should be emphasized that the active desalination system consists of coupling the solar still with parabolic trough through a heat exchanger hx see fig 2a the htf considered is thermal oil see appendix table a1 with a constant flow rate of 6 ℓ min at the heat exchanger inlet moreover thermal efficiencies of ptc and hx are reported in fig 11 whose curves are plotted using literature correlations kumar and kumar 2015 2017 forristall 2003 the instantaneous output temperature of htf increases with dni to attain its maximum value which exceeds 130 c fig 12 so an auxiliary heat source is guaranteed to compare passive and active system performances the curves of tw tpcm tw tg hevap and ph are plotted in figs 13 19 in the same way as for the passive desalination system it is obvious that their profiles are almost identical to those of passive solar still but their magnitudes are so different as an illustration for each absorber type of the active system the water temperature reaches a maximum value of 79 96 c 78 72 c 76 81 c 68 12 c and 47 89 c by using the rectangular spherical triangular flat forms and the conventional solar still respectively as expected pcm temperature undergoes a tangible increase by comparison with the passive system fig 15 hence the choice of the pcm must be questioned since its phase change period would be reduced and heat storage would carry only out in sensible mode ansari et al 2013 as for the temperature difference fig 14 its maximum value is almost twice that for the passive system which would generate higher productivity subsequently evaporative heat coefficient fig 16 and water productivity figs 17 and 19 increase to a higher degree than those for a passive system this fact is quantified and presented in table 5 indeed the daily productivity exceeds 15 kg m2 day slightly over 2 kg m2 day for the passive system for rectangular and spherical absorber ripples and hence their rates of increase seem to be high 549 36 and 611 37 respectively compared to passive solar stills with the same absorber shapes after these profitable results it seems appropriate to return to the influence of absorber shapes on the active desalination system so the previously established hierarchy is ultimately followed figs 17 19 in other words water productivity is relevant for the rectangular configuration of the absorber by comparison with other absorber shapes these results are entirely confirmed by table 5 in addition of that the productivity of the studied system was compared with other types of active solar desalination systems as mentioned in table 6 it can be concluded that the results obtained from the present work are acceptable and much better than other active solar stills available in the literature accordingly to further highlight the economic feasibility of the design proposed in this study a comparison has been conducted with some passive and active designs found in the literature table 7 from their results it can be noted that both designs currently proposed passive and active solar stills are promising in terms of being not only efficient but less costly as well hence the unit cost of distillate freshwater is in the lower range of 0 0014 0 0392 l m2 for passive solar still modified with fins while the highest cost from the modified solar still with ptc is estimated as 0 0174 l m2 with pd is the daily productivity er cv and er fl are the relative deviations of conventional distiller cv and solar still with flat form absorber placed on pcm fl 4 conclusion the desalination process of the studied system deals with one of the most original technologies to remedy the problem of groundwater salinity for arid and semi arid zones where solar energy and underground water are abundant the developed technology was founded to be of real benefit to many communities that are struggling with the problem of saline intrusion it will provide a real alternative to increasing shortages of groundwater the passive and active solar desalination devices were equipped with various absorbers each with a corrugated surface in rectangular triangular or spherical shape besides its classical flat form the main results obtained from the thermal modeling and simulation of the passive solar still are as follows temperatures of all components follow solar irradiation variation and their respective peak values were localized around 2 p m the corrugated surface with rectangular shape contributes to increasing the passive solar still performance by 109 and 41 86 relative to the conventional distiller and to the distiller with absorber flat form and storage system respectively as for the active solar desalination system the results below are generally encouraging for each absorber type the water temperature reaches a maximum value of 79 96 c 78 72 c 76 81 c 68 12 c and 47 89 c by using the rectangular spherical triangular flatforms and the conventional solar still respectively pcm temperature undergoes tangible increase a maximum value of 90 c by comparison with the passive system and hence the choice of the pcm must be questioned the comparative results between the passive and the active solar still configurations showed that the daily productivity is 2 37 and 2 11 kg m2 day for rectangular and spherical absorbers coupled with passive solar stills whereas it reaches 15 39 and 15 01 kg m2 day when considering the same absorbers configurations with active solar still representing thus an increase of the pure water productivity of respectively 549 36 and 611 37 under the active configuration finally in the present work the important challenge is to ensure the availability of pure water for the sustainable development of the arid and semi arid regions by using the most abundant resource on the earth furthermore the proposed modified systems perform better and appropriate designs for household use by integrating passive solar still with rectangular shape and storage medium also for irrigation and industrial applications by coupling the active system with more distillate output and higher efficiency the prospects suggested for the future scope are to release experimental study of the developed systems

mapping of the potential water resources it has been well documented khan et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 and haque et al 2020 they applied remote sensing and geographical information system techniques for artificial groundwater recharge by providing a high resolution data which can stimulate the water resources management studies and replenish and reflect a full scientific understanding for the terrain identification of recharging locations with the development of computer technology several machine learning models have been applied to forecast in sciences including artificial neural networks ann models are data driven models derived from the development of artificial intelligence ai kumar et al 2015 moreno et al 2011 the ann algorithms have been a widespread interest in the field of water sciences and technologies wue have been widely measure by used many indicators and it is a powerful soft computational technique kisi and parmar 2016 the main improvement of this model is trained to recognize the non linear and complex relationship between the input and output configurations further it doesn t put limitations on the input or the output space anns are being used to predict and model water resources factors in the last decades generally machine learning models provide more accurate wue prediction compared with the other indicators for example anns have been successfully used in hydrological processes water resources management and reservoir operation benzaghta et al 2012 antonopoulos et al 2016 wu et al 2014 forecasting the water quality level fluctuations is an important requirement for planning conjunctive use any water resources the ann models are able to forecast the water quality levels in advance reasonably well zhang et al 2019 2020 ann models have been employed to tackle numerous environmental issues for example a number of studies have used ann models to predict water resource variables like water quantity and water quality in river systems zhang et al 2019 the purpose of this study is to examine the quality of surface and groundwater and determine whether potentially harmful contaminants are present in significant concentrations and detecting the various substances that may effect on the health and acceptance of the consumer to this water until now none one has reported data about the quality of the existing water the quality assessment and observation of surface and groundwater sources of this region are of paramount importance so the results of this study will contribute and help the water resources managers and decision makers to come up with a planning to manage the water resources can execute in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the red sea state port sudan locality suakin locality gonob and oleeb locality halayeb locality this geographic area spans 212 800 km2 and locates between north eastern sudan from 18 n to 23 n and from 35 e to 38 e fig 1 it is bordered to the east kassala state eritrean border by the red sea coast which is 780 km long to the north by the arab republic of egypt and to the west by the river nile state elsheikh et al 2009 the existing water quality in the red sea state sudan has not been studied previously despite its large population 1 482 million in 2018 and its relatively low availability of water the red sea state is one of the most water poor states in sudan and suffers from the scarcity of potable water with only 687 million m3 of water from seasonal streams valleys and surface sources of water at depths of 40 60 feet port sudan suakin local and halayeb localities are the main source of fresh drinking water in the state in addition to the basin of khur arbaat located in gonob and oleeb 35 km from the city of port sudan there are also groundwater wells producing approximately 5000 m3 per day the red sea state is a semi dry and sub humid zones average annual rainfall is about 150 mm from may to september and less extended during winter november march the area is characterized by scattered acacia trees with an increasingly dense pattern landward the area can be subdivided into the coastal plain zone the red sea hills and between them the plateau of the washing zone the population relies mainly on groundwater for their domestic and agricultural activities the main source of groundwater feed is creek baraka and its branches during flood seasons 56 107 m3 year may september and precipitation the area s geology consists of a crystalline base complex of gneissic and granite rocks that have been dissected by some of the late post granite diabase dikes and quartz veins sedimentary formations are also deployed along the sudanese red sea coast elsheikh et al 2009 2 2 sampling and field analyses the study was carried out by taking water samples from twenty different loctions fig 2 to cover our study area it were collected from four localities during winter season february 2018 the water resources were analysed for conducting physical chemical and microbiological properties 500 ml samples were randomly collected in sterile glass bottles covered with plastic

powder pillow at wavelength 353 n mr pp sample without reagent was used as blank for nitrate and iron 2 4 microbial analysis total coliform bacteria are a wide range of variety includes gram negative non spore forming bacilli and anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria escherichia coli and thermotolerant coliforms are a group that can ferment lactose at high temperature but e coli have capability to produce indole samples from the water resources were analysed to detect the presence of total coliform and e coli it must be undetectable in any 100 ml of water samples to be recommended as safe water 2 4 1 total coliform total coliform was measured according to the method mentioned in the international standard iso 4831 microbiology of food and animal feeding stuff iso 2006 the most probable number enumeration method mpn was used to count total coliforms and escherichia coli 2 4 1 1 inoculation and incubation we performed serial dilutions of a nutritional medium of buffer peptone water 10 ml of selective media lauryl sulfate tryptose broth were put in test tubes containing inverted dirham tubes then sterilized at 121 c for 15 min under vacuum three tubes per 33 x dilution were used for greater results accuracy 25 ml of the sample was added to 225 ml buffer peptone water nutritional medium and distributed as serial dilution 1 2 3 equal to 0 01 g 0 001 g of sample per tube one ml from each buffer dilution peptone water were withdrawn and incoulated the test tubes that containing lauryl sulfate tryptose broth three tubes per dilution were incubated at 37 c for 24 h 2 h the appearance of gas in the inverted dirham tubes considered as indicator of bacteria presence tubes without gas were incubated for another 24 h one ml of the test sample was transferred to a tube containing 10 ml of lauryl sulfate tryptose broth 2 4 1 2 confirmation test cultivation was carried out using the tubes containing gas where taken a loop to brilliant green lactose tubes 10 ml containing inverted dirham tubes and it were incubated at 37 c for 24 h 2 the emergence of gas in aed tubes is evidence of the presence of bacteria tubes did not appear gas were incubated for another 24 h all tubes containing gas are considered positive for coliforms coliforms are calculated as the most probable number mpn 2 4 2 detection of escherichia coli detection of e coli was performed in accordance with the method mentioned in the international standard iso 7251 microbiology of food and animal feeding stuffs iso 2005 the number of escherichia coli bacteria was calculated using the most probable number method per millilitre of test sample 2 4 2 1 enumeration method the same method of counting was used to calculate total coliform the presence of gas in test tubes containing lauryl sulfate broth is expected to be as result of e coli bacteria present test tubes containing 10 ml of ec broth were prepared with inverted dirham tubes and sterilized in accordance with previous method 2 4 2 2 transfer of e coli bacteria on selective nutritional medium sub culturing and incubation of the selective medium ec broth the transplantation was carried out by transferring loop from the test tubes containing gas to the ec broth tubes and were incubated at 44 c for 24 h 2 2 4 2 3 examination for indole production following incubation 0 5 ml of indole reagent was added to a test

containing l emb agar and incubated at 35 c for 18 24 h the emergence of metallic sheen bacterial colonies 2 5 water quality index wqi was used to obtain a comprehensive picture of water resources quality which was defined as a classification that reflects the combined influence of different water quality parameters on the overall water quality kawo and karuppannan 2018 şener et al 2017 wqi was calculated with the following steps the first step each of the 12 parameters was assigned a weight wi between 1 5 least to highest effect on water quality based on their effects on the health and significance in the overall quality of water for drinking purposes table 2 second the relative weight wi of the parameters n is the number of parameters was computed using the following eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i third quality rating scale qi was computed using eq 2 which used the determinated concentration of each parameters ci and standard safe limits values si 2 q i c i s i 100 finally wqi was computed using eq 3 3 w q i i 1 n w i q i 2 6 artificial neural network ann ann is a powerful soft computational technique for linear and nonlinear approximations in several fields intravaia and lambrecht 2007 kişi 2006 it includes an array of several neurons that connected together to solve specialized problem in other words all input nodes feed into the first hidden layer the hidden layers successively feed into one another and the final hidden layer feeds into the output layer konaté et al 2015 the ann output yki presents in this equation 4 y i k f ν i k where i is the neuron k is the layer and f is the activation function hambli 2006 sigmoid function is most common one used as transfer function was implemented in the literature lippmann 1987 shown in eqs 5 and 6 5 ν i k j 1 b w j i k 1 y 1 k 1 b 1 k 6 f ν i k 1 1 exp θ ν i k where b is the number of connections to the preceding layer bk is a constant for f and it is the measure of the bias in the application wjik 1 represents each connection s weight θ 0 9 is the slope of the function the feed forward and back propagation bp training algorithms applied through network weights modification and criterion function for performance optimization normally back propagation uses a steepest descent method on error surfaces to adjust the weights and to minimize the difference between the predicted and expected output the error is back propagated as an input with the weights readjusted and the computational process is repeated until it reaches the least error which is the major task of bp ann is to determine the optimal weights that can make predictions that are in close proximity to the target output the levenberg marquardt algorithm lma is a type of bp training which provides a mathematical solution to the non linear problem of minimizing a function it is one of the fast methods for training moderate sized feed forward neural networks tiryaki 2008 olawoyin and richard 2016 wqi was calculated by bpann for optimization with 15 neurons configuration and learning rate factor ƞ 0 001 whereas wqi represents a single output agreed with nelson and illingworth 1991 who supported the idea of 20 30 of data for testing which were coded and implemented in matlab the accuracies of the developed ann models for predicting wqi were assessed with four commonly used statistical indices feng et al 2017 fan j et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mbe and t statistic 7 m b e 1 n i 1 n y i m y i e mbe is the mean bias error yi m is the calculated actual value and yi e is the predicted value the smaller absolute value means better model performs 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i m y i e 2 rmse is the root mean square error the small rmse values are considered to have better performance than models with larger values 9 t s t a t i s t i c s 1 n n 1 m b e 2 r m s e 2 m b e 2 the model with the value of t statistics close to zero is considered to be the best performing model 2 7 data analysis data were analysed with xlstat and matlab means and standard deviations for each of three subsamples were calculated other statistical analyses were performed such as water quality index artificial neural network and correlation matrix spearman s correlation matrix to determine if the contaminants were correlated with each other the results were compared to the sudanese drinking water standards from ssmo sds 2007 and the world health organization drinking water standards world health 2017 to assess compliance with national and international drinking water standards 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical parameters 3 1 1 heavy metals several heavy metals were measured ba cd cr cu mn ni pb and zn and analysed in triplicate to get the average the highest concentration of cadmium lead nickel and chromium were 0 0247 0 643 0 0880 and 0 0507 ppm respectively at location 20 with average values 0 01095 0 2799 0 0373 and 0 02322 respectively copper and manganese had the highest concentration at location 15 it wre 0 0386 and 0 0271 ppm respectively with average 0 01945 and 0 0051 ppm respectively the highest concentration of barium was 0 0584 ppm at sample site 4 with average 0 0283 finally the highest concentration of zinc was 0 264 ppm at site 11 and the average was 0 07031 see tables 3 and 4 3 1 2 ph and total dissolved solids tds the results showed that the highest ph concentration was 8 38 in the location 2 the average across all samples was 7 28 tables 4 and 5 the highest concentration of tds was 8 75 g l at site 3 tds average across all samples was 1271 2 mg l tables 4 and 5 3 1 3 iron and nitrate the highest concentration of iron was 0 15 mg l at sample site 15 the average was 0 0506 mg l across all samples tables 4 and 5 the highest nitrate concentration was 8 9 mg l at sample site 7 and the average across all sites was 1 79 mg l see tables 4 and 5 3 2 microbiological tests total coliform group indicator value can be used to estimate the cleanliness and safety of distribution systems unicef who 2017 escherichia coli indicator value it can be deemed the most suitable indicator of faecal human and animal contamination in most circumstances populations of thermotolerant coliforms are composed predominantly of e coli the presence of e coli or alternative thermotolerant coliforms should lead to investigation of potential pollution sources such as inadequate treatment or breaches in distribution system integrity who results of microbiological tests showed that the highest total coliform bacteria concentration was 1100 colony forming units cfu at sites 10 and 19 the average was 243 14 cfu the highest escherichia coli bacteria concentration was 460 cfu at sample site 10 and average 80 09 cfu see tables 4 and 5 3 3 water quality index water quality index of red sea state was assessed to estime thier suitability for drinking purposes the categories of water quality index was shown in table 6 and the calculated wqi values for each sampling location were shown in table 1 majority of samples sites were fall in unsuitable water index values sample site no 13 was categorized as excellent water resource and sites no 16 17 were categorized as good water resource the computed water quality index values were between 8 4936 and 889 04 to evaluate the general quality parameters of water we analysed the results belonging to all 20 sampling sites furthermore conformed with the international and national standard limits who ssmo to assess the safety parameters we made spatial variation maps of the water quality parameters tds cd pb ni total coliform and wqi by using geographic information system gis techniques as presented in fig 4 a b c d e and f assessment of spatial variation led to a better understanding of water resources quality in the study area that can helps for planning of new water projects heavy metals accumulation in water resources indicate that presence of natural or anthropogenic sources which constitute toxic pollutants which it may affect on human health bibi et al 2007 yang et al 2002 3 4 artificial neural network model for estimating wqi the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the network was identified by trial and error procedure the best performance was achieved when twelve neurons were applied in the hidden layer so the most appropriate model structure is 12 15 1 that means that the model consists of 12 input variables 15 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output layer fig 5 using a network training function that updates weight and bias values according to gradient descent with adaptive learning rate moreover the weights were adjusted by nonlinear sigmoid function the statistical results of the ann model for predicting monthly wqi during the training validation and testing stages which indicted the plotted data points generally correlated close towards the 1 1 line it was found that the r2 values of ann model was greater than 0 95 during training testing and validation which indicating a strong relationship between the wqi values from the traditional equation and those predicted by the ann model fig 5 shows the comparison of wqi values predicted by ann model versus the calculated method it can be observed that there is a good correlation between wqi of the ann model and the calculated method which are also consistent with the high values of statistical coefficient it was suggested that ann model showed much higher prediction accuracy in wqi modeling our research agrees with the previous investigation of abdel fattah et al 2020 who evaluated the irrigation water quality index iwqi through applying artificial neural network ann model abdel fattah et al 2020 our analysis shows that it is possible to construct a successful simple and faster model structure based on the ann to predict wqi with high accuracy 3 5 correlation analysis correlation coefficient were used to evaluate establish of the relationship between physical chemical and microbiological parameters we performed by using spearman s correlation matrix table 7 shows that for high positive and significant correlation the denotes value is r 0 7 and for significant and strong positive correlation the indicate r values were obtained r 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 physical and chemical parameters 4 1 1 heavy metals polluted drinking water by heavy metals can caused a serious health conditions such as kidney failure liver disease and some different cancer diseases which have harmful health effects these types of diseases are linked to high concentrations of heavy elements like cadmium chromium chromium copper lead manganese barium zinc and nickel 4 1 1 1 barium chromium manganese copper and zinc manganese is an important pollutant exposure to high concentrations in drinking water for many years has been correlated with toxic effects on the nervous system who 2008 that can producing syndrome similar to parkinson s disease especially for the elderly by the oral track manganese is often as one of the elements low toxic giri and singh 2015 among the various heavy metals high concentrations of chromium are known to cause various pulmonary disorders forti et al 2011 zinc and copper frequently not detected or detected in low quantities at all in water sources both elements were found in low concentrations in soils derived from granite wuta et al 2016 however copper is a factor that can cause cancer in humans kosaka et al 2007 also excessive intake of zinc has negative effects on the immunological system reduction in lymphocyte stimulation response and cholesterol metabolism goldhaber 2003 finally drinking large amounts of barium compounds that dissolve in water can cause changes in heart rhythm or paralysis in humans and accidental ingestion may cause gastroenteritis vomiting diarrhoea abdominal pain who 2001 has not been shown to occase cancer for humans or experimental animals drinking barium in water on the other hand department of health and human services dhhs international agency for research on cancer iarc and epa had not classified barium as carcinogenic atsdr 2007 zinc copper barium chromium and manganese concentration were obtained between 0 0082 0 264 0 0 0386 0 0 0584 0 0019 0 0507 and 0 0 0271 ppm respectively the maximum safe drinking water limits from who and ssmo were present in table 3 4 1 1 2 cadmium lead and nickel cadmium and lead are considered heavy toxic metals that are released into the aquatic environment through of the industrial activities such as mining and reflning of ores handy 1994 moreover cadmium and lead are naturally present in the groundwater of mountainous as a result of the weathering products of mining granodiorite and sandstone hume 1934 maynard 1983 also there are other sources such as the decomposed plants animal substances and atmospheric deposition of particulates can also contribute small amounts of these metals to neighbouring water sources johnson 1997 high levels of cadmium exposure can lead to kidney damage and hypertension while lead is a commutative poison and possible a human carcinogen or may also lead to significant respiratory damages husam malassa 2013 on the other hand nickel also is known to causing various pulmonary disorders forti et al 2011 cadmium lead and nickel concentration in samples were obtained between 0 0037 0 0247 0 0 643 and 0 0 0880 ppm ppm respectively all the water resources sites in this study had higher cadmium levels than the recommend limits while only one sample site had safe level of lead and seven sites had nickel concentration higher than recommended fig 6 a b and c spatial variation map of cd pb and ni fig 4 a b and c showed that most of the study area had a higher values than maximum limits low levels were found in northeastern parts 4 1 2 ph iron and nitrate water ph value is an important indicator of acidity or alkalinity of water the hydrogen ion of water does not have a direct negative impact on consumers and as an indirect result it can carried out modifications in some parameters of water quality including the primary chemical forming and survival of infectious microorganism s in the water bside it causing irritation of the digestive system in people who suffer from high sensitivity mkwate et al 2017 toure et al 2019 in this study the values of locations were between 6 57 8 38 which indicated that in line with the drinking water standard iron is commonly element encountered in rocks and soil which is found in large quantities in all types of water resources since it may be origin from soil or age old corroded iron pipes used although this metal has little attention as a health hazard and not poisonous borah et al 2010 tamrakar chirika shova 2013 but some researchers reported points out that is one of the most disturbing constituents in water supplies a high concentration of iron can have negative impacts on water supplies coloring water staining problems where water stands or affecting taste of water kosaka et al 2007 chung et al 2009 iron values in the study area were obtained between 0 001 and 0 15 mg l table 4 which indicates that it had conformed to drinking water standards a high levels of nitrate and nitrite in water resources has been associated with methaemoglobinaemia which is an often deadly disease for infants especially aged less than four months gao et al 2012 he et al 2016 bouwer 1978 the main sources that may arised nitrate contamination in surface and groundwater sources is the excessive use of fertilizers mixing of water with sewage and infiltration of other organic waste nitrate nitrite contamination is e common especially in areas with aggressive or acidic water the values of the study area were between 0 07 and 8 9 mg l it lower than who and ssmo standard limits 4 1 3 total dissolved solids tds dissolved solids in water resources contain many of numerous substances such as inorganic materials e g hydrogen carbonate ions chlorine salt calcium sulfate inorganic salt as well as organic materials come from a little dissolved organic synthesis who 2006 higher tds reduce water palatability and increases gastrointestinal irritation in consumers drinking water with a higher tds for extended periods can cause kidney stones therefore acceptable limits of tds are below 1200 mg l garg et al 2009 chung et al 2009 the maximum value of tds should be less than 1 000 mg l according to who ssmo our tds results showed values ranging between 103 5 and 8750 mg l however there were seven sites 1 2 3 10 11 15 and 20 exceeded the maximum standard level see fig 6 d spatial variation map of tds fig 4 e shown that large portions of the region have values less than maximum limit except areas in south eastern and north western parts 4 2 microbiological tests microbial quality of water resources is significantly important where it deteriorated can increase risks of waterborne diseases and may lead to disease outbreaks therefore it is imperative to increase the microbial safety of drinking water from watersheds to the consumer to prevent the contamination of drinking water or lessen contamination to levels that do not harm health safety is increased if the water resources are protected a proper operation of series treatment steps and management of distribution systems to conserve and protect treated water who 2006 detection of coliforms and the total bacterial number mainly covered the detection of microbes which are bacteria commonly found in the intestines of humans and mammals and are excreted outside the body in the dejection chlorine treatment can effectively prevent coliforms harm coliforms must be undetectable for water to be considered safe for drinking purposes uriuhare et al 1995 the presence of pathogenic microorganisms depends on the group of chemical and physical properties of the region and the group of animal sources and the nature of human activities that release pathogens into the environment the occurrence of coliform groups in water could be due to faecal pollution may come from sewage treatment facilities and household sewage tanks or discharge of farces by humus and other animals directly into water klein 1967 and yan and sadowsky 2007 also livestock has direct access to channel water in rural areas according to pujari et al 2007 the continuous consumption of contaminated water may cause serious health risks to the local population in this area especially for children 5 years suthar et al 2009 trabulsi lr 2002 concluded that typical enteropathogenic e coli strain is a leading cause of infantile diarrhoea especially in developing countries moreover increase transmitted of certain diseases such as pulmonary infections urinary tract infections abscesses skin wounds infections etc around 70 of sampling locations in this study had coliforms present and 55 had e coli table 4 standards issued by who and ssmo said that drinking water must be nil from total coliforms and e coli not detect in cfu 100 ml in our study fourteen locations of ground and surface water resources had a high proportion of total coliform ranged between 0 1100 cfu it has also been detected e coli on eleven sampling locations in range between 0 460 cfu spatial variation map of total coliform bacteria fig 4 d shown that most of the study area had a higher index values more than 300 cfu except six sites in north eastern and south eastern part 4 3 water quality index spatial variation map of water quality index of red sea state as shown in fig 4 f most of the study region has wqi above 300 unsuitable for drinking purpose this assessment led to better understanding of quality of water resources and helps for futures planning unsuitable water were located in the higher north part because of rock water interaction which has a high concentration of metals trace metals in water resources refers to presences of natural or anthropogenic pollution sources bibi et al 2007 yang et al 2002 4 4 correlation analysis a high positive correlation occurred between total coliform and escherichia coli r 0 8 suggesting either indicator may be used to assess drinking water quality trabulsi lr 2002 significant and strong positive correlation has been obtained for cd pb ni cu with other and with cr r 0 9 likely because they are found together in groundwater of mountain areas then are released into the aquatic environment naturally as a result of weathering also coming from the industrial activities sources such as mining granodiorite and sandstone which are enriched with these metals mark e brigham 1998 in the end a significant and strong positive correlation was also observed between the total dissolved solids and nitrate likely because tds are content a variety of numerous substances as well as its contenting of soluble organic synthesis who 2006 5 conclusion and recommendations this study investigated the quality of the water resources in the red sea state in sudan and its suitability for the drinking uses we also assessed water quality compliance with the international standards from who and national standards from ssmo the highest concentration of cadmium lead chromium and nickel were observed in sample site 20 however the highest concentration of copper manganese and iron occurred in sample site 15 while the highest concentration of tds and nitrate were in sample site 3 ph zinc and barium had the highest values are samples sites 2 11 finally samples sites 10 and 19 obtained the highest microbial contamination the percentage of cadmium contaminated samples sites was 100 lead 95 nickel 35 total coliform group 70 and 55 escherichia coli copper barium chromium manganese zinc iron nitrate and ph were within the safe limits for drinking water according to the who and ssmo standard the percentage of the tests which did not conform to the safe limits were 28 57 in portsudan 21 42 suakin 25 39 gonob and oleeb 32 14 in halayeb locality the results showed that all study samples sites were tested whether ground or surface water did not conform to the national and international specifications for drinking water in two or more test parameters water quality index shown that 5 of water sample sites fall within excellent water 15 good water and 10 in poor quality level beside that 70 of water samples fall within unsuitable water according to water quality rating scale of wqi ann model with five hidden neurons was the most reliable one with high value of coefficient of determination r2 0 95 for training testing and validation ann can recognize the relation between the input and output parameters without explicit physical consideration the present study indicated that the ann model is more promising for wqi a great effort should be made to achieve the quality of drinking water in this region as possible those who are most at risk to contracting contaminated water related diseases are include infants young and children the elderly and people who suffer weakness or living unsanitary conditions this study recommended protection of water sources by utilizing concrete ductwork or transmission lines with large capacities to transfer water from the source to the city we also recommend imposing precautions to maintain the integrity of groundwater as a safe source of drinking water by preventing any activity that might harm water safety and use filters likewise we need to treat surface and groundwater before use methods for achieving this may include simple chemical treatments installing modern treatment stations to treat the pollution and or establishing a water safety plan wsp had become is internationally renowned as an important way to reducing the health risk from drinking water who has been advocating for this approach since 2004 and while it has been effective in some places these trends are particularly alarming in areas experiencing significant urban growth consequently protecting aquatic ecosystems are becoming increasingly challenging in water management there is still an urgent need to improve drinking water safety and quality in many parts of the world author contributions mohamedelfatieh ismael collect the samples performed the

11898,this study aimed to assess the quality of water resources and its suitability for the drinking uses in red sea state sudan particularly with regard to international standards from the world health organization who 2017 and the national standards from sudanese standard and meteorology organization for drinking water sds 044 2007 twenty locations site were investigated to represent this important area where its analysed for compliance with the national and international standards furthermore the suitability for drinking purpose was assessed by using water quality index wqi method artificial neural network ann was applied to predict the qwi by using the algorithm of feed forward back propagation artificial neural networks bp ann for optimization physio chemical assessments indicated that water resources did not conform to the safe limits especially heavy metals likes cadmium which has the highest concentrations hazard in almost all samples high lead levels were observed at nineteen sites while a high concentrations of nickel and total dissolved solids were observed at seven locations the microbial assessment indicated most of locations did not conform to the safe limits a high bacteria hazard for total coliform and escherichia coli were observed in fourteen and seven locations respectively computed wqi values ranged from 35 61 to 337 52 ann model showed much high prediction accuracy of wqi modeling with r2 values greater than 0 95 during training testing and validation wqi spatial distribution shown that red sea state has unsuitable water quality in most of study sites 70 the effects of heavy pollutants dominated on the water quality and spread in these regions this study conducted the first full scale survey of the drinking water sources ground and surface in the red sea state of sudan based on these results we recommended that an urgent measures such as a chemical treatments to treat the pollution with or filters installation should be implemented as soon as possible to manage and protect the water resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metals who limits sds limits water quality index wqi artificial neural networks ann red sea state sudan 1 introduction safe drinking water access and availability are considered as a basic human right that noted by the european commission based on lisbon treaty and the united nations general assembly in 2010 and stated in the new united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs by 2030 everyone should have access to safe and affordable drinking water officially known as transforming our world gunnarsdottir et al 2020 un 2015 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 mukherjee et al 2021a however statistics as in 2015 that 29 of the world population does not have access to safe drinking water who iwa 2017 groundwater is one of the main sources of water worldwide 65 of it is used for drinking purposes 20 for irrigation and livestock and 15 for industry and mining their quality depends on interactions within the aquifer between chemical constituents soil rock and gases freeze r a 1979 selvakumar et al 2017 adimalla et al 2020 also influenced by natural processes such as deposition of minerals groundwater movement velocity quality of recharge waters and interactions with other aquifers and anthropogenic processes such as pollutants from human activities de andrade et al 2008 heavy metals are naturally present in groundwater at different concentrations depending on the type of parent rock and the nature of the sediments which human health can be affects however heavy metal contamination in water is of increasing concern as many groundwater sources are no longer safe for drinking purposes moyo 2013 furthermore human activities such as rapid urbanization and industrialization can negatively impact water quality tiehm et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021b causing increased spread of microbial and chemical pollutants on soil surfaces through the transport of the pollutants to the water receiving containers abera et al 2017 dahhou et al 2017 whittemore et al 1989 in recent years microbial contamination has generated widespread of concerns sorlini et al 2013 geng et al 2016 low quality groundwater can have long term impacts on the environment impacts which can be exacerbated by land use activities to cover the demand for food which cause pollutant releases rao 2014 toxic elements can easily enter to the body through ingestion of food or water accumulating in fatty tissues and depositing in the circulatory system and the body cannot biodegrade these pollutants lu et al 2014 tang et al 2013 bundschuh et al 2017 some water microorganisms such as the bacteria e coli and enterococci can cause waterborne outbreaks and indicate the presence of faecal contamination brindha and elango 2012 reports issued by the world health organization indicates that contaminated drinking water is responsible for approximately 80 of diseases around the world and one third of deaths in developing countries who 2004 in developing countries microbial quality of water is typically prioritized over chemical quality abera et al 2017 as a result microbial purification and quality assessing should be included in the water treatment process to protect the population from waterborne diseases de battisti et al 2018 jasrotia et al 2018 2019 many coliforms or bacteria are heterotrophic and able to live in water and can even survive in water distribution systems especially in presence of biofilms unicef who 2017 the total coliform group indicator value are used to estimate the cleanliness and safety of distribution systems it could act as a disinfection indicator should be absent after disinfection e coli its indicator value can specifically be used as an indicator of faecal human and animal contamination thus the presence of e coli or other thermotolerant coliforms indicates lack of disinfection and should spur investigation of potential sources of failure such as inadequate treatment or breaches in distribution system integrity saha et al 2019 the use of exposed storage facilities may actually decrease the microbiological quality level of drinking water who 2014 in addition to that in the same locations it uses the membrane systems such as reverse osmosis ro to provide drinking waters many literatures reported that several membrane systems were used to produce pure waters however this process does not effectively remove all pollutants especially in places with unreliable infrastructure or intermittent access to electricity gude et al 2010 singh et al 2015 drinking water quality decision making based on accurate data is imperative should be purely technical cude 2001 water quality index is a mathematical effectual tool it defined as a technique that provides a ranking of the composite effect of individual parameters of water quality to the overall water quality to give only a single number to assess the overall water quality for drinking purposes at a certain location and time rabeiy 2018 akkaraboyina and raju 2012 taloor et al 2020 tirkey et al 2017 and it is a certify method to quality of water by simple way that can respond to the changes in the basic characteristics of water can using the relative weight for each parameters and classify the waters according to the quality categories levels it was applied by several studies to assess surface and groundwater quality and rivers kawo and karuppannan 2018 şener et al 2017 rabeiy 2018 geographic information system gis technology is an important technique for producing the maps and it widely used in water quality maps to identify the polluted and unpolluted zones and demarcation furthermore also can be used to assist planners and decision makers in assessing the situation of water resources and future planning jasrotia et al 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 rabeiy 2018 in studies at last three decades gis technology has been used for mapping of the potential water resources it has been well documented khan et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 and haque et al 2020 they applied remote sensing and geographical information system techniques for artificial groundwater recharge by providing a high resolution data which can stimulate the water resources management studies and replenish and reflect a full scientific understanding for the terrain identification of recharging locations with the development of computer technology several machine learning models have been applied to forecast in sciences including artificial neural networks ann models are data driven models derived from the development of artificial intelligence ai kumar et al 2015 moreno et al 2011 the ann algorithms have been a widespread interest in the field of water sciences and technologies wue have been widely measure by used many indicators and it is a powerful soft computational technique kisi and parmar 2016 the main improvement of this model is trained to recognize the non linear and complex relationship between the input and output configurations further it doesn t put limitations on the input or the output space anns are being used to predict and model water resources factors in the last decades generally machine learning models provide more accurate wue prediction compared with the other indicators for example anns have been successfully used in hydrological processes water resources management and reservoir operation benzaghta et al 2012 antonopoulos et al 2016 wu et al 2014 forecasting the water quality level fluctuations is an important requirement for planning conjunctive use any water resources the ann models are able to forecast the water quality levels in advance reasonably well zhang et al 2019 2020 ann models have been employed to tackle numerous environmental issues for example a number of studies have used ann models to predict water resource variables like water quantity and water quality in river systems zhang et al 2019 the purpose of this study is to examine the quality of surface and groundwater and determine whether potentially harmful contaminants are present in significant concentrations and detecting the various substances that may effect on the health and acceptance of the consumer to this water until now none one has reported data about the quality of the existing water the quality assessment and observation of surface and groundwater sources of this region are of paramount importance so the results of this study will contribute and help the water resources managers and decision makers to come up with a planning to manage the water resources can execute in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the red sea state port sudan locality suakin locality gonob and oleeb locality halayeb locality this geographic area spans 212 800 km2 and locates between north eastern sudan from 18 n to 23 n and from 35 e to 38 e fig

non spore forming bacilli and anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria escherichia coli and thermotolerant coliforms are a group that can ferment lactose at high temperature but e coli have capability to produce indole samples from the water resources were analysed to detect the presence of total coliform and e coli it must be undetectable in any 100 ml of water samples to be recommended as safe water 2 4 1 total coliform total coliform was measured according to the method mentioned in the international standard iso 4831 microbiology of food and animal feeding stuff iso 2006 the most probable number enumeration method mpn was used to count total coliforms and escherichia coli 2 4 1 1 inoculation and incubation we performed serial dilutions of a nutritional medium of buffer peptone water 10 ml of selective media lauryl sulfate tryptose broth were put in test tubes containing inverted dirham tubes then sterilized at 121 c for 15 min under vacuum three tubes per 33 x dilution were used for greater results accuracy 25 ml of the sample was added to 225 ml buffer peptone water nutritional medium and distributed as serial dilution 1 2 3 equal to 0 01 g 0 001 g of sample per tube one ml from each buffer dilution peptone water were withdrawn and incoulated the test tubes that containing lauryl sulfate tryptose broth three tubes per dilution were incubated at 37 c for 24 h 2 h the appearance of gas in the inverted dirham tubes considered as indicator of bacteria presence tubes without gas were incubated for another 24 h one ml of the test sample was transferred to a tube

containing l emb agar and incubated at 35 c for 18 24 h the emergence of metallic sheen bacterial colonies 2 5 water quality index wqi was used to obtain a comprehensive picture of water resources quality which was defined as a classification that reflects the combined influence of different water quality parameters on the overall water quality kawo and karuppannan 2018 şener et al 2017 wqi was calculated with the following steps the first step each of the 12 parameters was assigned a weight wi between 1 5 least to highest effect on water quality based on their effects on the health and significance in the overall quality of water for drinking purposes table 2 second the relative weight wi of the parameters n is the number of parameters was computed using the following eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i third quality rating scale qi was computed using eq 2 which used the determinated concentration of each parameters ci and standard safe limits values si 2 q i c i s i 100 finally wqi was computed using eq 3 3 w q i i 1 n w i q i 2 6 artificial neural network ann ann is a powerful soft computational technique for linear and nonlinear approximations in several fields intravaia and lambrecht 2007 kişi 2006 it includes an array of several neurons that connected together to solve specialized problem in other words all input nodes feed into the first hidden layer the hidden layers successively feed into one another and the final hidden layer feeds into the output layer konaté et al 2015 the ann output yki presents in this equation 4 y i k f ν i k where i is the neuron k is the layer and f is the activation function hambli 2006 sigmoid function is most common one used as transfer function was implemented in the literature lippmann 1987 shown in eqs 5 and 6 5 ν i k j 1 b w j i k 1 y 1 k 1 b 1 k 6 f ν i k 1 1 exp θ ν i k where b is the number of connections to the preceding layer bk is a constant for f and it is the measure of the bias in the application wjik 1 represents each connection s weight θ 0 9 is the slope of the function the feed forward and back propagation bp training algorithms applied through network weights modification and criterion function for performance optimization normally back propagation uses a steepest descent method on error surfaces to adjust the weights and to minimize the difference between the predicted and expected output the error is back propagated as an input with the weights readjusted and the computational process is repeated until it reaches the least error which is the major task of bp ann is to determine the optimal weights that can make predictions that are in close proximity to the target output the levenberg marquardt algorithm lma is a type of bp training which provides a mathematical solution to the non linear problem of minimizing a function it is one of the fast methods for training moderate sized feed forward neural networks tiryaki 2008 olawoyin and richard 2016 wqi was calculated by bpann for optimization with 15 neurons configuration and learning rate factor ƞ 0 001 whereas wqi represents a single output agreed with nelson and illingworth 1991 who supported the idea of 20 30 of data for testing which were coded and implemented in matlab the accuracies of the developed ann models for predicting wqi were assessed with four commonly used statistical indices feng et al 2017 fan j et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mbe and t statistic 7 m b e 1 n i 1 n y i m y i e mbe is the mean bias error yi m is the calculated actual value and yi e is the predicted value the smaller absolute value means better model performs 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i m y i e 2 rmse is the root mean square error the small rmse values are considered to have better performance than models with larger values 9 t s t a t i s t i c s 1 n n 1 m b e 2 r m s e 2 m b e 2 the model with the value of t statistics close to zero is considered to be the best performing model 2 7 data analysis data were analysed with xlstat and matlab means and standard deviations for each of three subsamples were calculated other statistical analyses were performed such as water quality index artificial neural network and correlation matrix spearman s correlation matrix to determine if the contaminants were correlated with each other the results were compared to the sudanese drinking water standards from ssmo sds 2007 and the world health organization drinking water standards world health 2017 to assess compliance with national and international drinking water standards 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical parameters 3 1 1 heavy metals several heavy metals were measured ba cd cr cu mn ni pb and zn and analysed in triplicate to get the average the highest concentration of cadmium lead nickel and chromium were 0 0247 0 643 0 0880 and 0 0507 ppm respectively at location 20 with average values 0 01095 0 2799 0 0373 and 0 02322 respectively copper and manganese had the highest concentration at location 15 it wre 0 0386 and 0 0271 ppm respectively with average 0 01945 and 0 0051 ppm respectively the highest concentration of barium was 0 0584 ppm at sample site 4 with average 0 0283 finally the highest concentration of zinc was 0 264 ppm at site 11 and the average was 0 07031 see tables 3 and 4 3 1 2 ph and total dissolved solids tds the results showed that the highest ph concentration was 8 38 in the location 2 the average across all samples was 7 28 tables 4 and 5 the highest concentration of tds was 8 75 g l at site 3 tds average across all samples was 1271 2 mg l tables 4 and 5 3 1 3 iron and nitrate the highest concentration of iron was 0 15 mg l at sample site 15 the average was 0 0506 mg l across all samples tables 4 and 5 the highest nitrate concentration was 8 9 mg l at sample site 7 and the average across all sites was 1 79 mg l see tables 4 and 5 3 2 microbiological tests total coliform group indicator value can be used to estimate the cleanliness and safety of distribution systems unicef who 2017 escherichia coli indicator value it can be deemed the most suitable indicator of faecal human and animal contamination in most circumstances populations of thermotolerant coliforms are composed predominantly of e coli the presence of e coli or alternative thermotolerant coliforms should lead to investigation of potential pollution sources such as inadequate treatment or breaches in distribution system integrity who results of microbiological tests showed that the highest total coliform bacteria concentration was 1100 colony forming units cfu at sites 10 and 19 the average was 243 14 cfu the highest escherichia coli bacteria concentration was 460 cfu at sample site 10 and average 80 09 cfu see tables 4 and 5 3 3 water quality index water quality index of red sea state was assessed to estime thier suitability for drinking purposes the categories of water quality index was shown in table 6 and the calculated wqi values for each sampling location were shown in table 1 majority of samples sites were fall in unsuitable water index values sample site no 13 was categorized as excellent water resource and sites no 16 17 were categorized as good water resource the computed water quality index values were between 8 4936 and 889 04 to evaluate the general quality parameters of water we analysed the results belonging to all 20 sampling sites furthermore conformed with the international and national standard limits who ssmo to assess the safety parameters we made spatial variation maps of the water quality parameters tds cd pb ni total coliform and wqi by using geographic information system gis techniques as presented in fig 4 a b c d e and f assessment of spatial variation led to a better understanding of water resources quality in the study area that can helps for planning of new water projects heavy metals accumulation in water resources indicate that presence of natural or anthropogenic sources which constitute toxic pollutants which it may affect on human health bibi et al 2007 yang et al 2002 3 4 artificial neural network model for estimating wqi the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the network was identified by trial and error procedure the best performance was achieved when twelve neurons were applied in the hidden layer so the most appropriate model structure is 12 15 1 that means that the model consists of 12 input variables 15 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output layer fig 5 using a network training function that updates weight and bias values according to gradient descent with adaptive learning rate moreover the weights were adjusted by nonlinear sigmoid function the statistical results of the ann model for predicting monthly wqi during the training validation and testing stages which indicted the plotted data points generally correlated close towards the 1 1 line it was found that the r2 values of ann model was greater than 0 95 during training testing and validation which indicating a strong relationship between the wqi values from the traditional equation and those predicted by the ann model fig 5 shows the comparison of wqi values predicted by ann model versus the calculated method it can be observed that there is a good correlation between wqi of the ann model and the calculated method which are also consistent with the high values of statistical coefficient it was suggested that ann model showed much higher prediction accuracy in wqi modeling our research agrees with the previous investigation of abdel fattah et al 2020 who evaluated the irrigation water quality index iwqi through applying artificial neural network ann model abdel fattah et al 2020 our analysis shows that it is possible to construct a successful simple and faster model structure based on the ann to predict wqi with high accuracy 3 5 correlation analysis correlation coefficient were used to evaluate establish of the relationship between physical chemical and microbiological parameters we performed by using spearman s correlation matrix table 7 shows that for high positive and significant correlation the denotes value is r 0 7 and for significant and strong positive correlation the indicate r values were obtained r 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 physical and chemical parameters 4 1 1 heavy metals polluted drinking water by heavy metals can caused a serious health conditions such as kidney failure liver disease and some different cancer diseases which have harmful health effects these types of diseases are linked to high concentrations of heavy elements like cadmium chromium chromium copper lead manganese barium zinc and nickel 4 1 1 1 barium chromium manganese copper and zinc manganese is an important pollutant exposure to high concentrations in drinking water for many years has been correlated with toxic effects on the nervous system who 2008 that can producing syndrome similar to parkinson s disease especially for the elderly by the oral track manganese is often as one of the elements low toxic giri and singh 2015 among the various heavy metals high concentrations of chromium are known to cause various pulmonary disorders forti et al 2011 zinc and copper frequently not detected or detected in low quantities at all in water sources both elements were found in low concentrations in soils derived from granite wuta et al 2016 however copper is a factor that can cause cancer in humans kosaka et al 2007 also excessive intake of zinc has negative effects on the immunological system reduction in lymphocyte stimulation response and cholesterol metabolism goldhaber 2003 finally drinking large amounts of barium compounds that dissolve in water can cause changes in heart rhythm or paralysis in humans and accidental ingestion may cause gastroenteritis vomiting diarrhoea abdominal pain who 2001 has not been shown to occase cancer for humans or experimental animals drinking barium in water on the other hand department of health and human services dhhs international agency for research on cancer iarc and epa had not classified barium as carcinogenic atsdr 2007 zinc copper barium chromium and manganese concentration were obtained between 0 0082 0 264 0 0 0386 0 0 0584 0 0019 0 0507 and 0 0 0271 ppm respectively the maximum safe drinking water limits from who and ssmo were present in table 3 4 1 1 2 cadmium lead and nickel cadmium and lead are considered heavy toxic metals that are released into the aquatic environment through of the industrial activities such as mining and reflning of ores handy 1994 moreover cadmium and lead are naturally present in the groundwater of mountainous as a result of the weathering products of mining granodiorite and sandstone hume 1934 maynard 1983 also there are other sources such as the decomposed plants animal substances and atmospheric deposition of particulates can also contribute small amounts of these metals to neighbouring water sources johnson 1997 high levels of cadmium exposure can lead to kidney damage and hypertension while lead is a commutative poison and possible a human carcinogen or may also lead to significant respiratory damages husam malassa 2013 on the other hand nickel also is known to causing various pulmonary disorders forti et al 2011 cadmium lead and nickel concentration in samples were obtained between 0 0037 0 0247 0 0 643 and 0 0 0880 ppm ppm respectively all the water resources sites in this study had higher cadmium levels than the recommend limits while only one sample site had safe level of lead and seven sites had nickel concentration higher than recommended fig 6 a b and c spatial variation map of cd pb and ni fig 4 a b and c showed that most of the study area had a higher values than maximum limits low levels were found in northeastern parts 4 1 2 ph iron and nitrate water ph value is an important indicator of acidity or alkalinity of water the hydrogen ion of water does not have a direct negative impact on consumers and as an indirect result it can carried out modifications in some parameters of water quality including the primary chemical forming and survival of infectious microorganism s in the water bside it causing irritation of the digestive system in people who suffer from high sensitivity mkwate et al 2017 toure et al 2019 in this study the values of locations were between 6 57 8 38 which indicated that in line with the drinking water standard iron is commonly element encountered in rocks and soil which is found in large quantities in all types of water resources since it may be origin from soil or age old corroded iron pipes used although this metal has little attention as a health hazard and not poisonous borah et al 2010 tamrakar chirika shova 2013 but some researchers reported points out that is one of the most disturbing constituents in water supplies a high concentration of iron can have negative impacts on water supplies coloring water staining problems where water stands or affecting taste of water kosaka et al 2007 chung et al 2009 iron values in the study area were obtained between 0 001 and 0 15 mg l table 4 which indicates that it had conformed to drinking water standards a high levels of nitrate and nitrite in water resources has been associated with methaemoglobinaemia which is an often deadly disease for infants especially aged less than four months gao et al 2012 he et al 2016 bouwer 1978 the main sources that may arised nitrate contamination in surface and groundwater sources is the excessive use of fertilizers mixing of water with sewage and infiltration of other organic waste nitrate nitrite contamination is e common especially in areas with aggressive or acidic water the values of the study area were between 0 07 and 8 9 mg l it lower than who and ssmo standard limits 4 1 3 total dissolved solids tds dissolved solids in water resources contain many of numerous substances such as inorganic materials e g hydrogen carbonate ions chlorine salt calcium sulfate inorganic salt as well as organic materials come from a little dissolved organic synthesis who 2006 higher tds reduce water palatability and increases gastrointestinal irritation in consumers drinking water with a higher tds for extended periods can cause kidney stones therefore acceptable limits of tds are below 1200 mg l garg et al 2009 chung et al 2009 the maximum value of tds should be less than 1 000 mg l according to who ssmo our tds results showed values ranging between 103 5 and 8750 mg l however there were seven sites 1 2 3 10 11 15 and 20 exceeded the maximum standard level see fig 6 d spatial variation map of tds fig 4 e shown that large portions of the region have values less than maximum limit except areas in south eastern and north western parts 4 2 microbiological tests microbial quality of water resources is significantly important where it deteriorated can increase risks of waterborne diseases and may lead to disease outbreaks therefore it is imperative to increase the microbial safety of drinking water from watersheds to the consumer to prevent the contamination of drinking water or lessen contamination to levels that do not harm health safety is increased if the water resources are protected a proper operation of series treatment steps and management of distribution systems to conserve and protect treated water who 2006 detection of coliforms and the total bacterial number mainly covered the detection of microbes which are bacteria commonly found in the intestines of humans and mammals and are excreted outside the body in the dejection chlorine treatment can effectively prevent coliforms harm coliforms must be undetectable for water to be considered safe for drinking purposes uriuhare et al 1995 the presence of pathogenic microorganisms depends on the group of chemical and physical properties of the region and the group of animal sources and the nature of human activities that release pathogens into the environment the occurrence of coliform groups in water could be due to faecal pollution may come from sewage treatment facilities and household sewage tanks or discharge of farces by humus and other animals directly into water klein 1967 and yan and sadowsky 2007 also livestock has direct access to channel water in rural areas according to pujari et al 2007 the continuous consumption of contaminated water may cause serious health risks to the local population in this area especially for children 5 years suthar et al 2009 trabulsi lr 2002 concluded that typical enteropathogenic e coli strain is a leading cause of infantile diarrhoea especially in developing

significant and strong positive correlation was also observed between the total dissolved solids and nitrate likely because tds are content a variety of numerous substances as well as its contenting of soluble organic synthesis who 2006 5 conclusion and recommendations this study investigated the quality of the water resources in the red sea state in sudan and its suitability for the drinking uses we also assessed water quality compliance with the international standards from who and national standards from ssmo the highest concentration of cadmium lead chromium and nickel were observed in sample site 20 however the highest concentration of copper manganese and iron occurred in sample site 15 while the highest concentration of tds and nitrate were in sample site 3 ph zinc and barium had the highest values are samples sites 2 11 finally samples sites 10 and 19 obtained the highest microbial contamination the percentage of cadmium contaminated samples sites was 100 lead 95 nickel 35 total coliform group 70 and 55 escherichia coli copper barium chromium manganese zinc iron nitrate and ph were within the safe limits for drinking water according to the who and ssmo standard the percentage of the tests which did not conform to the safe limits were 28 57 in portsudan 21 42 suakin 25 39 gonob and oleeb 32 14 in halayeb locality the results showed that all study samples sites were tested whether ground or surface water did not conform to the national and international specifications for drinking water in two or more test parameters water quality index shown that 5 of water sample sites fall within excellent water 15 good water and 10 in poor quality level beside that 70 of water samples fall within unsuitable water according to water quality rating scale of wqi ann model with five hidden neurons was the most reliable one with high value of coefficient of determination r2 0 95 for training testing and validation ann can recognize the relation between the input and output parameters without explicit physical consideration the present study indicated that the ann model is more promising for wqi a great effort should be made to achieve the quality of drinking water in this region as possible those who are most at risk to contracting contaminated water related diseases are include infants young and children the elderly and people who suffer weakness or living unsanitary conditions this study recommended protection of water sources by utilizing concrete ductwork or transmission lines with large capacities to transfer water from the source to the city we also recommend imposing precautions to maintain the integrity of groundwater as a safe source of drinking water by preventing any activity that might harm water safety and use filters likewise we need to treat surface and groundwater before use methods for achieving this may include simple chemical treatments installing modern treatment stations to treat the pollution and or establishing a water safety plan wsp had become is internationally renowned as an important way to reducing the health risk from drinking water who has been advocating for this approach since 2004 and while it has been effective in some places these trends are particularly alarming in areas experiencing significant urban growth consequently protecting aquatic ecosystems are becoming increasingly challenging in

the management of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers all over the world these approaches have not been widely employed in all the coastal areas of the world lagos city a coastal region and one of the world s fastest growing megacities with rapidly increasing human population has her own share of depletion of groundwater resources which poses a high risk of saltwater intrusion with the potential pollution threatened at groundwater resources in seaside aquifers assessment of its chemistry for pollution standing and associated hydrogeochemical processes using hydrogeochemical tools water quality indices and statistical analysis factor analysis in ibeju lekki and ajah areas of lagos state are promptly desired results from this study will be useful in the management of groundwater resources in other megacities located along the coastal areas 2 study area 2 1 description of ajah and ibeju lekki communities the area under study comprises of coastal parts of lagos ajah and ibeju lekki communities covering about 445 km2 the two study areas are in the creek zone of tropical southwest nigeria between longitudes 3⁰ 45 and 4⁰ 15 n and latitudes 6⁰ 20 and 6⁰ 30 e fig 1 the proximity of the study areas to the atlantic ocean contributed to the longer periods of heavy precipitation events in these areas omenai and ayodele 2014 it experiences two wet periods with the highest quantity of rainfall between april and july and the lowest rainfall amount is recorded between october and november months iwugo et al 2003 talabi 2014 the ambient temperature in lagos range from 13 9 c to 37 3 c lagos fall under two vegetation types namely swamp forest and dry lowland rainforest of nigeria nwajide 2013 the swamp forests result from the blend of mangrove forest and coastal vegetation formed under the brackish conditions peculiar to coastal areas freshwater lagoons and estuaries access to ibeju lekki and ajah areas and construction activities are found to be challenging due to the swampy nature of the terrain the terrain of the study areas is near flat making it highly susceptible to flooding aftermath of heavy precipitation events ajah area is a naturally formed peninsula with human activities centering on trading farming and fishing the residents in ajah solely rely on groundwater resources tapped from hand dug wells and private boreholes for domestic and agricultural purposes sogbanmu et al 2019 ibeju lekki area is a suburban settlement which plays host to manufacturing business and warehousing activities at ibeju lekki domestic and agricultural water demand are met by groundwater resources in wells and private boreholes the proximity of the ibeju lekki area to the lagoon and the ocean allows for practice like fishing farming the large water bodies in ibeju lekki area serve as pathways for navigational purposes 2 2 geology and hydrogeology lagos falls in eastern portion of the dahomey basin and is underlain by the recent sediments and the coastal plain sands nwajide 2013 fig 2 the sediments are composed of variable shades of sands and clays with poor sorting characters and rarity of lignites jones and hockey 1964 the recent sediments are the major aquifer from which the populace tap their water through drilling of shallow boreholes and hand dug wells while the coastal plains sands aquifer serves as a multi aquifer system due to intercalations of sandy and clayey layers longe et al 1987 onwuka 1990 the recharge of the water table is done through infiltrating water of precipitation and occasional sea surge from sea level rise into the aquifers coastal plain sands aquifer has been classified into three namely recent sediments usually less than 2 m from the surface upper coastal plain sands ucps usually less than 30 m and lower coastal plain sands lcps usually between 200 and 250 m longe 2011 the aquifer formation of the present study falls under the upper coastal plain sands ucps which consists of alluvium material ucps has been exploited via hand dug wells boreholes and pipe borne waters for domestic municipal and industrial water supply the depth interval of this formation varies from 0 4 to 21 m lower than the ground level several studies have been carried out in several areas underlain by the coastal plain sands its aquifer depth range between 12 1 and 33 5 m with a mean of 26 1 m yield range from 33 0 to 77 6 m3 h and mean transmissivity value of 19 6 m3 h idowu et al 1998 coastal plain sands has been adjudged as the most proliferous aquiferous system in dahomey basin idowu et al 1998 olofinlade et al 2018 this aquifer system in relation to its shallow depth character unconfined is usually disposed to pollution from human activities and occasional sea water surge its total hardness range between 13 and 37 with mean value of 28 2 several researchers have assessed groundwater quality of similar aquifer systems representative of different parts of lagos state adebo and adetoyinbo 2009 akoteyon and soladoye 2011 balogun et al 2012 oladele et al 2012 soladoye 2014 these studies reveal abnormal high concentrations of chloride zinc and counts of escherichia coli in some water samples signaling the influence of seas water intrusion and land use activities urbanization and proximity to dumpsite these have threatened the potability of the waters in some parts of lagos the groundwater in the present study areas has not be tested for their suitability hence it makes the study appropriate and needful 3 materials and methods a total of fifty nine hand dug wells spreading across ajah twenty nine samples and ibeju lekki thirty samples areas were selected fig 1 spectrophotometric and titrimetric techniques were employed in the determination of anions so4 2 no3 cl and hco3 whereas atomic absorption spectrophotometric technique was employed in the determination of the cationic species ca2 mg2 na and k in the geochemistry laboratory at the federal university of technology akure following apha 1995 standards the dissolved cations and anions determined in ppm and epm units obtained from the laboratory serve as the major input data in the calculation of the pollution index of groundwater pig subba rao 2012 the results of the ionic balance for all the samples is 1 falling within standard limit of 5 calculation of six irrigation quality indices pi kr mar

present study this index permits the quantification of the position of relative influence of nine chemical parameters ph tds ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 and no3 on the groundwater quality table 1 the calculation involves five consecutive steps beginning with assigning weight to every chemical parameter varying from 1 to 5 in relation to their influence on human health rw a relative weight and value assigned to each chemical parameter in relation to their influence on human health the lowest weight 1 was allotted to k and supreme weight 5 to ph tds no3 and so4 2 calculation of weight factor wp for the nine chemical parameters allows accurate evaluation of their contribution to the whole water worth eq 9 calculation of concentration sc was made by dividing the measured value c for each chemical parameter nine chemical variables content from each groundwater sample by its individual standard water quality verge limit ds eq 10 world health organization who 2012 c is the measured value for each chemical parameter ph tds etc the total quality of water ow was calculated by the product of wp with sc eq 11 finally the pollution index of groundwater pig was obtained by the summation of ow values obtained from the nine chemical variables for each groundwater samples σow eq 12 this provides insight into the influence and degree of contamination on the coastal aquifer system of lagos area 9 wp r w r w 10 sc c d s 11 ow wp sc 12 pig ow during the pig assessment the participation and contribution of all the chemical variables per each groundwater sample was put into explanation and consideration the values obtained for chemical quality of water ow in relation to every chemical parameter involved in this study are very critical in the assessment such that when ow is greater than 0 1 this infers that the specific chemical parameter constitutes about 10 of the total pig value it also indicates perfect evidence on the potential and activity of the chemical parameter putting stress to the quality of groundwater resource subba rao 2012 the hydrogeochemical processes of groundwaters have been well understood through the behavior of ionic ratios na cl cl hco3 ca mg in several studies appelo and postma 2005 barzegar et al 2018 the following ionic ratios na cl cl hco3 and ca mg were calculated to understand the prevailing hydrogeochemical process and quality of the coastal groundwater the results obtained from the ionic ratios were categorized based on the standards for instance water is said to saline and non saline when na cl values are lower than 1 and greater than 1 respectively evidence of sea water intrusion is observed when ca mg is greater than 1 and when lower than 1 sea water intrusion no longer takes place the general classification of waters according to cl hco3 ratio is presented in table 2 high values of cl hco3 usually suggest the presence of seawater intrusion activities mondal et al 2008 senthilkumar et al 2019 corrosivity ratio a numerical economical index provides accurate information about water supply especially in the reticulation of water from source to end users deductions and knowledge of cr usually guide the mode of transportation of irrigation water via low cost plastic pipes or metallic pipes cost effective especially when the drainage is long ryner 1944 raman 1985 rawat et al 2018 however during reticulation water can get contaminated thereby impairing the quality of the water water with cr value 1 is usually recommended for transportation through all types of pipes due to its non corrosiveness whereas cr values 1 indicates the corrosive nature of water which suggests transportation route made solely of plastic pipes balasubramanian 1986 shankar et al 2014 corrosivity ratio is calculated for all the fifty nine wells using equation 13 13 cr cl 35 2 so 4 96 cl hc 03 100 ions are in epm 4 results and discussion 4 1 pollution status the pig for all the samples is between 0 17 and 0 84 with mean value of 0 35 table 3 all the water falls under the insignificant pollutant category subba rao 2012 table 4 a since the pig values fall into this category further explanation about the range of pig values was negligible for this study this show no pollution threat to the groundwater from ibeju lekki and ajah areas however ph tends to have more effect on the pollution index of groundwater due to its highest mean value of 0 12 table 4 b the ph values range from 5 10 slightly acidic to 8 10 slightly basic table 5 sulphate reduction is the only suggested process that is linkable to hydrogen ion concentration in coastal environment this suggests the imprints of anthropogenic activities to be the source of sulphate in the two study areas 4 2 suitability of groundwater for irrigation the sar results vary from 0 37 to 4 98 with mean value of 1 59 groundwater samples thereby lie within excellent class of eaton 1950 irrigation category ssp values show contrast from 12 56 to 60 66 averaging with value of 42 53 thirty four 34 one 1 and twenty four 24 water samples fall into doubtful excellent and good under eaton 1950 categories respectively for irrigation purposes tables 5 and 6 mar values range from 24 01 to 93 99 with mean value of 64 59 eighteen and forty one water samples fall under suitable and unsuitable for irrigation purposes following magnesium adsorption ratio classification paliwal 1972 with application in several studies asiwaju bello et al 2013 adewumi et al 2018 olofinlade et al 2018 rsc values vary from 1 38 to 9 04 with average value of 2 38 twenty one 21 nineteen 19 and nineteen 19 samples plunge into doubtful excellent and good groups respectively for irrigation purposes in comparison to eaton 1950 rsc classification kr values starts from 0 11 to 1 46 with an average value of 0 68 fifty one water samples fall under safe for irrigation while eight are unsafe for irrigation purpose according to kelley s ratio classification and applied in other studies kelley 1940 asiwaju bello et al 2013 the implications of the results from all the six irrigation water quality indices show that the groundwater resources from ibeju lekki and ajah areas would pose no threat to farming and agricultural practices when applied 4 3 hydrogeochemical processes 4 3 1 piper diagram the general order for the cations and anions were na ca mg k and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 respectively table 6 the piper plots figs 3 and 4 of the groundwater samples for the study areas classify the groundwater type into two contrasting water types order mixed camgcl nacl ca hco3 mixed canahco3 type and ca hco3 mixed camgcl nacl type for ajah and ibeju lekki areas respectively in total the camgcl mixed facies were twenty seven samples from the set of fifty nine water samples collected from the two study areas table 6 waters of this type facies is a strong indicator of pollution from two potential sources jeyaraj et al 2016 the first source of pollution can be traceable to the mingling of salinized water originated from occasional sea surge with the groundwater in the unconfined coastal aquifers of ibeju lekki and ajah areas the second source of pollution is attributed to anthropogenic activities through the discharge of wastewater into the shallow water systems unconfined aquifers of the two study areas the chemistry of this facies also reveals the dominance of alkaline earths and strong acidic anions over alkali metals and weak acidic anions the ca hco3 type facies is the second dominant water facies with a total of seventeen samples from fifty nine water samples table 6 this facies reflect the dissolution of silicate minerals due to water rock contact and recharge by precipitation mondal et al 2012 this also indicate pure natural groundwater venkatramanan et al 2017 nacl facies with fourteen samples indicate high salinity water the presence of this salinity from is water type is not unexpected in coastal areas and traceable to the occasional sea surge and domestic wastewater infiltrating into the water of this area only one sample fall into the mixed canahco3 water type region table 6 this water facies are usually fashioned from recharging water and silicate minerals present in the coastal aquifers along the flow pathway batabyal 2018 oyedele et al 2019 this however depend on the residence time and aquifer materials type no water sample fall into the ca cl and na hco3water type facies signaling the absent of activities leading to dissolution of carbonate bearing minerals in the subsurface oyedele et al 2019 4 3 2 ionic ratios ca mg ionic ratio results range from 0 06 to 3 16 table 7 with 69 of the groundwater samples showing traces of intrusion of sea water into the aquifers of the study area the remaining 32 groundwater samples did not show contribution from sea water the values of na cl which range from 0 20 to 2 89 table 7 also corroborate the findings of ca mg ratios the values of na cl points that the chemistry of all the groundwater samples is traceable to reversible mode of ionic exchange and chloride contribution from sea water surge this was accompanied by dual sea water surge and high rise in water table a regular occurrence in shallow coastal aquifers thereby making the groundwater saline flushing process is non evident in the coastal groundwaters of the coastal plain sandy aquifer the results obtained from na cl ratios also strongly confirmed the strong stand of sodium ion being non displaceable by calcium and magnesium ions in the coastal waters the na cl results also favor the coastal origin of the groundwaters than the continental origin the cl hco3 ratios which ranges from 0 07 to 1 74 show predominantly that the coastal groundwaters belong to the uncontaminated category while others fall into slightly and moderately contaminated categories the values obtained from corrosivity ratios also attested to the fact that 85 of the groundwater samples are greater than 1 this indicate the corrosive nature of the water with negative and adverse effect during the transportation corrosive waters like these will urgently warrant the use of plastic pvc pipes for transportation and reticulation of water into homes and industries olabode et al 2020 4 3 3 chloro alkaline index of the coastal groundwater samples the chloro alkaline index values showed an ion exchange response existing in the bulk of waters these waters have positive values signaling chloro alkaline equilibrium of which the na ions would be swapped for the alkaline earths ca mg hco₃ denoted as a base interchange hardened water type handa 1969 cai 1 values range from 5 91 to 0 48 with mean value of 0 70 cai 2 range from 0 83 to 0 26 with mean value of 0 13 table 1 wells with negative cai 1 2 values indicate ionic interchange signifying exchange amid calcium and magnesium in groundwater through dissolved sodium and potassium ions in the upper coastal plain aquifer materials however most cai 1 and 2 values are lower than zero making stronger direct ion exchange reactions in the coastal plain sandy aquifer 4 3 4 gibbs plot gp out of fifty nine samples representative of upper coastal plain sands ucps aquifers for the study area ibeju lekki and ajah fifty seven samples fall into the rock dominance water rock interaction and two samples fall in the evaporation dominance figs 5 and 6 water rock interaction due to permeable nature of the coastal plain sands is the dominant process the groundwater hydrogeochemical process influencing the groundwater quality the effect of precipitation rainfall prevailing in the coastal area aided the dilution of the hydrochemistry and causes increased flow of groundwater in the shallow coastal unconfined aquifer systems absence of samples in atmospheric dominance from the aquifer is probable to be triggered through fast infiltration course induced dense vegetation and higher permeability attributes of coastal plain sands 4 3 5 multivariate statistical analysis the outcomes of the multivariate statistical analyses are presented in table 8 for accurate interpretation principal components with eigen values greater than 1 are usually taken into consideration varol and davraz 2015 bon et al 2020 three principal components namely pc1 pc2 and pc3 have their eigen values greater than 1 were extracted for the present study the analysis also revealed that these three main components accounted for 86 82 of the total variance of all data pc1 pc2 and pc3 explains 64 13 13 42 and 9 26 of the entire variance respectively the values of tds ec cl so4 no3 mg and na show strong loading 0 84 0 94 cl ca and k show 0 69 0 74 moderate positive loading on the principal component 1 according to selvakumar et al 2017 pcs classification revealed only ph has moderate and strong positive loading on the principal component 2 and 3 with other chemical parameters falling within weak loading categories the combined moderate and strong loading of all the cations and anions in pc1 suggest the active role of hydrogeochemical processes in the mineral enrichment of the waters strong and moderate positive loading of sodium and potassium ions indicated dissolution of the loose unconsolidated coastal plain sands and various ion interchange processes in the unconfined upper coastal plain coastal aquifers of lagos okiongbo and douglas 2015 values showing moderate positive loading of bicarbonates ions also support the natural weathering sources of dissolved ions elango et al 2003 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 and could have result from the response action between feldspar rich minerals with carbonic acid at the incidence of water the strong loading of sodium and chloride also suggest the imprint of sea water intrusion peculiar to this coastal environment while sulphates and nitrates suggest imprint of pollution from anthropogenic activities the natural weathering and sea water intrusion activities are supported by the pervious character of the coastal plain sands and alluvial deposits potassium ion concentration in the groundwater under assessment have been linked to the leaching of the feldspar minerals in the underlying lithologies and aquifer materials love et al 2004 strong factor loading of sodium specifies the base interchange route responsible for substitution of sodium ion by calcium ion kannel et al 2007 utmost amount of co2 is consequent from remains of plant decay in the unsaturated media and the atmosphere it could also result from formation of bicarbonate through the association of water rainwater or groundwater and co2 activities such as weathering of the underlying lithologies leaching and ionic interchange could several influencers on the coastal groundwater chemistry in the areas under assessment magnesium ion concentration in the groundwater under study was credited to the ion interchange activities in clay mineral in pcs 2 and 3 only ph has strong factor due to the contribution of co2 via atmosphere and biogenic in the unsaturated media venkatramanan et al 2015 singh and saxena 2004 5 conclusion the present hydrogeochemical study reveals relative mean concentration of the dissolved positive ions cations and negative ions anions in a decreasing order na mg2 ca2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 respectively this has yielded insignificant or pollutant status at present of waters to the populace of ibeju lekki and ajah areas the results obtained from the ionic ratios however disagree from the pig and affirm the polluted state of the coastal groundwaters deductions made from piper gibbs plots chloro alkaline indices and ionic ratios results showed that hydrogeochemical processes such as imprints of natural weathering occasional sea water surge and anthropogenic activities have affected the groundwater quality of this water this was also confirmed by diverse forms of hydrogeochemical processes natural geological forces sea water intrusion and municipal contamination acting on the coastal groundwater quality through the multivariate statistical analysis hydrogeochemical processes tied with the permeable nature of the aquifer materials and high precipitation may stimulate groundwater flow that will eventually lead to rapid spread of pollutants in the study areas and eventually the human health may be at risk in the nearest future funding this study received no funding from any agency rather the study was borne out from the problem of sea water intrusion prevailing in the ibeju lekki

the study of salinity of coastal aquifers include hydrogeochemistry geophysics and modelling of saltwater freshwater interface bonnesen et al 2009 carrera et al 2010 hugman et al 2017 jørgensen et al 2012 misut and voss 2007 these interventions have broadened the understanding of the dynamics in groundwater flow and pattern siting of boreholes in identified freshwater aquifers and ultimately in the management of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers all over the world these approaches have not been widely employed in all the coastal areas of the world lagos city a coastal region and one of the world s fastest growing megacities with rapidly increasing human population has her own share of depletion of groundwater resources which poses a high risk of saltwater intrusion with the potential pollution threatened at groundwater resources in seaside aquifers assessment of its chemistry for pollution standing and associated hydrogeochemical processes using hydrogeochemical tools water quality indices and statistical analysis factor analysis in ibeju lekki and ajah areas of lagos state are promptly desired results from this study will be useful in the management of groundwater resources in other megacities located along the coastal areas 2 study area 2 1 description of ajah and ibeju lekki communities the area under study comprises of coastal parts of lagos ajah and ibeju lekki communities covering about 445 km2 the two study areas are in the creek zone of tropical southwest nigeria between longitudes 3⁰ 45 and 4⁰ 15 n and latitudes 6⁰ 20 and 6⁰ 30 e fig 1 the proximity of the study areas to the atlantic ocean contributed to the longer periods of heavy precipitation events in these areas omenai and ayodele 2014 it experiences two wet periods with the highest quantity of rainfall between april and july and the lowest rainfall amount is recorded between october and november months iwugo et al 2003 talabi 2014 the ambient temperature in lagos range from 13 9 c to 37 3 c lagos fall under two vegetation types namely swamp forest and dry lowland rainforest of nigeria nwajide 2013 the swamp forests result from the blend of mangrove forest and coastal vegetation formed under the brackish conditions peculiar to coastal areas freshwater lagoons and estuaries access to ibeju lekki and ajah areas and construction activities are found to be challenging due to the swampy nature of the terrain the terrain of the study areas is near flat making it highly susceptible to flooding aftermath of heavy precipitation events ajah area is a naturally formed peninsula with human activities centering on trading farming and fishing the residents in ajah solely rely on groundwater resources tapped from hand dug wells and private boreholes for domestic and agricultural purposes sogbanmu et al 2019 ibeju lekki area is a suburban settlement which plays host to manufacturing business and warehousing activities at ibeju lekki domestic and agricultural water demand are met by groundwater resources in wells and private boreholes the proximity of the ibeju lekki area to the lagoon and the ocean allows for practice like fishing farming the large water bodies in ibeju lekki area serve as pathways for navigational purposes 2 2 geology and hydrogeology lagos falls in eastern portion of the dahomey basin and is underlain by the recent sediments and the coastal plain sands nwajide 2013 fig 2 the sediments are composed of variable shades of sands and clays with poor sorting characters and rarity of lignites jones and hockey 1964 the recent sediments are the major aquifer from which the populace tap their water through drilling of shallow boreholes and hand dug wells while the coastal plains sands aquifer serves as a multi aquifer system due to intercalations of sandy and clayey layers longe et al 1987 onwuka 1990 the recharge of the water table is done through infiltrating water of precipitation and occasional sea surge from sea level rise into the aquifers coastal plain sands aquifer has been classified into three namely recent sediments usually less than 2 m from the surface upper coastal plain sands ucps usually less than 30 m and lower coastal plain sands lcps usually between 200 and 250 m longe 2011 the aquifer formation of the present study falls under the upper coastal plain sands ucps which consists of alluvium material ucps has been exploited via hand dug wells boreholes and pipe borne waters for domestic municipal and industrial water supply the depth interval of this formation varies from 0 4 to 21 m lower than the ground level several studies have been carried out in several areas underlain by the coastal plain sands its aquifer depth range between 12 1 and 33 5 m with a mean of 26 1 m yield range from 33 0 to 77 6 m3 h and mean transmissivity value of 19 6 m3 h idowu et al 1998 coastal plain sands has been adjudged as the most proliferous aquiferous system in dahomey basin idowu et al 1998 olofinlade et al 2018 this aquifer system in relation to its shallow depth character unconfined is usually disposed to pollution from human activities and occasional sea water surge its total hardness range between 13 and 37 with mean value of 28 2 several researchers have assessed groundwater quality of similar aquifer systems representative of different parts of lagos state adebo and adetoyinbo 2009 akoteyon and soladoye 2011 balogun et al 2012 oladele et al 2012 soladoye 2014 these studies reveal abnormal high concentrations of chloride zinc and counts of escherichia coli in some water samples signaling the influence of seas water intrusion and land use activities urbanization and proximity to dumpsite these have threatened the potability of the waters in some parts of lagos the groundwater in the present study areas has not be tested for their suitability hence it makes the study appropriate and needful 3 materials and methods a total of fifty nine hand dug wells spreading across ajah twenty nine samples and ibeju lekki thirty samples areas were selected fig 1 spectrophotometric and titrimetric techniques were employed in the determination of anions so4 2 no3 cl and hco3 whereas atomic absorption spectrophotometric technique was employed in the determination of the cationic species ca2 mg2 na and k in the geochemistry laboratory at the federal university of technology akure following apha 1995 standards the dissolved cations and anions determined in ppm and epm units obtained from the laboratory serve as the major input data in the calculation of the pollution index of groundwater pig subba rao 2012 the results of the ionic balance for all the samples is 1 falling within standard limit of 5 calculation of six irrigation quality indices pi kr mar

present study this index permits the quantification of the position of relative influence of nine chemical parameters ph tds ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 and no3 on the groundwater quality table 1 the calculation involves five consecutive steps beginning with assigning weight to every chemical parameter varying from 1 to 5 in relation to their influence on human health rw a relative weight and value assigned to each chemical parameter in relation to their influence on human health the lowest weight 1 was allotted to k and supreme weight 5 to ph tds no3 and so4 2 calculation of weight factor wp for the nine chemical parameters allows accurate evaluation of their contribution to the whole water worth eq 9 calculation of concentration sc was made by dividing the measured value c for each chemical parameter nine chemical variables content from each groundwater sample by its individual standard water quality verge limit ds eq 10 world health organization who 2012 c is the measured value for each chemical parameter ph tds etc the total quality of water ow was calculated by the product of wp with sc eq 11 finally the pollution index of groundwater pig was obtained by the summation of ow values obtained from the nine chemical variables for each groundwater samples σow eq 12 this provides insight into the influence and degree of contamination on the coastal aquifer system of lagos area 9 wp r w r w 10 sc c d s 11 ow wp sc 12 pig ow during the pig assessment the participation and contribution of all the chemical variables per each groundwater sample was put into explanation and consideration the values obtained for chemical quality of water ow in relation to every chemical parameter involved in this study are very critical in the assessment such that when ow is greater than 0 1 this infers that the specific chemical parameter constitutes about 10 of the total pig value it also indicates perfect evidence on the potential and activity of the chemical parameter putting stress to the quality of groundwater resource subba rao 2012 the hydrogeochemical processes of groundwaters have been well understood through the behavior of ionic ratios na cl cl hco3 ca mg in several studies appelo and postma 2005 barzegar et al 2018 the following ionic ratios na cl cl hco3 and ca mg were calculated to understand the prevailing hydrogeochemical process and quality of the coastal groundwater the results obtained from the ionic ratios were categorized based on the standards for instance water is said to saline and non saline when na cl values are lower than 1 and greater than 1 respectively evidence of sea water intrusion is observed when ca mg is greater than 1 and when lower than 1 sea water intrusion no longer takes place the general classification of waters according to cl hco3 ratio is presented in table 2 high values of cl hco3 usually suggest the presence of seawater intrusion activities mondal et al 2008 senthilkumar et al 2019 corrosivity ratio a numerical economical index provides accurate information about water supply especially in the reticulation of water from source to end users deductions and knowledge of cr usually guide the mode of transportation of irrigation water via low cost plastic pipes or metallic pipes cost effective especially when the drainage is long ryner 1944 raman 1985 rawat et al 2018 however during reticulation water can get contaminated thereby impairing the quality of the water water with cr value 1 is usually recommended for transportation through all types of pipes due to its non corrosiveness whereas cr values 1 indicates the corrosive nature of water which suggests transportation route made solely of plastic pipes balasubramanian 1986 shankar et al 2014 corrosivity ratio is calculated for all the fifty nine wells using equation 13 13 cr cl 35 2 so 4 96 cl hc 03 100 ions are in epm 4 results and discussion 4 1 pollution status the pig for all the samples is between 0 17 and 0 84 with mean value of 0 35 table 3 all the water falls under the insignificant pollutant category subba rao 2012 table 4 a since the pig values fall into this category further explanation about the range of pig values was negligible for this study this show no pollution threat to the groundwater from ibeju lekki and ajah areas however ph tends to have more effect on the pollution index of groundwater due to its highest mean value of 0 12 table 4 b the ph values range from 5 10 slightly acidic to 8 10 slightly basic table 5 sulphate reduction is the only suggested process that is linkable to hydrogen ion concentration in coastal environment this suggests the imprints of anthropogenic activities to be the source of sulphate in the two study areas 4 2 suitability of groundwater for irrigation the sar results vary from 0 37 to 4 98 with mean value of 1 59 groundwater samples thereby lie within excellent class of eaton 1950 irrigation category ssp values show contrast from 12 56 to 60 66 averaging with value of 42 53 thirty four 34 one 1 and twenty four 24 water samples fall into doubtful excellent and good under eaton 1950 categories respectively for irrigation purposes tables 5 and 6 mar values range from 24 01 to 93 99 with mean value of 64 59 eighteen and forty one water samples fall under suitable and unsuitable for irrigation purposes following magnesium adsorption ratio classification paliwal 1972 with application in several studies asiwaju bello et al 2013 adewumi et al 2018 olofinlade et al 2018 rsc values vary from 1 38 to 9 04 with average value of 2 38 twenty one 21 nineteen 19 and nineteen 19 samples plunge into doubtful excellent and good groups respectively for irrigation purposes in comparison to eaton 1950 rsc classification kr values starts from 0 11 to 1 46 with an average value of 0 68 fifty one water samples fall under safe for irrigation while eight are unsafe for irrigation purpose according to kelley s ratio classification and applied in other studies kelley 1940 asiwaju bello et al 2013 the implications of the results from all the six irrigation water quality indices show that the groundwater resources from ibeju lekki and ajah areas would pose no threat to farming and agricultural practices when applied 4 3 hydrogeochemical processes 4 3 1 piper diagram the general order for the cations and anions were na ca mg k and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 respectively table 6 the piper plots figs 3 and 4 of the groundwater samples for the study areas classify the groundwater type into two contrasting water types order mixed camgcl nacl ca hco3 mixed canahco3 type and ca hco3 mixed camgcl nacl type for ajah and ibeju lekki areas respectively in total the camgcl mixed facies were twenty seven samples from the set of fifty nine water samples collected from the two study areas table 6 waters of this type facies is a strong indicator of pollution from two potential sources jeyaraj et al 2016 the first source of pollution can be traceable to the mingling of salinized water originated from occasional sea surge with the groundwater in the unconfined coastal aquifers of ibeju lekki and ajah areas the second source of pollution is attributed to anthropogenic activities through the discharge of wastewater into the shallow water systems unconfined aquifers of the two study areas the chemistry of this facies also reveals the dominance of alkaline earths and strong acidic anions over alkali metals and weak acidic anions the ca hco3 type facies is the second dominant water facies with a total of seventeen samples from fifty nine water samples table 6 this facies reflect the dissolution of silicate minerals due to water rock contact and recharge by precipitation mondal et al 2012 this also indicate pure natural groundwater venkatramanan et al 2017 nacl facies with fourteen samples indicate high salinity water the presence of this salinity from is water type is not unexpected in coastal areas and traceable to the occasional sea surge and domestic wastewater infiltrating into the water of this area only one sample fall into the mixed canahco3 water type region table 6 this water facies are usually fashioned from recharging water and silicate minerals present in the coastal aquifers along the flow pathway batabyal 2018 oyedele et al 2019 this however depend on the residence time and aquifer materials type no water sample fall into the ca cl and na hco3water type facies signaling the absent of activities leading to dissolution of carbonate bearing minerals in the subsurface oyedele et al 2019 4 3 2 ionic ratios ca mg ionic ratio results range from 0 06 to 3 16 table 7 with 69 of the groundwater samples showing traces of intrusion of sea water into the aquifers of the study area the remaining 32 groundwater samples did not show contribution from sea water the values of na cl which range from 0 20 to 2 89 table 7 also corroborate the findings of ca mg ratios the values of na cl points that the chemistry of all the groundwater samples is traceable to reversible mode of ionic exchange and chloride contribution from sea water surge this was accompanied by dual sea water surge and high rise in water table a regular occurrence in shallow coastal aquifers thereby making the groundwater saline flushing process is non evident in the coastal groundwaters of the coastal plain sandy aquifer the results obtained from na cl ratios also strongly confirmed the strong stand of sodium ion being non displaceable by calcium and magnesium ions in the coastal waters the na cl results also favor the coastal origin of the groundwaters than the continental origin the cl hco3 ratios which ranges from 0 07 to 1 74 show predominantly that the coastal groundwaters belong to the uncontaminated category while others fall into slightly and moderately contaminated categories the values obtained from corrosivity ratios also attested to the fact that 85 of the groundwater samples are greater than 1 this indicate the corrosive nature of the water with negative and adverse effect during the transportation corrosive waters like these will urgently warrant the use of plastic pvc pipes for transportation and reticulation of water into homes and industries olabode et al 2020 4 3 3 chloro alkaline index of the coastal groundwater samples the chloro alkaline index values showed an ion exchange response existing in the bulk of waters these waters have positive values signaling chloro alkaline equilibrium of which the na ions would be swapped for the alkaline earths ca mg hco₃ denoted as a base interchange hardened water type handa 1969 cai 1 values range from 5 91 to 0 48 with mean value of 0 70 cai 2 range from 0 83 to 0 26 with mean value of 0 13 table 1 wells with negative cai 1 2 values indicate ionic interchange signifying exchange amid calcium and magnesium in groundwater through dissolved sodium and potassium ions in the upper coastal plain aquifer materials however most cai 1 and 2 values are lower than zero making stronger direct ion exchange reactions in the coastal plain sandy aquifer 4 3 4 gibbs plot gp out of fifty nine samples representative of upper coastal plain sands ucps aquifers for the study area ibeju lekki and ajah fifty seven samples fall into the rock dominance water rock interaction and two samples fall in the evaporation dominance figs 5 and 6 water rock interaction due to permeable nature of the coastal plain sands is the dominant process the groundwater hydrogeochemical process influencing the groundwater quality the effect of precipitation rainfall prevailing in the coastal area aided the dilution of the hydrochemistry and causes increased flow of groundwater in the shallow coastal unconfined aquifer systems absence of samples in atmospheric dominance from the aquifer is probable to be triggered through fast infiltration course induced dense vegetation and higher permeability attributes of coastal plain sands 4 3 5 multivariate statistical analysis the outcomes of the multivariate statistical analyses are presented in table 8 for accurate interpretation principal components with eigen values greater than 1 are usually taken into consideration varol and davraz 2015 bon et al 2020 three principal components namely pc1 pc2 and pc3 have their eigen values greater than 1 were extracted for the present study the analysis also revealed that these three main components accounted for 86 82 of the total variance of all data pc1 pc2 and pc3 explains 64 13 13 42 and 9 26 of the entire variance respectively the values of tds ec cl so4 no3 mg and na show strong loading 0 84 0 94 cl ca and k show 0 69 0 74 moderate positive loading on the principal component 1 according to selvakumar et al 2017 pcs classification revealed only ph has moderate and strong positive loading on the principal component 2 and 3 with other chemical parameters falling within weak loading categories the combined moderate and strong loading of all the cations and anions in pc1 suggest the active role of hydrogeochemical processes in the mineral enrichment of the waters strong and moderate positive loading of sodium and potassium ions indicated dissolution of the loose unconsolidated coastal plain sands and various ion interchange processes in the unconfined upper coastal plain coastal aquifers of lagos okiongbo and douglas 2015 values showing moderate positive loading of bicarbonates ions also support the natural weathering sources of dissolved ions elango et al 2003 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 and could have result from the response action between feldspar rich minerals with carbonic acid at the incidence of water the strong loading of sodium and chloride also suggest the imprint of sea water intrusion peculiar to this coastal environment while sulphates and nitrates suggest imprint of pollution from anthropogenic activities the natural weathering and sea water intrusion activities are supported by the pervious character of the coastal plain sands and alluvial deposits potassium ion concentration in the groundwater under assessment have been linked to the leaching of the feldspar minerals in the underlying lithologies and aquifer materials love et al 2004 strong factor loading of sodium specifies the base interchange route responsible for substitution of sodium ion by calcium ion kannel et al 2007 utmost amount of co2 is consequent from remains of plant decay in the unsaturated media and the atmosphere it could also result from formation of bicarbonate through the association of water rainwater or groundwater and co2 activities such as weathering of the underlying lithologies leaching and ionic interchange could several influencers on the coastal groundwater chemistry in the areas under assessment magnesium ion concentration in the groundwater under study was credited to the ion interchange activities in clay mineral in pcs 2 and 3 only ph has strong factor due to the contribution of co2 via atmosphere and biogenic in the unsaturated media venkatramanan et al 2015 singh and saxena 2004 5 conclusion the present hydrogeochemical study reveals relative mean concentration of the dissolved positive ions cations and negative ions anions in a decreasing order na mg2 ca2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 respectively this has yielded insignificant or pollutant status at present of waters to the populace of ibeju lekki and ajah areas the results obtained from the ionic ratios however disagree from the pig and affirm the polluted state of the coastal groundwaters deductions made from piper gibbs plots chloro alkaline indices and ionic ratios results showed that hydrogeochemical processes such as imprints of natural weathering occasional sea water surge and anthropogenic activities have affected the groundwater quality of this water this was also confirmed by diverse forms of hydrogeochemical processes natural geological forces sea water intrusion and municipal contamination acting on the coastal groundwater quality through the multivariate statistical analysis hydrogeochemical processes tied with the permeable nature of the aquifer materials and high precipitation may stimulate groundwater flow that will eventually lead to rapid spread of pollutants in the study areas and eventually the human health may be at risk in the nearest future funding this study received no funding from any agency rather the study was borne out from the problem of sea water intrusion prevailing in the ibeju lekki and ajah areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work
