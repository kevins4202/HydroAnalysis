22435,when a very large floating structure vlfs is deployed not far from the shore line or near the island the ocean waves and hydroelastic responses of vlfs could be greatly influenced by the complicated topography and inhomogeneous wave based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory a three step time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established called boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method an eight module semi submersible vlfs is studied for numerical assessment using rmfc rigid module flexible connecto model meanwhile the wave evolution simulation is carried out based on boussinesq equation the motions of each module and connector loads are investigated by considering the depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous wave furthermore the model test is carried out in wave tank for validating the correctness of the numerical results and the boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method there is significant shelter effect on the floating bodies arranged behind the island when the water depth is assumed to be constant by ignoring the influence of seabed topography the load of connectors will be underestimated keywords vlfs hydroelasticity connector load boussinesq equation time domain 1 introduction in the past three decades extensive investigations have been carried out on hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in deep open seas in usa ertekin et al 1993 wu et al 1993 riggs et al 2000 japan kashiwagi 1999 and china fu et al 2007 yang and gu 2015 the seabed topography near islands is usually rugged and the water depth can change from tens of meters to a few meters in a short distance far field waves advancing towards the shore will experience a complex evolution on the shoal in this environment the hydrodynamic responses of a floating structure will be largely affected by the non uniform wave pattern and changing seabed and can be quite different from the general responses of a platform in waves with uniform water depth and homogeneous wave madsen et al 1991 utsunomiya et al 2001 sun et al 2003 belibassakis and athanassoulis 2006 kyoung et al 2005 sturova 2008 utsunomiya et al 2008 belibassakis 2008 ding et al 2017 wei et al 2018 ding et al 2019 yang et al 2019 a coupled mode method has been developed and applied to hydroelastic analysis of large floating platforms of shallow draft over variable bathymetry regions characterized by parallel bottom contours belibassakis and athanassoulis 2006 a direct coupled method has been established on the basis of the boussinesq equations outer region and rankine source method inner region to analyze the hydroelastic responses of floating bodies near islands and reefs ding et al 2017 but the implementation is difficult and time consuming then a simplified method is taken to consider the influence of the incident wave through each module of vlfs with different wave direction wave height and wave period wei et al 2018 ding et al 2019 the principle is different modules adopt different wave parameters including wave direction wave height wave period which is too rough on the other hand three different scale models have been adopted to calculate the wave parameters around the vlfs and the hydroelastic responses of a 3 module vlfs have been analyzed coupled with depth varying seabed yang et al 2019 which considers the influence of depth varying seabed and corresponding wave parameters change in local mode the method cannot entirely consider the complex phenomena of wave evolution on changing terrain around the vlfs but only the diffraction effect in the process of wave propagation from deep open sea to the shallow water near islands and reefs complex phenomena will occur due to the effects of water depth such as reflection diffraction refraction fragmentation shallow water deformation bottom friction obstacles and current in the analysis of coastal wave evolution mechanism the more famous models are mild slope equation berkhoff 1972 kirby 1984 kirby and dalrymple 1986 boussinesq equation peregrine 1967 wei and kirby 1995 wei et al 1995 and g n theory green et al 1974 green and naghdi 1987 zhao 2010 which are completely solving in time domain since its own hypothesis of slowly varying seabed topography and the difficulty of classical mild slope equation in considering wave reflection phenomena mild slope equation is more suitable for the calculation of relatively gentle topography in the sea area for the areas around the reef where the water depth varies sharply the applicability of the equation is not suitable on the other hand g n theory does not abandon any higher order terms so it is a fully non linear wave theory which is more suitable for solving the wave surface changes of non linear waves however the momentum equation in g n theory is approximately satisfied so the accuracy of solving the velocity and pressure fields is not high enough to meet requirements of the wave height velocity and pressure which is required for solving dynamic response of three dimensional floating structures near island reef taking the above factors into account the boussinesq equation is selected here to solve the wave field parameters which is to be used as the fluid field input information later for solving the hydroelastic responses of the floating structures near islands for considering the depth varying seabed and complex effects of wave evolution based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory cummins 1962 a time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established a three step method is proposed to consider the nonlinear wave effect firstly wave evolution was analyzed using boussinesq equation in time domain by neglecting the existence of vlfs secondly using coupled hydrodynamic model the hydroelastic response analysis in frequency domain is carried out by considering depth varying seabed then the impulse response function of diffraction excitation forces and hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by convolution theorem finally combining the results of wave elevation and pressure distribution near vlfs in first step and the hydrodynamic coefficients in second step the hydroelastic responses and loads are solved in time domain then the boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method in time domain is established involving uneven seabed and inhomogeneous wave furthermore taken an eight module semi submersible vlfs as object the motion of each mode and connector loads are numerically calculated for validating the correctness of theory and accuracy of software the model tests of eight module vlfs are carried out in the wave tank which includes depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous wave 2 overall technical framework based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory a time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established called boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method a three step method is proposed to consider the nonlinear wave effect as the following and the flow chart is shown in fig 1 1 step 1 wave evolution was analyzed using boussinesq equation in time domain by neglecting the existence of vlfs but considering the depth varying seabed the pressure p x y z t and wave elevation η x y t in 3d space and time domain are obtained 2 step 2 using coupled hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic coefficients are solved in frequency domain considering depth varying seabed including added mass a r k ω added damping b r k ω and restoring matrix c rk for the diffraction effect due to depth varying seabed has been considered in boussinesq equation so the transfer functions of diffraction force f d r ω are assessed without depth varying seabed furthermore the impulse response function of added damping k r k t and impulse response function of diffraction force k d r t are calculated by convolution theorem 3 step 3 combining the results of wave elevation and pressure distribution near vlfs in first step and the hydrodynamic coefficients in second step the froude krylov f i r t is solved by pressure p x y z t integrated on the wetted surface of floating structure and the diffraction force f d r t is calculated by convolutional integral between k d r t and η x y t finally the hydroelastic responses are solved in time domain and the motion structural deflection wave loads and connector loads are obtained by modal superposition principle 3 mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity 3 1 basic assumption the fluid around the elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous non rotating during studying the interaction between floating structure and wave and

software based on boussinesq equation which is adopted in the paper to analyze the wave evolution for obtaining the wave elevation and pressure distribution of the fluid field the authors shi et al 2012 have implemented the numerical codes the present version of funwave is based on the muscle tvd finite volume scheme together with adaptive runge kutta time stepping the code is parallelized using mpi and has been tested in linux and unix mac os x environments 4 2 pressure and wave elevation transformation after obtaining the pressure distribution in three dimensional space and the wave surface elevation distribution on the still water surface and the three dimensional grids in boussinesq model are inconsistent with the wetted meshes on the surface of the floating body it is necessary to obtain the incident wave pressure of each wetted panel of the floating body and the wave height at the projection of each panel on still water surface through three dimensional or two dimensional interpolation in space assuming that the grids of boussinesq water wave model is divided uniformly in the x y and z directions the pressure p h x y z t on the hydrodynamic panels of hydroelastic analysis can be obtained by three dimensional cubic b spline interpolation of the pressure p b x y z t in the boussinesq model and the wave height η h x y t at the projection point of hydrodynamic panel center on still water surface can be obtained by two dimensional cubic b spline interpolation of the wave height distribution η b x y t in boussinesq model the details are as follows 22a p h x y

where l m and n denote the local coordinate system in x y and z directions respectively 5 hydroelastic responses in complicated geographic environment 5 1 vlfs model an eight module semi submersible vlfs is studied in the paper the single module with the length of 300 m is connected by flexible connectors the stiffness of connector is shown in table 1 two connectors at the upper deck are used to join adjacent modules meanwhile there are fourteen connectors c1 c2 c3 c4 c14 among the eight modules they are located at y 28 m and z 25 m of each module and the length of each connector is 6 m the configuration of the vlfs which is symmetric about x axis shown in fig 3 and the main characteristics of the vlfs are listed in table 1 the rigid module and flexible connector rmfc model are used the mass elements of each module are modeled in 3d fem using patran software and all nodes of the module are rigidly bound to corresponding mass element the connectors are modeled by bush elements the structural finite element model is shown in fig 4 5 2 modal analysis results there are forty eight modes in the rmfc model including thirteen rigid modes and thirty five flexible modes for the eight module vlfs the typical modes are partly shown in fig 5 the added mass of the structure in fluid could change the natural frequencies of the structure in vacuum the resonant frequencies of all modes shown in table 2 could be calculated by eq 11 the results have shown that the resonant frequencies are smaller than the natural frequencies for the existence of added mass the resonant frequency which plays an important role in wave induced response is harmful to the motion of the floating structure some resonant frequencies of vlfs under different modes have been shown in table 2 the resonant frequencies of 15 order mode and above are larger than the wave frequency upper limit in the numerical calculation so not listed in the table 5 3 model test in wave tank the schematic layout of model test in the wave tank are shown in fig 6 the model test was carried out in the deep water experimental tank of the state key laboratory of ocean engineering in shanghai jiaotong university ding and zhang 2017 the varying terrain mainly consists of two parts one is the island between the wave maker and the vlfs the other is the two dimensional slope behind the vlfs the water depth of flat part is 58 7 m in full scale the model scale ratio is 1 100 the length and width of the island above the still water surface are about 4 0 m and 1 5 m in the model test respectively the model of the whole island is about 16 15 m in length and 6 95 m in width in the model test before building the seabed the model tests of the motions and connector loads of the vlfs are taken carried out first for even seabed case after the seabed finished the model tests of the motions and connector loads of the vlfs are taken carried out again 5 4 coupled model of vlfs and seabed the hydrodynamic model of the eight module vlfs has 15072 panels shown in fig 7 a in order to investigate the effects of the depth varying seabed to radiation potential a coupled hydrodynamic model of the vlfs and seabed was built the seabed as shown in fig 7 b is all below the still water the length and breadth of the slope seabed behand the vlfs are 2000 m and 950 m and the length and breadth of the island before the vlfs are 1615 m and 695 m the panel number in the hydrodynamic model of the depth varying seabed is 11475 including 10800 for the slope and 1675 for the island thus the coupled hydrodynamic model has 26547 panels shown in fig 7 c for the hydrodynamic element number is so huge the parallel computing method of mpi are adopted ye et al 2015 the seabed of the other locations is flat and the water depths are assumed to be constant of 58 7m which is the calculating water depth for green s function method in hydroelasticity for the integral on the flat seabed will vanish by green s theorem so it does not need to generate panels on the flat seabed part for the diffraction effect of the depth varying seabed is accounted in the wave solution of funwave software the depth varying seabed is not considered in the diffraction potential solution of hydroelasticity for the vlfs but the depth varying seabed is considered in the radiation potential solution 5 5 experimental and numerical cases there are 13 wave height probes w w2 w3 w13 in fig 6 a which are numerically assessed in the funwave software and all the wave heights are 3m and wave directions are 90 deg for different regular incident waves in the experiments and numerical calculation at the area of vlfs 29 calculation points and 3 calculation points are set along the length direction and width direction of the vlfs respectively forming 29x3 87 calculation points calculation lattice and from the bottom to the surface six calculation layers are set up at each calculation point for outputting the time history curves of velocity and pressure of different water depths and the time history curves of wave surface elevation at the free surface in the hydroelastic response analysis the artificial damping ratios are 5 for rigid modes mode 1 to mode 13 and are 1 for elastic modes mode 14 to mode 48 the damping ratios of mode 3 4 5 and mode 7 to mode 14 are obtained by free decay oscillation test for the other damping ratios are difficult to obtained by this method established after iterative calculation and comparison 5 6 analysis of results 1 wave evolution fig 8 shows the comparison of the calculated and measured wave heights at 13 wave height probes w1 w13 under two regular wave conditions with periods of 7 s and 13 s respectively and input wave heights of 3 m which are in good agreement furthermore it can be seen that the wave heights at the measured locations w2 w13 behind the island show obvious inhomogeneity and the wave heights at the measured locations w7 and w8 are significantly smaller than those on both sides of the island it means that the island has large influence on wave propagation and the significant shelter effect is applied on the floating bodies arranged behind the island the vertical displacements at the gravity center and rotations about x and y of module 1 and module 4 are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 and the numerical results are compared with the results from model test it is concluded that a the present method has reasonably predicted the motions in complicated seabed and inhomogeneous wave although in the medium wave frequency range about 0 4 0 8 rad s the numerical results overestimate heave the reason is that the nonlinear effect such as green water and spraying is not entirely accounted in the numerical calculation and similar hypothesis of the boussinesq equation the scale effect of model test b for the existence of the island the wave around the vlfs has obvious inhomogeneity and is no longer symmetrical about y z plane of the vlfs therefore even when the incoming wave is 90 deg obvious rotation around y axis are induced for module 1 and module 4 which shows the influence of the island on the motion responses of vlfs c the peaks of motion rao are near 0 2 rad s which corresponding to the resonant frequencies of rigid modes mode 3 to mode 6 and mode 7 to mode 13 in table 2 around this frequency the motion responses are closely related to damping ratio green water or spraying from the experiment video there are indeed green water and spraying for the wave of 0 2 rad s in the experiment which influence the pitch response for limited space of the paper fig 11 and fig 12 only show the load transfer functions of three linear displacement directions for connectors 7 and 13 it is shown that the general trend of numerical results and experimental values is in good agreement there only is a little difference in specific values fig 13 shows the maximum of load transfer functions in three linear displacement directions of odd numbered connectors for the loads of even numbered connectors are the similar to the corresponding odd numbered connectors so these are not listed here it is concluded that a the numerical results and experimental data of the load transfer function of the connectors are basically coincident along the longitudinal direction of the vlfs b for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connectors in the x direction the characteristics are large in the middle and small at both ends c for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connector in the y direction it shows a m shaped distribution trend d the peak value of load transfer function in x direction of the connector is one order larger than that in the other two directions and the peak value of load transfer function in z direction is slightly larger than that in y direction e the connector load in x direction is mainly determined by two node horizontal bending mode and the resonant frequency is around 0 85 rad s shown in table 2 so the connector load in x direction is sensitive to damping effect around 0 85 rad s the artificial damping is too small which causes the peak around 0 85 rad s in the numerical results taking connector 13 as an example the main contributions of three linear displacement direction loads of connector are studied fig 14 shows the contributions of some modes which play a major role in the three linear displacement direction loads of the connector because there are many modes that play a role in the z direction loads of the connector only two typical modes are given in fig 15 total represents the load transfer function of a connector composed of 48 modes in fig 14 2node horizontal bending 1node torsion and 1st order pitch heave denote the individual contribution to connector load due to two node horizontal bending mode one node torsion mode and first order coupled mode of pitch and heave respectively from fig 14 the connector loads in the x and y directions are mainly affected by the two node horizontal bending mode which is shown in fig 5 a the connector load in z direction is not only affected by various torsional modes such as fig 5 j and fig 5 k but also by the coupled modes formed by relative pitch and surge between modules as shown in fig 15 because there are many modes that act on the load of the connector in z direction the contribution of a single mode is relatively limited from table 2 it is concluded that the wet frequency of the first elastic mode mode 14 two node horizontal bending mode is about 0 852 rad s which is consistent with the main peak frequency of load transfer functions in the x and y directions of connectors it can be determined that the peak value of load transfer functions is caused by the resonance of two node horizontal bending mode on the other hand except for the first elastic mode the wet frequencies of the other elastic modes exceed the upper limit of wave frequencies calculated in this paper therefore except for the main peak values of load transfer functions in the x and y directions of connectors the other peak values of load transfer functions are caused by the peak values of wave exciting forces rather than modal resonance furthermore in order to study the effect of complex topography of islands on the motion of vlfs and the loads of connectors the numerical results of the motion responses of vlfs and connector loads are compared among even seabed uneven island topography and the measured data of model tests the vertical displacement of gravity center the rotation about x axis and y axis of module 1 under the even seabed case and uneven topography case are given in fig 16 in the even seabed case the rotation angle around the y axis of module 1 is zero because the wave direction 90 deg is chosen in this paper from fig 16 a the vertical displacement of gravity center of module 1 measured by the experiment decreases after considering the depth varying seabed in the medium wave frequency range 0 4 1 0 rad s the vertical displacement of gravity center of module 1 under uneven topography is overestimated by numerical calculation the predicted results of vertical displacement of gravity center for even seabed case are smaller than the experiment data it can be seen from fig 16 b that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experiment results due to the existence of reef topography the rotation angle around the x axis of module 1 decreases significantly thus the significant shelter effect on the floating bodies arranged behind the island especially in the medium wave frequency range 0 4 1 0 rad s the angular amplitude around the x axis decreases from about 1 0 to about 0 4 it can be seen from fig 16 c that the numerical results are also in good agreement with the experiment results because of the existence of depth varying seabed even if the wave direction is 90 deg the vlfs also has a significant rotation around the y axis in order to study the effect of topography on the incident and diffraction forces of vlfs the comparisons of the amplitudes of the incident and diffraction forces for roll between the even seabed case and uneven seabed case are given in fig 17 it can be seen that the incident force of roll of vlfs under the two conditions is not significantly different while the diffraction force of roll under the even seabed condition is much larger than that under the uneven topography at the same time the comparison among fig 17 a to fig 17 c shows that the diffraction force is the main component of wave exciting force under the even seabed condition the wave force shows a single peak shape the wave exciting force of roll under uneven topography presents a double peak shape and its peak frequency coincides with the peak frequency of roll response in fig 16 b fig 18 shows the distribution curve of the maximum load transfer function in three linear displacement directions of each connector it can be seen that the longitudinal distribution of connector loads given by the calculation method considering the influence of seabed topography along vlfs is consistent with the measured results in the model test for simulating the seabed inhomogeneous topography although the value has a certain difference it can meet the needs of engineering design when the average water depth is assumed to be flat seabed by ignoring the influence of seabed topography the load of connectors would be much underestimated 6 conclusions based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory a time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established called boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method a three step method is proposed to consider the nonlinear wave effect then an eight module semi submersible vlfs is studied for numerical assessment using rmfc model meanwhile the wave evolution simulation is carried out based on boussinesq equation the motion responses of each module and connector loads are calculated by considering the depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous wave and the model test is carried out in wave tank for validating the correctness of the numerical results and the boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method some important conclusions are as follows 1 the wave heights distribution behind the island show obvious inhomogeneity and the wave heights at the measured locations w7 and w8 are significantly smaller than those on both sides of the island meanwhile due to the existence of reef topography the rotation angle around the x axis of module 1 decreases significantly thus the significant shelter effect on the floating bodies arranged behind the island 2 the present method has reasonably predicted the motion in complicated seabed and inhomogeneous wave and has good agreement with experiment results the wave is no longer symmetrical about y z plane of the vlfs therefore even when the incoming wave is 90 deg beam sea obvious rotation around y axis are induced for each module the peaks of motion rao are near 0 2 rad s which corresponding to the resonant frequencies of rigid modes the resonant frequencies lie at the range of large wave energy which is harmful to the vlfs structure 3 the calculated and experimental values of the load transfer function of the connectors are basically the same along the direction of the length of vlfs for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connector in the x direction the characteristics are large in the middle and small at both ends for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connector in the y direction it shows a m shaped distribution trend the peak value of load transfer function in x direction of the connector is one order larger than that in the other two directions and the peak value of load transfer function in z direction is slightly larger than that in y direction 4 the connector loads in the x and y directions are mainly affected by the two node horizontal bending mode the connector load in z direction is not only affected by various torsional modes but also by the coupled modes formed by relative pitch and surge between modules 5 when the water depth is assumed to be constant by ignoring the influence of depth varying seabed the load of connectors will be underestimated acknowledgment

22435,when a very large floating structure vlfs is deployed not far from the shore line or near the island the ocean waves and hydroelastic responses of vlfs could be greatly influenced by the complicated topography and inhomogeneous wave based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory a three step time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established called boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method an eight module semi submersible vlfs is studied for numerical assessment using rmfc rigid module flexible connecto model meanwhile the

furthermore the model test is carried out in wave tank for validating the correctness of the numerical results and the boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method there is significant shelter effect on the floating bodies arranged behind the island when the water depth is assumed to be constant by ignoring the influence of seabed topography the load of connectors will be underestimated keywords vlfs hydroelasticity connector load boussinesq equation time domain 1 introduction in the past three decades extensive investigations have been carried out on hydroelastic responses of the vlfs in deep open seas in usa ertekin et al 1993 wu et al 1993 riggs et al 2000 japan kashiwagi 1999 and china fu et al 2007 yang and gu 2015 the seabed topography near islands is usually rugged and the water depth can change from tens of meters to a few meters in a short distance far field waves advancing towards the shore will experience a complex evolution on the shoal in this environment the hydrodynamic responses of a floating structure will be largely affected by the non uniform wave pattern and changing seabed and can be quite different from the general responses of a platform in waves with uniform water depth and homogeneous wave madsen et al 1991 utsunomiya et al 2001 sun et al 2003 belibassakis and athanassoulis 2006 kyoung et al 2005 sturova 2008 utsunomiya et al 2008 belibassakis 2008 ding et al 2017 wei et al 2018 ding et al 2019 yang et al 2019 a coupled mode method has been developed and applied to hydroelastic analysis of large floating platforms of shallow draft over variable bathymetry regions characterized by parallel bottom contours belibassakis and athanassoulis 2006 a direct coupled method has been established on the basis of the boussinesq equations outer region and rankine source method inner region to analyze the hydroelastic responses of floating bodies near islands and reefs ding et al 2017 but the implementation is difficult and time consuming then a simplified method is taken to consider the influence of the incident wave through each module of vlfs with different wave direction wave height and wave period wei et al 2018 ding et al 2019 the principle is different modules adopt different wave parameters including wave direction wave height wave period which is too rough on the other hand three different scale models have been adopted to calculate the wave parameters around the vlfs and the hydroelastic responses of a 3 module vlfs have been analyzed coupled with depth varying seabed yang et al 2019 which considers the influence of depth varying seabed and corresponding wave parameters change in local mode the method cannot entirely consider the complex phenomena of wave evolution on changing terrain around the vlfs but only the diffraction effect in the process of wave propagation from deep open sea to the shallow water near islands and reefs complex phenomena will occur due to the effects of water depth such as reflection diffraction refraction fragmentation shallow water deformation bottom friction obstacles and current in the analysis of coastal wave evolution mechanism the more famous models are mild slope equation berkhoff 1972 kirby 1984 kirby and dalrymple 1986 boussinesq equation peregrine 1967 wei and kirby 1995 wei et al 1995 and g n theory green et al 1974 green and naghdi 1987 zhao 2010 which are completely solving in time domain since its own hypothesis of slowly varying seabed topography and the difficulty of classical mild slope equation in considering wave reflection phenomena mild slope equation is more suitable for the calculation of relatively gentle topography in the sea area for the areas around the reef where the water depth varies sharply the applicability of the equation is not suitable on the other hand g n theory does not abandon any higher order terms so it is a fully non linear wave theory which is more suitable for solving the wave surface changes of non linear waves however the momentum equation in g n theory is approximately satisfied so the accuracy of solving the velocity and pressure fields is not high enough to meet requirements of the wave height velocity and pressure which is required for solving dynamic response of three dimensional floating structures near island reef taking the above factors into account the boussinesq equation is selected here to solve the wave field parameters which is to be used as the fluid field input information later for solving the hydroelastic responses of the floating structures near islands for considering the depth varying seabed and complex effects of wave evolution based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory cummins 1962 a time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established a three step method is proposed to consider the nonlinear wave effect firstly wave evolution was analyzed using boussinesq equation in time domain by neglecting the existence of vlfs secondly using coupled hydrodynamic model the hydroelastic response analysis in frequency domain is carried out by considering depth varying seabed then the impulse response function of diffraction excitation forces and hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by convolution theorem finally combining the results of wave elevation and pressure distribution near vlfs in first step and the hydrodynamic coefficients in second step the hydroelastic responses and loads are solved in time domain then the boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method in time domain is established involving uneven seabed and inhomogeneous wave furthermore taken an eight module semi submersible vlfs as object the motion of each mode and connector loads are numerically calculated for validating the correctness of theory and accuracy of software the model tests of eight module vlfs are carried out in the wave tank which includes depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous wave 2 overall technical framework based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory a time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established called boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method a three step method is proposed to consider the nonlinear wave effect as the following and the flow chart is shown in fig 1 1 step 1 wave evolution was analyzed using boussinesq equation in time domain by neglecting the existence of vlfs but considering the depth varying seabed the pressure p x y z t and wave elevation η x y t in 3d space and time domain are obtained 2 step 2 using coupled hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic coefficients are solved in frequency domain considering depth varying seabed including added mass a r k ω added damping b r k ω and restoring matrix c rk for the diffraction effect due to depth varying seabed has been considered in boussinesq equation so the transfer functions of diffraction force f d r ω are assessed without depth varying seabed furthermore the impulse response function of added damping k r k t and impulse response function of diffraction force k d r t are calculated by convolution theorem 3 step 3 combining the results of wave elevation and pressure distribution near vlfs in first step and the hydrodynamic coefficients in second step the froude krylov f i r t is solved by pressure p x y z t integrated on the wetted surface of floating structure and the diffraction force f d r t is calculated by convolutional integral between k d r t and η x y t finally the hydroelastic responses are solved in time domain and the motion structural deflection wave loads and connector loads are obtained by modal superposition principle 3 mathematical foundation of hydroelasticity 3 1

2012 have implemented the numerical codes the present version of funwave is based on the muscle tvd finite volume scheme together with adaptive runge kutta time stepping the code is parallelized using mpi and has been tested in linux and unix mac os x environments 4 2 pressure and wave elevation transformation after obtaining the pressure distribution in three dimensional space and the wave surface elevation distribution on the still water surface and the three dimensional grids in boussinesq model are inconsistent with the wetted meshes on the surface of the floating body it is necessary to obtain the incident wave pressure of each wetted panel of the floating body and the wave height at the projection of each panel on still water surface through three dimensional or two dimensional interpolation in space assuming that the grids of boussinesq water wave model is divided uniformly in the x y and z directions the pressure p h x y z t on the hydrodynamic panels of hydroelastic

where l m and n denote the local coordinate system in x y and z directions respectively 5 hydroelastic responses in complicated geographic environment 5 1 vlfs model an eight module semi submersible vlfs is studied in the paper the single module with the length of 300 m is connected by flexible connectors the stiffness of connector is shown in table 1 two connectors at the upper deck are used to join adjacent modules meanwhile there are fourteen connectors c1 c2 c3 c4 c14 among the eight modules they are located at y 28 m and z 25 m of each module and the length of each connector is 6 m the configuration of the vlfs which is symmetric about x axis shown in fig 3 and the main characteristics of the vlfs are listed in table 1 the rigid module and flexible connector rmfc model are used the mass elements of each module are modeled in 3d fem using patran software and all nodes of the module are rigidly bound to corresponding mass element the connectors are modeled by bush elements the structural finite element model is shown in fig 4 5 2 modal analysis results there are forty eight modes in the rmfc model including thirteen rigid modes and thirty five flexible modes for the eight module vlfs the typical modes are partly shown in fig 5 the added mass of the structure in fluid could change the natural frequencies of the structure in vacuum the resonant frequencies of all modes shown in table 2 could be calculated by eq 11 the results have shown that the resonant frequencies are smaller than the natural frequencies for the existence of added mass the resonant frequency which plays an important role in wave induced response is harmful to the motion of the floating structure some resonant frequencies of vlfs under different modes have been shown in table 2 the resonant frequencies of 15 order mode and above are larger than the wave frequency upper limit in the numerical calculation so not listed in the table 5 3 model test in wave tank the schematic layout of model test in the wave tank are shown in fig 6 the model test was carried out in the deep water experimental tank of the state key laboratory of ocean engineering in shanghai jiaotong university ding and zhang 2017 the varying terrain mainly consists of two parts one is the island between the wave maker and the vlfs the other is the two dimensional slope behind the vlfs the water depth of flat part is 58 7 m in full scale the model scale ratio is 1 100 the length and width of the island above the still water surface are about 4 0 m and 1 5 m in the model test respectively the model of the whole island is about 16 15 m in length and 6 95 m in width in the model test before building the seabed the model tests of the motions and connector loads of the vlfs are taken carried out first for even seabed case after the seabed finished the model tests of the motions and connector loads of the vlfs are taken carried out again 5 4 coupled model of vlfs and seabed the hydrodynamic model of the eight module vlfs has 15072 panels shown in fig 7 a in order to investigate the effects of the depth varying seabed to radiation potential a coupled hydrodynamic model of the vlfs and seabed was built the seabed as shown in fig 7 b is all below the still water the length and breadth of the slope seabed behand the vlfs are 2000 m and 950 m and the length and breadth of the island before the vlfs are 1615 m and 695 m the panel number in the hydrodynamic model of the depth varying seabed is 11475 including 10800 for the slope and 1675 for the island thus the coupled hydrodynamic model has 26547 panels shown in fig 7 c for the hydrodynamic element number is so huge the parallel computing method of mpi are adopted ye et al 2015 the seabed of the other locations is flat and the water depths are assumed to be constant of 58 7m which is the calculating water depth for green s function method in hydroelasticity for the integral on the flat seabed will vanish by green s theorem so it does not need to generate panels on the flat seabed part for the diffraction effect of the depth varying seabed is accounted in the wave solution of funwave software the depth varying seabed is not considered in the diffraction potential solution of hydroelasticity for the vlfs but the depth varying seabed is considered in the radiation potential solution 5 5 experimental and numerical cases there are 13 wave height probes w w2 w3 w13 in fig 6 a which are numerically assessed in the funwave software and all the wave heights are 3m and wave directions are 90 deg for different regular incident waves in the experiments and numerical calculation at the area of vlfs 29 calculation points and 3 calculation points are set along the length direction and width direction of the vlfs respectively forming 29x3 87 calculation points calculation lattice and from the bottom to the surface six calculation layers are set up at each calculation point for outputting the time history curves of velocity and pressure of different water depths and the time history curves of wave surface elevation at the free surface in the hydroelastic response analysis the artificial damping ratios are 5 for rigid modes mode 1 to mode 13 and are 1 for elastic modes mode 14 to mode 48 the damping ratios of mode 3 4 5 and mode 7 to mode 14 are obtained by free decay oscillation test for the other damping ratios are difficult to obtained by this method established after iterative calculation and comparison 5 6 analysis of results 1 wave evolution fig 8 shows the comparison of the calculated and measured wave heights at 13 wave height probes w1 w13 under two regular wave conditions with periods of 7 s and 13 s respectively and input wave heights of 3 m which are in good agreement furthermore it can be seen that the wave heights at the measured locations w2 w13 behind the island show obvious inhomogeneity and the wave heights at the measured locations w7 and w8 are significantly smaller than those on both sides of the island it means that the island has large influence on wave propagation and the significant shelter effect is applied on the floating bodies arranged behind the island the vertical displacements at the gravity center and rotations about x and y of module 1 and module 4 are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 and the numerical results are compared with the results from model test it is concluded that a the present method has reasonably predicted the motions in complicated seabed and inhomogeneous wave although in the medium wave frequency range about 0 4 0 8 rad s the numerical results overestimate heave the reason is that the nonlinear effect such as green water and spraying is not entirely accounted in the numerical calculation and similar hypothesis of the boussinesq equation the scale effect of model test b for the existence of the island the wave around the vlfs has obvious inhomogeneity and is no longer symmetrical about y z plane of the vlfs therefore even when the incoming wave is 90 deg obvious rotation around y axis are induced for module 1 and module 4 which shows the influence of the island on the motion responses of vlfs c the peaks of motion rao are near 0 2 rad s which corresponding to the resonant frequencies of rigid modes mode 3 to mode 6 and mode 7 to mode 13 in table 2 around this frequency the motion responses are closely related to damping ratio green water or spraying from the experiment video there are indeed green water and spraying for the wave of 0 2 rad s in the experiment which influence the pitch response for limited space of the paper fig 11 and fig 12 only show the load transfer functions of three linear displacement directions for connectors 7 and 13 it is shown that the general trend of numerical results and experimental values is in good agreement there only is a little difference in specific values fig 13 shows the maximum of load transfer functions in three linear displacement directions of odd numbered connectors for the loads of even numbered connectors are the similar to the corresponding odd numbered connectors so these are not listed here it is concluded that a the numerical results and experimental data of the load transfer function of the connectors are basically coincident along the longitudinal direction of the vlfs b for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connectors in the x direction the characteristics are large in the middle and small at both ends c for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connector in the y direction it shows a m shaped distribution trend d the peak value of load transfer function in x direction of the connector is one order larger than that in the other two directions and the peak value of load transfer function in z direction is slightly larger than that in y direction e the connector load in x direction is mainly determined by two node horizontal bending mode and the resonant frequency is around 0 85 rad s shown in table 2 so the connector load in x direction is sensitive to damping effect around 0 85 rad s the artificial damping is too small which causes the peak around 0 85 rad s in the numerical results taking connector 13 as an example the main contributions of three linear displacement direction loads of connector are studied fig 14 shows the contributions of some modes which play a major role in the three linear displacement direction loads of the connector because there are many modes that play a role in the z direction loads of the connector only two typical modes are given in fig 15 total represents the load transfer function of a connector composed of 48 modes in fig 14 2node horizontal bending 1node torsion and 1st order pitch heave denote the individual contribution to connector load due to two node horizontal bending mode one node torsion mode and first order coupled mode of pitch and heave respectively from fig 14 the connector loads in the x and y directions are mainly affected by the two node horizontal bending mode which is shown in fig 5 a the connector load in z direction is not only affected by various torsional modes such as fig 5 j and fig 5 k but also by the coupled modes formed by relative pitch and surge between modules as shown in fig 15 because there are many modes that act on the load of the connector in z direction the contribution of a single mode is relatively limited from table 2 it is concluded that the wet frequency of the first elastic mode mode 14 two node horizontal bending mode is about 0 852 rad s which is consistent with the main peak frequency of load transfer functions in the x and y directions of connectors it can be determined that the peak value of load transfer functions is caused by the resonance of two node horizontal bending mode on the other hand except for the first elastic mode the wet frequencies of the other elastic modes exceed the upper limit of wave frequencies calculated in this paper therefore except for the main peak values of load transfer functions in the x and y directions of connectors the other peak values of load transfer functions are caused by the peak values of wave exciting forces rather than modal resonance furthermore in order to study the effect of complex topography of islands on the motion of vlfs and the loads of connectors the numerical results of the motion responses of vlfs and connector loads are compared among even seabed uneven island topography and the measured data of model tests the vertical displacement of gravity center the rotation about x axis and y axis of module 1 under the even seabed case and uneven topography case are given in fig 16 in the even seabed case the rotation angle around the y axis of module 1 is zero because the wave direction 90 deg is chosen in this paper from fig 16 a the vertical displacement of gravity center of module 1 measured by the experiment decreases after considering the depth varying seabed in the medium wave frequency range 0 4 1 0 rad s the vertical displacement of gravity center of module 1 under uneven topography is overestimated by numerical calculation the predicted results of vertical displacement of gravity center for even seabed case are smaller than the experiment data it can be seen from fig 16 b that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experiment results due to the existence of reef topography the rotation angle around the x axis of module 1 decreases significantly thus the significant shelter effect on the floating bodies arranged behind the island especially in the medium wave frequency range 0 4 1 0 rad s the angular amplitude around the x axis decreases from about 1 0 to about 0 4 it can be seen from fig 16 c that the numerical results are also in good agreement with the experiment results because of the existence of depth varying seabed even if the wave direction is 90 deg the vlfs also has a significant rotation around the y axis in order to study the effect of topography on the incident and diffraction forces of vlfs the comparisons of the amplitudes of the incident and diffraction forces for roll between the even seabed case and uneven seabed case are given in fig 17 it can be seen that the incident force of roll of vlfs under the two conditions is not significantly different while the diffraction force of roll under the even seabed condition is much larger than that under the uneven topography at the same time the comparison among fig 17 a to fig 17 c shows that the diffraction force is the main component of wave exciting force under the even seabed condition the wave force shows a single peak shape the wave exciting force of roll under uneven topography presents a double peak shape and its peak frequency coincides with the peak frequency of roll response in fig 16 b fig 18 shows the distribution curve of the maximum load transfer function in three linear displacement directions of each connector it can be seen that the longitudinal distribution of connector loads given by the calculation method considering the influence of seabed topography along vlfs is consistent with the measured results in the model test for simulating the seabed inhomogeneous topography although the value has a certain difference it can meet the needs of engineering design when the average water depth is assumed to be flat seabed by ignoring the influence of seabed topography the load of connectors would be much underestimated 6 conclusions based on the boussinesq equation and cummins theory a time domain hydroelastic method for vlfs on depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous waves is established called boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method a three step method is proposed to consider the nonlinear

motion responses of each module and connector loads are calculated by considering the depth varying seabed and inhomogeneous wave and the model test is carried out in wave tank for validating the correctness of the numerical results and the boussinesq hydroelasticity coupled method some important conclusions are as follows 1 the wave heights distribution behind the island show obvious inhomogeneity and the wave heights at the measured locations w7 and w8 are significantly smaller than those on both sides of the island meanwhile due to the existence of reef topography the rotation angle around the x axis of module 1 decreases significantly thus the significant shelter effect on the floating bodies arranged behind the island 2 the present method has reasonably predicted the motion in complicated seabed and inhomogeneous wave and has good agreement with experiment results the wave is no longer symmetrical about y z plane of the vlfs therefore even when the incoming wave is 90 deg beam sea obvious rotation around y axis are induced for each module the peaks of motion rao are near 0 2 rad s which corresponding to the resonant frequencies of rigid modes the resonant frequencies lie at the range of large wave energy which is harmful to the vlfs structure 3 the calculated and experimental values of the load transfer function of the connectors are basically the same along the direction of the length of vlfs for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connector in the x direction the characteristics are large in the middle and small at both ends for the maximum value of the load transfer function of the connector in the y direction it shows a m shaped distribution trend the peak value of load transfer function in x direction of the connector is one order larger than that in the other two directions and the peak value of load transfer function in z direction is slightly larger than that in y direction 4 the connector loads in the x and y directions are mainly affected by the two node horizontal bending mode the connector load in z direction is not only affected by various torsional modes but also by the coupled modes formed by relative pitch and surge between modules 5 when the water depth is assumed to be constant by ignoring the influence of depth varying seabed the load of connectors will be underestimated acknowledgment

22436,the behavior of deepwater anchors in the seabed is significantly affected by the anchor lines embedded in soils whether in anchor installation or in mooring unlike the anchor lines submerged in seawater the ones embedded in soils exhibit special and complex behaviors due to soil resistance in either tension transmitting or profile properties of the lines this problem becomes more complicated when encountering a complex seabed condition such as the layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers full knowledge of the anchor lines embedded in layered soils is imperative for anchor installation and safe operation of mooring systems the literature review indicates that the relevant studies apply only to a single layer of either cohesive or cohesionless soil this highlights the importance of the present study and also the challenge to deal with the problem in layered soils composed of both cohesive and cohesionless layers in the present work a mechanical model as well as analytical procedures is proposed to analyze the tension transmitting and profile properties of anchor lines embedded in layered soils this model can well capture the complexity of seabed conditions applying to not only the layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers but also the cohesive or cohesionless layers with different soil strengths to gain further knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils numerous cases of layered soils are designed and analyzed by the present model the results indicate that the configuration of the embedded anchor line presents complex and various reverse catenary shapes due to different strengths of layered soils companying with increasing curvature of the reverse catenary configuration both the tension loss and the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor increase with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers these phenomena exhibit the complexity and variety of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in

as key elements of the mooring system deepwater anchors provide capacity and guarantee the reliability and effectiveness for the whole system good performance of the anchor in both installation and mooring is always the goal to achieve for deepwater anchors such as drag anchors and gravity installed anchors the anchor may present comprehensive and complicated behaviors in the seabed in either installation or mooring due to the applied loading transmitted by anchor lines full knowledge of the anchor lines is therefore important for understanding and even controlling the anchor behaviors in the seabed however unlike the anchor lines submerged in seawater of which the behaviors are well known by researchers the ones embedded in soils exhibit special and complex behaviors due to soil resistance in either configuration or tension transmitting properties of the lines this problem becomes more complicated when encountering a complex seabed condition such as the layered soils full knowledge of the anchor lines embedded in soils accounting for the complexity of the seabed is imperative for not only anchor installation but also safe operation of mooring systems earlier studies on the anchor lines embedded in soils were mainly performed by theoretical analyses reese 1973 gault and cox 1974 vivatrat et al 1982 degenkamp and dutta 1989 neubecker and randolph 1995 bang et al 1996 bang and taylor 1997 wang et al 2010 nie et al 2011 liu et al 2013 aubeny and chi 2014 lee et al 2014 martins and lages 2014 liu et al 2018b together with limited experiments degenkamp and dutta 1989 heyerdahl and eklund 2001 bang et al 2003 liu et al 2014 lee et al 2014 and numerical simulations zhao and liu 2013 2016 2018 however these studies applied only to a single layer of either cohesive or cohesionless soil since the anchor lines completely embedded in saturated soils cannot be directly observed to precisely monitor and measure them in laboratory is not an easy task it has been realized that even the advanced techniques including radar infrared light x ray and lasers are all infeasible due to the combined concerns of measurement precision safety and economy liu et al 2018a the anchor line has a slender structure with a very large ratio of length to diameter moving in the seabed with a long distance generally the large deformation analyses are needed in the numerical simulation and the numerical model has to be large and fine enough due to the special dimension and movement of the anchor line this induces the computational efficiency fairly low and probably a failure simulation compared with experimental and numerical ways theoretical analyses show advantages in studying the behavior of anchor lines embedded in soils the anchor line embedded in soils usually presents a reverse catenary shape under in plane loading attributed to soil resistance the reverse catenary properties of the embedded anchor line including the reverse catenary shape and the tension transmitting property were investigated theoretically by many researchers reese 1973 gault and cox 1974 vivatrat et al 1982 degenkamp and dutta 1989 neubecker and randolph 1995 bang et al 1996 bang and taylor 1997 liu et al 2013 aubeny and chi 2014 lee et al 2014 however different from the generally adopted numerical incremental method neubecker and randolph 1995 liu et al 2013 and aubeny and chi 2014 developed closed form expressions for the embedded anchor line on the basis of the physical nature and earlier study liu et al 2013 analyzed reverse catenary properties of the embedded anchor line and the closed form expressions were derived for either cohesive or cohesionless soils through the theoretical work by liu et al 2013 the behavior of anchor lines embedded in the seabed with single soil layer can be satisfactorily analyzed the present work aims to extend the theoretical work by liu et al 2013 to layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers and try to gain knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines in more complex seabed conditions first a mechanical model for analyzing the anchor line embedded in layered soils is proposed as well as detailed analytical procedures through which the tension transmitting and profile properties of the embedded anchor line can be rationally and efficiently derived then comparative studies are performed to examine the theoretical model last numerous cases are designed and analyzed by the present model to gain further knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers 2 mechanical model for embedded anchor lines different from the anchor line embedded in a single soil layer the embedded anchor line would present more complex unknown behaviors in layered soils in either tension transmitting or profile properties a mechanical model is proposed in this section for analyzing the anchor line embedded in layered soils this model is based on the earlier work but the specialties are in that the layers with different soil properties have to be separately analyzed as well as a rational description of interfacial strengths between adjacent layers leading to the final closed form expressions that are capable of analyzing the behavior of the anchor line embedded in the whole layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers 2 1 tension in the embedded anchor line the tension transmitting model of the anchor line embedded in layered soils is on the basis of the model in a single soil layer in which the anchor line is considered as a series of discrete curved bar elements with the self weight being ignored through the equilibrium conditions on the anchor line the tension in the line in any layer of soils can be expressed as neubecker and randolph 1995 liu et al 2013 1 1 t t u e μ θ u θ where t u denotes the tension on the upper boundary of the line θ denotes the tension angle relative to the horizontal θ u denotes the

tension angles relative to the horizontal at the seafloor and at the shackle of the anchor respectively with eq 2 the tension transmitting properties of the anchor line embedded in layered soils can be evaluated and analyzed which also provide preconditions for establishing the mechanical model for analyzing the configuration of embedded anchor lines 2 2 configuration of the embedded anchor line based on the force equilibrium of embedded anchor lines the relationship that reflects the interaction between the anchor line and the soil in any layer of soils can be derived as neubecker and

the depth of the lower boundary of the anchor line according to eq 5 2 t l can be expressed as 5 3 t l 2 z u z l q d z e μ θ l sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u substituting eq 5 3 into eq 5 1 the following relation can be derived as 6 sin θ d z d s sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u z u z q d z z u z l q d z sin 2 θ u sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u z 2 z u 2 2 ε z z u z l 2 z u 2 2 ε z l z u sin 2 θ u where d s denotes the arc

the anchor line eq 7 can be integrated by two ways one is to integrate from the lower boundary and the other is to integrate from the upper boundary of the anchor line the former leads to the

configuration of the anchor line in each soil layer can be solved then the complete configuration of the anchor line in layered soils can be acquired by integrating the configurations obtained from each layer of soils 2 3 expressions of q and ε the two parameters mentioned in section 2 2 q and ε are just the parameters that specify the properties of layered soils for the layered soils composed

determining tension and configuration of embedded anchor lines in this section the tension and configuration equations of the anchor line embedded in layered soils are solved to obtain the complete tension and configuration of the anchor line in layered soils different analytical procedures are employed one is the procedure solved from the upper to lower boundaries of the anchor line and the other is the procedure solved from the lower to upper boundaries of the anchor line corresponding to different configuration equations 3 1 analytical procedure from the upper to lower boundaries the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line embedded in the soils with i layers are illustrated in fig 1 where t i denotes the thickness of the i th soil layer and θ a herein represents θ a h as observed in fig 1 if the anchor line is analyzed from the upper boundary of the line then t u 1 θ u 1 x u 1 z u 1 z l 1 and the soil conditions in the first layer are known for the soils with i layers the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line in the whole layered soils can be solved by the following procedure 1 by substituting the known conditions into eq 4 and combining with eq 2 obtain t l 1 and θ l 1 in the first soil layer 2 by substituting the known θ u 1 θ l 1 x u 1 z u 1 z l 1 and soil conditions into eq 8 the configuration of the anchor line in the first soil layer is obtained as well as x l 1 3 for the j th layer 2 j i by substituting the known t l j 1 θ l j 1 z l j 1 z l j and soil conditions into eq 4 and combining with eq 2 obtain t l j and θ l j in the j th layer by substituting the known θ l j 1 θ l j x l j 1 z l j 1 z l j and soil conditions into eq 8 the configuration of the anchor line in the j th layer is obtained as well as x l j 4 repeat the work in step 3 until the value of j reaches to i and the tension t l i θ l i and the configuration of the anchor line in the i th layer can be obtained 5 by integrating the tensions and configurations obtained from the first to the i th layers the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line embedded in the whole layered soils can be determined 3 2 analytical procedure from the lower to upper boundaries as observed in fig 1 if the embedded anchor line is analyzed from the lower boundary of the line then t l i θ l i x l i z l i z l i 1 and the soil conditions in the i th layer are known the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line in the whole layered soils can be solved by the following procedure 1 by substituting the known conditions into eq 5

as well as x u i j 4 repeat the work in step 3 until the value of j reaches to i 1 and the tension t u 1 θ u 1 and the configuration of the anchor line in the first layer can be obtained 5 by integrating the tensions and configurations obtained from the i th to the first layers the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line embedded in the whole layered soils can be determined 4 comparative study this section is designed to examine the theoretical model established in the present work because there are no relevant data in layered soils that can be found in the literature two sets of configuration data available in a single soil layer are employed to compare with the configuration equation in a single soil layer i e eq 9 which is degenerated from the configuration equations in layered soils 4 1 comparative study in cohesive soils the embedded chain behaviors were analyzed by neubecker and randolph 1995 in which an important expression was proposed for the chain profile in clay i e the reverse catenary equation n r equation to examine the present theoretical model in cohesive soils the configurations of the embedded line determined by the present model are compared with those by neubecker and randolph 1995 since the two models both adopted the small angle assumption in the analysis the configurations of the line calculated by the numerical solution without the small angle assumption are also presented in the comparison the comparative cases are from neubecker and randolph 1995 and listed in table 1 in which the values of θ a h are obtained from t 2 θ a h 2 and ε z a 10 5 is assumed for clay with linearly increasing strength profile due to the restriction of the n r equation i e it can only apply to clay with zero shear strength at the seafloor the comparative results are presented in fig 2 it is observed from fig 2 that there is a good agreement among different analytical methods for the configuration of the embedded line in clay with uniform strength profile for brevity uniform clay as illustrated in fig 2 a b the mean relative errors of the n r equation to the numerical solution are 20 4 1 4 and 0 3 for cases 1 3 respectively and the mean relative errors of the present model to the numerical solution are 2 4 0 9 and 0 4 for cases 1 3 respectively in clay with linearly increasing strength profile for brevity linear clay as illustrated in fig 2 c d the mean relative errors of the n r equation to the numerical solution are 19 9 1 7 and 0 4 for cases 1 3 respectively and the mean relative errors of the present model to the numerical solution are 8 5 1 0 and 0 4 for cases 1 3 respectively the results indicate the superiority of the present model comparing with the n r equation especially for larger values of θ a h the comparative study demonstrates the validity of the present model in a degenerate case for determining the configuration of anchor lines embedded in layered cohesive soils 4 2 comparative study in cohesionless soils 4 2 1 comparative study in cohesionless soils with liu et al 2014 with the specially designed model tests the reverse catenary properties of the anchor line embedded in sand were investigated by liu et al 2014 through the developed measurement techniques the transient configurations of the anchor line embedded in sand were simulated and monitored to examine the present theoretical model in cohesionless soils the configurations of the embedded line calculated by the present model are compared with those measured in the tests in the calculation the values of θ e γ s and ζ were 0 6 24 kn m3 and 8 10 4 m respectively which were all proposed by liu et al 2014 and the input parameters θ a h and x a z a were also provided by liu et al 2014 in the test results fig 3 presents the comparative results it is observed from fig 3 that the configurations of the embedded line calculated by the present model generally agree well with those measured in the tests taking cases 2 and 5 as examples the mean relative errors of the present model to the test results in case 2 are 0 01 7 2 10 2 1 7 4 1 and 4 5 at 0s 100s 200s 300s 400s and 500s respectively and the mean relative errors of the present model to the test results in case 5 are 4 9 9 4 5 9 3 0 4 1 and 3 7 at 0s 100s 200s 300s 400s and 500s respectively 4 2 2 comparative study in cohesionless soils with lee et al 2014 the behavior of anchor lines embedded in sand was studied by lee et al 2014 with centrifuge tests analytical solutions and simplified methods the governing equation in clay from degenkamp and dutta 1989 was adopted and extended to sand and a numerical incremental method was required in this section the results of configurations of the embedded line from lee et al 2014 are adopted to examine the present model in the calculation the values of θ e θ a h and γ s were proposed by lee et al 2014 i e θ e 0 γ s 9 31 kn m3 for tests 1 2 γ s 8 722 kn m3 for tests 3 4 and θ a h 90 45 55 and 30 for tests 1 4 respectively the values of ζ can be obtained from lee et al 2014 i e 0 01m for tests 1 2 and 0 02m for tests 3 4 in which n q l 79 5 for tests 1 2 and n q l 40 9 for tests 3 4 are obtained according to the results lee et al 2014 the input parameters x a z a were also provided by the tests lee et al 2014 fig 4 presents the comparative results it is observed from fig 4 that the configurations of the embedded line are reasonably estimated by the present model the mean relative errors of the present model to the test results are 23 6 4 3 14 4 and 4 1 for tests 1 4 respectively and the mean relative errors of the analytical solution to the test results are 6 3 2 0 13 8 and 5 8 for tests 1 4 respectively the larger error of the present model to the test results for test 1 is probably attributed to the small angle assumption adopted in the present model the comparative study confirms the validity of the present model in a degenerate case for determining the configuration of anchor lines embedded in layered cohesionless soils 5 the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils with both clay and sand as well known the behavior of the embedded anchor line significantly influences the performance of deepwater anchors and even eventually influences the stability and reliability of mooring systems up to now although the behavior of anchor lines embedded in a single soil layer has been well investigated there is a serious lack of knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils especially for those composed of both cohesive and cohesionless layers by utilizing the present theoretical model this section is therefore designed to investigate the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils with both clay and sand and try to acquire further knowledge of the problems 5 1 analytical conditions the layered soils may be composed of different types of soils and present variety of soil combinations such as a simple one i e the combination of only cohesive or cohesionless soil layers through the theoretical model established earlier the behavior of the anchor line embedded in layered soils with i layers covering all combinations of cohesive and cohesionless soils can be efficiently analyzed in the present analysis the most complex combinations are taken as examples i e the anchor line is embedded in soils composed of both cohesive and cohesionless layers that are presented alternately the number of soil layers is taken as three and for brevity the layered soils are labelled as c s c or s c s in the

based on previous studies neubecker and randolph 1995 hossain and randolph 2009 tho et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 s u 0 5 kpa and μ c 0 1 0 6 are selected according to the earlier study on the ultimate embedment depth of drag anchors liu et al 2010 the thickness of the soil layer is determined and varies in the range l f 3 l f to fully present the behavior of the embedded anchor line in which l f denotes the fluke length of the anchor and is taken as 3m in the analysis the thickness of the first soil layer is selected as 2 l f the details of parameters are listed in tables 2 and 3 the analytical procedure from the upper to lower boundaries is adopted to solve the tension and configuration equations of embedded anchor lines this procedure corresponds to the case of the installation of drag anchors in which the lower boundary conditions are moving and unknown while the upper boundary conditions can be acquired easier 5 2 the behavior of the anchor line in c s c the effects of different parameters on the configuration of the anchor line in c s c are illustrated in fig 6 it is observed from fig 6 that the configuration of the line in c s c is similar to the reverse catenary shape in a single soil layer while presents more complex and various shapes due to different soil properties between adjacent layers the curvature of the line will become bigger when the line enters into the second soil layer the cohesionless one while an opposite trend appears when the line enters into the third soil layer the cohesive one this phenomenon is mainly attributed to stronger soil resistance in the cohesionless layer resulting in a more distinct curve in the second soil layer fig 6 demonstrates that the configurations of the anchor line are significantly affected by the parameters t e θ e n c l n q l and b while the parameters γ s μ c and μ s have very small effects especially for μ c and μ s in general the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position increases with increasing values of the parameters θ e k γ c γ s n c l n q l and b while an opposite relation exists for t e the main reason for the parameters k γ c γ s n c l n q l and b is that these parameters are all related to soil resistance which will increase with increasing values of these parameters resulting in increasing depth of the anchor line regarding the applied loading with increasing value of t e or decreasing value of θ e the soil resistance is easier to be overcome by the anchor line resulting in more smooth reverse catenary curves note that different layer thickness ratios also have effects on the configuration of the anchor line as illustrated in case 1 in general with increasing thickness of the cohesionless soil layer the second one the soil resistance to the line increases resulting in the depth of the line increases at a certain horizontal position this is in accordance with the analytical results for the relation of soil resistance with the configuration of anchor lines the results of tension transmitting properties of the anchor line in c s c are captured and listed in table 1 from which the tension transmitting and the tension loss in each soil layer as well as the final tension loss can be found it is observed that the tension in the line decreases with increasing depth of the line for all cases the tension loss in the cohesionless soil layer the second one is more severe than those in cohesive layers the other ones indicating that the cohesionless properties of soils have more effects on the tension transmitting in the line in general the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c μ c μ s n q l and b have significant effects on the tension transmitting in the line while the effects of k and n c l are not evident the tension transmitting efficiency in the line decreases with increasing values of all parameters except t e and θ e indicating that the increase of soil resistance will cause more tension loss in the line it is also observed from table 1 that the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor θ a h increases with increasing values of all parameters except t e and μ s indicating that the increase of normal soil resistance or the decrease of tension at the seafloor will induce larger values of θ a h in general the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s n q l and b have significant effects on θ a h while the effects of μ c and μ s are not evident 5 3 the behavior of the anchor line in s c s the effects of different parameters on the configuration of the anchor line in s c s are illustrated in fig 7 it is observed from fig 7 that the configuration of the line in s c s also presents complex and various shapes the curvature of the line will become smaller when the line enters into the cohesive soil layer the second one while become bigger when the line enters into the cohesionless soil layer the third one fig 7 also demonstrates that the configurations of the line are significantly affected by the parameters t e θ e γ s n q l and b while the parameters k γ c μ c μ s and n c l have very small effects on the configurations of the line in general with increasing values of the parameters θ e γ s n q l and b the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position increases while the relation for t e is opposite in s c s different layer thickness ratios also have effects on the configuration of the line as illustrated in case 1 in general the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position decreases with increasing thickness of the cohesive soil layer the second one occurrence of these phenomena is due to the interaction between the anchor line and soil the tension transmitting properties of the anchor line in s c s are also analyzed and listed in table 2 with increasing depth of the line the tension in the line decreases for all cases it is observed from table 2 that the tension loss in cohesionless soil layers the first and third ones is more severe than that in the cohesive soil layer the second one this is consistent with that in c s c in general the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s μ s n q l and b significantly affect the tension transmitting in the line while the effects of k and n c l are not evident the tension transmitting efficiency in the line decreases with increasing values of all parameters except t 2 t 1 t e and θ e this can also be observed in c s c table 2 also confirms that the increase of normal soil resistance or the decrease of tension at the seafloor will induce larger values of θ a h the effects of parameters on θ a h are generally identical with those in c s c 5 4 comparison with the behavior of the anchor line in a single soil layer to further explore the behavior of the anchor line embedded in layered soils two cases for layered soils i e case 1 2 in tables 2 and 3 are selected as the basic cases the basic cases are then used to compare with the behavior of the anchor line embedded in single layer soils i e fully cohesive or fully cohesionless soils which are labelled for brevity as c c c or s s s respectively as illustrated in fig 5 c and d the comparative results of the line configuration are illustrated in fig 8 it is observed from fig 8 that the curvature of the embedded anchor line increases from c c c to c s c then to s c s and then to s s s this means that the curvature of the reverse catenary curve increases with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers the increased soil resistance to the line results in the increase of the line curvature the comparative results of the tension transmitting are presented in table 3 it is observed that with increasing depth of the line the tension in the line decreases for all cases the tension loss at the shackle of the anchor is much different in the soils with different layers and increases with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers the same phenomenon can also be observed for the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor θ a h 6 concluding remarks as key elements of the mooring system the embedded anchor lines will exhibit special and complex behaviors due to soil resistance especially in layered soils full knowledge of the anchor line embedded in layered soils is imperative for anchor installation and safe operation of mooring systems in the present study a mechanical model is proposed as well as analytical procedures through which the tension transmitting and profile properties of the anchor line embedded in layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers can be rationally and efficiently derived validity of the theoretical model is confirmed through comparative studies numerous cases of layered soils are designed and analyzed by the present model in order to gain further knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils the behavior of the anchor line embedded in layered soils is more complex than that in a single soil layer in layered soils the configuration of the line presents more complex and various shapes when the line enters into the cohesionless layer from the cohesive layer the curvature of the line will become bigger resulting in a more distinct curve in the cohesionless layer in c s c the parameters t e θ e n c l n q l and b have significant effects on the configurations of the anchor line and the corresponding parameters in s c s are t e θ e γ s n q l and b while the effects of the parameters γ s μ c and μ s in c s c and the parameters k γ c μ c μ s and n c l in s c s on the configurations of the line are not evident in general the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position increases with increasing values of the parameters θ e k γ c γ s n c l n q l and b in c s c and the parameters θ e γ s n q l and b in s c s while the relations for t e in both c s c and s c s are opposite increasing thickness of the cohesionless soil layer will also increase the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position the results of tension transmitting properties of the anchor line indicate that the tension in the line will decrease with increasing depth of the line the tension loss in the cohesionless soil layer is more severe than that in the cohesive soil layer indicating that the cohesionless properties of soils have more effects on the tension transmitting of the line in general the tension transmitting in the line are significantly affected by the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c μ c μ s n q l and b in c s c and the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s μ s n q l and b in s c s while the effects of the parameters k and n c l in both c s c and s c s are not evident the tension transmitting efficiency in the line decreases with increasing values of all parameters except t e and θ e in c s c and all parameters except t 2 t 1 t e and θ e in s c s indicating the increase of the tension loss in the line with increasing soil resistance the increase of normal soil resistance or the decrease of tension at the seafloor will induce larger values of θ a h in general θ a h are significantly affected by the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s n q l and b in both c s c and s c s while the effects of the parameters μ c and μ s in both c s c and s c s are not evident in the soils with different layers the tension loss at the shackle of the anchor is much different and increases with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers the same property can also be found for the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor θ a h the present study provides a powerful tool to rationally and efficiently analyze the complex behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils which would be not only valuable for better understanding the properties of anchor lines but also beneficial to optimizing and operating the mooring and anchorage systems acknowledgements financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51539008 and 51890915 is

22436,the behavior of deepwater anchors in the seabed is significantly affected by the anchor lines embedded in soils whether in anchor installation or in mooring unlike the anchor lines submerged in seawater the ones embedded in soils exhibit special and complex behaviors due to soil resistance in either tension transmitting or profile properties of the lines this problem becomes more complicated when encountering a complex seabed condition such as the layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers full knowledge of the anchor lines embedded in layered soils is imperative for anchor installation and safe operation of mooring systems the literature review indicates that the relevant studies apply only to a single layer of either cohesive or cohesionless soil this highlights the importance of the present study and also the challenge to deal with the problem in layered soils composed of both cohesive and cohesionless layers in the present work a mechanical model as well as analytical procedures is proposed to analyze the tension transmitting and profile properties of anchor lines embedded in layered soils this model can well capture the complexity of seabed conditions applying to not only the layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers but also the cohesive or cohesionless layers with different soil strengths to gain further knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils numerous cases of layered soils are designed and analyzed by the present model the results indicate that the configuration of the embedded anchor line presents complex and various reverse catenary shapes due to different strengths of layered soils companying with increasing curvature of the reverse catenary configuration both the tension loss and the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor increase with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers these phenomena exhibit the complexity and variety of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in

as key elements of the mooring system deepwater anchors provide capacity and guarantee the reliability and effectiveness for the whole system good performance of the anchor in both installation and mooring is always the goal to achieve for deepwater anchors such as drag anchors and gravity installed anchors the anchor may present comprehensive and complicated behaviors in the seabed in either installation or mooring due to the applied loading transmitted by anchor lines full knowledge of the anchor lines is therefore important for understanding and even controlling the anchor behaviors in the seabed however unlike the anchor lines submerged in seawater of which the behaviors are well known by researchers the ones embedded in soils exhibit special and complex behaviors due to soil resistance in either configuration or tension transmitting properties of the lines this problem becomes more complicated when encountering a complex seabed condition such as the layered soils full knowledge of the anchor lines embedded in soils accounting for the complexity of the seabed is imperative for not only anchor installation but also safe operation of mooring systems earlier studies on the anchor lines embedded in soils were mainly performed by theoretical analyses reese 1973 gault and cox 1974 vivatrat et al 1982 degenkamp and dutta 1989 neubecker and randolph 1995 bang et al 1996 bang and taylor 1997 wang et al 2010 nie et al 2011 liu et al 2013 aubeny and chi 2014 lee et al 2014 martins and lages 2014 liu et al 2018b together with limited experiments degenkamp and dutta 1989 heyerdahl and eklund 2001 bang et al 2003 liu et al 2014 lee et al 2014 and numerical simulations zhao and liu 2013 2016 2018 however these studies applied only to a single layer of either cohesive or cohesionless soil since the anchor lines completely embedded in saturated soils cannot be directly observed to precisely monitor and measure them in laboratory is not an easy task it has been realized that even the advanced techniques including radar infrared light x ray and lasers are all infeasible due to the combined concerns of measurement precision safety and economy liu et al 2018a the anchor line has a slender structure with a very large ratio of length to diameter moving in the seabed with a long distance generally the large deformation analyses are needed in the numerical simulation and the numerical model has to be large and fine enough due to the special dimension and movement of the anchor line this induces the computational efficiency fairly low and probably a failure simulation compared with experimental and numerical ways theoretical analyses show advantages in studying the behavior of anchor lines embedded in soils the anchor line embedded in soils usually presents a reverse catenary shape under in plane loading attributed to soil resistance the reverse catenary properties of the embedded anchor line including the reverse catenary shape and the tension transmitting property were investigated theoretically by many researchers reese 1973 gault and cox 1974 vivatrat et al 1982 degenkamp and dutta 1989 neubecker and randolph 1995 bang et al 1996 bang and taylor 1997 liu et al 2013 aubeny and chi 2014 lee et al 2014 however different from the generally adopted numerical incremental method neubecker and randolph 1995 liu et al 2013 and aubeny and chi 2014 developed closed form expressions for the embedded anchor line on the basis of the physical nature and earlier study liu et al 2013 analyzed reverse catenary properties of the embedded anchor line and the closed form expressions were derived for either cohesive or cohesionless soils through the theoretical work by liu et al 2013 the behavior of anchor lines embedded in the seabed with single soil layer can be satisfactorily analyzed the present work aims to extend the theoretical work by liu et al 2013 to layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers and try to gain knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines in more complex seabed conditions first a mechanical model for analyzing the anchor line embedded in layered soils is proposed as well as detailed analytical procedures through which the tension transmitting and profile properties of the embedded anchor line can be rationally and efficiently derived then comparative studies are performed to examine the theoretical model last numerous cases are designed and analyzed by the present model to gain further knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers 2 mechanical model for embedded anchor lines different from the anchor line embedded in a single soil layer the embedded anchor line would present more complex unknown behaviors in layered soils in either tension transmitting or profile properties a mechanical model is proposed in this section for analyzing the anchor line embedded in layered soils this model is based on the earlier work but the specialties are in that the layers with different soil properties have to be separately analyzed as well as a rational description of interfacial strengths between adjacent layers leading to the final closed form expressions that are capable of analyzing the behavior of the anchor line embedded in the whole layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers 2 1 tension in the embedded anchor line the tension transmitting model of the anchor line embedded in layered soils is on the basis of the model in a single soil layer in which the anchor line is considered as a series of discrete curved bar elements with the self weight being ignored through the equilibrium conditions on the anchor line the tension in the line in any layer of soils can be expressed as neubecker and randolph 1995 liu et al 2013 1 1 t t u e μ θ u θ where t u denotes the tension on the upper boundary of the line θ denotes the tension angle relative to the horizontal θ u denotes the tension angle relative to the horizontal on the upper boundary of the line and μ denotes the frictional coefficient the value of μ is in the range 0 1 0 6 for cohesive soils neubecker and randolph 1995 zhang 2011 liu et al 2013 while μ tan δ l is widely adopted for cohesionless soils in which δ l denotes the interface friction angle for the anchor line by introducing the lower boundary conditions of the anchor line into eq 1 1 the following relation can be obtained 1 2 t l t u e μ θ u θ l where t l denotes the tension on the lower boundary of the line and θ l denotes the tension angle relative to the horizontal on the lower boundary of the line according to eq 1 2 the tension transmitting in the line within a certain soil layer the i th soil layer in which i is an integer and denotes the number of soil layers can be expressed as 1 3 t l i t u i e μ i θ u i θ l i utilizing eq 1 3 with the recurrence method the relationship between t l i and t u 1 in layered soils can be obtained 2 t l 1 t u 1 e μ 1 θ u 1 θ l 1 i 1 t l i t u i e μ i θ u i θ l i e μ i θ u i θ l i t u 1 e μ 1 θ u 1 θ l 1 t u 1 e μ i θ u i θ l i μ 1 θ u 1 θ l 1 i 2 where t u 1 t l 1 θ u 1 θ l 1 and μ 1 represent t u t l θ u θ l and μ in the first soil layer respectively and t u i t l i θ u i θ l i and μ i represent t u t l θ u θ l and μ in the i th soil layer respectively note that t u 1 t l i θ u 1 and θ l i herein can be replaced by t e t a θ e and θ a h respectively where t e and t a denote the tensions at the seafloor and at the shackle of the anchor respectively and θ e and θ a h denote the tension angles relative to the horizontal at the seafloor and at the shackle of the anchor respectively with eq 2 the tension transmitting properties of the anchor line embedded in layered soils can be evaluated and analyzed which also provide preconditions for establishing the mechanical model for analyzing the configuration of embedded anchor lines 2 2 configuration of the embedded anchor line based on the force equilibrium of embedded anchor lines the relationship that reflects the interaction between the anchor line and the soil in any layer of soils can be derived as neubecker and

the depth of the lower boundary of the anchor line according to eq 5 2 t l can be expressed as 5 3 t l 2 z u z l q d z e μ θ l sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u substituting eq 5 3 into eq 5 1 the following relation can be derived as 6 sin θ d z d s sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u z u z q d z z u z l q d z sin 2 θ u sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u z 2 z u 2 2 ε z z u z l 2 z u 2 2 ε z l z u sin 2 θ u where d s denotes the arc length of the line element ε is a parameter that relates to q and will be introduced in detail in section 2 3 according to eq 6 the horizontal length of the line element can be expressed as 7 d x d s 2 d z 2 cos 2 θ u z l 2 z u 2 2 ε z l z u sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u z 2 z u 2 2 ε z z u sin 2 θ u z l 2 z u 2 2 ε z l z u sin 2 θ l sin 2 θ u z 2 z u 2 2 ε z z u d z to derive the configuration equation of the anchor line eq 7 can be integrated by two ways one is to integrate from the lower boundary and the other is to integrate from the upper boundary of the anchor line the former leads to the

configuration of the anchor line in each soil layer can be solved then the complete configuration of the anchor line in layered soils can be acquired by integrating the configurations obtained from each layer of soils 2 3 expressions of q and ε the two parameters mentioned in section 2 2 q and ε are just the parameters that specify the properties of layered soils for the layered soils composed

other is the procedure solved from the lower to upper boundaries of the anchor line corresponding to different configuration equations 3 1 analytical procedure from the upper to lower boundaries the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line embedded in the soils with i layers are illustrated in fig 1 where t i denotes the thickness of the i th soil layer and θ a herein represents θ a h as observed in fig 1 if the anchor line is analyzed from the upper boundary of the line then t u 1 θ u 1 x u 1 z u 1 z l 1 and the soil conditions in the first layer are known for the soils with i layers the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line in the whole layered soils can be solved by the following procedure 1 by substituting the known conditions into eq 4 and combining with eq 2 obtain t l 1 and θ l 1 in the first soil layer 2 by substituting the known θ u 1 θ l 1 x u 1 z u 1 z l 1 and soil conditions into eq 8 the configuration of the anchor line in the first soil layer is obtained as well as x l 1 3 for the j th layer 2 j i by substituting the known t l j 1 θ l j 1 z l j 1 z l j and soil conditions into eq 4 and combining with eq 2 obtain t l j and θ l j in the j th layer by substituting the known θ l j 1 θ l j x l j 1 z l j 1 z l j and soil conditions into eq 8 the configuration of the anchor line in the j th layer is obtained as well as x l j 4 repeat the work in step 3 until the value of j reaches to i and the tension t l i θ l i and the configuration of the anchor line in the i th layer can be obtained 5 by integrating the tensions and configurations obtained from the first to the i th layers the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line embedded in the whole layered soils can be determined 3 2 analytical procedure from the lower to upper boundaries as observed in fig 1 if the embedded anchor line is analyzed from the lower boundary of the line then t l i θ l i x l i z l i z l i 1 and the soil conditions in the i th layer are known the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line in the whole layered soils can be solved by the following procedure 1 by substituting the known conditions into eq 5 2 and combining with eq 2 obtain t u i and θ u i in the i th layer 2 by substituting the known θ l i θ u i x l i z l i z l i 1 and soil conditions into eq 8 the configuration of the anchor line in the i th layer is obtained as well as x u i 3 for the i j th layer 1 j i 1 by substituting the known t l i j θ l i j z l i j z l i j 1 and soil conditions into eq 5 2 and combining with eq 2 obtain t u i j and θ u i j in the i j th layer by substituting the known θ l i j θ u i j x l i j z l i j z l i j 1 and soil conditions into eq 8 the configuration of the anchor line in the i j th layer is obtained as well as x u i j 4 repeat the work in step 3 until the value of j reaches to i 1 and the tension t u 1 θ u 1 and the configuration of the anchor line in the first layer can be obtained 5 by integrating the tensions and configurations obtained from the i th to the first layers the tension transmitting and configuration of the anchor line embedded in the whole layered soils can be determined 4 comparative study this section is designed to examine the theoretical model established in the present work because there are no relevant data in layered soils that can be found in the literature two sets of configuration data available in a single soil layer are employed to compare with the configuration equation in a single soil layer i e eq 9 which is degenerated from the configuration equations in layered soils 4 1 comparative study in cohesive soils the embedded chain behaviors were analyzed by neubecker and randolph 1995 in which an important expression was proposed for the chain profile in clay i e the reverse catenary equation n r equation to examine the present theoretical model in cohesive soils the configurations of the embedded line determined by the present model are compared with those by neubecker and randolph 1995 since the two models both adopted the small angle assumption in the analysis the configurations of the line calculated by the numerical solution without the small angle assumption are also presented in the comparison the comparative cases are from neubecker and randolph 1995 and listed in table 1 in which the values of θ a h are obtained from t 2 θ a h 2 and ε z a 10 5 is assumed for clay with linearly increasing strength profile due to the restriction of the n r equation i e it can only apply to clay with zero shear strength at the seafloor the comparative results are presented in fig 2 it is observed from fig 2 that there is a good agreement among different analytical methods for the configuration of the embedded line in clay with uniform strength profile for brevity uniform clay as illustrated in fig 2 a b the mean relative errors of the n r equation to the numerical solution are 20 4 1 4 and 0 3 for cases 1 3 respectively and the mean relative errors of the present model to the numerical solution are 2 4 0 9 and 0 4 for cases 1 3 respectively in clay with linearly increasing strength profile for brevity linear clay as illustrated in fig 2 c d the mean relative errors of the n r equation to the numerical solution are 19 9 1 7 and 0 4 for cases 1 3 respectively and the mean relative errors of the present model to the numerical solution are 8 5 1 0 and 0 4 for cases 1 3 respectively the results indicate the superiority of the present model comparing with the n r equation especially for larger values of θ a h the comparative study demonstrates the validity of the present model in a degenerate case for determining the configuration of anchor lines embedded in layered cohesive soils 4 2 comparative study in cohesionless soils 4 2 1 comparative study in cohesionless soils with liu et al 2014 with the specially designed model tests the reverse catenary properties of the anchor line embedded in sand were investigated by liu et al 2014 through the developed measurement techniques the transient configurations of the anchor line embedded in sand were simulated and monitored to examine the present theoretical model in cohesionless soils the configurations of the embedded line calculated by the present model are compared with those measured in the tests in the calculation the values of θ e γ s and ζ were 0 6 24 kn m3 and 8 10 4 m respectively which were all proposed by liu et al 2014 and the input parameters θ a h and x a z a were also provided by liu et al 2014 in the test results fig 3 presents the comparative results it is observed from fig 3 that the configurations of the embedded line calculated by the present model generally agree well with those measured in the tests taking cases 2 and 5 as examples the mean relative errors of the present model to the test results in case 2 are 0 01 7 2 10 2 1 7 4 1 and 4 5 at 0s 100s 200s 300s 400s and 500s respectively and the mean relative errors of the present model to the test results in case 5 are 4 9 9 4 5 9 3 0 4 1 and 3 7 at 0s 100s 200s 300s 400s and 500s respectively 4 2 2 comparative study in cohesionless soils with lee et al 2014 the behavior of anchor lines embedded in sand was studied by lee et al 2014 with centrifuge tests analytical solutions and simplified methods the governing equation in clay from degenkamp and dutta 1989 was adopted and extended to sand and a numerical incremental method was required in this section the results of configurations of the embedded line from lee et al 2014 are adopted to examine the present model in the calculation the values of θ e θ a h and γ s were proposed by lee et al 2014 i e θ e 0 γ s 9 31 kn m3 for tests 1 2 γ s 8 722 kn m3 for tests 3 4 and θ a h 90 45 55 and 30 for tests 1 4 respectively the values of ζ can be obtained from lee et al 2014 i e 0 01m for tests 1 2 and 0 02m for tests 3 4 in which n q l 79 5 for tests 1 2 and n q l 40 9 for tests 3 4 are obtained according to the results lee et al 2014 the input parameters x a z a were also provided by the tests lee et al 2014 fig 4 presents the comparative results it is observed from fig 4 that the configurations of the embedded line are reasonably estimated by the present model the mean relative errors of the present model to the test results are 23 6 4 3 14 4 and 4 1 for tests 1 4 respectively and the mean relative errors of the analytical solution to the test results are 6 3 2 0 13 8 and 5 8 for tests 1 4 respectively the larger error of the present model to the test results for test 1 is probably attributed to the small angle assumption adopted in the present model the comparative study confirms the validity of the present model in a degenerate case for determining the configuration of anchor lines embedded in layered cohesionless soils 5 the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils with both clay and sand as well known the behavior of the embedded anchor line significantly influences the performance of deepwater anchors and even eventually influences the stability and reliability of mooring systems up to now although the behavior of anchor lines embedded in a single soil layer has been well investigated there is a serious lack of knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils especially for those composed of both cohesive and cohesionless layers by utilizing the present theoretical model this section is therefore designed to investigate the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils with both clay and sand and try to acquire further knowledge of the problems 5 1 analytical conditions the layered soils may be composed of different types of soils and present variety of soil combinations such as a simple one i e the combination of only cohesive or cohesionless soil layers through the theoretical model established earlier the behavior of the anchor line embedded in layered soils with i layers covering all combinations of cohesive and cohesionless soils can be efficiently analyzed in the present analysis the most complex combinations are taken as examples i e the anchor line is embedded in soils composed of both cohesive and cohesionless layers that are presented alternately the number of soil layers is taken as three and for brevity the layered soils are labelled as c s c or s c s in the analysis where c and s represent clay and sand respectively as illustrated in fig 5 a and b to fully understand the behavior of the anchor line embedded in layered soils numerous cases are designed for c s c and s c s respectively including 11 cases covering important parameters in the present model as presented in tables 2 and 3 cases 1 11 are designed to investigate the effects of different parameters on the behavior of the embedded anchor line including the thickness ratio of soil layers t 2 t 1 tension at the seafloor t e tension angle relative to the horizontal at the seafloor θ e gradient of undrained shear strength with depth of the cohesive soil k submerged weight of the cohesive soil γ c submerged weight of the cohesionless soil γ s frictional coefficient in the cohesive soil μ c frictional coefficient in the cohesionless soil μ s bearing capacity factor in the cohesive soil n c l bearing capacity factor in the cohesionless soil n q l and effective bearing width of the anchor line b based on previous studies hossain and randolph 2009 zhang 2011 liu et al 2012 tho et al 2014 the values of parameters γ c γ s k and μ s are determined i e γ c 3 5 11 5 kn m3 γ s 2 94 11 76 kn m3 k 1 2 kpa m and μ s 0 27 0 58 based on previous studies murff et al 2005 zhang 2011 zhao 2016 liu et al 2018b n c l 7 12 n q l 5 40 b 0 03 0 07m θ e 0 40 and t e 1500 2500 kn are adopted based on previous studies neubecker and randolph 1995 hossain and randolph 2009 tho et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 s u 0 5 kpa and μ c 0 1 0 6 are selected according to the earlier study on the ultimate embedment depth of drag anchors liu et al 2010 the thickness of the soil layer is determined and varies in the range l f 3 l f to fully present the behavior of the embedded anchor line in which l f denotes the fluke length of the anchor and is taken as 3m in the analysis the thickness of the first soil layer is selected as 2 l f the details of parameters are listed in tables 2 and 3 the analytical procedure from the upper to lower boundaries is adopted to solve the tension and configuration equations of embedded anchor lines this procedure corresponds to the case of the installation of drag anchors in which the lower boundary conditions are moving and unknown while the upper boundary conditions can be acquired easier 5 2 the behavior of the anchor line in c s c the effects of different parameters on the configuration of the anchor line in c s c are illustrated in fig 6 it is observed from fig 6 that the configuration of the line in c s c is similar to the reverse catenary shape in a single soil layer while presents more complex and various shapes due to different soil properties between adjacent layers the curvature of the line will become bigger when the line enters into the second soil layer the cohesionless one while an opposite trend appears when the line enters into the third soil layer the cohesive one this phenomenon is mainly attributed to stronger soil resistance in the cohesionless layer resulting in a more distinct curve in the second soil layer fig 6 demonstrates that the configurations of the anchor line are significantly affected by the parameters t e θ e n c l n q l and b while the parameters γ s μ c and μ s have very small effects especially for μ c and μ s in general the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position increases with increasing values of the parameters θ e k γ c γ s n c l n q l and b while an opposite relation exists for t e the main reason for the parameters k γ c γ s n c l n q l and b is that these parameters are all related to soil resistance which will increase with increasing values of these parameters resulting in increasing depth of the anchor line regarding the applied loading with increasing value of t e or decreasing value of θ e the soil resistance is easier to be overcome by the anchor line resulting in more smooth reverse catenary curves note that different layer thickness ratios also have effects on the configuration of the anchor line as illustrated in case 1 in general with increasing thickness of the cohesionless soil layer the second one the soil resistance to the line increases resulting in the depth of the line increases at a certain horizontal position this is in accordance with the analytical results for the relation of soil resistance with the configuration of anchor lines the results of tension transmitting properties of the anchor line in c s c are captured and listed in table 1 from which the tension transmitting and the tension loss in each soil layer as well as the final tension loss can be found it is observed that the tension in the line decreases with increasing depth of the line for all cases the tension loss in the cohesionless soil layer the second one is more severe than those in cohesive layers the other ones indicating that the cohesionless properties of soils have more effects on the tension transmitting in the line in general the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c μ c μ s n q l and b have significant effects on the tension transmitting in the line while the effects of k and n c l are not evident the tension transmitting efficiency in the line decreases with increasing values of all parameters except t e and θ e indicating that the increase of soil resistance will cause more tension loss in the line it is also observed from table 1 that the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor θ a h increases with increasing values of all parameters except t e and μ s indicating that the increase of normal soil resistance or the decrease of tension at the seafloor will induce larger values of θ a h in general the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s n q l and b have significant effects on θ a h while the effects of μ c and μ s are not evident 5 3 the behavior of the anchor line in s c s the effects of different parameters on the configuration of the anchor line in s c s are illustrated in fig 7 it is observed from fig 7 that the configuration of the line in s c s also presents complex and various shapes the curvature of the line will become smaller when the line enters into the cohesive soil layer the second one while become bigger when the line enters into the cohesionless soil layer the third one fig 7 also demonstrates that the configurations of the line are significantly affected by the parameters t e θ e γ s n q l and b while the parameters k γ c μ c μ s and n c l have very small effects on the configurations of the line in general with increasing values of the parameters θ e γ s n q l and b the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position increases while the relation for t e is opposite in s c s different layer thickness ratios also have effects on the configuration of the line as illustrated in case 1 in general the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position decreases with increasing thickness of the cohesive soil layer the second one occurrence of these phenomena is due to the interaction between the anchor line and soil the tension transmitting properties of the anchor line in s c s are also analyzed and listed in table 2 with increasing depth of the line the tension in the line decreases for all cases it is observed from table 2 that the tension loss in cohesionless soil layers the first and third ones is more severe than that in the cohesive soil layer the second one this is consistent with that in c s c in general the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s μ s n q l and b significantly affect the tension transmitting in the line while the effects of k and n c l are not evident the tension transmitting efficiency in the line decreases with increasing values of all parameters except t 2 t 1 t e and θ e this can also be observed in c s c table 2 also confirms that the increase of normal soil resistance or the decrease of tension at the seafloor will induce larger values of θ a h the effects of parameters on θ a h are generally identical with those in c s c 5 4 comparison with the behavior of the anchor line in a single soil layer to further explore the behavior of the anchor line embedded in layered soils two cases for layered soils i e case 1 2 in tables 2 and 3 are selected as the basic cases the basic cases are then used to compare with the behavior of the anchor line embedded in single layer soils i e fully cohesive or fully cohesionless soils which are labelled for brevity as c c c or s s s respectively as illustrated in fig 5 c and d the comparative results of the line configuration are illustrated in fig 8 it is observed from fig 8 that the curvature of the embedded anchor line increases from c c c to c s c then to s c s and then to s s s this means that the curvature of the reverse catenary curve increases with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers the increased soil resistance to the line results in the increase of the line curvature the comparative results of the tension transmitting are presented in table 3 it is observed that with increasing depth of the line the tension in the line decreases for all cases the tension loss at the shackle of the anchor is much different in the soils with different layers and increases with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers the same phenomenon can also be observed for the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor θ a h 6 concluding remarks as key elements of the mooring system the embedded anchor lines will exhibit special and complex behaviors due to soil resistance especially in layered soils full knowledge of the anchor line embedded in layered soils is imperative for anchor installation and safe operation of mooring systems in the present study a mechanical model is proposed as well as analytical procedures through which the tension transmitting and profile properties of the anchor line embedded in layered soils with both cohesive and cohesionless layers can be rationally and efficiently derived validity of the theoretical model is confirmed through comparative studies numerous cases of layered soils are designed and analyzed by the present model in order to gain further knowledge of the behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils the behavior of the anchor line embedded in layered soils is more complex than that in a single soil layer in layered soils the configuration of the line presents more complex and various shapes when the line enters into the cohesionless layer from the cohesive layer the curvature of the line will become bigger resulting in a more distinct curve in the cohesionless layer in c s c the parameters t e θ e n c l n q l and b have significant effects on the configurations of the anchor line and the corresponding parameters in s c s are t e θ e γ s n q l and b while the effects of the parameters γ s μ c and μ s in c s c and the parameters k γ c μ c μ s and n c l in s c s on the configurations of the line are not evident in general the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position increases with increasing values of the parameters θ e k γ c γ s n c l n q l and b in c s c and the parameters θ e γ s n q l and b in s c s while the relations for t e in both c s c and s c s are opposite increasing thickness of the cohesionless soil layer will also increase the depth of the line at a certain horizontal position the results of tension transmitting properties of the anchor line indicate that the tension in the line will decrease with increasing depth of the line the tension loss in the cohesionless soil layer is more severe than that in the cohesive soil layer indicating that the cohesionless properties of soils have more effects on the tension transmitting of the line in general the tension transmitting in the line are significantly affected by the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c μ c μ s n q l and b in c s c and the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s μ s n q l and b in s c s while the effects of the parameters k and n c l in both c s c and s c s are not evident the tension transmitting efficiency in the line decreases with increasing values of all parameters except t e and θ e in c s c and all parameters except t 2 t 1 t e and θ e in s c s indicating the increase of the tension loss in the line with increasing soil resistance the increase of normal soil resistance or the decrease of tension at the seafloor will induce larger values of θ a h in general θ a h are significantly affected by the parameters t 2 t 1 t e θ e γ c γ s n q l and b in both c s c and s c s while the effects of the parameters μ c and μ s in both c s c and s c s are not evident in the soils with different layers the tension loss at the shackle of the anchor is much different and increases with increasing proportion of cohesionless layers the same property can also be found for the tension angle at the shackle of the anchor θ a h the present study provides a powerful tool to rationally and efficiently analyze the complex behavior of anchor lines embedded in layered soils which would be not only valuable for better understanding the properties of anchor lines but also beneficial to optimizing and operating the mooring and anchorage systems acknowledgements financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51539008 and 51890915 is

22437,the modeling and control of tethered undersea kites for power generation are discussed in this paper in the first part we apply the added mass model to underwater kite systems in the second part the stability of undersea kite systems is analyzed using two frameworks the dissipative property of the hydrodynamic force is provided first based on this property the input to state stability of the undersea kite dynamics is established moreover based on the input to state stability the ultimate boundedness of constrained undersea kite dynamics is also discussed finally an input output system is proposed and a passivity based control signal is designed the proposed control signal is tested in a baseline simulation which yields consecutive figure eight cycles with positive net power generation keywords undersea kite lyapunov based control added mass 1 introduction tethered undersea kite tusk energy is an emerging renewable energy technology system in which the undersea kites are used to convert current energy into electricity a tusk system consists of four parts the rigid undersea kite an attached marine turbine the tether and a floating or seabed platform there are two significant advantages of tusk systems over conventional marine turbines first tusk can move at a high cross current velocity over a large swept area to significantly increase power output compared to same size marine turbines as a result tusk systems can be used in lower velocity currents secondly tethered undersea kites do not require costly support structures in spite of their potential there are only a few systematic investigations olinger and wang 2015 paiva et al 2018 li et al 2016a mademlis et al 2018 on tusk systems however airborne wind energy systems awe which use a similar concept for wind power harvesting have been given more attention from the research community vermillion et al 2013 vermillion and fagiano 2013 ahrens et al 2013 the systematic study of awe systems started in the 1980s when loyd provided a first rigorous analysis of the power limit of a kite in a cross wind motion in loyd 1980 due to their similarity loyd s limit can also serve as a theoretical foundation for tusk systems awe systems can be placed into three categories buoyant systems vermillion et al 2012 flexible kite systems fagiano et al 2014 and rigid glider systems li et al 2015a williams et al 2008a b among these configurations the rigid glider systems are most similar to tusk similar to rigid glider awe systems the tusk systems can be classified as flygen systems olinger and wang 2015 with an onboard turbine and constant tether length and buoygen systems with variable tether length compared with more conventional ocean power conversion technologies melikoglu 2018 uihlein and magagna 2016 such as marine turbines and wave energy converters the flygen tusk system can be viewed as a current speed enhancement device due to the rigid wing s high cross current velocity although both tusk and awe system dynamics can be captured using rigid body formalism there is one significant difference the water density is much higher than air density in principle the full fluid structure interaction can be characterized using partial differential equations pde de groot et al 2011 however the resulting system dynamics can be too computationally expensive for real time control algorithms to overcome this difficulty an added mass model is applied to tusk system milne thomson 2013 in this paper in this approach the fluid structure interaction is modeled as additional inertia on the undersea kite such approach has been widely used in underwater vehicle control system design valentinis and woolsey 2019 anderlini et al 2018 similar to awe systems the control system design is the key issue in achieving robust and optimal power harvesting of the tusk systems unlike the awe systems where many control system design techniques li et al 2015b 2016b 2015a vermillion et al 2014 bafandeh and vermillion 2016 nikpoorparizi et al 2018 henriques et al 2016 barambones et al 2018 have already been investigated the control system design of tusk system more or less remains untouched apparently due to the similar power generation mechanism it is possible to apply many developed control schemes for awe systems onto the tusk systems however the significant fluid structure interaction presented in tusk dynamics poses additional challenges to achieving system stability and optimum power harvesting when similar algorithms are used in the second part of this paper we propose three frameworks which can be used to analyze the stability of tusk systems moreover a passivity based control algorithm will be designed for tusk systems the organization and main contributions of this work are as follows first some useful notations and kinematic relations are presented and an added mass model is applied to the tusk dynamics milne thomson 2013 second the passivity property of the hydrodynamic force will be investigated a framework of the stability analysis of tusk systems is presented we will show that the full tusk dynamics are input to state stable and the translational motion of undersea kites are ultimately bounded under the tether tension of a quadratic type third an input output system based on the tusk dynamics is defined and a passivity based control signal is designed finally we present a baseline simulation that yields successive power generation cycles to test the proposed control system 2 equations of motion physical phenomena in tusk systems are modeled in different reference frames by convention 1 the hydrodynamics models are established in a reference frame with respect to flow direction 2 the undersea kite rotation is characterized with respect to an inertial earth frame 3 the added mass effects are usually modeled in a reference frame attached to the kite body 4 the motion of the undersea kite is constrained by a tether which is described in a spherical frame to derive a system of equations of motion that includes all these perspectives we first present some key kinematics relations between different reference frames then the equivalences of the system dynamics between frames are presented finally tusk dynamics are derived which will enable the stability analysis in the next section 2 1 system kinematics denote the reference frames as follows inertial cartesian frame c i c j c k c body frame b i b j b k b spherical frame s e r e 1 e 2 the i c axis is set along the upstream current direction k c axis vertically downward and j c axis forms a right hand coordinate system with i c and k c the body frame b centers at the kite center of gravity and follows the north east down convention as shown in fig 1 the position transformation between cartesian frame c and spherical frame s is given by 1 r c x c y c z c r cos q 1 sin q 2 sin q 1 cos q 1 cos q 2 where r is the tether length q 1 is the cross wind angle and q 2 the inclination angle the inverse transformation can be found as 2 q r q 1 q 2 x c 2 y c 2 z c 2 arcsin y c r arctan x c z c define the kite cg velocity in earth frame as v c then the velocity transformation from spherical to cartesian frame is given by differentiating eq 1 3 v c u c v c w c t p q p c q 1 s q 2 r s q 1 s q 2 r c q 1 c q 2 s q 1 r c q 1 0 c q 1 c q 2 r s q 1 c q 2 r c q 1 s q 2 the orientation of the body frame b can be represented by euler angles θ ϕ θ ψ where ϕ θ and ψ are also referred to as roll pitch and yaw angle respectively the directional cosine matrix that represents the translational velocity transformation between frames c and b is given by 4 v b l b c v c l b c c θ c ψ c θ s ψ s θ s ϕ s θ c ψ c ϕ s ψ s ϕ s θ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s ϕ c θ c ϕ s θ c ψ s ϕ s

follows 5 ω ω x ω y ω z t r θ r 1 0 s θ 0 c ϕ c θ s ϕ 0 s ϕ c θ c ϕ the graphical representation of undersea kite reference frames are shown in figs 1 and 2 eqs 1 5 describe the basic kinematics of the kite translation and rotation additionally the following algebraic and differential properties of the transformation matrices are needed for deriving the kite equations of motion the velocity transformation matrix is orthogonal its inverse is the transpose i e 6 l c b l b c 1 l b c t it is well known that the derivative of the directional cosine matrix satisfies that 7 l c b l c b ω ω 0 ω

translational velocity v c with respect to spherical coordinate q satisfies 9 v c q p similarly the gradient matrix of the kite angular velocity ω with respect to the euler angles θ is given by 10 ω θ r ω r t combining with kinematic relations 1 5 the matrix equalities 6 10 will be used to establish the equivalences of undersea kite dynamics in different reference frames 2 2 rigid body dynamics equivalences as mentioned earlier the physical phenomena for the undersea kite are modeled in different reference frames this requires a mathematical framework that is capable of combining hydrodynamical added mass and rigid body model into a single dynamical system see fig 3 to achieve this goal we will present the equivalent relations of the rigid body dynamics between frames c b and s using the energy approach first the translational kinetic energies of a rigid body in frames c b and s are given by cartesian frame c k c t 1 2 m v c 2 body frame b k b t 1 2 m v b 2 spherical frame s k s t 1 2 m p q 2 where m is the kite mass ρ t is the tether length density and m m 1 3 ρ t r then the rotational energy of a rigid body measured in frame b and euler angles is given by body frame b k b r 1 2 ω t j ω euler angles θ k θ r 1 2 r θ t j r θ where j is the kite moment of inertia with these expressions the following lemmas hold for the rigid body dynamics the detailed derivation is presented in li et al 2016a lemma 1 translation dynamics equivalences using euler lagrange equations the translational dynamics of a rigid body in reference frames c b and s are given by inertial cartesian frame d d t k c t v c q c body frame d d t k b t v b q b spherical frame d d t k s t q k c t q q s the resulting translational dynamics are equivalent more precisely 11 d d t k c t v c l c b

undersea kite into a single dynamical system is established we will develop the complete undersea kite system dynamics in the following section 2 3 system dynamics of undersea kites in this section the forces acting on the undersea kites are first discussed then a complete dynamical model of the undersea kites is established in a general mechanical system the forces acting on the system include the conservative and non conservative ones in the tusk system the conservative forces include the gravitational and buoyancy forces the nonconservative forces include the steady hydrodynamical force anderson 2011 milne thomson 2013 the added mass effect contains both conservative and nonconservative parts the potential energy of the undersea kites is the sum of the gravitational and buoyancy potential energies 18 u g t r c n b t r c l c b d where d is the distance between kite center of gravity and center of buoyancy therefore the gravitational and buoyancy forces acting the undersea kite are 19 g t u r c 20 g r u θ the apparent velocity of the undersea kite is defined as 21 v a u a v a w a t l b c v c w then the kite apparent attitudes can be computed as follows 22 α arctan w a u a β arcsin v a v a where v a v a is the kite apparent speed and α and β are often referred to as the angle of attack and side slip angle respectively the kite apparent attitudes α and β as shown in figs 5 and 6 play a key role in determining the steady hydrodynamical forces acting on the kites in general the kite lift and drag coefficients are function of α while the side force coefficient is function of β c l c l α c d c d α c y c y β by inspection of fig 5 the kite hydrodynamical coefficients along the body axes can be represented in matrix form 23 c x c z 1 0 0 1 sin α cos α cos α sin α c l c d moreover the turbine drag coefficient manwell et al 2010 can be computed using the induction factor a as follows c t 4 a 1 a s t s where s t is the turbine area and s is the kite area therefore the total hydrodynamic coefficients along the kite body axes are 24 c b c x c y c z t c t 0 0 t hence the total steady hydrodynamic force acting on the undersea kite becomes 25 h 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s c b in addition to the steady hydrodynamical force the added mass effect also has a significant influence on the undersea kite motion although the navier stokes equations characterize the full fluid structure interaction these partial differential equations are difficult to use in the real time control decision making to facilitate the control system design and analysis while accounting for the fluid structure interaction we adopt an added mass approach using euler lagrange formulation suppose the added mass effect is introduced by the following quadratic kinetic energy which can be found in korotkin 2009 t f 1 2 v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω where m a and j a are symmetric added mass matrices due to kite translation and rotation alone and matrix γ is the added mass matrix due to the coupling of kite translation and rotation expanding the quadratic equation using eqs 4 and 21 yields 26 t f 1 2 v b t m a v b 1 2 ω t j a ω ω t γ v b v b t m a w b ω t γ w b 1 2 w b t m a w b where w b l b c w is the current velocity measured in the body frame b the last term in eq 26 is a function of kite attitude only hence it represents a potential energy associated with the current velocity denoting this term as 27 u v 1 2 w b t m a w b then the conservative force introduced by u v is 28 g v u v θ furthermore the nonconservative force introduced by the added mass effects can be modeled using the kirchhoff equations milne thomson 2013 the impulse introduced by t f is given by η t t f v b m a v b γ t ω m a w b η r t f ω j a ω γ v b γ w b using impulse force principle milne thomson 2013 we have a t η t ω η t a r η r ω η r v b η t and more explicitly 29 a t m a v a γ t ω ω m a v a γ t ω 30 a r j a ω γ v a ω j a ω γ v a v b m a v a γ t ω as mentioned earlier the conservative force the steady hydrodynamic force and the added mass effects are modeled in different reference frames using the generalized force transformations 13 15 and 17 the total generalized force acting on the undersea kites translation is given by q b l b c g t h a t t b where t b is the tether tension the generalized force acting on the kite rotation is given by m θ r t u b g r g v r t a r where u b is the rotational control inputs that need to be designed use the conclusions of lemmas 1 and 2 the complete dynamics of the tusk systems is given by 31 m v b ω v b l b c g t h a t t b 32 r t j ω ω j ω r t u b g r g v r t a r however generalized forces introduced by the added mass effect a t and a r depend on the kite apparent translational and rotational acceleration v a and ω on the other hand the dynamics of the undersea kite are described by the absolute kite velocity v b this inconsistency introduces another difficulty in constructing a dynamical model that is convenient for simulation and control design the following assumption is made to simplify the discussion below assumption 1 the current velocity w is constant under the above assumption we could arrive some important results on undersea kite stability these results can be used to design adaptive or optimal control systems for undersea kites in the future the first result come from newtonian dynamics which states that the acceleration observed in the cartesian frame c and body frame b are the same lemma 3 for a constant current velocity w the following two equalities hold 33 w b ω w b 34 v b ω v b v a ω v a where w b is the current velocity measured in body frame b proof by definition current velocity measured in body frame b is w l c b w b taking the time derivative of the equation above l c b w b l c b w b 0 using the matrix identity 7 l c b ω w b l c b w b 0 since velocity transformation matrix l c b is invertible equation above then can be simplified as follows ω w b w b 0 therefore eq 33 holds moreover using eq 33 and distributive property of the cross product v b ω v b v b ω w b ω v b ω w b v b w b ω v b w b v a ω v a using eq 34 the undersea kite translational dynamics 31 can be transformed to the following form 35 m v a ω v a l b c g t h a t t b substituting eqs 29 and 30 into eqs 32 and 35 after some algebraic manipulation 36 m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b 37 r t j j a ω γ v a ω j j a ω γ v a v b m a v a γ t ω r t u b g r g v the kite rotational and translational equations of motion were derived from the euler lagrange approach the resulting system dynamics are bidirectional coupled and under actuated even if the kite rotational motion is fully actuated there is at most one control input to the translational motion no control input if the tether length is constant one control input in the tension direction if the tether length is variable in the following section the stability criterion for both cases constant and variable tether length will be established 3 stability analysis based on the system dynamics 36 and 37 a stability analysis of the tusk system is presented in this section first the passivity of the steady hydrodynamic force is proven by treating the tether tension as an additional external input to the tusk systems the input to state stability iss is then derived for the tusk dynamics furthermore if the tether tension is bounded by the square of apparent current speed we will show that the kite velocity is ultimately bounded 3 1 dissipativity of hydrodynamic force it can be shown in the following lemma that the steady hydrodynamic force is dissipative with respect to the undersea kite apparent velocity lemma 4 if the side slip angle β is bounded by π 2 and the kite apparent velocity is positive in x axis i e 38 β π 2 u a 0 then the hydrodynamic force is dissipative with respect to the kite apparent velocity i e 39 v a t h 0 proof if the apparent velocity of the undersea kite is positive along the x axis then the kite angle of attack α is also bounded by π 2 i e α π 2 expanding the left hand side of inequality 39 with eq 24 gives v a t h 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s v a t c b 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s u a c x c t v a c y w a c z using the apparent angle α and β α arctan w a u a β arcsin v a v a the kite apparent velocity can be rewritten as follows u a v a w a v a cos α cos β v a sin β v a sin α cos β the left hand side of the inequality 39 can be expanded by using eq 23 v a t h 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s u a c x c t v a c y w a c z 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c x c t c α c β c y s β c z s α c β 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c l s α c d c α c α c β c y s β c l c α c d s α s α c β c t c α c β 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c d c β c y s β c t c α c β by assumption 38 cos β 0 and cos α cos β 0 both turbine and kite drag coefficients c d and c t are positive hence c d cos β c t cos α cos β 0 the following inequality also holds as shown in fig 6 c y sin β 0 the following inequality holds immediately v a t h 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c a 0 c a c d cos β c t cos α cos β c y sin β 0 to prove inequality 39 we only need to prove that c a 0 which can be shown as follows suppose cos β 0 it is clear that c d cos β 0 even if cos α 0 thus c a 0 on the other hand if cos β 0 we must have sin β 1 in this case c y 0 which means c y sin β 0 therefore the lemma is proven 3 2 input to state stability to simplify the following derivation we first transform the tusk dynamics 36 and 37 into their equivalent form 40 m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b 41 j j a ω γ v a ω j j a ω γ v a v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω u b r t 1 g r g v where 42 u b u b w b m a v a γ t ω in next lemma we will show that system 40 and 41 are iss with respect to t b and u b as the first result we will show that this properties holds in a current with constant velocity in particular we will show the case where the current velocity is horizontal this is an important case since the tusk system is designed to harvest energy from a horizontal flowing current the assumption is made so that the derivation is as simple as possible while also showing how the passivity of the hydrodynamic force influences the stability of tusk systems although it is possible to make arguments on a more general case the particular set of assumption presented in the following lemma is enough to build a mathematical framework to address the stability issue lemma 5 assume the current velocity is horizontal 43 w t g t 0 and there exist two positive constants c min and δ c such that 44 c a c min δ c if the rotational control signal is chosen in such way that u b 0 then the tusk dynamics 40 and 41 are input to state stable with respect to tether tension t b more explicitly choose the lyapunov function as 45 e a t a u u v where t a 1 2 v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω m a m a m i 3 j a j j a and u u v are given by eqs 18 and 27 if v a 2 t b ρ w s δ c then 46 e a 1 2 ρ w s c m i n v a 3 proof denote the kite apparent kinetic energy as follows t a 1 2 v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω taking the time derivative of t a along the system trajectory 40 and 41 yields t a v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω v a t ω t 0 ω j j a ω γ v a ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b u b r 1 t g r g v using the cross product properties ω t ω j j a ω γ v a 0 v a t ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω t v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω the time derivative of t a can be simplified as follows t a v a t ω t l b c g t h t b u b r 1 t g r g v if the tusk dynamics is uncontrolled i e u b 0 the equation above becomes t a v a t ω t l b c g t h t b r 1 t g r g v using the kinematic relations 5 and 21 v a l b c v c w ω r θ the time derivative of t a can be expanded as follows t a v c w t g t v a t h t b θ t g r g v using assumption 43 the equation can be further simplified t a v c t g t v a t h t b θ t g r g v define the total potential energy u t as follows u t u u v where u g t r c b t r c l c b d u v 1 2 w b t m a w b the time derivative of total potential energy u t is given by u t v c t u r c θ t u θ θ t u v θ hence the time derivative of the lyapunov function e a 45 is given by e a t a u t v a t h t b using the conclusion of lemma 4 e a 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c a v a t b hence a sufficient condition for 46 can be solved by the following 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c a v a t b 1 2 ρ w s c m i n v a 3 which can be further simplified using eq 46 v a 2 t b ρ w s δ c 3 3 ultimate boundedness the input to state stability established in lemma 5 indicates that the kite apparent speed is bounded for a bounded tether tension in a tusk system with constant tether length on the other hand the ultimate boundedness of the system states can be proven using a similar analysis one of the major differences between constant tether length and variable tether length tusk systems is the velocity transformation between spherical frame s and cartesian frame c instead of 4 the transformation is given by v c p q p r sin q 1 sin q 2 cos q 1 cos q 2 cos q 1 0 sin q 1 cos q 2 cos q 1 sin q 2 however the derivation of the input to state stability in the last section does not depend on the velocity transformation 4 therefore the conclusion of lemma 5 is valid for constant tether length tusk systems additionally if the tether length is constant the kite motion is constrained in a sphere centered at the system origin which implies that the tension direction is perpendicular to the kite velocity δ q t p t l c b t b 0 furthermore the tether tension can be computed by the force balance in the tether direction 47 t b l b c g t h a t q ˆ q ˆ if the undersea kite apparent velocity does not vanish the tether tension can then be bounded by a quadratic function of the kite apparent speed the input to state stability 46 reduces to ultimate boundedness given in the following corollary corollary 1 suppose λ t 0 such that 48 t b 1 2 ρ w s λ t v a 2 then the states of the uncontrolled tusk dynamics are ultimately bounded i e eq 40 and 41 are ultimately bounded if u b 0 more explicitly if v a λ t w c m i n the time derivative of lyapunov function e a which is given by 45 is negative definite 49 e a 0 proof using the velocity transformations 3 and 4 the tether tension direction is constrained by v b t t b 0 using eqs 4 and 21 we have e a v a t h t b v a v b l b c w combining the two equations above e a v a t h v b l b c w t t b therefore the time derivative of e a can be further simplified as follows e a v a t h l b c w t t b 1 2 ρ w s v a 3 c a w t b 1 2 ρ w s v a 3 c a 1 2 ρ w s λ t v a 2 w then the conclusion of the corollary can be solved directly from the following inequality 1 2 ρ w s v a 3 c a 1 2 ρ w s λ t v a 2 w 0 which can be sufficiently guaranteed by v a λ t w c min the stability analysis of the undersea kite apparent velocity was presented in summary for an uncontrolled undersea kite the bound on its apparent velocity is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the tether tension in particular if the tether length is constant such bound is proportional to the current speed 4 rotational control design here a rotational control algorithm will be designed based on the stability property derived in the previous section first an input output system is defined based on the tusk dynamics 40 and 41 then we show that the input output system is passive khalil 2001 and a control algorithm is proposed to increase the passivity of the system finally for a constant tether length tusk system it can be shown that the proposed control algorithm guarantees the ultimate boundedness of the system states consider the following input output system based on the tusk dynamics 40 and 41 50 m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b 51 j j a ω γ v a ω j j a ω γ v a v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω u b r 1 t g r g v 52 y v a θ u t b u e k θ θ θ d where the u and y are the input and output to system 50 and 51 if the roll angle θ π 2 u b uniquely determines the input signal u e as follows u e r t u b moreover k θ is a positive definite design matrix and θ d is some desired attitude which will be discussed later using the kinematic relation 5 the supply rate to the system as defined in khalil 2001 is given by s u t y v a t t b θ t u e θ t k θ θ θ d v a t t b ω t u b θ t k θ θ θ d based on the lyapunov function proposed in eq 45 one can construct a storage function as follows 53 e a t a u u v 1 2 θ θ d t k θ θ θ d following the derivation in lemma 5 time derivative of the storage function 53 along the trajectory of system 50 and 51 is given by e a v a t h v a t t b ω t u b θ t k θ θ θ d by lemma 4 that is e a 1 2 ρ w s v a 3 c a u t y moreover v a t h 0 and the input output system defined in 50 52 is strictly passive to design the rotational control algorithm one can choose the storage function 53 as the lyapunov function candidate it can be shown that the

velocity observed in body frame w b cannot be measured directly using on board sensor to implement control signal 55 adaptive algorithm need to be designed in the future 5 baseline simulation in this section a baseline simulation is conducted to test the proposed control algorithm 55 first the key tusk system parameters used in the simulation are listed the key parameters in table 1 are selected to match a nominal existing tusk system from minesto then the simulation results are presented and discussed 5 1 simulation results for a thin wing undersea kite the added mass matrices m a and j a

coefficients along the i b and j b directions are negligible and λ 1 represents the added mass effect along the k b axis for rotational motion on the other hand the added mass effect caused by the kite rotation along k b direction is negligible and λ 2 and λ 3 represent the added mass effect due to kite rotation about the i b and j b axes the coefficient λ 4 represents the added mass due to the coupling of kite translation along the k b direction and rotation along the j b direction these coefficients are determined by the wing geometry denote the wing area as s and wing span as b then the wing mean chord length c m is given by 58 c m s b the added mass coefficients korotkin 2009 λ i i 1 4 are given by 59 λ 1 κ 1 ρ w s c m λ 2 3 κ 2 3 ρ w s c m 3 λ 4 κ 4 ρ w s c m 2 the values of κ i i

06 1 0 6 α 3 0 0405 α 0 2 otherwise the effect of finite wing span is also taken into account in the simulation as in anderson 2011 the buoyancy force is given as a fraction represented by λ b of the kite gravitational force 60 n b λ b g the coordinate of the geometric center in the body frame is given in table 1 in summary the key physical parameters in the baseline simulation are listed in the following table in addition to the control algorithm 55 we implement a switching mechanism in the baseline simulation to establish cross current motion of the kite denote the limiting cross current position by q 1 and q 1 then the switching of kite desired attitudes i e θ d and θ d are determined by the following rule 61 θ d θ d if q 1 q 1 θ d if q 1 q 1 the following equation is adopted to

and the resulting power of about 27 485 kw on average 6 conclusion in this paper a framework of modeling and control of tethered undersea kite energy systems was presented an added mass model was applied to the undersea kites to characterize the fluid structure interaction the dissipative property of steady hydrodynamic force was shown based on this property the stability of the undersea kite states was analyzed based on lyapunov methods it has been shown that the upper bound of undersea kite apparent speed is proportional to the square of tension magnitude also if the tether length is constant this upper bound is proportional to the current speed a strictly passive input output system was defined based on the proposed undersea kite dynamics finally a rotational control signal was designed based on lyapunov methods a baseline simulation was conducted for a constant tether length undersea kite system it shows successive figure eight power generation cycles for the undersea kites driven by the proposed control algorithm an unsteady hydrodynamic force model can be added to the proposed undersea kite dynamics in the future the added mass model that considered in this paper is a model with constant parameters in practice parameters such as the added mass coefficient can be time varying and need to be identified online the effects of surface waves also can be considered through the added mass model from a control perspective the system stability under the switching mechanism needs to be addressed moreover the robustness of the proposed control signals against disturbance also needs to be considered finally a control algorithm to achieve optimal kite trajectories for maximum power output can be designed using the proposed undersea dynamics acknowledgment

22437,the modeling and control of tethered undersea kites for power generation are discussed in this paper in the first part we apply the added mass model to underwater kite systems in the second part the stability of undersea kite systems is analyzed using two frameworks the dissipative property of the hydrodynamic force is provided first based on this property the input to state stability of the

keywords undersea kite lyapunov based control added mass 1 introduction tethered undersea kite tusk energy is an emerging renewable energy technology system in which the undersea kites are used to convert current energy into electricity a tusk system consists of four parts the rigid undersea kite an attached marine turbine the tether and a floating or seabed platform there are two significant advantages of tusk systems over conventional marine turbines first tusk can move at a high cross current velocity over a large swept area to significantly increase power output compared to same size marine turbines as a result tusk systems can be used in lower velocity currents secondly tethered undersea kites do not require costly support structures in spite of their potential there are only a few systematic investigations olinger and wang 2015 paiva et al 2018 li et al 2016a mademlis et al 2018 on tusk systems however airborne wind energy systems awe which use a similar concept for wind power harvesting have been given more attention from the research community vermillion et al 2013 vermillion and fagiano 2013 ahrens et al 2013 the systematic study of awe systems started in the 1980s when loyd provided a first rigorous analysis of the power limit of a kite in a cross wind motion in loyd 1980 due to their similarity loyd s limit can also serve as a theoretical foundation for tusk systems awe systems can be placed into three categories buoyant systems vermillion et al 2012 flexible kite systems fagiano et al 2014 and rigid glider systems li et al 2015a williams et al 2008a b among these configurations the rigid glider systems are most similar to tusk similar to rigid glider awe systems the tusk systems can be classified as flygen systems olinger and wang 2015 with an onboard turbine and constant tether length and buoygen systems with variable tether length compared with more conventional ocean power conversion technologies melikoglu 2018 uihlein and magagna 2016 such as marine turbines and wave energy converters the flygen tusk system can be viewed as a current speed enhancement device due to the rigid wing s high cross current velocity although both tusk and awe system dynamics can be captured using rigid body formalism there is one significant difference the water density is much higher than air density in principle the full fluid structure interaction can be characterized using partial differential equations pde de groot et al 2011 however the resulting system dynamics can be too computationally expensive for real time control algorithms to overcome this difficulty an added mass model is applied to tusk system milne thomson 2013 in this paper in this approach the fluid structure interaction is modeled as additional inertia on the undersea kite such approach has been widely used in underwater vehicle control system design valentinis and woolsey 2019 anderlini et al 2018 similar to awe systems the control system design is the key issue in achieving robust and optimal power harvesting of the tusk systems unlike the awe systems where many control system design techniques li et al 2015b 2016b 2015a vermillion et al 2014 bafandeh and vermillion 2016 nikpoorparizi et al 2018 henriques et al 2016 barambones et al 2018 have already been investigated the control system design of tusk system more or less remains untouched apparently due to the similar power generation mechanism it is possible to apply many developed control schemes for awe systems onto the tusk systems however the significant fluid structure interaction presented in tusk dynamics poses additional challenges to achieving system stability and optimum power harvesting when similar algorithms are used in the second part of this paper we propose three frameworks which can be used to analyze the stability of tusk systems moreover a passivity based control algorithm will be designed for tusk systems the organization and main contributions of this work are as follows first some useful notations and kinematic relations are presented and an added mass model is applied to the tusk dynamics milne thomson 2013 second the passivity property of the hydrodynamic force will be investigated a framework of the stability analysis of tusk systems is presented we will show that the full tusk dynamics are input to state stable and the translational motion of undersea kites are ultimately bounded under the tether tension of a quadratic type third an input output system based on the tusk dynamics is defined and a passivity based control signal is designed finally we present a baseline simulation that yields successive power generation cycles to test the proposed control system 2 equations of motion physical phenomena in tusk systems are modeled in different reference frames by convention 1 the hydrodynamics models are established in a reference frame with respect to flow direction 2 the undersea kite rotation is characterized with respect to an inertial earth frame 3 the added mass effects are usually modeled in a reference frame attached to the kite body 4 the motion of the undersea kite is constrained by a tether which is described in a spherical frame to derive a system of equations of motion that includes all these perspectives we first present some key kinematics relations between different reference frames then the equivalences of the system dynamics between frames are presented finally tusk dynamics are derived which will enable the stability analysis in the next section 2 1 system kinematics denote the reference frames as follows inertial cartesian frame c i c j c k c body frame b i b j b k b spherical frame s e r e 1 e 2 the i c axis is set along the upstream current direction k c axis vertically downward and j c axis forms a right hand coordinate system with i c and k c the body frame b centers at the kite center of gravity and follows the north east down convention as shown in fig

translational velocity v c with respect to spherical coordinate q satisfies 9 v c q p similarly the gradient matrix of the kite angular velocity ω with respect to the euler angles θ is given by 10 ω θ r ω r t combining with kinematic relations 1 5 the matrix equalities 6 10 will be used to establish the equivalences of undersea kite dynamics in different reference frames 2 2 rigid body dynamics equivalences as mentioned earlier the physical phenomena for the undersea kite are modeled in different reference frames this requires a mathematical framework that is capable of combining hydrodynamical added mass and rigid body model into a single dynamical system see fig 3 to achieve this goal we will present the equivalent relations of the rigid body dynamics between frames c b and s using the energy approach first the translational kinetic energies of a rigid body in frames c b and s are given by cartesian frame c k c t 1 2 m v c 2 body frame b k b t 1 2 m v b 2 spherical frame s k s t 1 2 m p q 2 where m is the kite mass ρ t is the tether length density and m m 1 3 ρ t r then the rotational energy of a rigid body measured in frame b and euler angles is given by body frame b k b r 1 2 ω t j ω euler angles θ k θ r 1 2 r θ t j r θ where j is the kite moment of inertia with these expressions the following lemmas hold for the rigid body dynamics the detailed derivation is presented in li et al 2016a lemma 1 translation dynamics equivalences using euler lagrange equations the translational dynamics of a rigid body in reference frames c b and s are given by inertial

also be obtained using the virtual work principle 17 m θ ω θ t m b r t m b using eqs 13 15 17 with lemmas 1 and 2 a mathematical framework which can combine the different physical phenomena for the undersea kite into a single dynamical system is established we will develop the complete undersea kite system dynamics in the following section 2 3 system dynamics of undersea kites in this section the forces acting on the undersea kites are first discussed then a complete dynamical model of the undersea kites is established in a general mechanical system the forces acting on the system include the conservative and non conservative ones in the tusk system the conservative forces include the gravitational and buoyancy forces the nonconservative forces include the steady hydrodynamical force anderson 2011 milne thomson 2013 the added mass effect contains both conservative and nonconservative parts the potential energy of the undersea kites is the sum of the gravitational and buoyancy potential energies 18 u g t r c n b t r c l c b d where d is the distance between kite center of gravity and center of buoyancy therefore the gravitational and buoyancy forces acting the undersea kite are 19 g t u r c 20 g r u θ the apparent velocity of the undersea kite is defined as 21 v a u a v a w a t l b c v c w then the kite apparent attitudes can be computed as follows 22 α arctan w a u a β arcsin v a v a where v a v a is the kite apparent speed and α and β are often referred to as the angle of attack and side slip angle respectively the kite apparent attitudes α and β as shown in figs 5 and 6 play a key role in determining the steady hydrodynamical forces acting on the kites in general the kite lift and drag coefficients are function of α while the side force coefficient is function of β c l c l α c d c d α c y c y β by inspection of fig 5 the kite hydrodynamical coefficients along the body axes can be represented in matrix form 23 c x c z 1 0 0 1 sin α cos α cos α sin α c l c d moreover the turbine drag coefficient manwell et al 2010 can be computed using the induction factor a as follows c t 4 a 1 a s t s where s t is the turbine area and s is the kite area therefore the total hydrodynamic coefficients along the kite body axes are 24 c b c x c y c z t c t 0 0 t hence the total steady hydrodynamic force acting on the undersea kite becomes 25 h 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s c b in addition to the steady hydrodynamical force the added mass effect also has a significant influence on the undersea kite motion although the navier stokes equations characterize the full fluid structure interaction these partial differential equations are difficult to use in the real time control decision making to facilitate the control system design and analysis while accounting for the fluid structure interaction we adopt an added mass approach using euler lagrange formulation suppose the added mass effect is introduced by the following quadratic kinetic energy which can be found in korotkin 2009 t f 1 2 v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω where m a and j a are symmetric added mass matrices due to kite translation and rotation alone and matrix γ is the added mass matrix due to the coupling of kite translation and rotation expanding the quadratic equation using eqs 4 and 21 yields 26 t f 1 2 v b t m a v b 1 2 ω t j a ω ω t γ v b v b t m a w b ω t γ w b 1 2 w b t m a w b where w b l b c w is the current velocity measured in the body frame b the last term in eq 26 is a function of kite attitude only hence it represents a potential energy associated with the current velocity denoting this term as 27 u v 1 2 w b t m a w b then the conservative force introduced by u v is 28 g v u v θ furthermore the nonconservative force introduced by the added mass effects can be modeled using the kirchhoff equations milne thomson 2013 the impulse introduced by t f is given by η t t f v b m a v b γ t ω m a w b η r t f ω j a ω γ v b γ w b using impulse force principle milne thomson 2013 we have a t η t ω η t a r η r ω η r v b η t and more explicitly 29 a t m a v a γ t ω ω m a v a γ t ω 30 a r j a ω γ v a ω j a ω γ v a v b m a v a γ t ω as mentioned earlier the conservative force the steady hydrodynamic force and the added mass effects are modeled in different reference frames using the generalized force transformations 13 15 and 17 the total generalized force acting on the undersea kites translation is given by q b l b c g t h a t t b where t b is the tether tension the generalized force acting on the kite rotation is given by m θ r t u b g r g v r t a r where u b is the rotational control inputs that need to be designed use the conclusions of lemmas 1 and 2 the complete dynamics of the tusk systems is given by 31 m v b ω v b l b c g t h a t t b 32 r t j ω ω j ω r t u b g r g v r t a r however generalized forces introduced by the added mass effect a t and a r depend on the kite apparent translational and rotational acceleration v a and ω on the other hand the dynamics of the undersea kite are described by the absolute kite velocity v b this inconsistency introduces another difficulty in constructing a dynamical model that is convenient for simulation and control design the following assumption is made to simplify the discussion below assumption 1 the current velocity w is constant under the above assumption we could arrive some important results on undersea kite stability these results can be used to design adaptive or optimal control systems for undersea kites in the future the first result come from newtonian dynamics which states that the acceleration observed in the cartesian frame c and body frame b are the same lemma 3 for a constant current velocity w the following two equalities hold 33 w b ω w b 34 v b ω v b v a ω v a where w b is the current velocity measured in body frame b proof by definition current velocity measured in body frame b is w l c b w b taking the time derivative of the equation above l c b w b l c b w b 0 using the matrix identity 7 l c b ω w b l c b w b 0 since velocity transformation matrix l c b is invertible equation above then can be simplified as follows ω w b w b 0 therefore eq 33 holds moreover using eq 33 and distributive property of the cross product v b ω v b v b ω w b ω v b ω w b v b w b ω v b w b v a ω v a using eq 34 the undersea kite translational dynamics 31 can be transformed to the following form 35 m v a ω v a l b c g t h a t t b substituting eqs 29 and 30 into eqs 32 and 35 after some algebraic manipulation 36 m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b 37 r t j j a ω γ v a ω j j a ω γ v a v b m a v a γ t ω r t u b g r g v the kite rotational and translational equations of motion were derived from the euler lagrange approach the resulting system dynamics are bidirectional coupled and under actuated even if the kite rotational motion is fully actuated there is at most one control input to the translational motion no control input if the tether length is constant one control input in the tension direction if the tether length is variable in the following section the stability criterion for both cases constant and variable tether length will be established 3 stability analysis based on the system dynamics 36 and 37 a stability analysis of the tusk system is presented in this section first the passivity of the steady hydrodynamic force is proven by treating the tether tension as an additional external input to the tusk systems the input to state stability iss is then derived for the tusk dynamics furthermore if the tether tension is bounded by the square of apparent current speed we will show that the kite velocity is ultimately bounded 3 1 dissipativity of hydrodynamic force it can be shown in the following lemma that the steady hydrodynamic force is dissipative with respect to the undersea kite apparent velocity lemma 4 if the side slip angle β is bounded by π 2 and the kite apparent velocity is positive in x axis i e 38 β π 2 u a 0 then the hydrodynamic force is dissipative with respect to the kite apparent velocity i e 39 v a t h 0 proof if the apparent velocity of the undersea kite is positive along the x axis then the kite angle of attack α is also bounded by π 2 i e α π 2 expanding the left hand side of inequality 39 with eq 24 gives v a t h 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s v a t c b 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s u a c x c t v a c y w a c z using the apparent angle α and β α arctan w a u a β arcsin v a v a the kite apparent velocity can be rewritten as follows u a v a w a v a cos α cos β v a sin β v a sin α cos β the left hand side of the inequality 39 can be expanded by using eq 23 v a t h 1 2 ρ w v a 2 s u a c x c t v a c y w a c z 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c x c t c α c β c y s β c z s α c β 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c l s α c d c α c α c β c y s β c l c α c d s α s α c β c t c α c β 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c d c β c y s β c t c α c β by assumption 38 cos β 0 and cos α cos β 0 both turbine and kite drag coefficients c d and c t are positive hence c d cos β c t cos α cos β 0 the following inequality also holds as shown in fig 6 c y sin β 0 the following inequality holds immediately v a t h 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c a 0 c a c d cos β c t cos α cos β c y sin β 0 to prove inequality 39 we only need to prove that c a 0 which can be shown as follows suppose cos β 0 it is clear that c d cos β 0 even if cos α 0 thus c a 0 on the other hand if cos β 0 we must have sin β 1 in this case c y 0 which means c y sin β 0 therefore the lemma is proven 3 2 input to state stability to simplify the following derivation we first transform the tusk dynamics 36 and 37 into their equivalent form 40 m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b 41 j j a ω γ v a ω j j a ω γ v a v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω u b r t 1 g r g v where 42 u b u b w b m a v a γ t ω in next lemma we will show that system 40 and 41 are iss with respect to t b and u b as the first result we will show that this properties holds in a current with constant velocity in particular we will show the case where the current velocity is horizontal this is an important case since the tusk system is designed to harvest energy from a horizontal flowing current the assumption is made so that the derivation is as simple as possible while also showing how the passivity of the hydrodynamic force influences the stability of tusk systems although it is possible to make arguments on a more general case the particular set of assumption presented in the following lemma is enough to build a mathematical framework to address the stability issue lemma 5 assume the current velocity is horizontal 43 w t g t 0 and there exist two positive constants c min and δ c such that 44 c a c min δ c if the rotational control signal is chosen in such way that u b 0 then the tusk dynamics 40 and 41 are input to state stable with respect to tether tension t b more explicitly choose the lyapunov function as 45 e a t a u u v where t a 1 2 v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω m a m a m i 3 j a j j a and u u v are given by eqs 18 and 27 if v a 2 t b ρ w s δ c then 46 e a 1 2 ρ w s c m i n v a 3 proof denote the kite apparent kinetic energy as follows t a 1 2 v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω taking the time derivative of t a along the system trajectory 40 and 41 yields t a v a t ω t m a γ t γ j a v a ω v a t ω t 0 ω j j a ω γ v a ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b u b r 1 t g r g v using the cross product properties ω t ω j j a ω γ v a 0 v a t ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω t v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω the time derivative of t a can be simplified as follows t a v a t ω t l b c g t h t b u b r 1 t g r g v if the tusk dynamics is uncontrolled i e u b 0 the equation above becomes t a v a t ω t l b c g t h t b r 1 t g r g v using the kinematic relations 5 and 21 v a l b c v c w ω r θ the time derivative of t a can be expanded as follows t a v c w t g t v a t h t b θ t g r g v using assumption 43 the equation can be further simplified t a v c t g t v a t h t b θ t g r g v define the total potential energy u t as follows u t u u v where u g t r c b t r c l c b d u v 1 2 w b t m a w b the time derivative of total potential energy u t is given by u t v c t u r c θ t u θ θ t u v θ hence the time derivative of the lyapunov function e a 45 is given by e a t a u t v a t h t b using the conclusion of lemma 4 e a 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c a v a t b hence a sufficient condition for 46 can be solved by the following 1 2 ρ w v a 3 s c a v a t b 1 2 ρ w s c m i n v a 3 which can be further simplified using eq 46 v a 2 t b ρ w s δ c 3 3 ultimate boundedness the input to state stability established in lemma 5 indicates that the kite apparent speed is bounded for a bounded tether tension in a tusk system with constant tether length on the other hand the ultimate boundedness of the system states can be proven using a similar analysis one of the major differences between constant tether length and variable tether length tusk systems is the velocity transformation between spherical frame s and cartesian frame c instead of 4 the transformation is given by v c p q p r sin q 1 sin q 2 cos q 1 cos q 2 cos q 1 0 sin q 1 cos q 2 cos q 1 sin q 2 however the derivation of the input to state stability in the last section does not depend on the velocity transformation 4 therefore the conclusion of lemma 5 is valid for constant tether length tusk systems additionally if the tether length is constant the kite motion is constrained in a sphere centered at the system origin which implies that the tension direction is perpendicular to the kite velocity δ q t p t l c b t b 0 furthermore the tether tension can be computed by the force balance in the tether direction 47 t b l b c g t h a t q ˆ q ˆ if the undersea kite apparent velocity does not vanish the tether tension can then be bounded by a quadratic function of the kite apparent speed the input to state stability 46 reduces to ultimate boundedness given in the following corollary corollary 1 suppose λ t 0 such that 48 t b 1 2 ρ w s λ t v a 2 then the states of the uncontrolled tusk dynamics are ultimately bounded i e eq 40 and 41 are ultimately bounded if u b 0 more explicitly if v a λ t w c m i n the time derivative of lyapunov function e a which is given by 45 is negative definite 49 e a 0 proof using the velocity transformations 3 and 4 the tether tension direction is constrained by v b t t b 0 using eqs 4 and 21 we have e a v a t h t b v a v b l b c w combining the two equations above e a v a t h v b l b c w t t b therefore the time derivative of e a can be further simplified as follows e a v a t h l b c w t t b 1 2 ρ w s v a 3 c a w t b 1 2 ρ w s v a 3 c a 1 2 ρ w s λ t v a 2 w then the conclusion of the corollary can be solved directly from the following inequality 1 2 ρ w s v a 3 c a 1 2 ρ w s λ t v a 2 w 0 which can be sufficiently guaranteed by v a λ t w c min the stability analysis of the undersea kite apparent velocity was presented in summary for an uncontrolled undersea kite the bound on its apparent velocity is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the tether tension in particular if the tether length is constant such bound is proportional to the current speed 4 rotational control design here a rotational control algorithm will be designed based on the stability property derived in the previous section first an input output system is defined based on the tusk dynamics 40 and 41 then we show that the input output system is passive khalil 2001 and a control algorithm is proposed to increase the passivity of the system finally for a constant tether length tusk system it can be shown that the proposed control algorithm guarantees the ultimate boundedness of the system states consider the following input output system based on the tusk dynamics 40 and 41 50 m a m i 3 v a γ t ω ω m a m i 3 v a γ t ω l b c g t h t b 51 j j a ω γ v a ω j j a ω γ v a v a m a m i 3 v a γ t ω u b r 1 t g r g v 52 y v a θ u t b u e k θ θ θ d where the u and y are the input

k θ θ θ d based on the lyapunov function proposed in eq 45 one can construct a storage function as follows 53 e a t a u u v 1 2 θ θ d t k θ θ θ d following the derivation in lemma 5 time derivative of

kite rotation along k b direction is negligible and λ 2 and λ 3 represent the added mass effect due to kite rotation about the i b and j b axes the coefficient λ 4 represents the added mass due to the coupling of kite translation along the k b direction and rotation along the j b direction these coefficients are determined by the wing geometry denote the wing area as s and wing span as b then the wing mean chord length c m is given by 58 c m s b the added mass coefficients korotkin 2009 λ i i 1 4 are given by 59 λ 1 κ 1 ρ w s c m λ 2 3 κ 2 3 ρ w s c m 3 λ 4 κ 4 ρ w s c m 2 the values of κ i i

06 1 0 6 α 3 0 0405 α 0 2 otherwise the effect of finite wing span is also taken into account in the simulation as in anderson 2011 the buoyancy force is given as a fraction represented by λ b of the kite gravitational force 60 n b λ b g the coordinate of the geometric center in the body frame is given in table 1 in summary the key physical parameters in the baseline simulation are listed in the

applied to the undersea kites to characterize the fluid structure interaction the dissipative property of steady hydrodynamic force was shown based on this property the stability of the undersea kite states was analyzed based on lyapunov methods it has been shown that the upper bound of undersea kite apparent speed is proportional to the square of tension magnitude also if the tether length is constant this upper bound is proportional to the current speed a strictly passive input output system was defined based on the proposed undersea kite dynamics finally a rotational control signal was designed based on lyapunov methods a baseline simulation was conducted for a constant tether length undersea kite system it shows successive figure eight power generation cycles for the undersea kites driven by the proposed control algorithm an unsteady hydrodynamic force model can be added to the proposed undersea kite dynamics in the future the added mass model that considered in this paper is a model with constant parameters in practice parameters such as the added mass coefficient can be time varying and need to be identified online the effects of surface waves also can be considered through the added mass model from a control perspective the system stability under the switching mechanism needs to be addressed moreover the robustness of the proposed control signals against disturbance also needs to be considered finally a control algorithm to achieve optimal kite trajectories for maximum power output can be designed using the proposed undersea dynamics acknowledgment

22438,a real time identification procedure is applied to the estimation of hydrodynamic derivatives of ship manoeuvring equations in the procedure not only the ship motion data but also the wind data are used for making up a carx continuous auto regressive exogenous model the main advantage of the procedure is that the coefficients of the model directly correspond to the hydrodynamic derivatives the identification algorithm consists of the iir infinite impulse response digital filters and rls recursive least square method to discuss the reliability of the identified coefficients the procedure is applied to a full scale ship s data and the results are compared to the hydrodynamic derivatives provided by the shipbuilding company moreover a simple navigation support system is proposed using the identified hydrodynamic derivatives the system can indicate the ship manoeuvrable range under wind conditions and its usefulness is shown keywords iir filter hydrodynamic derivative real time estimation manoeuvrable range in wind 1 introduction it is very important for mariners to be familiar with the manoeuvrability of the own ship the ship manoeuvring performance however is influenced by loading conditions and water depth furthermore the effect of the weather conditions should be also recognized therefore it is considered necessary to develop a practical prediction method of manoeuvring performance for full scale ships under an arbitrary condition from the view point of the statistical data analysis the evaluation of the ship manoeuvring indices can be recognized as an identification procedure for a continuous system the author applied a direct parameter estimation procedure sagara et al 1990 to the nomoto model for ship manoeuvring motion iseki and ohtsu 2000 jiang and iseki 2015 the nomoto model also known as the k t model is a kind of response model of ship maneuverability and is widely used in full scale ship analysis nomoto et al 1956 1957 the direct parameter estimation algorithm consists of carx continuous auto regressive exogenous models and iir infinite impulse response filters while the arx model is defined in a discrete time domain and affected by the data sampling rate the carx model is defined in a continuous time domain and is characterized in that the parameters of the equations of motion are explicitly obtained as the model coefficients therefore there is no need to find the optimum sampling interval on the other hand the iir digital filters are introduced to avoid taking direct derivatives and to reduce the influence of measurement noise furthermore the iir filters are free form the initial condition problem and the accumulation problem of integration error results of the paper showed that the direct parameter estimation algorithm with carx models and iir filters was a powerful tool for real time identification of ship manoeuvring indices the main objective of this paper is development of a practical prediction method of manoeuvring performance for full scale ships under wind condition the direct parameter estimation procedure is applied to the estimation of hydrodynamic derivatives of ship manoeuvring equations furthermore the estimated hydrodynamic derivatives are used to estimate the manoeuvrability of the own ship under wind condition in the procedure therefore not only the ship motion data but also the wind data are used for making up a carx model the main advantage of the procedure is that the coefficients of the model directly correspond to the hydrodynamic derivatives the

the future work are summarized in the section 4 2 real time identification procedure in this section the algorithm of the real time identification method with iir digital filter is explained in which the coefficients of the motion equations appear explicitly and can be easily evaluated the real time identification procedure can be divided into three steps in the first step the ship manoeuvring motion equation is transformed into the integrated carx model the second step is the integration of the sampled data by using the iir digital filters and the last is the rls method 2 1 equations of motion in this section the ship motions are defined in a right handed xyz coordinate system with x to the bow y to the starboard side and z down words ignoring the motion of x direction the linearized manoeuvring equations are expressed as follows 1 m m y v y v v y r m r y r r y δ δ y w i z z j z z r n v v n v v n r r n δ δ n w where v and v denote the velocities and accelerations along the y axis

therefore estimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives can be considered as a fitting problem of coefficients χ of the carx model eq 6 in this study the integration of the signals ϕ t and φ t are obtained by introducing iir filters 2 3 iir filter in actual integration of eqs 7 and 8 the accumulation of the integration error is inevitable and numerical instability is induced therefore an approximated integration with the digital filter is introduced the filter has the equivalent response to the following transfer function 10 g s 1 s λ where λ denotes the constant that controls the damping of the signal the impulse response of eq 10 corresponds to g t e λt in the continuous time domain if eq 10 is used as an integral filter the damping effects can avoid the accumulation of the integration error consequently the transfer function in the discrete time domain that integrates n times in this case n 2 can be represented by the bilinear transformation as follows 11 h z 1 s λ n s 2 δ 1 z 1 1 z 1 2 δ 1 z 1 1 z 1 λ n where δ and z 1 are the sampling interval and the delay operator if v k is used to express the sampled values of v t at t k t k 0 1 the ith order integration of v k can be obtained through the digital filter p i z 12 v i k h z p n i v k p i z v k where p denotes the differential operator and using substituting eq 7 13 p i z 1 c 2 c 1 z 1 n c 1 n δ 2 i 1 z 1 i 1 z

following formulae 24 y w 1 2 ρ a a y v w 2 c y θ w n w 1 2 ρ a l a y v w 2 c n θ w where ρ a a y v w θ w denote the density of air lateral projected area the wind speed and direction although various formulae have been proposed for estimation of wind force coefficients c y θ w and c n θ w in this paper the following empirical formulae yamano and saito 1997 which can be widely applied to many types of ships are adopted 25 c y θ w i 1 3 c y i sin i θ w c n θ w i 1 3 0 1 c n i sin i θ w where the coefficients are calculated as follows 26 c y 1 0 509 4 904 a y l 2 0 022 a y a x c y 2 0 0208 0 230 a

transverse projected area and the distance between f p and the centroid of a y these formulae were applied to the measured wind data considering the relative speed and direction on the other hand the measured wind data includes gustiness in the actual estimation of the wind forces therefore the iir filter has been applied to the measured wind data in order to smooth the effect of wind gustiness 2 6 estimation of manoeuvrable range in wind the ship manoeuvrable range under wind condition are evaluated as the required ship speed to maintain the current course nakajima 1948 ishibashi 1975 to estimate the condition in which the ship can maintain the current course by the specified rudder angle δ s let v r r 0 and δ t δ s in eq 3 28 y w t y v v t y δ δ s n w t n v v t n δ δ s eliminating the lateral velocity v t from the equations and substituting eq 9 for y v y δ n v and n δ the equation of equilibrium is expressed as follows 29 n w t χ n 2 y w t χ y 2 χ n 5 χ n 2 χ y 5 χ y 2 δ s if it can be assumed that the ship course is changed with constant speed u 0 and eq 24 can be extended to the relative wind direction θ r and the relative wind speed v r θ r the equation for real time estimation of manoeuvrable range in wind can be obtained 30 u u 0 ρ a a y v r 2 θ r c n θ r χ n 2 c y θ r χ y 2 ρ l d u 0 2 χ n 5 χ n 2 χ y 5 χ y 2 δ s the equation indicates the required ship speed u when the ship must keep her course under the wind condition with the specified rudder angle δ s 3 full scale experiments full scale experiments were carried out using the training ship shioji maru table 1 and fig 1 off tateyama bay in chiba prefecture japan in addition to the ship course the rudder angle the wind speed and direction the ship longitudinal and lateral velocities were measured by a doppler sonar atlas dolog23 the gps data was not used in this report at all the data sets were measured in the sampling interval 0 5 s during the experiments the observed direction and the wind speed were 170deg and 7 m s respectively the wind forces and moments were calculated using the formulae described in the previous section to observe the transient response of the real time identification the data includes not only the straight course but also zig zag manoeuvres the execution time of the zig zag manoeuvres and the initial ship courses are shown in table 2 the actual time histories of the rudder angle ship course and speed are plotted in fig 2 it can be seen that the ship speed was dropped slightly during the zig zag manoeuvres 3 1 results of the real time identifica tion based on the real time identification procedure an in house software was developed fig 3 shows the graphical user interface of the program the upper left side of the screen shows movement of the ship and her trajectory that were calculated using the doppler sonar data the lower left side of the screen indicates the ship manoeuvrable range calculated by equation 29 the details are explained in the later section on the other hand the graphs in the middle and the right are indicating the time histories of measured data and the real time identified hydrodynamic derivatives specifically from the top the measured δ the identified m y and y v the identified y r and y r the identified y δ the measured and the iir filtered v are shown in the middle column in the right column from the top the measured u and the iir filtered v r the identified n v and n v the identified j zz and n r the identified n δ the estimated and the iir filtered y w are shown the stability and convergence of the real time identification can be observed by these graphs fig 4 shows the transition of identified added mass m y and added inertia moment j zz the figure is also indicating the hydrodynamic derivatives broken lines provided by the shipbuilding company for reference the identified added mass m y shows good agreement just after the end of the first zig zag manoeuvre it can be said that a certain degree of manoeuvre is required for good identification of m y on the other hand the identified added inertia moment seems to be unstable and does not agree with the reference value fig 5 shows the transition of identified hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v looking at the figure the results are stable but some discrepancies can be observed the reason of the disagreement is considered that the measured lateral velocity was too small to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives the real time estimation requires rather large fluctuation for both of input and output signals this concludes that the zig zag manoeuvre is not sufficient for precise identification of hydrodynamic derivatives concerning the ship lateral velocity because the lateral velocity appears in the carx model as a double integrated valuable v 2 t and the small fluctuations of v t becomes inconspicuous fig 6 shows the transition of identified hydrodynamic derivatives y r and n r looking at the figure the identified n r is stable and agree well with the reference value the reason of the agreement can be considered that the measured yaw rate time integrated signal of ship course in the carx model was rather large during the zig zag manoeuvres on the other hand the identified y r seems to be unstable and does not agree with the reference value it can be considered that the centrifugal force acting on the ship s hull was removed successfully in the identification process 3 2 manoeuvrable range in wind fig 7 shows contour lines of the estimated manoeuvrable range under the current wind condition the graph is almost the same as the radar chart excepting the centre point that is indicating zero ship speed the numbers arranged in the circumferential direction denote the absolute azimuth of the bow direction of the ship the own ship is indicated by the black circle in the 270deg direction on the second grey circle from the centre instead the grey coloured concentric circles denote the non dimensional ship speed u u 0 the second grey circle is u u 0 1 and the outermost grey circle is u u 0 2 the colours of contour lines correspond to the specified rudder angle δ s in equation 30 that were discretized from 1deg blue outermost to 35deg red innermost at 1 intervals therefore the region inside the red coloured line denotes the region in which the ship course cannot be maintained even with maximum rudder angle the mariner can easily understand the manoeuvrable range of the own ship by looking at the indicated chart however the reliability of the chart should be examined carefully because the identified hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v appeared in equation 30 and the identified values don t show good agreement with reference value 4 conclusions in this paper a real time identification procedure was applied to the estimation of hydrodynamic derivatives of ship manoeuvring equations the results are summarized below identified hydrodynamic derivatives m y and n r were stable and showed good agreement with the reference value provided by the shipbuilding company identified hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v were stable but some discrepancies could be observed the fact that the lateral velocity is very small and its fluctuation becomes inconspicuous by iir filters can be considered as the cause identification of hydrodynamic derivatives y r and j zz were unstable the cause should be investigated in detail the possibility of the simple navigation support system in winds has been shown but it is considered that the reliability of the identification procedure should be examined in this report the wind force and moment were treated as the measured signals through the formulae and the rudder force and the moment were included in the carx model as the unknown variables another modelling should be examined for more accurate identification furthermore the proposed real time identification method requires conspicuous output signals responding to fluctuating input signals therefore proper real time manoeuvres should be investigated for the estimation of each hydrodynamic derivative acknowledgements this work is partly supported by jsps kakenhi grant

estimation manoeuvrable range in wind 1 introduction it is very important for mariners to be familiar with the manoeuvrability of the own ship the ship manoeuvring performance however is influenced by loading conditions and water depth furthermore the effect of the weather conditions should be also recognized therefore it is considered necessary to develop a practical prediction method of manoeuvring performance for full scale ships under an arbitrary condition from the view point of the statistical data analysis the evaluation of the ship manoeuvring indices can be recognized as an identification procedure for a continuous system the author applied a direct parameter estimation procedure sagara et al 1990 to the nomoto model for ship manoeuvring motion iseki and ohtsu 2000 jiang and iseki 2015 the nomoto model also known as the k t model is a kind of response model of ship maneuverability and is widely used in full scale ship analysis nomoto et al 1956 1957 the direct parameter estimation algorithm consists of carx continuous auto regressive exogenous models and iir infinite impulse response filters while the arx model is defined in a discrete time domain and affected by the data sampling rate the carx model is defined in a continuous time domain and is characterized in that the parameters of the equations of motion are explicitly obtained as the model coefficients therefore there is no need to find the optimum sampling interval on the other hand the iir digital filters are introduced to avoid taking direct derivatives and to reduce the influence of measurement noise furthermore the iir filters are free form the initial condition problem and the accumulation problem of integration error results of the paper showed that the direct parameter estimation algorithm with carx models and iir filters was a powerful tool for real time identification of ship manoeuvring indices the main objective of this paper is development of a practical prediction method of manoeuvring performance for full scale ships under wind condition the direct parameter estimation procedure is applied to the estimation of hydrodynamic derivatives of ship manoeuvring equations furthermore the estimated hydrodynamic derivatives are used to estimate the manoeuvrability of the own ship under wind condition in the procedure therefore not only the ship motion data but also the wind data are used for making up a carx model the main advantage of the procedure is that the coefficients of the model directly correspond to the hydrodynamic derivatives the

the future work are summarized in the section 4 2 real time identification procedure in this section the algorithm of the real time identification method with iir digital filter is explained in which the coefficients of the motion equations appear explicitly and can be easily evaluated the real time identification procedure can be divided into three steps in the first step the ship manoeuvring

therefore estimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives can be considered as a fitting problem of coefficients χ of the carx model eq 6 in this study the integration of the signals ϕ t and φ t are obtained by introducing iir filters 2 3 iir filter in actual integration of eqs 7 and 8 the accumulation of the integration error is inevitable and numerical instability is induced therefore an approximated integration with the digital filter is introduced the filter has the equivalent response to the following transfer function 10 g s 1 s λ where λ denotes the constant that controls the damping of the signal the impulse response of eq 10 corresponds to g t e λt in the continuous time domain if eq 10 is used as an integral filter the damping effects can avoid the accumulation of the

broken lines provided by the shipbuilding company for reference the identified added mass m y shows good agreement just after the end of the first zig zag manoeuvre it can be said that a certain degree of manoeuvre is required for good identification of m y on the other hand the identified added inertia moment seems to be unstable and does not agree with the reference value fig 5 shows the transition of identified hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v looking at the figure the results are stable but some discrepancies can be observed the reason of the disagreement is considered that the measured lateral velocity was too small to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives the real time estimation requires rather large fluctuation for both of input and output signals this concludes that the zig zag manoeuvre is not sufficient for precise identification of hydrodynamic derivatives concerning the ship lateral velocity because the lateral velocity appears in the carx model as a double integrated valuable v 2 t and the small fluctuations of v t becomes inconspicuous fig 6 shows the transition of identified hydrodynamic derivatives y r and n r looking at the figure the identified n r is stable and agree well with the reference value the reason of the agreement can be considered that the measured yaw rate time integrated signal of ship course in the carx model was rather large during the zig zag manoeuvres on the other hand the identified y r seems to be unstable and does not agree with the reference value it can be considered that the centrifugal force acting on the ship s hull was removed successfully in the identification process 3 2 manoeuvrable range in wind fig 7 shows contour lines of the estimated manoeuvrable range under the current wind condition the graph is almost the same as the radar chart excepting the centre point that is indicating zero ship speed the numbers arranged in the circumferential direction denote the absolute azimuth of the bow direction of the ship the own ship is indicated by the black circle in the 270deg direction on the second grey circle from the centre instead the grey coloured concentric circles denote the non dimensional ship speed u u 0 the second grey circle is u u 0 1 and the outermost grey circle is u u 0 2 the colours of contour lines correspond to the specified rudder angle δ s in equation 30 that were discretized from 1deg blue outermost to 35deg red innermost at 1 intervals therefore the region inside the red coloured line denotes the region in which the ship course cannot be maintained even with maximum rudder angle the mariner can easily understand the manoeuvrable range of the own ship by looking at the indicated chart however the reliability of the chart should be examined carefully because the identified hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v appeared in equation 30 and the identified values don t show good agreement with reference value 4 conclusions in this paper a real time identification procedure was applied to the estimation of hydrodynamic derivatives of ship manoeuvring equations the results are summarized below identified hydrodynamic derivatives m y and n r were stable and showed good agreement with the reference value provided by the shipbuilding company identified hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v were stable but some discrepancies could be observed the fact that the lateral velocity is very small and its fluctuation becomes inconspicuous by iir filters can be considered as the cause identification of hydrodynamic derivatives y r and j zz were unstable the cause should be investigated in detail the possibility of the simple navigation support system in winds has been shown but it is considered that the reliability of the identification procedure should be examined in this report the wind force and moment were treated as the measured signals through the formulae and the rudder force and the moment were included in the carx model as the unknown variables another modelling should be examined for more accurate identification furthermore the proposed real time identification method requires conspicuous output signals responding to fluctuating input signals therefore proper real time manoeuvres should be investigated for the estimation of each hydrodynamic derivative acknowledgements this work is partly supported by jsps kakenhi grant

22439,the fatigue mechanics of steel catenary risers is significantly influenced by the cyclic riser soil coupling dynamic interaction in the touchdown zone in this study the penetration resistance and its corresponding soil deformation of a shallowly embedded riser which withstands a long term cyclic loading are simulated using a finite element method during the numerical analysis in this paper a dynamic boundary surface model of saturated soil is used instead of the empirical strength degradation curve method and a riser soil contact model is considered instead of no slip tie assumption a sufficiently large number of riser motion of vertical displacement is simulated using the soil dynamic constitutive model and the riser soil contact model proposed in this paper on the basis of the numerical results an empirical degradation coefficient for the riser penetration resistance is proposed in this paper which can well evaluate the effect of cyclic number on the resistance along the axis direction of the riser in the touchdown zone an intensive study about the deformation law and failure mode of the seabed soil is analyzed by comparing the equivalent plastic strain at different sections finally some parameters which may affect the riser penetration resistance and soil deformation law of the seabed are discussed in detail it can be found that varing with the loading cyclic number the riser penetration resistance is reduced gradually and the soil deformation surrounding the riser in the touchdown zone presents obvious three dimensional characteristics too keywords touch down zone steel catenary riser cyclic loading soil dynamic constitutive model 1 introduction steel catenary riser is widely used in deepwater to transport hydorcarbons from seabed well systems to surface vessels or floating platform it is a longer flexible pipe with typically 150 600 m m diameter marine environmental loading usually causes a cyclic vertical motion of the rises which makes the riser separate from the seabed near the touchdown point t d p when it is lifted upward during vertical motion and penetrate into the seabed when it occurs downward motion a typical riser schematic diagram in two dimensional plane is shown in fig 1 one of the key concerns in the design is the dynamic fatigue response of riser within the scope of touchdown zone the fatigue response of elastic riser is significantly influenced by riser seabed pore pressure interaction in the touchdown zone this zone exists long term cyclic riser soil interaction where the vertical motion is particularly significant in the current industry practice the mechanical properties between the elastic riser and the elastic plastic seabed near the touchdown zone are mainly evaluated modelling the seabed soil as a set of linear or nonlinear springs or ideal rigid surface zhou and randolph 2009 wang et al 2010 chatterjee et al 2012 martin and white 2012 dutta et al 2014 where the mechanical properties of seabed soil under risers are usually shown as fig 2 including initial backbone curve unloading curve and reloading curve the loading displacement curve shown in fig 2 can not be used to evaluate the soil plastic accumulated deformation the development rule of excess pore pressure and the soil stiffness softening the shear strength degradation curve which represents the soil cyclic mechanical properties are used to analyze the riser resistance einva and randolph 2005 sujan dutta et al 2018 a number of investigations using model test and numerical analysis have been conducted to study the response of risers under environmental cyclic loading some large scaled field and small scaled laboratory tests were conducted to study the response of riser due to cyclic loading e g bridge et al 2003 aubeny et al 2008 hodder and byrne 2010 wang et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 because of the complex behaviour of riser soil interaction the soil stress strain constitutive relationship and the dynamic mechanical properties of soil with scope in the touchdown zone still have not been well understood numerical modelling can provide further insights into the mechanisms and explain some observations using finite element methods to simulate the cyclic penetration and extraction processes in a fully embedded condition and a shallowly embedded condition has been presented by a number of researchers zhou and randolph 2009 wang et al 2010 chatterjee et al 2012 dutta et al 2014 which assumes that the seabed soil is elastic properties but ignors the soil dynamic cycling characteristics in most cases when soil is withstood cyclic loading the mechanical characteristics of cumulative plastic deformation stiffness weakening and strength reduction usually occur and which can affect the fatigue response of risers in the touchdown zone some researchers employed a mathematical models in form of a p y curve or modified p y curve to investigate the complex nature of riser soil interaction where p is the cyclic vertical resistance per unit length of the riser and y is the corresponding vertical motion e g bridge et al 2004 aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 hodder et al 2013 sahdi et al 2017 in order to consider the cyclic weakening of soil shear strength and its corresponding accumulated plastic shear strain einva and randolph 2005 proposed a shear strength degradation curve and an empirical equation aubeny et al 2015 suggested a set of empirical equations to reflect the influence of loading amplitude and numbers of loading cycles actually the three dimensional soil deformation law and the failure mode around the riser in the touchdown zone have obvious influence on the fatigue characteristics of risers moreover under the cyclic loading the seabed soil tends to exhibit some characteristics of stiffness softening and strength weakness which also affects the interaction between riser and soil during the riser and seabed interaction process the invert of a three dimensional riser with diameter d is first penetrated into the seabed to an assumed depth w p and then cyclic vertical displacements of amplitude a or vertical loading q are applied the embedded depth w represents the vertical distance between the invert of riser and the mudline a typical cross sectional diagram in x o z plane is shown in fig 3 in summary when subjected to cyclic vertical loading the three dimensional response of riser soil interaction is different from one of two dimensional plane based on the assumption that the seabed soil presents elastic plastic deformation under dynamic cyclic loading a dynamic constitutive model of the seabed soil is deduced by using the boundary surface theory moreover an interface contact algorithms is proposed by assuming that there are both tangential and normal constraints on the interface between riser and soil in this paper then the three dimensional riser penetration resistance due to long term cyclic vertical loading is analysised and a resistance degradation equation is put forward 2 soil dynamic constitutive model in order to analyze the soil cyclic deformation law and corresponding shear strength weakening which is near the touchdown point of a three dimensional elastic riser a dynamic elastic plastic memorial nested yield surface model of soil is introduced in this model the inverted loading surface f r the damaged surface f and the initial loading surface f which is tangent with the inside of inverted loading surface are memorized at the end of any incremental time in the process of numerical calculation and the shape of yield surface is supposed to be similar with the damage surface the above mentioned memorial surfaces are shown in fig 4 when the yield curve in meridian plane is supposed to be a straight line the generic yield function of soil can be expressed as 1 f α θ g θ σ p 1 2 s i j α i j s i j α i j k g θ σ 0 where s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor α i j is the deviatoric part of the back stress tensor k and g θ σ are model parameters and when the soil is in plastic state the radius r of yield surface in deviatoric stress plane can be written as follows 2 r 2 g θ σ k α θ p the arithmetic product of the deviatoric stress increment versus exterior normal vector of the current yield surface can be used to judge the soil stress reversal the yield surfaces change from the initial loading point to the current one according to the theory of isotropic hardening at the stage of initial loadings the elements of the tensor α i j are zero at the stage of initial loadings and when the loading reverses the yield surface at this time is memorized as the reversal yield surface as fig 4 a the hardening yield surfaces are tangental with the inside of the reversal yield surface if the current yield surface exceeds the outside of the reversal yield surface the yield surface of initial loading which tangents with the inside of the reversal yield surface is memorized as the initial reversal yield surface when current yield surface exceeds outside of the initial reversal yield surface the subsequent yield surfaces change between the initial reversal yield surface and the damage surface according to the theory of isotropic hardening according to the correlation flow rule in the plastic mechanics the elastic plastic stress strain relationship of soils can be obtained as follows 3 1 d σ i j s i j α i j 2 s i j α i j s i j α i j d ε k k δ i j 2 g d e i j g g max 1 r r max 2 s i j α i j k g θ σ α θ p 2 s k l α k l d ε k l where g max is the maximum shear modulus of soil and g e 2 1 μ is shear modulus which can be calculated by elastic modulus e and possion ratio μ the parameter p is written as p k g θ σ α θ the excess pore pressure p e x c e s s in saturated soils which is additional pore pressure caused by the external cyclic loading can be expressed by the following formula 3 2 p e x c e s s k w n ε x x ε y y ε z z in which the parameters k w and n are water volumetric compressive modulus and soil skeleton porosity respectively 3 boundary value problem 3 1 governing equations in order to investigate the riser soil interaction and the soil deformation law in the touchdown zone due to long term cyclic loading this paper considers a steel catenary riser with a radious r shallowly embedded in an elastic plastic seabed with depth h width d and length l as shown in fig 5 in this study the consolidation equations which have been commonly used as the governing equations for water flow of a noncompressible medium biot 1941 are adopted to analyze the variation of pore pressure around the riser and the soil dynamic strength weakening is simulated by usage of the boundary surface model described above as formula 3 1 4 t k w p p o r γ w n β p p o r t γ w u t where u u s v s w s is the vector of soil displacements k w is the permeability matrix of the seabed soil γ w is the unit weight of pore water n is soil porosity p p o r is pore pressure in soil skeleton t is consolidation time by usaged of an elastic theory the governing equation for shallowly buried riser is given by 5 g r 2 u r g r 1 2 μ r u r ρ r b r ρ r u r where u r u r v r w r is the vector of displacement of the elastic riser ρ r b r is the body force of the riser ρ r is the density of the elastic riser g r is the shear modulus of the riser and μ r is poisson s ratio of the steel catenary riser u r is the vector of acceleration of the riser 3 2 boundary conditions for a set of nonlinear coupling system with riser soil as shown in fig 5 the evaluation of the touchdown zone requires a simultaneous solution of equations 3 5 together with some appropriate boundary conditions firstly there is no vertical flow at the impermeable horizontal bottom boundary and the outside of riser is also impermeable the corresponding boundary conditions are written as 6 1 p p o r z 0 a t z 0 6 2 p p o r n 0 a t r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 r where x 0 and y 0 denote the coordinates of the centre of the riser and n is the normal direction to the surface of the riser secondly let the effective normal stress σ s at the mudline is equal to the hydrostatic pressure which ignores the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface and to assume that the horizontal tangential stress τ s is small and negligible 7 τ s 0 σ s ρ w g h where h is the static water level above the mudline thirdly we assumed that the lateral fluid boundary is impermeable and the soil boundary is fixed the boundary conditions are described below 8 u s v s 0 p p o r x p p o r y 0 3 3 riser soil contact properties in the analysis of riser soil interaction there exists complex separation penetration and shear sliding at the interface between seabed soil and riser due to long term cyclic vertical loading which causes the touchdown points in contact or separation to simulate the contact effects along riser soil interface a contact element which the effects in normal and tangential directions are considered simultaneously can be established to link two materials during this numerical analysis in the tangential direction the contact effects include the relative sliding displacement and frictional shear stress and in the normal direction the contact effect is normal hard contact allowing separation so to simulate the effects of interaction at the interface we need to select the contactor surfaces and target surfaces an important distinction between a contactor surface and a target surface is that in the converged solution the material overlap at the contactor nodes is zero the target nodes can overlap the contactor body in general the contactor surface should select the surface of fine mesh thus herein the outer surface of the riser is the contactor surface and the seabed soil surrounding the riser is considered as target surface according to the coulomb friction theory the friction shear stress τ s at the interface between riser and seabed can be expressed in terms of frictional coefficient μ f and contact pressure p c at two contact surfaces i e τ s μ f p c the shear sliding only occurs when surface drag force is greater than frictional shear stress fig 6 shows how node k has come into contact with the target segment j formed by nodes a and b as shown the x t δ t k i 1 x t δ t a i 1 and x t δ t b i 1 are current global coordinates of nodes k a and b respectively then after iteration i 1 for the equilibrium configuration corresponding to time t δ t the x t δ t c i 1 is current global coordinates of the assumed physical point of contact of node k and d j i 1 is the length of segment j 4 finite element formulation 4 1 finite element formulations for seabed soil by usage of the galerkin numerical method to the

in this study the behaviour of seabed soil is analyzed using a coupled stress pore pressure formulation based on biot s dynamic consoildation equations in the u p formulation where u is the soil skeleton displacement which is a boundary surface model proposed in this paper and p is the pore pressure in soil skeleton 4 4 finite element mesh as shown in fig 7 the finite element mesh is used in the present study an elastic riser section with a diameter of d 350 m m thickness of t 10 m m and length of l 1800 m m is buried in saturated seabed with initial embedment depth of w beneath the mudline it is recommended that the element lengths of segments on the contactor elastic riser and the target surfaces elastic plastic seabed be approximately equal considering the coordination and consistency of mesh contact elements between the riser and soil and the numerical calculation accuracy finite element mesh is generated along the circumferential and radial directions of riser which is suggested that the element numbers in the circumferential and radial direction are n θ n r 64 4 shown as fig 7 a all the boundaries of seabed are placed at a sufficiently large distance from the riser in order to avoid boundary effects where the depth h and the width w are h 20 d and w 18 d respectively the bottom and all the four vertical boundaries are defined as impermeable surface and a no slip boundary condition is applied to the bottom which represents zero displacement previous fe analyses and model tests for shallowly embedded conditions show that the soil elements more than 1 5 d from the riser outside surface do not experience significant deformation during vertical displacement dutta et al 2014 considering the dynamic cyclic softening properties of the seabed soil and its resulting large plastic deformation a subdomain of 3 5 d thickness around riser is created where the mesh is refined the soil dynamic boundary surface model derived in this paper is applied to simulate the cyclic mechanical properties of seabed soil 5 results and analysis 5 1 loading modes in order to simulate the cyclic mechanical properties of elastic riser and elastic plastic seabed in detail two sets of loading modes are adopted shown as fig 8 namely cyclic loading and cyclic displacement are applied on the riser respectively on the one hand the normal pressure and tangential friction on the riser surface which is described as fig 6 are analyzed by applying cyclic loading mode and the soil elastic plastic deformation law the excess pore pressure and seabed instability modes surrounding the riser are also studied where the vertical load q is applied on the riser on the other hand the soil shear strength weakening and its stiffness soften are analyzed by controlling the cyclic displacement amplitude u r which is applied on the riser 5 2 penetration resistance of riser the geometry and mechanical parameters of elastic riser used in the penetration analysis are shown in table 1 and seabed soil parameters are listed in table 2 the seabed soil is modelled as homogeneous material the maximum shear modulus of soil g max can be obtained by shear wave velocity v s and soil density ρ s which is discribed as following 13 g max ρ s v s 2 the riser motion boundary parameters and its initial geometric boundary conditions used in the base case analysis are shown in table 3 to let the vertical cyclic period be 5 s applicating a vertical loading amplitude with 2 π s u d e we can obtain a set of dynamic cyclic curves as fig 9 the dynamic cyclic curve shows that the riser penetration displacement gradually increases with the cyclic number n and the secant deformation modulus of soil e i enlarges gradually with cyclic number n under the vertical cyclic loading q the soil elastic deformation decreases gradually and the soil plastic deformation accumulates gradually with cyclic number n on the other hand in order to analyze the change rule between the riser penetration depth and the cyclic number n a cyclic displacement amplitude u r is applied to the reference point of the riser the numerical results are shown in fig 10 which shows that the riser resistance decreases gradually with the cyclic number n and the degradation curve of resistance varying with the cyclic number is shown in fig 11 where we can find that the resistance decreases rapidly within the first 20 cycles then the resistance is relatively stable and finally reachs the residual resistance based on the above curves shown as fig 11 the degradation relation of resistance under cyclic loading is proposed as following 14 r n n 0 25 1 25 1 e n π 2 π 5 3 soil deformation law in this paper multiple sections along the axis of riser which are shown in fig 8 are used to discuss the soil elastic plastic deformation law the penetration depth into the seabed of riser directly affects the soil deformation law and failure mechanism the soil deformation law under different sections is shown as fig 12 a f fig 12 a shows the soil deformation law at the maximum penetration depth section 0 0 and fig 12 f shows the soil deformation law at the minimum penetration depth section 5 5 fig 12 a shows that the soil deformation in section 0 0 includs three parts which is consistent with terzaghi failure modes such as active failure zone 10 1 passive failure zone 123 and constrained deformation zone 102 as the riser penetration depth decreases the passive failure zone 123 gradually disappears and the soil failure mode at the bottom of riser develops from general shear deformation to punch shear deformation shown as fig 12 d 5 4 excess pore pressure distribution the saturated seabed where the mudline surface is taken as permeable boundary is modelled as homogeneous soil layer some excess pore pressure with different depths under the riser are discussed shown in fig 13 as points a b c and d taking homogeneous seabed foundation as an example this paper studies the variation of excess pore water pressure at different depths of seabed some results are shown in fig 14 where gives the time history of excess pore pressure response fig 14 a shows the variation curve of excess pore pressure with loading cyclic number n at different depths in homogeneous seabed it can be found that the excess pore pressure p e x c e s s at point a and d increases rapidly in the first 20 cycles and the slope of the growth curve is the largest in the initial stage while the excess pore pressure tends to be stable after 40 cycles and the pore pressure at point b and c continues to grow in the first 60 cycles the development tendency of excess pore pressure at a b c and d is similar which grows rapidly in the initial stage and then presents stability the specific growth patterns at different sections are inconsistent from section 0 0 to 3 3 the main reasons are due to the penetration depth of riser and the dissipation process of excess pore pressure the excess pore pressure curves further shows that point a which is without overlying soil is very easy to occur soil liquefaction under relatively high pore pressure and the maximum excess pore pressure of point d is lower than that of point a which is located at deeper layer and under great overlying soil gravity the excess pore pressure can reduce the soil effective stress and cause the riser resistance to reduce the excess pore pressure tendency of point b and c is relatively complicated they are related to the effective stress in soil skeleton and the soil permeability 6 parametric study a parametric study is performed for the soil penetration resistance surrounding the riser under the cyclic touchdown by varying only one soil parameter while the others are constant 6 1 effect of initial embedment in order to study the effect of riser initial burial depth on the resistance some numerical calculations are carried out which includes three different burial depth such as w 0 0 d 1 3 d and 2 3 d the analysis results is shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows that there is obvious difference between resistance degradation coefficient r n and loading cyclic number n in the first 40 cycles however with the further increase of cyclic number n the resistance degradation coefficient r n tends to be stable where the degradation coefficient is approximately equal to r n 0 24 6 2 effect of friction coefficient f r by varying only the riser soil friction coefficient f r while the other parameters are the same as in table 3 the value of f r varies from 0 3 to 0 7 fig 15 shows a very small difference between riser resistance coefficient r n and loading cyclic number n and the small difference mainly occurs in the first 20 cycles which can be negligible 6 3 effect of stiffness ratio e r e s let the riser soil stiffness ratio e r e s vary between 500 and 1500 while the other parameters are the same as in table 3 the relationship curve between riser resistance coefficient and cyclic number r n n is shown in fig 16 note that the stiffness ratio e r e s has a significant effect on the resistance degradation coefficient r n with an increase in stiffness ratio the degradation coefficient r n decrease quickly which means that the stiffness ratio has a significant effect on the riser resistance within the scope of the touchdown zone 6 4 effect of cyclic amplitude a let the loading cyclic amplitude a vary between 0 05 m and 0 175 m while the other parameters are the same as in table 3 the degradation curve of riser resistance is shown in fig 17 with the increase of cyclic amplitude a the riser resistance coefficient r n decreases gradually when the cyclic amplitude a is equal to 0 05 m the rate of riser resistance degradation is faster in the first 20 cycles then the degradation rate tends to be stable after 40 cycles when the cyclic amplitude a is larger and equal to 0 175 m the degradation coefficient r n of riser resistance reduces rapidly in fist 40 cycles it can be found that the critical cyclic number n c r when the riser resistance degardation coefficient r n reaches stability varies with the loading cyclic amplitude a 7 conclusions a numerical modelling of three dimensional riser penetration behaviour subjected to cyclic loading is presented in this paper in order to simulate the resistance of the seabed soil on the riser a dynamic boundary surface model of saturated soil is used instead of the empirical strength degradation curve method the riser resistance degradation curves and the soil deformation law are studied in detail in addition to the initial buried depth the stiffness ratio of elastic riser to the seabed soil the loading amplitude and the friction coefficient are analyzed on the riser resistance degradation the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the degradation of three dimensional riser vertical resistance primarily occurs during 1 20 cycles then the riser resistance coefficient r n tends to be stable and the riser degradation coefficient can be estimated by formula 14 presented in this paper 2 the three dimensional soil deformation law where in the touchdown zone are discussed by usage of multiple sections in two dimensional plane by analyzing the equivalent plastic strain of seabed soil it can be considered that the soil deformation law is consistent with classical terzaghi failure mode and with the reduction of the riser penetration depth the soil failure patterns have changed from general shear failure to local punch failure which is shown in fig 12 3 the stiffness ratio of riser to seabed determines the size of the touchdown zone and greatly affects the riser resistance degradation coefficient r n moreover the initial burial depth the friction coefficient and the cyclic loading amplitude can affect the riser resistance degradation coefficient 4 the development law of the excess pore pressure which is surrounding the riser within scope of the touchdown zone can lead to soil liquefaction or reduce the soil effective stress which reduces the riser resistance and increases the geometric range of the touchdown zone 5 based on the numerical results presented in this paer which considers the normal pressure and tangential friction between riser and seabed we can find that the effect of tangential friction on the riser resistance degradation is weak finally although the three dimensional riser resistance degradation and its corresponding soil deformation law are discussed by introducing a dynamic constitutive model which can analyze the accumulated plastic deformation of soil and simulate the soil stiffness softening under cyclic loading but in consideration of the complex process of excess pore pressure in soil skeleton and its effects on the soil effective stress the three dimensional riser resistance needs to be studied further acknowledgments this paper are supported by the project of the national natural science

22439,the fatigue mechanics of steel catenary risers is significantly influenced by the cyclic riser soil coupling dynamic interaction in the touchdown zone in this study the penetration resistance and its corresponding soil deformation of a shallowly embedded riser which withstands a long term cyclic loading are simulated using a finite element method during the numerical analysis in this paper a dynamic boundary surface model of saturated soil is used instead of the empirical strength degradation curve method and a riser soil contact model is considered instead of no slip tie assumption a sufficiently large number of riser motion of vertical displacement is simulated using the soil dynamic constitutive model and the riser soil contact model proposed in this paper on the basis of the numerical results an empirical degradation coefficient for the riser penetration resistance is proposed in this paper which can well evaluate the effect of cyclic number on the resistance along the axis direction of the riser in the touchdown zone an intensive study about the deformation law and failure mode of the seabed soil is analyzed by comparing the equivalent plastic strain at different sections finally some parameters which may affect the riser penetration resistance and soil deformation law of the seabed are discussed in detail it can be found that varing with the loading cyclic number the riser penetration resistance is reduced gradually and the soil deformation surrounding the riser in the touchdown zone presents obvious three dimensional characteristics too keywords touch down zone steel catenary riser cyclic loading soil dynamic constitutive model 1 introduction steel catenary riser is widely used in deepwater to transport hydorcarbons from seabed well systems to surface vessels or floating platform it is a longer flexible pipe with typically 150 600 m m diameter marine environmental loading usually causes a cyclic vertical motion of the rises which makes the riser separate from the seabed near the touchdown point t d p when it is lifted upward during vertical motion and penetrate into the seabed when it occurs downward motion a typical riser schematic diagram in two dimensional plane is shown in fig 1 one of the key concerns in the design is the dynamic fatigue response of riser within the scope of touchdown zone the fatigue response of elastic riser is significantly influenced by riser seabed pore pressure interaction in the touchdown zone this zone exists long term cyclic riser soil interaction where the vertical motion is particularly significant in the current industry practice the mechanical properties between the elastic riser and the elastic plastic seabed near the touchdown zone are mainly evaluated modelling the seabed soil as a set of linear or nonlinear springs or ideal rigid surface zhou and randolph 2009 wang et al 2010 chatterjee et al 2012 martin and white 2012 dutta et al 2014 where the mechanical properties of seabed soil under risers are usually shown as fig 2 including initial backbone curve unloading curve and reloading curve the loading displacement curve shown in fig 2 can not be used to evaluate the soil plastic accumulated deformation the development rule of excess pore pressure and the soil stiffness softening the shear strength degradation curve which represents the soil cyclic mechanical properties are used to analyze the riser resistance einva and randolph 2005 sujan dutta et al 2018 a number of investigations using model test and numerical analysis have been conducted to study the response of risers under environmental cyclic loading some large scaled field and small scaled laboratory tests were conducted to study the response of riser due to cyclic loading e g bridge et al 2003 aubeny et al 2008 hodder and byrne 2010 wang et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 because of the complex behaviour of riser soil interaction the soil stress strain constitutive relationship and the dynamic mechanical properties of soil with scope in the touchdown zone still have not been well understood numerical modelling can provide further insights into the mechanisms and explain some observations using finite element methods to simulate the cyclic penetration and extraction processes in a fully embedded condition and a shallowly embedded condition has been presented by a number of researchers zhou and randolph 2009 wang et al 2010 chatterjee et al 2012 dutta et al 2014 which assumes that the seabed soil is elastic properties but ignors the soil dynamic cycling characteristics in most cases when soil is withstood cyclic loading the mechanical characteristics of cumulative plastic deformation stiffness weakening and strength reduction usually occur and which can affect the fatigue response of risers in the touchdown zone some researchers employed a mathematical models in form of a p y curve or modified p y curve to investigate the complex nature of riser soil interaction where p is the cyclic vertical resistance per unit length of the riser and y is the corresponding vertical motion e g bridge et al 2004 aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 hodder et al 2013 sahdi et al 2017 in order to consider the cyclic weakening of soil shear strength and its corresponding accumulated plastic shear strain einva and randolph 2005 proposed a shear strength degradation curve and an empirical equation aubeny et al 2015 suggested a set of empirical equations to reflect the influence of loading amplitude and numbers of loading cycles actually the three dimensional soil deformation law and the failure mode around the riser in the touchdown zone have obvious influence on the fatigue characteristics of risers moreover under the cyclic loading the seabed soil tends to exhibit some characteristics of stiffness softening and strength weakness which also affects the interaction between riser and soil during the riser and seabed interaction process the invert of a three dimensional riser with diameter d is first penetrated into the seabed to an assumed depth w p and then cyclic vertical displacements of amplitude a or vertical loading q are applied the embedded depth w represents the vertical distance between the invert of riser and the mudline a typical cross sectional diagram in x o z plane is shown in fig 3 in summary when subjected to cyclic vertical loading the three dimensional response of riser soil interaction is different from one of two dimensional plane based on the assumption that the seabed soil presents elastic plastic deformation under dynamic cyclic loading a dynamic constitutive model of the seabed soil is deduced by using the boundary surface theory moreover an interface contact algorithms is proposed by assuming that there are both tangential and normal constraints on the interface between riser and soil in this paper then the three dimensional riser penetration resistance due to long term cyclic vertical loading is analysised and a resistance degradation equation is put forward 2 soil dynamic constitutive model in order to analyze the soil cyclic deformation law and corresponding shear strength weakening which is near the touchdown point of a three dimensional elastic riser a dynamic elastic plastic memorial nested yield surface model of soil is introduced in this model the inverted loading surface f r the damaged surface f and the initial loading surface f which is tangent with the inside of inverted loading surface are memorized at the end of any incremental time in the process of numerical calculation and the shape of yield surface is supposed to be similar with the damage surface the above mentioned memorial surfaces are shown in fig 4 when the yield curve in meridian plane is supposed to be a straight line the generic yield function of soil can be expressed as 1 f α θ g θ σ p 1 2 s i j α i j s i j α i j k g θ σ 0 where s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor α i j is the deviatoric part of the back stress tensor k and g θ σ are model parameters and when the soil is in plastic state the radius r of yield surface in deviatoric stress plane can be written as follows 2 r 2 g θ σ k α θ p the arithmetic product of the deviatoric stress increment versus exterior normal vector of the current yield surface can be used to judge the soil stress reversal the yield surfaces change from the initial loading point to the current one according to the theory of isotropic hardening at the stage of initial loadings the elements of the tensor α i j are zero at the stage of initial loadings and when the loading reverses the yield surface at this time is memorized as the reversal yield surface as fig 4 a the hardening yield surfaces are tangental with the inside of the reversal yield surface if the current yield surface exceeds the outside of the reversal yield surface the yield surface of initial loading which tangents with the inside of the reversal yield surface is memorized as the initial reversal yield surface when current yield surface exceeds outside of the initial reversal yield surface the subsequent yield surfaces change between the initial reversal yield surface and the damage surface according to the theory of isotropic hardening according to the correlation flow rule in the plastic mechanics the elastic plastic stress strain relationship of soils can be obtained as follows 3 1 d σ i j s i j α i j 2 s i j α i j s i j α i j d ε k k δ i j 2 g d e i j g g max 1 r r max 2 s i j α i j k g θ σ α θ p 2 s k l α k l d ε k l where g max is the maximum shear modulus of soil and g e 2 1 μ is shear modulus which can be calculated by elastic modulus e and possion ratio μ the parameter p is written as p k g θ σ α θ the excess pore pressure p e x c e s s in saturated soils which is additional pore pressure caused by the external cyclic loading can be expressed by the following formula 3 2 p e x c e s s k w n ε x x ε y y ε z z in which the parameters k w and n are water volumetric compressive modulus and soil skeleton porosity respectively 3 boundary value problem 3 1 governing equations in order to investigate the riser soil interaction and the soil deformation law in the touchdown zone due to long term cyclic loading this paper considers a steel catenary riser with a radious r shallowly embedded in an elastic plastic seabed with depth h width d and length l as shown in fig 5 in this study the consolidation equations which have been commonly used as the governing equations for water flow of a noncompressible medium biot 1941 are adopted to analyze the variation of pore pressure around the riser and the soil dynamic strength weakening is simulated by usage of the boundary surface model described above as formula 3 1 4 t k w p p o r γ w n β p p o r t γ w u t where u u s v s w s is the vector of soil displacements k w is the permeability matrix of the seabed soil γ w is the unit weight of pore water n is soil porosity p p o r is pore pressure in soil skeleton t is consolidation time by usaged of an elastic theory the governing equation for shallowly buried riser is given by 5 g r 2 u r g r 1 2 μ r u r ρ r b r ρ r u r where u r u r v r w r is the vector of displacement of the elastic riser ρ r b r is the body force of the riser ρ r is the density of the elastic riser g r is the shear modulus of the riser and μ r is poisson s ratio of the steel catenary riser u r is the vector of acceleration of the riser 3 2 boundary conditions for a set of nonlinear coupling system with riser soil as shown in fig 5 the evaluation of the touchdown zone requires a simultaneous solution of equations 3 5 together with some appropriate boundary conditions firstly there is no vertical flow at the impermeable horizontal bottom boundary and the outside of riser is also impermeable the corresponding boundary conditions are written as 6 1 p p o r z 0 a t z 0 6 2 p p o r n 0 a t r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 r where x 0 and y 0 denote the coordinates of the centre of the riser and n is the normal direction to the surface of the riser secondly let the effective normal stress σ s at the mudline is equal to the hydrostatic pressure which ignores the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface and to assume that the horizontal tangential stress τ s is small and negligible 7 τ s 0 σ s ρ w g h where h is the static water level above the mudline thirdly we assumed that the lateral fluid boundary is impermeable and the soil boundary is fixed the boundary conditions are described below 8 u s v s 0 p p o r x p p o r y 0 3 3 riser soil contact properties in the analysis of riser soil interaction there exists complex separation penetration and shear sliding at the interface between seabed soil and riser due to long term cyclic vertical loading which causes the touchdown points in contact or separation to simulate the contact effects along riser soil interface a contact element which the effects in normal and tangential directions are considered simultaneously can be established to link two materials during this numerical analysis in the tangential direction the contact effects include the relative sliding displacement and frictional shear stress and in the normal direction the contact effect is normal hard contact allowing separation so to simulate the effects of interaction at the interface we need to select the contactor surfaces and target surfaces an important distinction between a contactor surface and a target surface is that in the converged solution the material overlap at the contactor nodes is zero the target nodes can overlap the contactor body in general the contactor surface should select the surface of fine mesh thus herein the outer surface of the riser is the contactor surface and the seabed soil surrounding the riser is considered as target surface according to the coulomb friction theory the friction shear stress τ s at the interface between riser and seabed can be expressed in terms of frictional coefficient μ f and contact pressure p c at two contact surfaces i e τ s μ f p c the shear sliding only occurs when surface drag force is greater than frictional shear stress fig 6 shows how node k has come into contact with the target segment j formed by nodes a and b as shown the x t δ t k i 1 x t δ t a i 1 and x t δ t b i 1 are current global coordinates of nodes k a and b respectively then after iteration i 1 for the equilibrium configuration corresponding to time t δ t the x t δ t c i 1 is current global coordinates of the assumed physical point of contact of node k and d j i 1 is the length of segment j 4 finite element formulation 4 1 finite element formulations for seabed soil by usage of the galerkin numerical method to the

in this study the behaviour of seabed soil is analyzed using a coupled stress pore pressure formulation based on biot s dynamic consoildation equations in the u p formulation where u is the soil skeleton displacement which is a boundary surface model proposed in this paper and p is the pore pressure in soil skeleton 4 4 finite element mesh as shown in fig 7 the finite element mesh is used in the present study an elastic riser section with a diameter of d 350 m m thickness of t 10 m m and length of l 1800 m m is buried in saturated seabed with initial embedment depth of w beneath the mudline it is recommended that the element lengths of segments on the contactor elastic riser and the target surfaces elastic plastic seabed be approximately equal considering the coordination and consistency of mesh contact elements between the riser and soil and the numerical calculation accuracy finite element mesh is generated along the circumferential and radial directions of riser which is suggested that the element numbers in the circumferential and radial direction are n θ n r 64 4 shown as fig 7 a all the boundaries of seabed are placed at a sufficiently large distance from the riser in order to avoid boundary effects where the depth h and the width w are h 20 d and w 18 d respectively the bottom and all the four vertical boundaries are defined as impermeable surface and a no slip boundary condition is applied to the bottom which represents zero displacement previous fe analyses and model tests for shallowly embedded conditions show that the soil elements more than 1 5 d from the riser outside surface do not experience significant deformation during vertical displacement dutta et al 2014 considering the dynamic cyclic softening properties of the seabed soil and its resulting large plastic deformation a subdomain of 3 5 d thickness around riser is created where the mesh is refined the soil dynamic boundary surface model derived in this paper is applied to simulate the cyclic mechanical properties of seabed soil 5 results and analysis 5 1 loading modes in order to simulate the cyclic mechanical properties of elastic riser and elastic plastic seabed in detail two sets of loading modes are adopted shown as fig 8 namely cyclic loading and cyclic displacement are applied on the riser respectively on the one hand the normal pressure and tangential friction on the riser surface which is described as fig 6 are analyzed by applying cyclic loading mode and the soil elastic plastic deformation law the excess pore pressure and seabed instability modes surrounding the riser are also studied where the vertical load q is applied on the riser on the other hand the soil shear strength weakening and its stiffness soften are analyzed by controlling the cyclic displacement amplitude u r which is applied on the riser 5 2 penetration resistance of riser the geometry and mechanical parameters of elastic riser used in the penetration analysis are shown in table 1 and seabed soil parameters are listed in table 2 the seabed soil is modelled as homogeneous material the maximum shear modulus of soil g max can be obtained by shear wave velocity v s and soil density ρ s which is discribed as following 13 g max ρ s v s 2 the riser motion boundary parameters and its initial geometric boundary conditions used in the base case analysis are shown in table 3 to let the vertical cyclic period be 5 s applicating a vertical loading amplitude with 2 π s u d e we can obtain a set of dynamic cyclic curves as fig 9 the dynamic cyclic curve shows that the riser penetration displacement gradually increases with the cyclic number n and the secant deformation modulus of soil e i enlarges gradually with cyclic number n under the vertical cyclic loading q the soil elastic deformation decreases gradually and the soil plastic deformation accumulates gradually with cyclic number n on the other hand in order to analyze the change rule between the riser penetration depth and the cyclic number n a cyclic displacement amplitude u r is applied to the reference point of the riser the numerical results are shown in fig 10 which shows that the riser resistance decreases gradually with the cyclic number n and the degradation curve of resistance varying with the cyclic number is shown in fig 11 where we can find that the resistance decreases rapidly within the first 20 cycles then the resistance is relatively stable and finally reachs the residual resistance based on the above curves shown as fig 11 the degradation relation of resistance under cyclic loading is proposed as following 14 r n n 0 25 1 25 1 e n π 2 π 5 3 soil deformation law in this paper multiple sections along the axis of riser which are shown in fig 8 are used to discuss the soil elastic plastic deformation law the penetration depth into the seabed of riser directly affects the soil deformation law and failure mechanism the soil deformation law under different sections is shown as fig 12 a f fig 12 a shows the soil deformation law at the maximum penetration depth section 0 0 and fig 12 f shows the soil deformation law at the minimum penetration depth section 5 5 fig 12 a shows that the soil deformation in section 0 0 includs three parts which is consistent with terzaghi failure modes such as active failure zone 10 1 passive failure zone 123 and constrained deformation zone 102 as the riser penetration depth decreases the passive failure zone 123 gradually disappears and the soil failure mode at the bottom of riser develops from general shear deformation to punch shear deformation shown as fig 12 d 5 4 excess pore pressure distribution the saturated seabed where the mudline surface is taken as permeable boundary is modelled as homogeneous soil layer some excess pore pressure with different depths under the riser are discussed shown in fig 13 as points a b c and d taking homogeneous seabed foundation as an example this paper studies the variation of excess pore water pressure at different depths of seabed some results are shown in fig 14 where gives the time history of excess pore pressure response fig 14 a shows the variation curve of excess pore pressure with loading cyclic number n at different depths in homogeneous seabed it can be found that the excess pore pressure p e x c e s s at point a and d increases rapidly in the first 20 cycles and the slope of the growth curve is the largest in the initial stage while the excess pore pressure tends to be stable after 40 cycles and the pore pressure at point b and c continues to grow in the first 60 cycles the development tendency of excess pore pressure at a b c and d is similar which grows rapidly in the initial stage and then presents stability the specific growth patterns at different sections are inconsistent from section 0 0 to 3 3 the main reasons are due to the penetration depth of riser and the dissipation process of excess pore pressure the excess pore pressure curves further shows that point a which is without overlying soil is very easy to occur soil liquefaction under relatively high pore pressure and the maximum excess pore pressure of point d is lower than that of point a which is located at deeper layer and under great overlying soil gravity the excess pore pressure can reduce the soil effective stress and cause the riser resistance to reduce the excess pore pressure tendency of point b and c is relatively complicated they are related to the effective stress in soil skeleton and the soil permeability 6 parametric study a parametric study is performed for the soil penetration resistance surrounding the riser under the cyclic touchdown by varying only one soil parameter while the others are constant 6 1 effect of initial embedment in order to study the effect of riser initial burial depth on the resistance some numerical calculations are carried out which includes three different burial depth such as w 0 0 d 1 3 d and 2 3 d the analysis results is shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows that there is obvious difference between resistance degradation coefficient r n and loading cyclic number n in the first 40 cycles however with the further increase of cyclic number n the resistance degradation coefficient r n tends to be stable where the degradation coefficient is approximately equal to r n 0 24 6 2 effect of friction coefficient f r by varying only the riser soil friction coefficient f r while the other parameters are the same as in table 3 the value of f r varies from 0 3 to 0 7 fig 15 shows a very small difference between riser resistance coefficient r n and loading cyclic number n and the small difference mainly occurs in the first 20 cycles which can be negligible 6 3 effect of stiffness ratio e r e s let the riser soil stiffness ratio e r e s vary between 500 and 1500 while the other parameters are the same as in table 3 the relationship curve between riser resistance coefficient and cyclic number r n n is shown in fig 16 note that the stiffness ratio e r e s has a significant effect on the resistance degradation coefficient r n with an increase in stiffness ratio the degradation coefficient r n decrease quickly which means that the stiffness ratio has a significant effect on the riser resistance within the scope of the touchdown zone 6 4 effect of cyclic amplitude a let the loading cyclic amplitude a vary between 0 05 m and 0 175 m while the other parameters are the same as in table 3 the degradation curve of riser resistance is shown in fig 17 with the increase of cyclic amplitude a the riser resistance coefficient r n decreases gradually when the cyclic amplitude a is equal to 0 05 m the rate of riser resistance degradation is faster in the first 20 cycles then the degradation rate tends to be stable after 40 cycles when the cyclic amplitude a is larger and equal to 0 175 m the degradation coefficient r n of riser resistance reduces rapidly in fist 40 cycles it can be found that the critical cyclic number n c r when the riser resistance degardation coefficient r n reaches stability varies with the loading cyclic amplitude a 7 conclusions a numerical modelling of three dimensional riser penetration behaviour subjected to cyclic loading is presented in this paper in order to simulate the resistance of the seabed soil on the riser a dynamic boundary surface model of saturated soil is used instead of the empirical strength degradation curve method the riser resistance degradation curves and the soil deformation law are studied in detail in addition to the initial buried depth the stiffness ratio of elastic riser to the seabed soil the loading amplitude and the friction coefficient are analyzed on the riser resistance degradation the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the degradation of three dimensional riser vertical resistance primarily occurs during 1 20 cycles then the riser resistance coefficient r n tends to be stable and the riser degradation coefficient can be estimated by formula 14 presented in this paper 2 the three dimensional soil deformation law where in the touchdown zone are discussed by usage of multiple sections in two dimensional plane by analyzing the equivalent plastic strain of seabed soil it can be considered that the soil deformation law is consistent with classical terzaghi failure mode and with the reduction of the riser penetration depth the soil failure patterns have changed from general shear failure to local punch failure which is shown in fig 12 3 the stiffness ratio of riser to seabed determines the size of the touchdown zone and greatly affects the riser resistance degradation coefficient r n moreover the initial burial depth the friction coefficient and the cyclic loading amplitude can affect the riser resistance degradation coefficient 4 the development law of the excess pore pressure which is surrounding the riser within scope of the touchdown zone can lead to soil liquefaction or reduce the soil effective stress which reduces the riser resistance and increases the geometric range of the touchdown zone 5 based on the numerical results presented in this paer which considers the normal pressure and tangential friction between riser and seabed we can find that the effect of tangential friction on the riser resistance degradation is weak finally although the three dimensional riser resistance degradation and its corresponding soil deformation law are discussed by introducing a dynamic constitutive model which can analyze the accumulated plastic deformation of soil and simulate the soil stiffness softening under cyclic loading but in consideration of the complex process of excess pore pressure in soil skeleton and its effects on the soil effective stress the three dimensional riser resistance needs to be studied further acknowledgments this paper are supported by the project of the national natural science
