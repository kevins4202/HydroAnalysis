fertilizer or sap was applied ms cf cf cs cf ss and cf ms results of the leaching experiment showed that water and nutrient leaching loss from the saline soil was reduced by 12 6 22 7 and 14 2 65 0 respectively in the treatments with sap application in addition both soil pore number and soil porosity were significantly increased in the 0 10 cm soil layer in the pot experiment maize yield was increased by 25 9 32 1 and fertilizer use efficiency was significantly increased with the application of sap taken together sap application in the saline soil improved soil moisture and nutritional

producing region in china but soil salt accumulation up to 1 99 3 77 g kg 1 soil occurs commonly in the entire basin due to climatic water shortage and capillary action xu et al 2013 pereira et al 2007 ren et al 2019 the concentrations of cations na ca2 mg2 etc in soil solution are usually abnormally high rao et al 2019 on the one hand these cations compete with nh4 and k for crop absorption and immobilize hpo4 2 and h2po4 zorb et al 2019 on the other they cause soil structure degradation barrett lennard 2002 and physiological dehydration growth inhibition and yield reduction of crops saifullah et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to restore the physiological functions of water and soil in the yellow river basin dong et al 2018 soil moisture has a strong effect on nutrient availability mueller et al 2012 water saving and conservation measures have been taken to improve soil water and nutritional conditions in modern agriculture singh et al 2021 jovanovic et al 2020 superabsorbent polymers saps have excellent water absorption and retention capacities zohuriaan mehr and kabiri 2008 and can absorb water 100 1000 times of their own weight guilherme et al 2015 they have been widely used as soil conditioners to improve the water use efficiency wue of crops theoretically soil moisture increase with sap application alleviates the osmotic pressure of soil solution kaya et al 2018 and soil drying wetting cycle promotes the mineralization and release of soil nutrients d cheng et al 2018 y cheng et al 2018 which improve nutrient availability and accessibility promote root growth and improve wue zia et al 2021 in addition sap degradation provides additional exogenous carbon h√ºttermann et al 2009 which has a priming effect on soil carbon and nitrogen n mineralization lu et al 2018 therefore sap application improves soil nutritional conditions and promotes crop growth and yield liao et al 2018 satriani et al 2018 liang et al 2019 the water absorption capacity wac of sap is closely related to the characteristics of its molecular network generally the more hydrophilic groups in a sap and the higher crosslinking degree of its molecule the larger a wac it has guilherme et al 2015 in addition the wac of sap is affected by the ion concentration in absorption medium ma et al 2004 thombare et al 2018 al jabri et al 2015 for example the wac of sap in normal saline is usually approximately one tenth of its wac in deionized water zhao et al 2019 zain et al 2018 high concentrations of ions such as k na ca2 and mg2 in irrigation water or in the pore water of salinized soils would significantly decrease the wac of sap shi et al 2010 ai et al 2021 to improve their salt tolerance saps are commonly grafted with natural macromolecules e g starch cellulose lignin rizwan et al 2021 in previous studies saps were applied in non saline soils their effects in saline soils are not clear guo et al 2016 tubert et al 2018 in this study it was hypothesized that after grafted with biological macromolecules a sap would have a higher wac in salinized soils and promote crop production a soil column leaching experiment and a pot experiment were conducted using a commercial sap and salt tolerant starch grafted saps as soil conditioners the objectives were to 1 investigate the effects of the commercial sap and starch grafted saps on the water and nutritional conditions of a moderately salinized soil from the yellow river basin 2 reveal the underlying mechanisms of the effects of saps on soil properties and 3 find out the effects of saps on the growth and yield of maize the findings of this study are expected to provide support for crop production in the yellow river basin where both water shortage and soil salinization are concerns 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil fertilizers and saps used the soil used in both the column leaching and pot experiments was collected from the 0 20 cm layer of an agricultural field in the bohai

used in the pot experiment had n p2o5 k2o ratios of 42 0 0 17 3 43 8 0 and 0 0 53 respectively the three types of saps used in this study included a commercial sap csap purchased from the schultz company moisture plus watering crystals usa whose wac was 354 8 and 35 4 g g 1 in deionized water and normal saline respectively the other two saps a starch grafted sap sgsp and a modified starch

separate the upper 20 cm of soil from the lower 20 cm the lower 20 cm section was further sawn into four 5 cm sections fig s2 then the soils were taken out from the pipes and air dried after separated manually from the soils the saps were analyzed for total n p and k the soils were passed through a 10 mesh sieve and analyzed for available n p and k 2 4 pot experiment the pot experiment was conducted in a research farm 117 9 48 e 36 9 40 n of shandong agricultural university the site has a temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 c six treatments were set up with four replications in a completely randomized design 1 ck no fertilizer or sap was applied 2 ms no fertilizer but mssp was applied 3 cf no sap but fertilizers were applied 4 cf cs fertilizers and csap were applied 5 cf ss fertilizers and sgsp were applied and 6 cf ms fertilizers and mssp were applied the amounts of fertilizers and saps used in each treatment are listed in table

rhizons 2 5 sampler rhizosphere research products b v netherlands for nutrient concentration analysis in cf and cf ms soil moisture and temperature were monitored with a data logger hobo micro station logger version 5 0 onset usa fig s3 irrigation weeding and pest control were performed according to local practices maize ears were harvested on 29 september 2018 maize ears and above ground parts were oven dried and weights were recorded the experiment was repeated in 2019 using the same pots with seed sowing and grain harvest on the same dates as in 2018 2 5 chemical analyses total n in leachate and soil solution was measured with a nitrogen analyzer vario toc elementer germany total p in leachate and soil solution was determined using the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in leachate and soil solution were measured with a continuous flow autoanalyzer aa 3 bran luebbe germany the concentration of k in leachate and soil solution was determined by flame photometry the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in leachate were measured with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa 7000 shimadzu japan soil no3 n and nh4 n were extracted with 2 mol l 1 kcl solution soil available p and k was extracted with 0 05 mol l 1 nahco3 and 1 mol l 1 ch3coonh4 respectively the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n p and k in extracts were determined as previously described li et al 2021 the sap and plant samples were digested with concentrated h2so4 at 280 c until no visible solids total n was measured using the kjeldahl method total p was determined using the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method and total k was quantified by flame photometry 2 6 calculations and statistical analyses nutrient n p or k leaching loss rate was calculated as lu et al 2019 nutrient leaching loss rate nutrient leaching loss from the fertilization treatment nutrient leaching loss from the nonfertilization treatment nutrient supply by fertilizer 100 where nutrient leaching loss leachate volume leachate nutrient concentration nutrient n p or k accumulation in the above ground parts of maize was calculated as nutrient accumulation nutrient content above ground biomass nutrient n p or k utilization efficiency was calculated as li et al 2021 nutrient utilization efficiency maize nutrient accumulation in the fertilization treatment maize nutrient accumulation in the nonfertilization treatment nutrient supply by fertilizer 100 for wue calculation the following equation was used wang et al 2019 wue maize above ground biomass precipitation irrigation data were processed using microsoft excel 2019 and analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova using sas version 8 2 sas 2010 means were separated using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 figures were generated using sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 ftir spectra of mssp the ftir spectrum of mssp showed two characteristic peaks of starch a strong broad absorption peak at 3300 3500 cm 1 and a weak absorption peak at 1600 1650 cm 1 fig 1 which correspond to oh scissoring vibration zhao et al 2019 in addition there were a peak at 1650 cm 1 attributed to co vibration and a peak at 1400 cm 1 due to the asymmetric vibration of so3h tsai et al 2010 after soaked in the saturated urea solution mssp showed peaks at 4000 3800 cm 1 2850 cm 1 and 2430 cm 1 which were due to oh groups zhao et al 2019 the destruction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds by urea y cheng et al 2018 d cheng et al 2018 and the amide structure of urea narayanan et al 2018 respectively after mssp was soaked in the saturated nh4 2hpo4 solution its peak at 1400 cm 1 redshifted slightly which was because nh4 competed with h for the intramolecular bonding sites and weakened the asymmetric vibration of so3h jin et al 2019 in addition the nh4 2hpo4 soaked mssp displayed a very different spectral pattern in the fingerprint area 800 cm 1 compared with the unsoaked mssp which may be due to the effect of phosphate ions yang et al 2018 the kcl soaked mssp displayed a weaker absorption peak at 2850 cm 1 compared with the unsoaked mssp hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl and sulfonic acid groups are the major binding sites in sap molecules and they uniformly disperse in the 3d network of sap molecule zhao et al 2019 the spectra indicate that no chemical bonds were formed when mssp was soaked in the saturated solutions of urea nh4 2hpo4 and kcl it can be expected that when soil moisture decreases the osmotic pressure change would result in nutrient release from mssp zhao et al 2021 therefore saps are simultaneous a sink and source of water and nutrients depending on soil moisture conditions 3 2 water and nutrient leaching loss application of 6 g csap sgsp or mssp to the soil significantly reduced water leaching loss fig 2a compared with cf water leaching loss from cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly reduced by 12 6 14 3 and 22 7 respectively as cross linked polymers saps contain many highly hydrophilic groups and can absorb a large amount of water saha et al 2020a therefore sap application can reduce water leaching loss water leaching loss from cf ms was 8 9 and 7 3 less than that from cf cs and cf ss respectively in contrast there was no significant difference in water leaching loss between cf cs and cf ss when 30 less mssp was applied i e cf 70 ms vs cf ms water leaching loss increased by 21 1 water leaching loss from cf ss and cf cs was significantly greater by 10 7 and 12 5 respectively than that from ms which indicated that the compound fertilizer applied negatively influenced the water absorption performance of csap and sgsp this is because ions e g nh4 k from fertilizers permeate into the inner space of sap molecules with water which is driven by osmotic pressure de souza et al 2019 and compete with water for the hydrophilic groups on sap molecules lee et al 2018 as a result less water is absorbed by saps zhao et al 2021 liu et al 2007 however the effect of chemical fertilizer on the water absorption performance of mssp was not significant the reason may be that mssp had a higher salt tolerance than csap and sgsp zhao et al 2019 compared with cf the n leaching loss rate of cf ss cf cs and cf ms was significantly reduced by 49 2 50 9 and 65 0 respectively fig 2b demonstrating that sap application can reduce both water and n leaching loss thombare et al 2018 compared with cf cs and cf ss the n leaching loss rate of cf ms was significantly lower by 28 7 and 31 0 respectively demonstrating that saps differ greatly in nutrient retention capacity even 30 less mssp was applied the n leaching loss rate of cf 70 ms was 25 5 and 23 0 lower than that of cf ss and cf cs respectively similarly the no3 n leaching loss from cf ss cf cs and cf ms was reduced by 33 3 14 2 and 33 8 respectively compared with cf fig 2c in addition the no3 n leaching loss from cf ms and cf ss was significantly decreased by 22 8 and 22 2 respectively compared with cf cs and there was no significant difference between cf ms and cf ss the p leaching loss rate of cf cs and cf ms was significantly decreased by 52 62 and 68 1 respectively compared with cf and by 62 8 and 75 0 respectively compared with cf ss fig 2d similarly mssp displayed the largest p retention capacity with the p leaching loss rate of cf ms being 32 7 significantly lower than that of cf cs the total nh4 n leaching loss from cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly reduced by 51 6 72 4 and 88 0 respectively compared with cf and that from cf ms was significantly reduced by 75 3 and 56 7 compared with cf cs and cf ss respectively fig 3a similarly the cf treatment had the highest k leaching loss rate fig 3b the k leaching loss rate of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly decreased by 15 2 57 3 and 63 8 respectively compared with cf compared with cf cs the total k leaching loss rate of cf ss and cf ms was significantly decreased by 49 6 and 57 3 respectively leaching loss of divalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 was very different from that of the monovalent cation k fig 3c d the highest ca2 leaching loss occurred in cf cs and cf fig 3c there was no significant difference in ca2 leaching loss between cf ss and cf the leaching loss of ca2 from cf ms was significantly reduced by 11 4 and 27 9 compared with cf ss and cf cs respectively when mssp application was reduced by 30 i e cf 70 ms vs cf ms ca2 leaching loss increased by 16 4 the highest mg2 leaching loss occurred in cf ss fig 3d there were no significant differences in mg2 leaching loss between cf cs cf ms and cf compared with cf ms the mg2 leaching loss from cf 70 ms increased significantly by 13 4 it is generally known that the smaller radius and the higher valence of a cation the stronger it is adsorbed due to its higher surface charge density zhang et al 2014 in addition high valence cations readily accumulate on the surface preventing the further diffusion of other cations into the interior of sap molecules this explains the leaching loss differences between ca2 mg2 and k taken together the results clearly demonstrate that sap application can reduce water and nutrient loss from soil el rehim et al 2006 this is related to the wac of saps the absorption of ions into sap molecules is a physical process driven by osmotic pressure zhao et al 2021 a sap with a larger wac would absorb more ions 3 3 nutrient retention the total amount of nh4 n in the whole soil column was 11 5 and 81 7 significantly higher in cf ss and cf ms respectively than in cf fig 4a compared with cf cs and cf ss the nh4 n retention in cf ms was 63 2 and 55 5 respectively significantly higher but there was no significant difference between cf cs and cf ss in the 0 20 cm fertilization layer nh4 n in cf ss and cf ms was 90 1 and 98 2 respectively significantly higher than that in cf cs after leaching with four soil pore volumes of water more nh4 n was observed in the 20 40 cm layer and it was distributed uniformly in the four subsections of the layer in cf ms this was due to the higher absorption capacity of nh4 n by mssp after leaching with the first two soil pore volumes of water leaching loss of nh4 n from cf ms was less fig s4 the subsequent re release process buffered the infiltration of nh4 n which was fixed by the negatively charged soil colloids resulting in a more uniform distribution of nh4 n in the lower soil layers the total amount of no3 n in the entire soil column was 18 0 22 9 and 31 0 significantly higher in cf cs cf ss and cf ms respectively than in cf fig 4b demonstrating the nutrient retention property of the saps el rehim et al 2006 compared with cf cs and cf ss no3 n in cf ms was 11 0 and 6 6 significantly higher respectively the total amount of available p was not significantly different between cf cs and cf ss and it was not significantly different between cf cs and cf ms either fig 4c however it was 52 4 50 9 and 57 8 significantly lower in cf cs cf ss and cf ms respectively than in cf and it was 14 0 significantly lower in cf ms than in cf ss there were no significant differences between cf ms cf cs and cf 70 ms the total available k was 39 8 significantly higher in cf cs than in cf and it was 38 1 and 38 9 significantly lower in cf ms and cf ss respectively than in cf cs fig 4d however it was not significantly different between cf ss and cf ms the lower soil p and k in cf ss and cf ms compared with those in cf cannot be explained by leaching loss as these two treatments displayed lower p and k leaching loss in their leachates as well fig 2 3 therefore it is speculated the lost p and k had been adsorbed by the saps applied the three saps were significantly different in n adsorption amount fig 5a and mssp in cf ms had the highest n adsorption amount 55 3 and 309 4 significantly higher than that of csap in cf cs and sgsp in cf ss respectively in contrast the three saps were not significantly different in p adsorption amount fig 5b however mssp displayed a higher p adsorption amount in cf 70 ms than in cf ms indicating that the p binding sites of mssp in cf ms were not saturated with p the k adsorption amount of mssp in cf ms was 80 and 53 7 significantly higher than that of sgsp and csap respectively and there was no significant difference in k adsorption amount between csap and sgsp fig 5c in a word mssp had the highest adsorption amount of fertilizers which explained the lower p and k retention in the soil column of cf ms compared with cf cs 3 4 soil pore structure improvement by sap application of the saps had a significant effect on soil pore number table 3 fig s5 in the 0 5 cm soil layer pore number of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 81 3 300 0 and 300 0 significantly more than that of cf respectively the soil pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 120 7 and 120 7 respectively significantly more than that of cf cs but there was no significant difference between cf ss and cf ms a 30 reduction in mssp application did not significantly reduce the soil pore number in 0 10 cm layer in the 5 10 cm soil layer ms cf 70 ms and cf ms had the largest number of pores the pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 162 3 and 244 3 respectively significantly higher than that of cf compared with cf cs the soil pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 53 4 and 101 3 significantly higher respectively in the 10 15 cm soil layer the pore number of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 159 2 430 8 and 434 6 significantly higher than that of cf respectively the pore number of cf ms and cf ss was 106 2 and 104 4 respectively significantly higher than that of cf cs in the 15 20 cm soil layer the pore number of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 87 7 253 8 and 334 0 significantly higher than that of cf respectively and the pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 88 7 and 131 1 significantly higher than that of cf cs respectively the application of saps significantly changed soil porosity in each layer of the upper 20 cm of soil column table 4 in the 0 5 cm soil layer soil porosity of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 5 3 14 7 times significantly higher than that of cf compared with cf cs and cf ms soil porosity of cf ss was 38 1 and 177 8 significantly higher respectively and there was no significant difference between cf 70 ms and cf ms in the 5 10 cm layer soil porosity of cf ss was 152 2 and 87 5 significantly higher than that of cf cs and cf ms respectively and soil porosity of cf ms was 34 5 significantly higher than that of cf cs a 30 reduction in mssp application significantly decreased soil porosity by 32 2 in contrast there were no significant differences in soil porosity between the treatments with combined application of fertilizer and sap in the 10 20 cm soil layer the application of sap had no significant effect on soil pore circularity table 5 pores created by sap have no specific shape and they are affected by the pressure from soil particles bian et al 2018 therefore sap application would create more and larger pores in the 0 20 cm layer huang et al 2021 when soil moisture content is high they absorb water expand and destroy the capillary pores when soil moisture content is low they dehydrate and shrink leaving large pores in the soil under both scenarios the capillary rise of groundwater with a high salt concentration was stopped consequently surface evaporation would be reduced and the upward migration of salts would be inhibited zhao et al 2019 3 5 soil property improvement in the pot experiment as shown in fig 6 application of mssp markedly increased soil moisture by 22 0 in cf ms 31 6 on average as compared with cf 25 9 on average the average range value of cf ms 9 14 was also significantly lower than that of cf 12 7 which was due to the excellent water absorption and retention capacity of mssp therefore mssp application can provide a more smooth temperature environment for maize growth soil temperature was lower in cf ms 26 7 c on average than in cf 27 5 c on average which was related to the difference in soil moisture it is known that water has a large specific heat capacity the higher soil moisture in cf ms weakened the influence of air temperature on soil temperature leading to lower soil temperature values during the summer growing season of maize yang et al 2020 dehkordi 2018 3 6 improvement in crop yield nutrient utilization efficiency and wue fertilization is an important approach to stimulate crop growth and increase grain yield the above ground biomass and yield of maize were significantly increased in the fertilization treatments table 6 compared with ck cf significantly increased maize above ground biomass 100 grain weight and yield by 71 9 13 9 and 69 0 respectively in 2018 and it significantly increased maize above ground biomass and yield by 95 0 and 46 8 respectively in 2019 compared with ms the above ground biomass yield and 100 grain weight in cf ms were significantly increased by 37 6 11 4 and 89 7 in 2018 respectively and those in 2019 were significantly increased by 94 3 17 2 and 90 3 respectively application of sap increased maize yield as well table 6 compared with cf cf ss and cf ms significantly increased maize yield by 31 8 and 25 9 respectively in 2018 however there were no significant differences in above ground biomass 100 grain weight or yield between the three cf sap treatments in 2018 in 2019 cf ss and cf ms significantly increased maize yield by 25 1 and 32 1 respectively as compared with cf but there was no significant difference between the two treatments compared with cf cf ss and cf ms significantly increased n utilization efficiency nue by 49 2 and 45 3 respectively in 2018 and cf cs cf ss and cf ms significantly increased nue by 17 3 25 7 and 32 7 respectively in 2019 compared with cf cf cs significantly increased p utilization efficiency pue by 70 8 in 2018 cf ss significantly increased pue by 93 4 and 21 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and cf ms significantly increased pue by 99 1 and 29 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively in 2018 the k utilization efficiency kue in cf cs and cf ss was significantly higher by 63 7 and 50 6 respectively than that in cf in 2019 cf ss and cf ms significantly increased kue by 10 7 and 24 0 respectively as compared with cf it is worth noting that maize accumulated more n p and k in ms than in ck table s1 indicating that mssp application enhanced maize nutrient uptake liao et al 2018 this is mainly due to the improved soil moisture condition in ms on the one hand nutrient mobility was improved leading to higher nutrient accessibility to maize fig s6 on the other maize root grew better resulting in better nutrient uptake water use efficiency of maize was significantly different among the treatments table 6 compared with ck the wue in cf was significantly higher by 70 0 and 86 7 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with ms the wue in cf ms was significantly increased by 83 2 and 45 5 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with cf the wue in cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly increased by 23 3 35 0 and 29 2 respectively in 2018 and the wue in cf ss and cf ms was significantly increased by 14 2 and 13 5 respectively in 2019 the results of column leaching and pot experiments demonstrated that sap application improved soil moisture and nutritional conditions by reducing water and nutrient leaching loss and increased pore number and porosity in the 0 10 cm layer of the moderately saline soil as a result maize yield and apparent wue were increased al jabri et al 2015 saha et al 2020b 4 conclusion in the leaching experiment sap application decreased soil water leaching loss by 12 6 22 7 n leaching loss rate by 49 2 65 0 p leaching loss rate by 52 6 68 1 and k leaching loss rate by 15 2 63 8 in addition pore number and porosity in the 0 10 cm soil layer were increased in the pot experiment soil moisture was increased and soil temperature was decreased by sap application during the summer growing season of maize maize yield was significantly increased by 25 9 32 1 and wue by 13 5 35 0 in summary sap application reduced nutrient loss increased nutrient availability and improved soil physical properties creating a better environment for maize growth in the saline soil and thereby increasing maize yield this work provides a feasible strategy for raising the agricultural productivity of the large area of moderately saline soils in the yellow river basin china declaration

9740,to investigate the effects of superabsorbent polymers saps on the water nutrient retention characteristics and agricultural productivity of a saline soil from the yellow river basin soil column leaching and pot experiments were carried out three types of saps were used a commercial sap csap a starch grafted sap sgsp and a modified sgsp mssp six treatments were set up in the leaching

producing region in china but soil salt accumulation up to 1 99 3 77 g kg 1 soil occurs commonly in the entire basin due to climatic water shortage and capillary action xu et al 2013 pereira et al 2007 ren et al 2019 the concentrations of cations na ca2 mg2 etc in soil solution are usually abnormally high rao et al 2019 on the one hand these cations compete with nh4 and k for crop absorption

promote root growth and improve wue zia et al 2021 in addition sap degradation provides additional exogenous carbon h√ºttermann et al 2009 which has a priming effect on soil carbon and nitrogen n mineralization lu et al 2018 therefore sap application improves soil nutritional conditions and promotes crop growth and yield liao et al 2018 satriani et al 2018 liang et al 2019 the water absorption capacity wac of sap is closely related to the characteristics of its molecular network generally the more hydrophilic groups in a sap and the higher crosslinking degree of its molecule the larger a wac it has guilherme et al 2015 in addition the wac of sap is affected by the ion concentration in absorption medium ma et al 2004 thombare et al 2018 al jabri et al 2015 for example the wac of sap in normal saline is usually approximately one tenth of its wac in deionized water zhao et al 2019 zain et al 2018 high concentrations of ions such as k na ca2 and mg2 in irrigation water or in the pore water of salinized soils would significantly decrease the wac of sap shi et al 2010 ai et al 2021 to improve their salt tolerance saps are commonly grafted with natural macromolecules e g starch cellulose lignin rizwan et al 2021 in previous studies saps were applied in non saline soils their effects in saline soils are not clear guo et al 2016 tubert et al 2018 in this study it was hypothesized that after grafted with biological macromolecules a sap would have a higher wac in salinized soils and promote crop production a soil column leaching experiment and a pot experiment were conducted using a commercial sap and salt tolerant starch grafted saps as soil conditioners the objectives were to 1 investigate the effects of the commercial sap and starch grafted saps on the water and nutritional conditions of a moderately salinized soil from the yellow river basin 2 reveal the underlying mechanisms of the effects of saps on soil properties and 3 find out the effects of saps on the growth and yield of maize the findings of this study are expected to provide support for crop production in the yellow river basin where both water shortage and soil salinization are concerns 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil fertilizers and saps used the soil used in both the column leaching and pot experiments was collected from the 0 20 cm layer of an agricultural field in the bohai

used in the pot experiment had n p2o5 k2o ratios of 42 0 0 17 3 43 8 0 and 0 0 53 respectively the three types of saps used in this study included a commercial sap csap purchased from the schultz company moisture plus watering crystals usa whose wac was 354 8 and 35 4 g g 1 in deionized water and normal saline respectively the other two saps a starch grafted sap sgsp and a modified starch

fertilizer and csap were applied 4 cf ss fertilizer and sgsp were applied 5 cf ms fertilizer and mssp were applied and 6 cf 70 ms fertilizer and mssp were applied but mssp was applied at 70 of that in cf ms the amounts of the compound fertilizer and saps used in each treatment are listed in table 1 the polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes inner diameter 7 0 cm height 60 cm used for the experiment were sealed with three layers of 10 mesh gauze on the bottom and first packed with 1980 g dry soil 2 mm to 20 cm thick then the pipes were packed with another 1980 g soil which had been mixed thoroughly with fertilizer and or sap according to the specific treatment to another 20 cm thick finally a 1 cm layer of coarse quartz sand was packed on top to prevent the soil from disturbance and reduce water

separate the upper 20 cm of soil from the lower 20 cm the lower 20 cm section was further sawn into four 5 cm sections fig s2 then the soils were taken out from the pipes and air dried after separated manually from the soils the saps were analyzed for total n p and k the soils were passed through a 10 mesh sieve and analyzed for available n p and k 2 4 pot experiment the pot experiment was conducted in a research farm 117 9 48 e 36 9 40 n of shandong agricultural university the site has a temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 c six treatments were set up with four replications in a completely randomized design 1 ck no fertilizer or sap was applied 2 ms no fertilizer but mssp was applied 3 cf no sap but fertilizers were applied 4 cf cs

rhizons 2 5 sampler rhizosphere research products b v netherlands for nutrient concentration analysis in cf and cf ms soil moisture and temperature were monitored with a data logger hobo micro station logger version 5 0 onset usa fig s3 irrigation weeding and pest control were performed according to local practices maize ears were harvested on 29 september 2018 maize ears and above ground parts were oven dried and weights were recorded the experiment was repeated in 2019 using the same pots with seed sowing and grain harvest on the same dates as in 2018 2 5 chemical analyses total n in leachate and soil solution was measured with a nitrogen analyzer vario toc elementer germany total p in leachate and soil solution was determined using the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in leachate and soil solution were measured with a continuous flow autoanalyzer aa 3 bran luebbe germany the concentration of k in leachate and soil solution was determined by flame photometry the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in leachate were measured with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa 7000 shimadzu japan soil no3 n and nh4 n were extracted with 2 mol l 1 kcl solution soil available p and k was extracted with 0 05 mol l 1 nahco3 and 1 mol l 1 ch3coonh4 respectively the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n p and k in extracts were determined as previously described li et al 2021 the sap and plant samples were digested with concentrated h2so4 at 280 c until no visible solids total n was measured using the kjeldahl method total p was determined using the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method and total k was quantified by flame photometry 2 6 calculations and statistical analyses nutrient n p or k leaching loss rate was calculated as lu et al 2019 nutrient leaching loss rate nutrient leaching loss from the fertilization treatment nutrient leaching loss from the nonfertilization treatment nutrient supply by fertilizer

content above ground biomass nutrient n p or k utilization efficiency was calculated as li et al 2021 nutrient utilization efficiency maize nutrient accumulation in the fertilization treatment maize nutrient accumulation in the nonfertilization treatment nutrient supply by fertilizer 100 for wue calculation the following equation was used wang et al 2019 wue maize above ground biomass precipitation irrigation data were processed using microsoft excel 2019 and analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova using sas version 8 2 sas 2010 means were separated using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 figures were generated using sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 ftir spectra of mssp the ftir spectrum of mssp showed two characteristic peaks of starch a strong broad absorption peak at 3300 3500 cm 1 and a weak absorption peak at 1600 1650 cm 1 fig 1 which correspond to oh scissoring vibration zhao et al 2019 in addition there were a peak at 1650 cm 1 attributed to co vibration and a peak at 1400 cm 1 due to the asymmetric vibration of so3h tsai et al 2010 after soaked in the saturated urea solution mssp showed peaks at 4000 3800 cm 1 2850 cm 1 and 2430 cm 1 which were due to oh groups zhao et al 2019 the destruction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds by urea y cheng et al 2018 d cheng et al 2018 and the amide structure of urea narayanan et al 2018 respectively after mssp was soaked in the saturated nh4 2hpo4 solution its peak at 1400 cm 1 redshifted slightly which was because nh4 competed with h for the intramolecular bonding sites and weakened the asymmetric vibration of so3h jin et al 2019 in addition the nh4 2hpo4 soaked mssp displayed a very different spectral pattern in the fingerprint area 800 cm 1 compared with the unsoaked mssp which may be due to the effect of phosphate ions yang et al 2018 the kcl soaked mssp displayed a weaker absorption peak at 2850 cm 1 compared with the unsoaked mssp hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl and sulfonic acid groups are the major binding sites in sap molecules and they uniformly disperse in the 3d network of sap molecule zhao et al 2019 the spectra indicate that no chemical bonds were formed when mssp was soaked in the saturated solutions of urea nh4 2hpo4 and kcl it can be expected that when soil moisture decreases the osmotic pressure change would result in nutrient release from mssp zhao et al 2021 therefore saps are simultaneous a sink and source of water and nutrients depending on soil moisture conditions 3 2 water and nutrient leaching loss application of 6 g csap sgsp or mssp to the soil significantly reduced water leaching loss fig 2a compared with cf water leaching loss from cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly reduced by 12 6 14 3 and 22 7 respectively as cross linked polymers saps contain many highly hydrophilic groups and can absorb a large amount of water saha et al 2020a therefore sap application can reduce water leaching loss water leaching loss from cf ms was 8 9 and 7 3 less than that from cf cs and cf ss respectively in contrast there was no significant difference in water leaching loss between cf cs and cf ss when 30 less mssp was applied i e cf 70 ms vs cf ms water leaching loss increased by 21 1 water leaching loss from cf ss and cf cs was significantly greater by 10 7 and 12 5 respectively than that from ms which indicated that the compound fertilizer applied negatively influenced the water absorption performance of csap and sgsp this is because ions e g nh4 k from fertilizers permeate into the inner space of sap molecules with water which is driven by osmotic pressure de souza et al 2019 and compete with water for the hydrophilic groups on sap molecules lee et al 2018 as a result less water is absorbed by saps zhao et al 2021 liu et al 2007 however the effect of chemical fertilizer on the water absorption performance of mssp was not significant the reason may be that mssp had a higher salt tolerance than csap and sgsp zhao et al 2019 compared with cf the n leaching loss rate of cf ss cf cs and cf ms was significantly reduced by 49 2 50 9 and 65 0 respectively fig 2b demonstrating that sap application can reduce both water and n leaching loss thombare et al 2018 compared with cf cs and cf ss the n leaching loss rate of cf ms was significantly lower by 28 7 and 31 0 respectively demonstrating that saps differ greatly in nutrient retention capacity even 30 less mssp was applied the n leaching loss rate of cf 70 ms was 25 5 and 23 0 lower than that of cf ss and cf cs respectively similarly the no3 n leaching loss from cf ss cf cs and cf ms was reduced by 33 3 14 2 and 33 8 respectively compared with cf fig 2c in addition the no3 n leaching loss from cf ms and cf ss was significantly decreased by 22 8 and 22 2 respectively compared with cf cs and there was no significant difference between cf ms and cf ss the p leaching loss rate of cf cs and cf ms was significantly decreased by 52 62 and 68 1 respectively compared with cf and by 62 8 and 75 0 respectively compared with cf ss fig 2d similarly mssp displayed the largest p retention capacity with the p leaching loss rate of cf ms being 32 7 significantly lower than that of cf cs the total nh4 n leaching loss from cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly reduced by 51 6 72 4 and 88 0 respectively compared with cf and that from cf ms was significantly reduced by 75 3 and 56 7 compared with cf cs and cf ss respectively fig 3a similarly the cf treatment had the highest k leaching loss rate fig 3b the k leaching loss rate of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly decreased by 15 2 57 3 and 63 8 respectively compared with cf compared with cf cs the total k leaching loss rate of cf ss and cf ms was significantly decreased by 49 6 and 57 3 respectively leaching loss of divalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 was very different from that of the monovalent cation k fig 3c d the highest ca2 leaching loss occurred in cf cs and cf fig 3c there was no significant difference in ca2 leaching loss between cf ss and cf the leaching loss of ca2 from cf ms was significantly reduced by 11 4 and 27 9 compared with cf ss and cf cs respectively when mssp application was reduced by 30 i e cf 70 ms vs cf ms ca2 leaching loss increased by 16 4 the highest mg2 leaching loss occurred in cf ss fig 3d there were no significant differences in mg2 leaching loss between cf cs cf ms and cf compared with cf ms the mg2 leaching loss from cf 70 ms increased significantly by 13 4 it is generally known that the smaller radius and the higher valence of a cation the stronger it is adsorbed due to its higher surface charge density zhang et al 2014 in addition high valence cations readily accumulate on the surface preventing the further diffusion of other cations into the interior of sap molecules this explains the leaching loss differences between ca2 mg2 and k taken together the results clearly demonstrate that sap application can reduce water and nutrient loss from soil el rehim et al 2006 this is related to the wac of saps the absorption of ions into sap molecules is a physical process driven by osmotic pressure zhao et al 2021 a sap with a larger wac would absorb more ions 3 3 nutrient retention the total amount of nh4 n in the whole soil column was 11 5 and 81 7 significantly higher in cf ss and cf ms respectively than in cf fig 4a compared with cf cs and cf ss the nh4 n retention in cf ms was 63 2 and 55 5 respectively significantly higher but there was no significant difference between cf cs and cf ss in the 0 20 cm fertilization layer nh4 n in cf ss and cf ms was 90 1 and 98 2 respectively significantly higher than that in cf cs after leaching with four soil pore volumes of water more nh4 n was observed in the 20 40 cm layer and it was distributed uniformly in the four subsections of the layer in cf ms this was due to the higher absorption capacity of nh4 n by mssp after leaching with the first two soil pore volumes of water leaching loss of nh4 n from cf ms was less fig s4 the subsequent re release process buffered the infiltration of nh4 n which was fixed by the negatively charged soil colloids resulting in a more uniform distribution of nh4 n in the lower soil layers the total amount of no3 n in the entire soil column was 18 0 22 9 and 31 0 significantly higher in cf cs cf ss and cf ms respectively than in cf fig 4b demonstrating the nutrient retention property of the saps el rehim et al 2006 compared with cf cs and cf ss no3 n in cf ms was 11 0 and 6 6 significantly higher respectively the total amount of available p was not significantly different between cf cs and cf ss and it was not significantly different between cf cs and cf ms either fig 4c however it was 52 4 50 9 and 57 8 significantly lower in cf cs cf ss and cf ms respectively than in cf and it was 14 0 significantly lower in cf ms than in cf ss there were no significant differences between cf ms cf cs and cf 70 ms the total available k was 39 8 significantly higher in cf cs than in cf and it was 38 1 and 38 9 significantly lower in cf ms and cf ss respectively than in cf cs fig 4d however it was not significantly different between cf ss and cf ms the lower soil p and k in cf ss and cf ms compared with those in cf cannot be explained by leaching loss as these two treatments displayed lower p and k leaching loss in their leachates as well fig 2 3 therefore it is speculated the lost p and k had been adsorbed by the saps applied the three saps were significantly different in n adsorption amount fig 5a and mssp in cf ms had the highest n adsorption amount 55 3 and 309 4 significantly higher than that of csap in cf cs and sgsp in cf ss respectively in contrast the three saps were not significantly different in p adsorption amount fig 5b however mssp displayed a higher p adsorption amount in cf 70 ms than in cf ms indicating that the p binding sites of mssp in cf ms were not saturated with p the k adsorption amount of mssp in cf ms was 80 and 53 7 significantly higher than that of sgsp and csap respectively and there was no significant difference in k adsorption amount between csap and sgsp fig 5c in a word mssp had the highest adsorption amount of fertilizers which explained the lower p and k retention in the soil column of cf ms compared with cf cs 3 4 soil pore structure improvement by sap application of the saps had a significant effect on soil pore number table 3 fig s5 in the 0 5 cm soil layer pore number of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 81 3 300 0 and 300 0 significantly more than that of cf respectively the soil pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 120 7 and 120 7 respectively significantly more than that of cf cs but there was no significant difference between cf ss and cf ms a 30 reduction in mssp application did not significantly reduce the soil pore number in 0 10 cm layer in the 5 10 cm soil layer ms cf 70 ms and cf ms had the largest number of pores the pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 162 3 and 244 3 respectively significantly higher than that of cf compared with cf cs the soil pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 53 4 and 101 3 significantly higher respectively in the 10 15 cm soil layer the pore number of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 159 2 430 8 and 434 6 significantly higher than that of cf respectively the pore number of cf ms and cf ss was 106 2 and 104 4 respectively significantly higher than that of cf cs in the 15 20 cm soil layer the pore number of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 87 7 253 8 and 334 0 significantly higher than that of cf respectively and the pore number of cf ss and cf ms was 88 7 and 131 1 significantly higher than that of cf cs respectively the application of saps significantly changed soil porosity in each layer of the upper 20 cm of soil column table 4 in the 0 5 cm soil layer soil porosity of cf cs cf ss and cf ms was 5 3 14 7 times significantly higher than that of cf compared with cf cs and cf ms soil porosity of cf ss was 38 1 and 177 8 significantly higher respectively and there was no significant difference between cf 70 ms and cf ms in the 5 10 cm layer soil porosity of cf ss was 152 2 and 87 5 significantly higher than that of cf cs and cf ms respectively and soil porosity of cf ms was 34 5 significantly higher than that of cf cs a 30 reduction in mssp application significantly decreased soil porosity by 32 2 in contrast there were no significant differences in soil porosity between the treatments with combined application of fertilizer and sap in the 10 20 cm soil layer the application of sap had no significant effect on soil pore circularity table 5 pores created by sap have no specific shape and they are affected by the pressure from soil particles bian et al 2018 therefore sap application would create more and larger pores in the 0 20 cm layer huang et al 2021 when soil moisture content is high they absorb water expand and destroy the capillary pores when soil moisture content is low they dehydrate and shrink leaving large pores in the soil under both scenarios the capillary rise of groundwater with a high salt concentration was stopped consequently surface evaporation would be reduced and the upward migration of salts would be inhibited zhao et al 2019 3 5 soil property improvement in the pot experiment as shown in fig 6 application of mssp markedly increased soil moisture by 22 0 in cf ms 31 6 on average as compared with cf 25 9 on average the average range value of cf ms 9 14 was also significantly lower than that of cf 12 7 which was due to the excellent water absorption and retention capacity of mssp therefore mssp application can provide a more smooth temperature environment for maize growth soil temperature was lower in cf ms 26 7 c on average than in cf 27 5 c on average which was related to the difference in soil moisture it is known that water has a large specific heat capacity the higher soil moisture in cf ms weakened the influence of air temperature on soil temperature leading to lower soil temperature values during the summer growing season of maize yang et al 2020 dehkordi 2018 3 6 improvement in crop yield nutrient utilization efficiency and wue fertilization is an important approach to stimulate crop growth and increase grain yield the above ground biomass and yield of maize were significantly increased in the fertilization treatments table 6 compared with ck cf significantly increased maize above ground biomass 100 grain weight and yield by 71 9 13 9 and 69 0 respectively in 2018 and it significantly increased maize above ground biomass and yield by 95 0 and 46 8 respectively in 2019 compared with ms the above ground biomass yield and 100 grain weight in cf ms were significantly increased by 37 6 11 4 and 89 7 in 2018 respectively and those in 2019 were significantly increased by 94 3 17 2 and 90 3 respectively application of sap increased maize yield as well table 6 compared with cf cf ss and cf ms significantly increased maize yield by 31 8 and 25 9 respectively in 2018 however there were no significant differences in above ground biomass 100 grain weight or yield between the three cf sap treatments in 2018 in 2019 cf ss and cf ms significantly increased maize yield by 25 1 and 32 1 respectively as compared with cf but there was no significant difference between the two treatments compared with cf cf ss and cf ms significantly increased n utilization efficiency nue by 49 2 and 45 3 respectively in 2018 and cf cs cf ss and cf ms significantly increased nue by 17 3 25 7 and 32 7 respectively in 2019 compared with cf cf cs significantly increased p utilization efficiency pue by 70 8 in 2018 cf ss significantly increased pue by 93 4 and 21 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and cf ms significantly increased pue by 99 1 and 29 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively in 2018 the k utilization efficiency kue in cf cs and cf ss was significantly higher by 63 7 and 50 6 respectively than that in cf in 2019 cf ss and cf ms significantly increased kue by 10 7 and 24 0 respectively as compared with cf it is worth noting that maize accumulated more n p and k in ms than in ck table s1 indicating that mssp application enhanced maize nutrient uptake liao et al 2018 this is mainly due to the improved soil moisture condition in ms on the one hand nutrient mobility was improved leading to higher nutrient accessibility to maize fig s6 on the other maize root grew better resulting in better nutrient uptake water use efficiency of maize was significantly different among the treatments table 6 compared with ck the wue in cf was significantly higher by 70 0 and 86 7 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with ms the wue in cf ms was significantly increased by 83 2 and 45 5 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with cf the wue in cf cs cf ss and cf ms was significantly increased by 23 3 35 0 and 29 2 respectively in 2018 and the wue in cf ss and cf ms was significantly increased by 14 2 and 13 5 respectively in 2019 the results of column leaching and pot experiments demonstrated that sap application improved soil moisture and nutritional conditions by reducing water and nutrient leaching loss and increased pore number and porosity in the 0 10 cm layer of the moderately saline soil as a result maize yield and apparent wue were increased al jabri et al 2015 saha et al 2020b 4 conclusion in the leaching experiment sap application decreased soil water leaching loss by 12 6 22 7 n leaching loss rate by 49 2 65 0 p leaching loss rate by 52 6 68 1 and k leaching loss rate by 15 2 63 8 in addition pore number and porosity in the 0 10 cm soil layer were increased in the pot experiment soil moisture was increased and soil temperature was decreased by sap application during the summer growing season of maize maize yield was significantly increased by 25 9 32 1 and wue by 13 5 35 0 in summary sap application reduced nutrient loss increased nutrient availability and improved soil physical properties creating a better environment for maize growth in the saline soil and thereby increasing maize yield this work provides a feasible strategy for raising the agricultural productivity of the large area of moderately saline soils in the yellow river basin china declaration

9741,the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system is considered an effective strategy for improving crop productivity and it has been adopted increasingly in the arid and semiarid rainfed agricultural areas of china however how rfrh performs at improving the crop productivity and the economic benefits of long term implementation are not known in different counties and conditions in the loess plateau region therefore rfrh and traditional planting method ck experiments were carried out by us under five different hydrothermal conditions in the loess plateau for many years the denitrification decomposition dndc model was corrected and verified by field test data then the performance of rfrh and ck in time from 1990 to 2019 three test points and space 387 counties 112 000 km 2 grain crop planting area was simulated the results showed that from 1990 to 2019 the maize yield was 9200 11 395 kg ha 1 under rfrh and 1433 11 326 kg ha 1 under ck the interannual variation in the maize yield was small under rfrh and it significantly improved the maize yield in dry years 87 0 higher than ck in addition rfrh effectively stabilized and improved the maize biomass increased by 26 9 harvest index increased by 24 3 and economic benefits increased by 63 4 in the whole loess plateau region compared with ck the average grain yield under rfrh increased by 86 and the average net income increased by 133 the capacity of rfrh to increase the economic benefits in the loess plateau regions followed the order of northwest region northeast region southwest region southeast region rfrh can improve and stabilize the maize yield but also enhance the economic benefits of maize production in this region therefore rfrh can be used as an important technique for coping with years when different amounts of precipitation occur in the loess plateau region but especially in the northwest where the precipitation is limited keywords ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrh precipitation utilization efficiency crop productivity economic benefits dryland agriculture 1 introduction the loess plateau 100 114 e 33 42 n is the main dryland agricultural region in china fig 1 where the grain yield accounts for 9 1 of the total production in china zheng et al 2021 maize is the main grain crop produced in this area zhang et al 2019 the loess plateau is rich in light resources with annual radiation of 50 2 67 0 104 j cm 2 and the crop yield potential is high zhang et al 2019 however the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation in this area is uneven which is mainly manifested in more precipitation in the southeast less precipitation in the northwest and very high precipitation variability in season and in the year zhang et al 2020 in addition the temperature is generally low during the spring dong et al 2019 and the natural precipitation period is not consistent with the crop water demand period liu et al 2020 thereby resulting in low grain yields indeed the grain yield cannot even meet the needs of the local population in some counties in the loess plateau region zhang et al 2018 therefore developing dryland farming and water saving agriculture techniques to improve crop the water use efficiency are important for enhancing the crop yield in this region chen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system used in dryland agriculture has attracted global attention because of its advantages for collecting rainfall and increasing infiltration jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 previous studies have shown that rfrh can improve the yield and resource use efficiency by changing the crop phenology li et al 2017 increasing the leaf chlorophyll content zhang et al 2019 rubpcase activity and photosynthetic rate hou et al 2015 and promoting the absorption of water and nutrients via the roots wang and xing 2016 jia et al 2018 mohammadi et al 2019 however the effects of rfrh are readily influenced by the climate soil conditions and management measures dong et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 and they vary greatly among the different regions of china zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 clearly due to limitations in terms of human and material resources it is difficult to conduct field experiments in different counties throughout an entire study region at the same time therefore a process based model is considered a better option for exploring the effects of rfrh in the loess plateau region in detail han et al 2014 the denitrification decomposition dndc model is a biogeochemical model that considers the carbon and nitrogen in an agroecosystem based on a process mechanism this model is one of the most important for studying the effects of the interactions among the climate soil conditions and field management measures on crop growth dutta et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the model has been verified in many countries throughout the world and it has been used widely deng et al 2018 mohammadi et al 2019 banger et al 2020 moreover the model obtains good simulations of rfrh experiments han et al 2014 and thus it can be used to simulate the effects of rfrh on maize growth in the loess plateau region several studies have evaluated the crop yield under plastic mulching in the loess plateau region using the dndc model zhang et al 2018 however the long term historical effects of the rfrh system on the maize yield biomass harvest index precipitation use efficiency pue economic benefits and their spatial differences have not been determined for the different counties in the loess plateau region the hypotheses of this study were 1 rfrh can have a good performance of increasing yield and efficiency in years with different amounts of precipitation under long term historical conditions 2 rfrh can improve maize productivity and economic benefits in different counties in the loess plateau region therefore we corrected the dndc model using experimental observation data the maize yield and biomass under rfrh and traditional flat planting ck were simulated with the dndc model and the crop productivity and economic benefits were studied the aims of this study was to evaluate the temporal and spatial applicability of rfrh in the loess plateau and to provide a theoretical basis for the popularization and application of rfrh in the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the loess plateau region of northwest china fig 1 which is the main grain producing region in china chen et al 2015 the loess plateau region

area of about 640 000 km2 sun et al 2019 with altitudes ranging from 12 to 5232 m fig 1 the loess plateau region has a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate which is affected by the latitude and topography the precipitation levels are low on the loess plateau the mean annual precipitation from 1990 to 2019 was 144 946 mm fig 2c and only 13 of the area had annual precipitation exceeding 600 mm these areas are mainly distributed in the southeast of the loess plateau the general precipitation trend in the loess plateau region decreases from the southeast to northwest fig 2 the precipitation in this region is characterized by an uneven annual distribution and high variability zhang et al 2012a 2 2 experimental design and field management these experiments were conducted

study we considered the loess plateau region as the research area each county in the loess plateau region was treated as a basic research unit to build a regional simulation database that is the

pengyang yangling and changwu were selected the distance between each meteorological station and the experimental site was less than 10 km and the amounts of precipitation in each year from 1990 to 2019 were statistically analyzed during the study period considered the precipitation differed significantly at each experimental station fig 4a c the mean annual precipitation amounts at pengyang changwu and yangling were 457 9 mm 586 1 mm and 579 5 mm respectively with 391 8 mm 473 4 mm and 460 4 mm in the maize growth period and 63 8 mm 110 4 mm and 117 3 mm in the fallow period the mean annual precipitation precipitation in the maize growth period and precipitation in the fallow period followed the order of changwu yangling pengyang the precipitation amounts were used to calculate the drought index di for each experimental site with eq 6 fig 4d according to the classification standard for precipitation in different years guo et al 2012 the years in the period from 1990 to 2019 were divided into wet normal and dry years the statistical results showed that the probability of dry years differed significantly at the three stations fig 4e i e 50 at pengyang 40 at changwu and 33

yield and biomass based on simulations of the different planting modes rfrh and ck the simulated and the actual measured maize yield fig 5a and biomass fig 5c at each experimental site were compared the results showed that the simulated values were the same as the measured values a highly significant correlation was obtained between the simulated and measured maize yields r 0 59 p 0 01 a significant correlation was found between the simulated and measured biomass results r 0 40 p 0 05 for the maize yield and biomass the rmse mae and bias values were 1872 kg ha 1 and 4113 kg ha 1 1576 kg ha 1 and 3495 kg ha 1 and 389 kg ha 1 and 373 kg ha 1 respectively fig 5b and d thus the verification results demonstrated that the dndc model could simulate the maize yield and biomass under ck and rfrh in the loess plateau region however differences in the maize varieties planted and climate and soil coarse resolution data could lead to errors in the simulations of the model considering these factors the overall performance of the model was high when the simulated values were compared with the measured values the rmse mae and bias results obtained in the present study are similar to those reported in a previous study zhang et al 2018 and some large scale investigations in china qiao et al 2014 chen et al 2016 tang et al 2021 therefore the dndc model performed well for the loess plateau region and the accuracy of the simulations was reasonable and thus it was considered suitable for studying the effects of rfrh on maize growth in this region 3 2 changes in maize yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits from 1990 to 2019 the maize yield and biomass fig 6a c at pengyang yangling and changwu during 1990 2019 were simulated using the dndc model and the harvest index fig 6d pue table 3 fig 7 and economic benefits table 4 fig 8 were calculated the results showed that rfrh significantly increased the grain yield by 54 0 compared with ck p 0 01 from 1990 2019 the average grain yield under rfrh and ck was 11 089 kg ha 1 and 7202 kg ha 1 respectively the grain yield under rfrh fluctuated little during 1990 2019 from 1990 2019 the grain yield under rfrh varied from 9200 to 11 395 kg ha 1 by contrast the grain yield fluctuated greatly under ck from 1990 2019 the grain yield under ck varied from 1433 to 11 326 kg ha 1 rfrh significantly increased the total maize biomass by 26 9 compared with ck p 0 01 from 1990 to 2019 the average biomass under rfrh and ck was 22 342 kg ha 1 and 17 604 kg ha 1 respectively the range of fluctuations in the maize biomass was small under rfrh from 1990 to 2019 the biomass under rfrh was 22 149 22 633 kg ha 1 by contrast the biomass fluctuated greatly under ck from 1990 2019 the biomass varied from 7655 to 22 613 kg ha 1 rfrh significantly increased the maize harvest index by 24 3 compared with ck p 0 01 from 1990 2019 the average harvest index under rfrh and ck was 49 6 and 39 9 respectively from 1990 to 2019 the variation in the maize harvest index was small under rfrh where the harvest index was 44 7 50 5 by contrast the harvest index fluctuated greatly under ck the harvest index varied from 15 6 to 56 1 during 1990 2019 the average pue values did not differ significantly under rfrh and ck at the three experimental sites p 0 05 the pue value fluctuated little under rfrh where it varied among 8 3 29 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 from 1990 to 2019 by contrast the pue value fluctuated greatly under ck the pue value varied between 5 3 and 37 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 from 1990 to 2019 the agricultural input cost under rfrh was 28 8 1700 yuan ha 1 higher than that under ck table 5 however although the agricultural input cost was higher the economic benefits were still greater under rfrh than ck rfrh effectively stabilized and improved the economic benefits of maize production table 4 fig 8 the output net income and output input ratio fluctuated little under rfrh from 1990 2019 the output net income and output input ratio under rfrh were 19 764 24 139 yuan ha 1 12 159 16 534 yuan ha 1 and 2 59 3 17 respectively by contrast the output net income and output input ratio fluctuated greatly under ck from 1990 2019 the output net income and output input ratio were 3794 24 000 yuan ha 1 2111 to 18095 yuan ha 1 and 0 64 4 06 respectively in addition we found that the effects of rfrh on the maize yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits differed significantly among years with different amounts of precipitation in the order of wet year normal year dry year table s1 table 4 in the wet normal and dry years compared with ck rfrh increased the maize yield by 44 53 and 87 respectively the biomass by 22 25 and 39 the harvest index by 18 21 and 36 the output by 41 49 and 80 the net income by 54 68 and 133 and the output input ratio by 10 16 and 40 3 3 spatial performance in terms of maize yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits the precipitation varied greatly among the different regions in the loess plateau area fig 2 the amounts of precipitation in the maize growth period 127 8 775 7 mm fallow period 16 0 192 7 mm and annual precipitation 144 0 946 2 mm were consistent over the whole loess plateau area where they tended to decrease from the southeast to northwest fig 2a c according to the elevation of the loess plateau shown in fig 1 the terrain is higher in the southwest especially in qinghai province where the average altitude is higher than 3000 m and the annual average temperature is lower than 7 c in this cold plateau area fig s4 the results showed that the grain yield fig 9 biomass fig 10 and harvest index fig 11 were generally higher under rfrh in the different counties in the loess plateau region the average grain yield biomass and harvest index under rfrh in the 387 counties were 10 239 kg ha 1 21 295 kg ha 1 and 47 respectively the grain yields in 92 of the counties exceeded 6000 kg ha 1 by contrast the maize grain yield biomass and harvest index were relatively low under ck the average grain yield biomass and harvest index under ck in the 387 counties were 5499 kg ha 1 13 794 kg ha 1 and 41 respectively the grain yield biomass and harvest index under rfrh fluctuated little in the 387 counties in the loess plateau region the ranges of the grain yield biomass and harvest index under rfrh in the loess plateau region were 1592 11 558 kg ha 1 10 800 22 578 kg ha 1 and 15 53 respectively by contrast the grain yield biomass and harvest index fluctuated greatly under ck the ranges of the grain yield biomass and harvest index under ck were 222 9523 kg ha 1 2487 20 207 kg ha 1 and 10 67 respectively we calculated the pue values fig 12 under the two maize planting modes in different counties in the loess plateau region and found that the pue values were generally higher under rfrh with an average pue of 16 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 and range of 1 9 37 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 the pue values were slightly lower under ck with an average of 14 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 and range of 0 5 34 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 we also calculated the economic benefits under the two planting modes fig 13 table 5 in each county in the loess plateau region and found that the economic benefits were generally higher under rfrh with average output net income and output input ratio values of 21 805 yuan ha 1 14 200 yuan ha 1 and 2 87 respectively and ranges of 4290 24 406 yuan ha 1 3314 16801 yuan ha 1 and 0 97 3 21 the economic benefits were lower under ck where the average output net income and output input ratio values were 11 995 yuan ha 1 6090 yuan ha 1 and 2 03 respectively and the ranges were 716 20 329 yuan ha 1 5188 to 14 424 yuan ha 1 and 0 12 3 44 the grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits under rfrh and ck exhibited similar spatial patterns in the loess plateau region where they gradually decreased from the southeast to northwest the spatial patterns in the grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits agreed with the spatial distribution of precipitation figs 2 9 10 and 11 compared with ck rfrh significantly increased the maize grain yield biomass harvest index pue output net income and output input ratio by 86 54 16 13 82 133 and 41 respectively and thus local farmers had higher yields and incomes the results showed that rfrh significantly increased the maize yield and biomass in 98 of the counties in the loess plateau region compared with ck thereby indicating that rfrh can significantly increase the maize grain yield and biomass in most areas our analysis of the economic benefits in the loess plateau region showed that rfrh significantly increased the net incomes in 96 of the counties p 0 01 the net income was negative in 8 3 of the counties under ck but in only 2 3 of the counties under rfrh in addition the number of counties which had net incomes 8000 9000 and 10 000 yuan ha 1 under rfrh was 222 295 and 303 more than that under ck respectively these results demonstrate that rfrh could improve the economic benefits of maize in most counties expand the area suitable for planting maize effectively reduce the impacts of regional differences in rainfall significantly reduce the amount of counties with negative net incomes and enhance the incomes of farmers 4 discussion 4 1 effects of changes in interannual precipitation on crop yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits the rfrh system can improve the maize yield but also utilize precipitation more effectively li et al 2012 chen et al 2014 li et al 2016b liu et al 2020 our results showed that the annual precipitation changed greatly from 1990 to 2019 the average precipitation was 876 mm in the year with the maximum precipitation in pengyang yangling and changwu and the average precipitation was 313 3 mm in the year with the minimum precipitation fig 4a c thus the maximum annual precipitation was 2 8 times of the minimum annual precipitation the grain yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits under ck were greatly affected by the changes in interannual precipitation the grain yield biomass harvest index output net income and output input ratio under ck in the year with the maximum precipitation were 1 9 1 4 1 5 1 8 2 1 and 3 4 times higher respectively compared with those in the year with the minimum precipitation figs 6 7 8 table 4 in addition these indexes decreased under ck as the annual precipitation decreased however the grain yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits were affected less by the interannual changes in precipitation under rfrh and these indexes did not differ significantly among years under rfrh dong et al 2019 obtained similar results when studying the effects of rfrh on wheat grain yield and biomass in different precipitation years this is mainly because rfrh effectively collects rainfall and increases its infiltration compared with ck zhou et al 2015 moreover rfrh can change the crop phenology li et al 2017 improve the leaf photosynthetic capacity wang et al 2015 promote root growth and the absorption of water and nutrients jia et al 2018 and increase the maize grain yield and pue wang and xing 2016 mohammadi et al 2019 in particular in years with low precipitation rfrh can effectively alleviate the impact of drought stress on maize growth zhang et al 2018 thereby obtaining a higher maize grain yield hou et al 2015 mohammadi et al 2019 therefore the changes in interannual precipitation had little effect on maize production under rfrh the average precipitation in the wet years in pengyang yangling and changwu during 1990 2019 was 29 higher than that in the normal years and 62 higher than that in the dry years in wet years the grain yield biomass harvest index output net income and output input ratio under ck were 5 3 2 5 2 3 4 9 8 0 and 4 8 higher respectively compared with those in normal years and 30 8 14 8 15 5 28 4 52 9 and 28 5 higher compared with those in dry years fig 6 however these indexes under rfrh differed little among normal wet and dry years fig 6 thus rfrh could maintain the normal growth of maize jia et al 2018 obtain higher grain yield and economic benefits among normal wet and dry years zhang et al 2019 we also found that there were no significant differences in the grain yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits between rfrh and ck where they were even lower compared with ck in some years when more precipitation occurred at the same experimental location thus for the agricultural management measures investigated in this study the capacity of rfrh to increase the grain yield is limited to an extent when the precipitation exceeds a certain amount improving the water use efficiency is essential for improving the crop productivity mohammadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 therefore on the basis of agricultural management measures in this study if combined with reasonable fertilization selecting suitable maize varieties for local planting optimizing the planting density and returning straw to the field it may further improve maize grain yield and pue li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 4 2 effects of regional differences in precipitation on crop yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits more fully utilizing natural precipitation is crucial for the success of dryland farming especially in areas without the condition of irrigation han et al 2014 the maize grain yield was positively correlated with precipitation fig 6f the results of li et al 2016a were similar to those of this study therefore improving the water use efficiency is important for enhancing the crop productivity in china fan et al 2012 the spatial distributions of the maize grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits in the loess plateau region were similar to that of the precipitation where the precipitation decreased gradually from the southeast to northwest figs 9 11 13 compared with ck rfrh significantly decreased the reductions in these indexes and it effectively reduced the influence of regional precipitation differences on maize growth this is mainly because rfrh has strong capacity at collecting and retain water zhou et al 2015 thereby significantly improving the water use efficiency in maize liu et al 2020 effectively saving water han et al 2014 to improve the maize grain yield and biomass in areas with lower precipitation zhang et al 2018 thus the differences in the grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits in areas with different amounts of precipitation were effectively reduced under rfrh figs 9 11 13 compared with ck the effect of rfrh at increasing the grain yield was more obvious in areas with more limited precipitation resources wang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the precipitation was significantly lower in the northwest of the loess plateau region than the southeast and thus the northwest of the region was less favorable for maize production therefore the grain yield under ck was generally low in the northwest of the loess plateau rfrh planting helped to address this problem and the increase in the grain yield in the northwest of the loess plateau region was significantly higher than that in the southeast fig 9 during agricultural development economic benefits are most important for farmers and the government and improved economic benefits are conducive to the promotion of new planting modes zhang et al 2019 2020 in the loess plateau region the use of rfrh was not recommended in eight counties fig s6b because the net income was lower under rfrh than ck in these areas or it could not improve the economic benefits compared with ck we also found that the net income in 32 counties fig s6c was lower under rfrh than the average net income under ck in the whole loess plateau area 6090 yuan ha 1 and the grain yield in 29 counties fig s6a was lower under rfrh than the average grain yield under ck in the whole loess plateau area 5499 kg ha 1 in addition the maize grain yield and economic benefits in these counties were low regardless of whether ck or rfrh was applied possibly because the basic conditions in these counties did not meet the requirements for maize growth wang et al 2016 han et al 2014 for example some counties received too little precipitation the rainfall during the maize growth period was less than 200 mm fig 2a while some were located in cold and dry high altitude areas with low accumulated temperature amounts 2000 c and the soil clay content was also low in many counties 10 fig s5d the maize grain yield is positively related to the soil clay content zhang et al 2018 thus rfrh could not effectively improve the maize grain yield in these counties zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2012b therefore we suggest that other food or cash crops should be planted in these counties to increase economic incomes finally although rfrh can generally increase the incomes of farmers it may also lead to environmental pollution because the long term application of plastic film mulching can cause soil degradation and white pollution steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016 therefore in order to obtain economic benefits and ensure the sustainable development of agriculture we propose the use of new materials such as biodegradable film instead of traditional plastic film 4 3 limitations and future work we acknowledge that this study had several limitations first some errors may occurre during the model correction and validation process because different maize varieties were actually used therefore this may have affected the model simulations second xu et al 2019 pointed out that the ratio of base fertilizer relative to topdressing fertilizer and the fertilization frequency are becoming increasingly important for various crop types throughout the world in addition there are obvious temporal and spatial differences in the types of fertilizer used in actual agricultural production of different regions nishina et al 2017 in the present study the fertilization management in all counties in the loess plateau region was set as one application before sowing and the fertilization methods and types that are suitable for local crop growth were not set according to the local soil properties and meteorological conditions which may had led to differences between the simulation results and the actual values obtained from local production third the model failed to capture the detailed phenology in the early stage of crop growth han et al 2014 which may have resulted in some errors in the simulation results fourth there are clearly differences in topography in the loess plateau region and the altitude is not consistent in different counties thus differences in climate between the mountain and plain areas might have been ignored in the simulation thereby affecting the final simulation results therefore in future research we suggest that a variety of models should be used in joint simulations and comparative analyses to obtain more reliable benchmark settings and simulation results tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the impacts of climate change and agricultural management on the crop yield and water use efficiency still require further research mohammadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 in particular studies need to investigate how to save water and improve the water use efficiency in many important crop producing areas of china further research should focus on combining tillage methods such as rfrh or straw incorporation with the optimal planting density fertilization and irrigation methods in addition to determining crop yield and water use efficiency we should investigate the nh3 volatilization greenhouse gas emissions mineral nitrogen leaching and crop nutrient use efficiency therefore we can explore whether agricultural management measures can effectively reduce environmental pollution and waste of resources while still increasing production so in the future research we should not only improve grain yield and economic benefits but also ensure environmental security and achieve the sustainable development of agriculture 5 conclusion in most areas of the loess plateau the rfrh system can effectively improve and stabilize the maize grain yield biomass harvest index precipitation utilization efficiency and economic benefits the capacity of rfrh to increase the grain yield and economic benefits in years with differences in precipitation follows the order of dry year normal year wet year rfrh can cope well with interannual changes in precipitation the potential for increasing the maize grain yield and economic benefits under rfrh is significantly higher in the arid and rainless areas of the northwest loess plateau region than the areas in the southeast with better rainfall resources rfrh cannot effectively increase the yield in areas where the accumulated temperature is too low or the rainfall is insufficient to meet the normal requirements for maize growth we suggest that rfrh should preferably be used in the semiarid area of the northwest loess plateau region with low precipitation declaration of

9741,the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system is considered an effective strategy for improving crop productivity and it has been adopted increasingly in the arid and semiarid rainfed agricultural areas of china however how rfrh performs at improving the crop productivity and the economic benefits of long term implementation are not known in different counties and conditions in the loess plateau region therefore rfrh and traditional planting method ck experiments were carried out by us under five different hydrothermal conditions in the loess plateau for many years the denitrification decomposition dndc model was corrected and verified by field test data then the performance of rfrh and ck in time from 1990 to 2019 three test points and space 387 counties 112 000 km 2 grain crop planting area was simulated the results showed that from 1990 to 2019 the maize yield was 9200 11 395 kg ha 1 under rfrh and 1433 11 326 kg ha 1 under ck the interannual variation in the maize yield was small under rfrh and it significantly improved the maize yield in dry years 87 0 higher than ck in addition rfrh effectively stabilized and improved the maize biomass increased by 26 9 harvest index increased by 24 3 and economic benefits increased by 63 4 in the whole loess plateau region compared with ck the average grain yield under rfrh increased by 86 and the average net income increased by 133 the capacity of rfrh to increase the economic benefits in the loess plateau regions followed the order of northwest region northeast region southwest region southeast region rfrh can improve and stabilize the maize yield but also enhance the economic benefits of maize production in this region therefore rfrh can be used as an important technique for coping with years when different amounts of precipitation occur in the loess plateau region but especially in the northwest where the precipitation is limited keywords ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrh precipitation utilization efficiency crop productivity economic benefits dryland agriculture 1 introduction the loess plateau 100 114 e 33 42 n is the main dryland agricultural region in china fig 1 where the grain yield accounts for 9 1 of the total production in china zheng et al 2021 maize is the main grain crop produced in this area zhang et al 2019 the loess plateau is rich in light resources with annual radiation of 50 2 67 0 104 j cm 2 and the crop yield potential is high zhang et al 2019 however the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation in this area is uneven which is mainly manifested in more precipitation in the southeast less precipitation in the northwest and very high precipitation variability in season and in the year zhang et al 2020 in addition the temperature is generally low during the spring dong et al 2019 and the natural precipitation period is not consistent with the crop water demand period liu et al 2020 thereby resulting in low grain yields indeed the grain yield cannot even meet the needs of the local population in some counties in the loess plateau region zhang et al 2018 therefore developing dryland farming and water saving agriculture techniques to improve crop the water use efficiency are important for enhancing the crop yield in this region chen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system used in dryland agriculture has attracted global attention because of its advantages for collecting rainfall and increasing infiltration jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 previous studies have shown that rfrh can improve the yield and resource use efficiency by changing the crop phenology li et al 2017 increasing the leaf chlorophyll content zhang et al 2019 rubpcase activity and photosynthetic rate hou et al 2015 and promoting the absorption of water and nutrients via the roots wang and xing 2016 jia et al 2018 mohammadi et al 2019 however the effects of rfrh are readily influenced by the climate soil conditions and management measures dong et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 and they vary greatly among the different regions of china zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 clearly due to limitations in terms of human and material resources it is difficult to conduct field experiments in different counties throughout an entire study region at the same time therefore a process based model is considered a better option for exploring the effects of rfrh in the loess plateau region in detail han et al 2014 the denitrification decomposition dndc model is a biogeochemical model that considers the carbon and nitrogen in an agroecosystem based on a process mechanism this model is one of the most important for studying the effects of the interactions among the climate soil conditions and field management measures on crop growth dutta et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the model has been verified in many countries throughout the world and it has been used widely deng et al 2018 mohammadi et al 2019 banger et al 2020 moreover the model obtains good simulations of rfrh experiments han et al 2014 and thus it can be used to simulate the effects of rfrh on maize growth in the loess plateau region several studies have evaluated the crop yield under plastic mulching in the loess plateau region using the dndc model zhang et al 2018 however the long term historical effects of the rfrh system on the maize yield biomass harvest index precipitation use efficiency pue economic benefits and their spatial differences have not been determined for the different counties in the loess plateau region the hypotheses of this study were 1 rfrh can have a good performance of increasing yield and efficiency in years with different amounts of precipitation under long term historical conditions 2 rfrh can improve maize productivity and economic benefits in different counties in the loess plateau region therefore we corrected the dndc model using experimental observation data the maize yield and biomass under rfrh and traditional flat planting ck were simulated with the dndc model and the crop productivity and economic benefits were studied the aims of this study was to evaluate the temporal and spatial applicability of rfrh in the loess plateau and to provide a theoretical basis for the popularization and application of rfrh in the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the loess plateau region of northwest china fig 1 which is the main grain producing region in china chen et al 2015 the loess plateau region includes 387 counties these counties are mainly distributed in seven provinces and autonomous regions such as qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi and henan the loess plateau covers an area of about 640 000 km2 sun et al 2019 with altitudes ranging from 12 to 5232 m fig 1 the loess plateau region has a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate which is affected by the latitude and topography the precipitation levels are low on the loess plateau the mean annual precipitation from 1990 to 2019 was 144 946 mm fig 2c and only 13 of the area had annual precipitation exceeding 600 mm these areas are mainly distributed in the southeast of the loess plateau the general precipitation trend in the loess plateau region decreases from the southeast to northwest fig 2 the precipitation in this region is characterized by an uneven annual distribution and high variability zhang et al 2012a 2 2 experimental design and field management these experiments were conducted

of the ridge or furrow was 60 cm the height of the ridge was 15 cm the ridge was covered with plastic film and the furrow was exposed fig 3a and 2 traditional flat planting ck as the control treatment

the experiment the amount of fertilizer applied in the field and the organic carbon and nutrient contents of the topsoil before the experiment are shown in table 1 the slope of the cultivated land in the loess plateau region was set to 0 to simulate flat fields as the management practice zhang et al 2018 the amount of fertilizer n applied in the model simulation conducted in the present study was the same as the average amount of fertilizer n applied in eastern china i e 180 kg n ha 1 zhao et al 2016 the other simulation parameters are shown in table 2 2 3 field measurement of biomass and

study we considered the loess plateau region as the research area each county in the loess plateau region was treated as a basic research unit to build a regional simulation database that is the

pengyang yangling and changwu were selected the distance between each meteorological station and the experimental site was less than 10 km and the amounts of precipitation in each year from 1990 to 2019 were statistically analyzed during the study period considered the precipitation differed significantly at each experimental station fig 4a c the mean annual precipitation amounts at pengyang changwu and yangling were 457 9 mm 586 1 mm and 579 5 mm respectively with 391 8 mm 473 4 mm and 460 4 mm in the maize growth period and 63 8 mm 110 4 mm and 117 3 mm in the fallow period the mean annual precipitation precipitation in the maize growth period and precipitation in the fallow period followed the order of changwu yangling pengyang the precipitation amounts were used to calculate the drought index di for each experimental site with eq 6 fig 4d according to the classification standard for precipitation in different years guo et al 2012 the years in the period from 1990 to 2019 were divided into wet normal and dry years the statistical results showed that the probability of dry years differed significantly at the three stations fig 4e i e 50 at pengyang 40 at changwu and 33

yield and biomass based on simulations of the different planting modes rfrh and ck the simulated and the actual measured maize yield fig 5a and biomass fig 5c at each experimental site were compared the results showed that the simulated values were the same as the measured values a highly significant correlation was obtained between the simulated and measured maize yields r 0 59 p 0 01 a significant correlation was found between the simulated and measured biomass results r 0 40 p 0 05 for the maize yield and biomass the rmse mae and bias values were 1872 kg ha 1 and 4113 kg ha 1 1576 kg ha 1 and 3495 kg ha 1 and 389 kg ha 1 and 373 kg ha 1 respectively fig 5b and d thus the verification results demonstrated that the dndc model could simulate the maize yield and biomass under ck and rfrh in the loess plateau region however differences in the maize varieties planted and climate and soil coarse resolution data could lead to errors in the simulations of the model considering these factors the overall performance of the model was high when the simulated values were compared with the measured values the rmse mae and bias results obtained in the present study are similar to those reported in a previous study zhang et al 2018 and some large scale investigations in china qiao et al 2014 chen et al 2016 tang et al 2021 therefore the dndc model performed well for the loess plateau region and the accuracy of the simulations was reasonable and thus it was considered suitable for studying the effects of rfrh on maize growth in this region 3 2 changes in maize yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits from 1990 to 2019 the maize yield and biomass fig 6a c at pengyang yangling and changwu during 1990 2019 were simulated using the dndc model and the harvest index fig 6d pue table 3 fig 7 and economic benefits table 4 fig 8 were calculated the results showed that rfrh significantly increased the grain yield by 54 0 compared with ck p 0 01 from 1990 2019 the average grain yield under rfrh and ck was 11 089 kg ha 1 and 7202 kg ha 1 respectively the grain yield under rfrh fluctuated little during 1990 2019 from 1990 2019 the grain yield under rfrh varied from 9200 to 11 395 kg ha 1 by contrast the grain yield fluctuated greatly under ck from 1990 2019 the grain yield under ck varied from 1433 to 11 326 kg ha 1 rfrh significantly increased the total maize biomass by 26 9 compared with ck p 0 01 from 1990 to 2019 the average biomass under rfrh and ck was 22 342 kg ha 1 and 17 604 kg ha 1 respectively the range of fluctuations in the maize biomass was small under rfrh from 1990 to 2019 the biomass under rfrh was 22 149 22 633 kg ha 1 by contrast the biomass fluctuated greatly under ck from 1990 2019 the biomass varied from 7655 to 22 613 kg ha 1 rfrh significantly increased the maize harvest index by 24 3 compared with ck p 0 01 from 1990 2019 the average harvest index under rfrh and ck was 49 6 and 39 9 respectively from 1990 to 2019 the variation in the maize harvest index was small under rfrh where the harvest index was 44 7 50 5 by contrast the harvest index fluctuated greatly under ck the harvest index varied from 15 6 to 56 1 during 1990 2019 the average pue values did not differ significantly under rfrh and ck at the three experimental sites p 0 05 the pue value fluctuated little under rfrh where it varied among 8 3 29 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 from 1990 to 2019 by contrast the pue value fluctuated greatly under ck the pue value varied between 5 3 and 37 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 from 1990 to 2019 the agricultural input cost under rfrh was 28 8 1700 yuan ha 1 higher than that under ck table 5 however although the agricultural input cost was higher the economic benefits were still greater under rfrh than ck rfrh effectively stabilized and improved the economic benefits of maize production table 4 fig 8 the output net income and output input ratio fluctuated little under rfrh from 1990 2019 the output net income and output input ratio under rfrh were 19 764 24 139 yuan ha 1 12 159 16 534 yuan ha 1 and 2 59 3 17 respectively by contrast the output net income and output input ratio fluctuated greatly under ck from 1990 2019 the output net income and output input ratio were 3794 24 000 yuan ha 1 2111 to 18095 yuan ha 1 and 0 64 4 06 respectively in addition we found that the effects of rfrh on the maize yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits differed significantly among years with different amounts of precipitation in the order of wet year normal year dry year table s1 table 4 in the wet normal and dry years compared with ck rfrh increased the maize yield by 44 53 and 87 respectively the biomass by 22 25 and 39 the harvest index by 18 21 and 36 the output by 41 49 and 80 the net income by 54 68 and 133 and the output input ratio by 10 16 and 40 3 3 spatial performance in terms of maize yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits the precipitation varied greatly among the different regions in the loess plateau area fig 2 the amounts of precipitation in the maize growth period 127 8 775 7 mm fallow period 16 0 192 7 mm and annual precipitation 144 0 946 2 mm were consistent over the whole loess plateau area where they tended to decrease from the southeast to northwest fig 2a c according to the elevation of the loess plateau shown in fig 1 the terrain is higher in the southwest especially in qinghai province where the average altitude is higher than 3000 m and the annual average temperature is lower than 7 c in this cold plateau area fig s4 the results showed that the grain yield fig 9 biomass fig 10 and harvest index fig 11 were generally higher under rfrh in the different counties in the loess plateau region the average grain yield biomass and harvest index under rfrh in the 387 counties were 10 239 kg ha 1 21 295 kg ha 1 and 47 respectively the grain yields in 92 of the counties exceeded 6000 kg ha 1 by contrast the maize grain yield biomass and harvest index were relatively low under ck the average grain yield biomass and harvest index under ck in the 387 counties were 5499 kg ha 1 13 794 kg ha 1 and 41 respectively the grain yield biomass and harvest index under rfrh fluctuated little in the 387 counties in the loess plateau region the ranges of the grain yield biomass and harvest index under rfrh in the loess plateau region were 1592 11 558 kg ha 1 10 800 22 578 kg ha 1 and 15 53 respectively by contrast the grain yield biomass and harvest index fluctuated greatly under ck the ranges of the grain yield biomass and harvest index under ck were 222 9523 kg ha 1 2487 20 207 kg ha 1 and 10 67 respectively we calculated the pue values fig 12 under the two maize planting modes in different counties in the loess plateau region and found that the pue values were generally higher under rfrh with an average pue of 16 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 and range of 1 9 37 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 the pue values were slightly lower under ck with an average of 14 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 and range of 0 5 34 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 we also calculated the economic benefits under the two planting modes fig 13 table 5 in each county in the loess plateau region and found that the economic benefits were generally higher under rfrh with average output net income and output input ratio values of 21 805 yuan ha 1 14 200 yuan ha 1 and 2 87 respectively and ranges of 4290 24 406 yuan ha 1 3314 16801 yuan ha 1 and 0 97 3 21 the economic benefits were lower under ck where the average output net income and output input ratio values were 11 995 yuan ha 1 6090 yuan ha 1 and 2 03 respectively and the ranges were 716 20 329 yuan ha 1 5188 to 14 424 yuan ha 1 and 0 12 3 44 the grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits under rfrh and ck exhibited similar spatial patterns in the loess plateau region where they gradually decreased from the southeast to northwest the spatial patterns in the grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits agreed with the spatial distribution of precipitation figs 2 9 10 and 11 compared with ck rfrh significantly increased the maize grain yield biomass harvest index pue output net income and output input ratio by 86 54 16 13 82 133 and 41 respectively and thus local farmers had higher yields and incomes the results showed that rfrh significantly increased the maize yield and biomass in 98 of the counties in the loess plateau region compared with ck thereby indicating that rfrh can significantly increase the maize grain yield and biomass in most areas our analysis of the economic benefits in the loess plateau region showed that rfrh significantly increased the net incomes in 96 of the counties p 0 01 the net income was negative in 8 3 of the counties under ck but in only 2 3 of the counties under rfrh in addition the number of counties which had net incomes 8000 9000 and 10 000 yuan ha 1 under rfrh was 222 295 and 303 more than that under ck respectively these results demonstrate that rfrh could improve the economic benefits of maize in most counties expand the area suitable for planting maize effectively reduce the impacts of regional differences in rainfall significantly reduce the amount of counties with negative net incomes and enhance the incomes of farmers 4 discussion 4 1 effects of changes in interannual precipitation on crop yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits the rfrh system can improve the maize yield but also utilize precipitation more effectively li et al 2012 chen et al 2014 li et al 2016b liu et al 2020 our results showed that the annual precipitation changed greatly from 1990 to 2019 the average precipitation was 876 mm in the year with the maximum precipitation in pengyang yangling and changwu and the average precipitation was 313 3 mm in the year with the minimum precipitation fig 4a c thus the maximum annual precipitation was 2 8 times of the minimum annual precipitation the grain yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits under ck were greatly affected by the changes in interannual precipitation the grain yield biomass harvest index output net income and output input ratio under ck in the year with the maximum precipitation were 1 9 1 4 1 5 1 8 2 1 and 3 4 times higher respectively compared with those in the year with the minimum precipitation figs 6 7 8 table 4 in addition these indexes decreased under ck as the annual precipitation decreased however the grain yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits were affected less by the interannual changes in precipitation under rfrh and these indexes did not differ significantly among years under rfrh dong et al 2019 obtained similar results when studying the effects of rfrh on wheat grain yield and biomass in different precipitation years this is mainly because rfrh effectively collects rainfall and increases its infiltration compared with ck zhou et al 2015 moreover rfrh can change the crop phenology li et al 2017 improve the leaf photosynthetic capacity wang et al 2015 promote root growth and the absorption of water and nutrients jia et al 2018 and increase the maize grain yield and pue wang and xing 2016 mohammadi et al 2019 in particular in years with low precipitation rfrh can effectively alleviate the impact of drought stress on maize growth zhang et al 2018 thereby obtaining a higher maize grain yield hou et al 2015 mohammadi et al 2019 therefore the changes in interannual precipitation had little effect on maize production under rfrh the average precipitation in the wet years in pengyang yangling and changwu during 1990 2019 was 29 higher than that in the normal years and 62 higher than that in the dry years in wet years the grain yield biomass harvest index output net income and output input ratio under ck were 5 3 2 5 2 3 4 9 8 0 and 4 8 higher respectively compared with those in normal years and 30 8 14 8 15 5 28 4 52 9 and 28 5 higher compared with those in dry years fig 6 however these indexes under rfrh differed little among normal wet and dry years fig 6 thus rfrh could maintain the normal growth of maize jia et al 2018 obtain higher grain yield and economic benefits among normal wet and dry years zhang et al 2019 we also found that there were no significant differences in the grain yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits between rfrh and ck where they were even lower compared with ck in some years when more precipitation occurred at the same experimental location thus for the agricultural management measures investigated in this study the capacity of rfrh to increase the grain yield is limited to an extent when the precipitation exceeds a certain amount improving the water use efficiency is essential for improving the crop productivity mohammadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 therefore on the basis of agricultural management measures in this study if combined with reasonable fertilization selecting suitable maize varieties for local planting optimizing the planting density and returning straw to the field it may further improve maize grain yield and pue li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 4 2 effects of regional differences in precipitation on crop yield biomass harvest index pue and economic benefits more fully utilizing natural precipitation is crucial for the success of dryland farming especially in areas without the condition of irrigation han et al 2014 the maize grain yield was positively correlated with precipitation fig 6f the results of li et al 2016a were similar to those of this study therefore improving the water use efficiency is important for enhancing the crop productivity in china fan et al 2012 the spatial distributions of the maize grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits in the loess plateau region were similar to that of the precipitation where the precipitation decreased gradually from the southeast to northwest figs 9 11 13 compared with ck rfrh significantly decreased the reductions in these indexes and it effectively reduced the influence of regional precipitation differences on maize growth this is mainly because rfrh has strong capacity at collecting and retain water zhou et al 2015 thereby significantly improving the water use efficiency in maize liu et al 2020 effectively saving water han et al 2014 to improve the maize grain yield and biomass in areas with lower precipitation zhang et al 2018 thus the differences in the grain yield biomass harvest index and economic benefits in areas with different amounts of precipitation were effectively reduced under rfrh figs 9 11 13 compared with ck the effect of rfrh at increasing the grain yield was more obvious in areas with more limited precipitation resources wang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the precipitation was significantly lower in the northwest of the loess plateau region than the southeast and thus the northwest of the region was less favorable for maize production therefore the grain yield under ck was generally low in the northwest of the loess plateau rfrh planting helped to address this problem and the increase in the grain yield in the northwest of the loess plateau region was significantly higher than that in the southeast fig 9 during agricultural development economic benefits are most important for farmers and the government and improved economic benefits are conducive to the promotion of new planting modes zhang et al 2019 2020 in the loess plateau region the use of rfrh was not recommended in eight counties fig s6b because the net income was lower under rfrh than ck in these areas or it could not improve the economic benefits compared with ck we also found that the net income in 32 counties fig s6c was lower under rfrh than the average net income under ck in the whole loess plateau area 6090 yuan ha 1 and the grain yield in 29 counties fig s6a was lower under rfrh than the average grain yield under ck in the whole loess plateau area 5499 kg ha 1 in addition the maize grain yield and economic benefits in these counties were low regardless of whether ck or rfrh was applied possibly because the basic conditions in these counties did not meet the requirements for maize growth wang et al 2016 han et al 2014 for example some counties received too little precipitation the rainfall during the maize growth period was less than 200 mm fig 2a while some were located in cold and dry high altitude areas with low accumulated temperature amounts 2000 c and the soil clay content was also low in many counties 10 fig s5d the maize grain yield is positively related to the soil clay content zhang et al 2018 thus rfrh could not effectively improve the maize grain yield in these counties zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2012b therefore we suggest that other food or cash crops should be planted in these counties to increase economic incomes finally although rfrh can generally increase the incomes of farmers it may also lead to environmental pollution because the long term application of plastic film mulching can cause soil degradation and white pollution steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016 therefore in order to obtain economic benefits and ensure the sustainable development of agriculture we propose the use of new materials such as biodegradable film instead of traditional plastic film 4 3 limitations and future work we acknowledge that this study had several limitations first some errors may occurre during the model correction and validation process because different maize varieties were actually used therefore this may have affected the model simulations second xu et al 2019 pointed out that the ratio of base fertilizer relative to topdressing fertilizer and the fertilization frequency are becoming increasingly important for various crop types throughout the world in addition there are obvious temporal and spatial differences in the types of fertilizer used in actual agricultural production of different regions nishina et al 2017 in the present study the fertilization management in all counties in the loess plateau region was set as one application before sowing and the fertilization methods and types that are suitable for local crop growth were not set according to the local soil properties and meteorological conditions which may had led to differences between the simulation results and the actual values obtained from local production third the model failed to capture the detailed phenology in the early stage of crop growth han et al 2014 which may have resulted in some errors in the simulation results fourth there are clearly differences in topography in the loess plateau region and the altitude is not consistent in different counties thus differences in climate between the mountain and plain areas might have been ignored in the simulation thereby affecting the final simulation results therefore in future research we suggest that a variety of models should be used in joint simulations and comparative analyses to obtain more reliable benchmark settings and simulation results tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the impacts of climate change and agricultural management on the crop yield and water use efficiency still require further research mohammadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 in particular studies need to investigate how to save water and improve the water use efficiency in many important crop producing areas of china further research should focus on combining tillage methods such as rfrh or straw incorporation with the optimal planting density fertilization and irrigation methods in addition to determining crop yield and water use efficiency we should investigate the nh3 volatilization greenhouse gas emissions mineral nitrogen leaching and crop nutrient use efficiency therefore we can explore whether agricultural management measures can effectively reduce environmental pollution and waste of resources while still increasing production so in the future research we should not only improve grain yield and economic benefits but also ensure environmental security and achieve the sustainable development of agriculture 5 conclusion in most areas of the loess plateau the rfrh system can effectively improve and stabilize the maize grain yield biomass harvest index precipitation utilization efficiency and economic benefits the capacity of rfrh to increase the grain yield and economic benefits in years with differences in precipitation follows the order of dry year normal year wet year rfrh can cope well with interannual changes in precipitation the potential for increasing the maize grain yield and economic benefits under rfrh is significantly higher in the arid and rainless areas of the northwest loess plateau region than the areas in the southeast with better rainfall resources rfrh cannot effectively increase the yield in areas where the accumulated temperature is too low or the rainfall is insufficient to meet the normal requirements for maize growth we suggest that rfrh should preferably be used in the semiarid area of the northwest loess plateau region with low precipitation declaration of

9742,in the context of global warming and human interventions the impact of climate on crop yield may change over time therefore assessing the dynamics of drought thresholds that trigger various maize yield losses is critical for food security under climate change to this end this study aims to assess the vulnerability of maize to drought stress in three provinces of northeast china heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces and to quantify the drought thresholds that cause different levels of maize yield loss a copula bayesian conditional probability bivariate model is constructed to combine drought conditions and maize yield results indicate that 1 for the whole study period 1980 2018 drought thresholds that induced different levels of maize yield reduction were significantly different in the three northeastern provinces of china on average the drought thresholds that induced 30 40 and 50 maize yield losses were 1 06 1 53 and 2 23 in the three provinces of northeast china 2 during the transition from mild to moderate and severe drought maize vulnerability in liaoning province gradually exceeded that of jilin and heilongjiang province 3 from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 the drought thresholds that triggered the same percentage of maize yield reduction increased in all three provinces suggesting a dramatically increasing trend in the vulnerability of maize yields to drought 4 the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration leading to increased drought severity were the main factors inducing drought threshold dynamics in both sub study periods the probabilistic assessment of the impact of drought on maize yield is expected to provide useful insights into the mitigation of drought and its effects under climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords crop yield vulnerability spei dynamic thresholds northeast china 1 introduction global climate change has become one of the most studied topics in recent decades due to its adverse impacts on social economy environment and biology ipcc 2014 climate change is increasing the frequency severity and duration of droughts in many regions of the world liu et al 2020 peng et al 2020 vogt et al 2021 over the past few decades droughts have caused significant impacts on the agricultural sector leading to food insecurity especially in developing countries chi et al 2020 randell et al 2021 despite significant research breakthroughs in the technology and crop yield potential food production and security remain highly dependent on weather and climate change as temperature and precipitation are key drivers of crop growth petritsch and hasenauer 2014 zou et al 2019 thus studying the response of crop yield to climate change is essential to ensure food security leng and hall 2019 feng et al 2019 as a result food security issues caused by extreme weather events such as drought have generated research and public interest in climate change analysis hameed et al 2019 guo et al 2019 fang et al 2019 cui et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 a number of studies have explored the effect of drought on crop yield liu et al 2018 marina et al 2019 leng and hall 2019 venkatappa et al 2021 the mechanism of crop yield reduction caused by drought has been explored based on the knowledge of crop physiology shah et al 2017 feng et al 2019 leng and hall 2019 temperature anomalies were found to cause crop yield changes during the growing season deryng et al 2014 high temperature can reduce production by shortening the growing season and destroying plant cells zampieri et al 2016 2018 in order to detect and quantify droughts the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 to account for the effects of both temperature and precipitation spei has been proved to be an effective drought indicator and been widely used in a range of studies e g liu et al 2018 maize is the crop with the largest planting area and yield in china tian et al 2019 the three provinces of northeast china heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces are an important commodity grain production base in which maize is one of the most important crops therefore the present study focuses on the investigation of drought impacts on maize yield in these three provinces the gar special report on drought 2021 states that while droughts may develop gradually over several months they can also trigger sudden and dramatic famines and subsequent food riots when a social tipping point is crossed vogt et al 2021 tipping points occur in nonlinear dynamic systems and the effects of droughts on the food system are highly nonlinear vogt et al 2021 it is critical to assess the tipping point of drought impacts on food systems namely to quantify drought thresholds that induce grain yield reduction some studies have analyzed drought thresholds and their effects on crops based on field experiments liu et al 2021 however few studies have explored and quantified through probabilistic statistics the drought thresholds that can cause different levels of food yield reduction at the provincial level probabilistic methods for comprehensive assessment of drought impacts on crop production are helpful to capture the multivariate characteristics of agricultural drought risk ribeiro et al 2019 it has been widely recognized that copula functions are becoming quite popular among multivariate analysis approaches e g lee et al 2013 li et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2019 the application of copula theory in agrometeorological research is also relatively new madadgar et al 2017 and bokusheva et al 2016 have recently modeled the joint distribution of agricultural crops and drought conditions with copula model the advantage of using copula in multivariate modeling is that the probability distributions of individual variables are not necessarily the same nelsen 1999 ribeiro et al 2019 existing studies have assessed grain yield reduction under different drought levels e g mild moderate severe and extreme drought but did not accurately quantify the drought thresholds that can cause dynamic food production losses the impact of climate on yields may vary over time due to global warming and related extremes and changes in agricultural practices trnka et al 2016 zipper et al 2016 feng et al 2021 accurate estimates of drought thresholds triggering corresponding food yield losses and their dynamics over different periods can help individuals and societies to appropriately predict these impacts and adjust agriculture practices to maximize agricultural yields therefore the purpose of this study is to assess the probability response of maize yield to drought conditions based on a copula bayesian framework in three provinces of northeast china a model of multivariate distribution is employed to jointly study the behavior of drought and maize yields the conditional probability distribution framework for maize yield loss under different drought conditions was then used to quantify the drought thresholds that induce different yield losses the main objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the vulnerability of maize yield in different provinces under drought stress at different periods 2 to quantify the drought thresholds inducing maize yield loss and their dynamics in different provinces 2 study area and data this study selects three provinces in northeast china 118 50 135 20 e 38 43 53 33 n as the research area which includes heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces covering an area of 7 87 105 km2 with complex topography of plains and mountains fig 1 located in the northernmost part of china this region is the country s largest granary the largest grain output and an important forestry base in china the changbai mountains the greater khingan mountains and the lesser khingan mountains are very important natural barriers for the ecosystem in northeast china in the three great plains sanjiang plain songnen plain and liaohe plain fertile and deep soil provides natural conditions suitable for growing crops several major rivers such as the songhua river the east liao river the west liao river and the yalu river all originate here in general the three northeastern provinces are of great economic and ecological value the northeast china is in a cold temperate mid temperate humid semi humid climatic zone with mean annual temperature ranging from 5 10 c and mean summer temperature ranging from 20 c to 25 c the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the region is uneven with the largest proportion of precipitation 60 occurring in july and september the annual precipitation ranges from 400 mm to 1000 mm but there are large differences in the spatial distribution of precipitation decreasing from southeast to northwest guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 due to its special geographical location the northeast region is severely influenced by climate disasters which makes the region become the most vulnerable drought prone region in china since 2001 economic losses due to drought related disasters in the region have amounted to rmb 890 million per year zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 in this study 68 meteorological stations 20 in liaoning province 23 in jilin province and 25 in heilongjiang province with 39 year precipitation and temperature data records 1980 2018 were downloaded from the national climate center china climate administration http data cma cn zhang et al 2009 these datasets have been processed with quality control by the national climate center and have a data missing rate of p 0 1 in this study the data of maize yield per unit area and effective irrigation at the provincial scale from 1980 to 2018 were collected from the statistical yearbook of three provinces in northeast china in this study maize yield data were de trended to minimize the impact of slow changing factors feng et al 2019 it was then averaged to the stage of the maize growing season in the three northeastern provinces to facilitate research and analysis 3 methods 3 1 drought index calculation in terms of meteorological drought indices the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at growing season from may to september average growing season of maize in the three northeastern provinces at scales of 5 spei5 during 1980 2018 is used in this study the detailed steps for the calculation of the spei are as follows first the monthly potential evapotranspiration were estimated based on the climate data precipitation and temperature using the method of thornthwaite 1948 for all stations during the study period vicente serrano et al 2010 second the difference between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was calculated to represent the monthly water balance finally the monthly water balance data for all stations were used to calculate the spei values at multiple time scales using the spei r package http cran r project org web packages spei the classification of drought based on spei is shown in table 1 3 2 copula bayesian probability statistical framework the copula function joe 1997 nelsen 1999 is defined as the multivariate distribution function c of two or more uniformly distributed variables in the interval 0 1 nelsen 1999 madadgar et al 2017 the corresponding joint distribution is expressed as follows 1 f x 1 x n x 1 x i x n c f x 1 x 1 f x i x i f x n x n c u 1 u i u n where c is the cumulative distribution function cdf of copula and f x i x i also denoted by u i is the non exceedance probability of x j i e the marginal distribution note that c joins the cdf of random variables i e u i while f x 1 x n joins the original random variables i e x i the flexible structure of copula in combining random variables i e x i with different types of marginal distributions i e u i is a unique feature that has inspired applications of copulas in hydrological research madadgar et al 2017 fang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in this study copula function is utilized to construct the joint probability distribution of maize yield and spei5 based on their dependency structure before the establishment of the joint distribution the marginal distribution of random variables should be identified the gamma distribution exponential exp distribution generalized pareto gp distribution generalized extreme value gev distribution weibull wbl distribution and normal distribution were applied to fit the marginal distribution of maize yield in the study the copula bayesian probabilistic evaluation framework used in this study is shown in fig 2 which consists of three main parts the fitting of marginal distributions the modelling of joint distributions and the calculation of conditional probability the bivariate statistical framework combines the drought information with maize yield series and provides a joint distribution to form a two dimensional probability space based on copula based joint distribution and conditional distribution formulas conditional probabilities corresponding to drought thresholds for maize yields below different percentiles 50th 60th and 70th percentile were calculated the corresponding expression is shown in eq 2 2 p y y x x p x x y y p x x c f x x f y y f x x c u v u the conditional probability of maize yield loss occurring under various drought scenarios can be calculated for a given yield reduction the probability of this maize yield reduction occurring as drought conditions increase will be infinitely close to 1 in this model the confidence level for the drought threshold for inducing a maize yield reduction is 0 8 meaning that when the conditional probability is larger than 0 8 the corresponding drought index value will be considered as the threshold for triggering this level of maize yield reduction the probability density function pdf of p y y x x can be inferred with the bayesian network as follows madadgar and moradkhani 2013 mazdiyasni et al 2017 3 f y x y x c f x x f y y f y y in which c u v c u v u v denotes the pdf of the copula function f x x and f y y are pdfs of the spei5 and detrended maize yield respectively once the conditional pdf f y x y x for a specific drought condition is computed from eq 3 the cumulative probability of a decline in maize yield to a particular threshold y y is given by the area under the curve f y x y x for y y 4 results 4 1 impact of drought on maize yield during the growing season fig 3a shows the variation of maize yield per unit area in the three provinces of northeast china during 1980 2018 in general during this period of time strong human interventions such as the improvement of agricultural practice investment and technological progress have led to a steady increase in maize yield nevertheless the trend of sharp decline and significant decline in maize yield were found during severe drought years as shown in the gray vertical shadow in fig 3 fig 3b and c respectively show the detrended maize yields time series and a comparison with spei5 over the period 1980 2018 it can be seen that maize yield also dramatically reduces during severe droughts climate yield relationship is usually evaluated using correlation coefficients troy et al 2015 feng et al 2021 for example feng et al 2021 showed that there is overall positive precipitation yield correlation in most countries in this study the correlation coefficients between detrended maize yield and the spei5 were computed to show the climate maize yield relationship of the three provinces in northeast china to further explore changes in climate yield relationship we divided the 39 year data into two periods including the first period from 1980 to 1999 and the recent period from 2000 to 2018 the results are shown in table 2 the correlation analysis shows that spei5 exhibits a strong correlation with the annual detrended maize yields see table 2 detrended maize yields of heilongjiang province and jilin province have the most and least correlation with the selected drought index table 2 which suggesting that maize yield in heilongjiang province may be easier to reduce under the influence of drought beyond that in two different sub periods the correlation between detrended maize yield and spei5 in liaoning province passed the 95 confidence test while detrended maize yield and spei5 in the other two provinces did not exceed the 95 confidence test 4 2 the marginal distribution and the joint distribution in the study gamma norm gev gp exp and wbl distributions were used to fit the detrended annual maize yield and the selected drought indicator spei in three provinces of northeast china quantitative k s test and root mean square error rmse fit tests were applied to select the best fit distribution the results are shown in table 4 copula functions e g student s t gaussian clayton gumbel and frank were used to find the joint probability distribution of the detrended annual maize yield and spei5 the joint probability distribution integrates drought condition and maize yield data based on their dependency structure in this study the type of copula function was selected by quantitative aic and bic and graphical goodness of fit tests the results are shown in table 3 table 4 and fig 4 4 3 verifying the reliability of the bivariate probabilistic framework for vulnerability assessment in the proposed probabilistic framework detrended maize yield was connected with growing season spei series spei5 to gain their joint distributions with the copula method then a collection of conditional probabilities eq 2 of maize yield reduction under multiple drought scenarios were estimated for maize yield vulnerability evaluation in northeast china given the complexity of the framework shown in fig 2 it is necessary to verify its reliability before conducting maize yield vulnerability analysis accurate modeling of the dependence of maize yield on water availability is the key of maize yield vulnerability assessment the reliability of the framework in this study was verified by comparing the pairwise observed values of maize yield spei5 with the estimated maize yield distribution based on different spei5 values fig 4 compares the estimated maize yield distribution with the observed annual detrended production for the three provinces in northeast china the conditional pdfs of the maize yield were computed using eq 3 each panel indicates where the observed annual detrended maize yields black dots locate within the estimated maize yield distribution the color of any pixel on the panel represents the probability density function pdf of the spei5 value the colors represent normalized probability density function at a given spei5 every column of a panel denotes the conditional pdf of the maize yield for a given spei value which is discretized in steps of 0 1 the probability density is normalized into an interval of 0 1 with 1 for the highest possibility and 0 for the lowest possibility as seen in all panels the majority of paired maize yield spei5 observations fall into the high density portion of the pdfs demonstrating an accurate simulation of the correlation between maize health and water availability therefore the proposed frame work is considered reliable for maize vulnerability assessment 4 4 the maize yield vulnerability to drought stress at various levels as demonstrated in section 4 3 we can generate probability distributions of detrended maize yields for different projected meteorological conditions based on the copula bayesian framework model the joint distributions of the detrended maize yield spei5 content were estimated in the three provinces of northeast china where maize yield values had a threshold conditional probability y y30th an expression of maize yield vulnerability assessed under preparatory meteorological stress x x30th the conditional probabilities of maize yield lower than different percentiles under different drought scenarios were quantified e g p y y30th 50th 2 x 0 5 when the probability of 0 8 is recognized to be reliable the conditional probabilities of maize yield losses under different drought levels were identified an additional consideration is the maize yield value at 0 5 0 4 and 0 3 quantiles which denote diverse levels of damage to the health of the agricultural system in ascending order the results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the loss of maize yield is increasing with the intensification of drought in the three provinces however as the stress is amplified the rate of loss gradually decreases as shown in the left column of fig 5 this study also finds that the conditional probabilities of maize yield losses in jilin province are significantly higher than that in liaoning and heilongjiang province under the influence of mild drought under moderate and severe drought conditions the conditional probabilities of maize yield reduction in liaoning province is higher than that in jilin province these results indicate that maize in jilin province has the highest vulnerability under mild drought while maize in liaoning province has the highest vulnerability under moderate and severe drought it is seen from panels at the second column in fig 5 middle that the conditional probabilities of drought induced maize yield reduction are the largest in jilin province indicating that jilin province is more susceptible to drought among the three provinces in northeast china during 1980 1999 the results illustrate that the maize in jilin province was the most vulnerable to drought during the study period in addition it can be seen from panels in fig 5 right column that in contrast the conditional probabilities of moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought resulting in maize yield losses during 2000 2018 are significantly higher than that of maize yield losses due to the same drought during 1980 1999 it is worth noting that the conditional probabilities of maize yield reduction caused by drought in liaoning province are significantly higher than that in the other two provinces fig 5c f and 5i this may be due to significant changes in meteorological conditions and irrigation conditions at different time periods in addition the above results indicate that the vulnerability of maize to drought is the strongest in liaoning province from 2000 to 2018 and the yield losses of maize are the largest under the influence of drought 4 5 drought thresholds triggering maize yield loss at various levels the results of the quantified drought thresholds corresponding to maize yield losses were considered plausible when the conditional probability was 0 8 on this basis the corresponding drought thresholds under different maize yield losses were quantified in the total study period and the two subperiods the results of the detailed estimates of the combination of drought conditions and maize yield losses in the three northeastern provinces were shown in fig 6 it can be seen that there are differences in thresholds of maize yield reduction caused by drought in the three provinces of northeast china maize yield losses under mild moderate severe and extreme drought conditions in heilongjiang province were 22 24 25 32 33 49 and 49 respectively fig 6a left extreme drought can even lead to crop failure hao and singh 2015 liu et al 2018 among them the drought threshold inducing 22 maize yield loss is 0 5 leading to 24 maize yield reduction is 1 0 resulting in 42 maize yield decline is 1 5 and causing 49 maize yield loss is 2 0 in heilongjiang province in contrast for jilin province the maize yield losses under slight moderate severe and severe drought varies in the range of 27 36 37 39 40 45 and 45 respectively fig 6a middle for the drought thresholds of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 it could lead to a reduction of maize yield by 27 37 40 and 45 in jilin province respectively in addition under the same drought conditions the average maize yield reductions are 23 6 29 3 39 0 and 55 respectively as drought increase in severity exaggerated probabilities of maize yield losses are expected which is the same case when the levels of maize yield decline are investigated in heilongjiang province compared to heilongjiang and jilin provinces under the same drought conditions maize yields in liaoning province fell by 22 28 29 46 47 71 and 71 when suffering from mild moderate severe and extreme drought respectively fig 6a right interestingly the conditional probabilities of maize yield losses under severe drought in liaoning province are significantly higher than that in jilin and heilongjiang provinces in addition for the whole study period from 1980 to 2018 the drought threshold leading to the average maize yield reduction of 32 in heilongjiang province is 1 5 the drought threshold inducing the average maize yield loss of 36 in jilin province is 1 0 and the drought threshold triggering the average maize yield decline of 40 in liaoning province is 1 3 fig 6a in order to further compare the changes of drought thresholds leading to maize yield losses in different provinces at different periods the drought thresholds inducing maize yield reduction for the two periods 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 are shown in fig 6b and c it is shown that maize yield loss 20 22 in heilongjiang province does not change dramatically with the increase of drought intensity during 1980 1999 fig 6b left in contrast during 2000 2018 maize yield losses change relatively strong under different drought scenarios increasing from 23 to 72 fig 6 c left on average from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 when mild drought occurred the maize yield losses in heilongjiang province increased from 20 to 24 a 4 increase in losses similarly under moderate drought and severe drought maize yield in heilongjiang province increased by 15 and 39 respectively interestingly similar maize yield losses responses to drought were observed in jilin and liaoning provinces changing from 23 42 to 27 55 and from 18 25 to 28 82 respectively furthermore the conditional probability of maize yield loss in liaoning province jilin province increased by an average of 19 43 and 57 4 3 and 10 respectively from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 under mild moderate and severe drought respectively overall under various drought conditions e g spei5 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 maize yields in liaoning province were reduced by 22 28 46 and 71 with the conditional probability of 0 8 during the whole study period 1980 2018 while under the same conditions maize yields in jilin province were reduced by 27 36 39 and 45 respectively and in heilongjiang province by 22 24 32 and 49 from 1980 1999 2000 2018 under the same drought conditions the maize yield losses in liaoning province change from 18 19 22 and 25 28 47 76 and 82 respectively by contrast the maize yield reduction in heilongjiang province change from 20 21 22 and 22 in 1980 1999 23 25 49 and 72 in 2000 2018 respectively under the same drought conditions the maize yield losses in jilin province change from 23 30 38 and 42 27 35 41 and 55 respectively from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 in addition this study further analyses the characteristics of changes in drought thresholds in different periods using the thresholds of 30 40 and 50 reduction in maize yield due to drought as an example table 5 as can be seen from table 5 for the whole study period 1980 2018 drought thresholds inducing 30 40 50 maize yield reduction in heilongjiang province jilin province and liaoning province are 1 30 1 60 2 20 0 80 1 70 2 70 and 1 10 1 30 1 80 respectively on average drought thresholds inducing 30 40 and 50 maize yield losses in the three provinces of northeast china are 1 06 1 53 and 2 23 during 1980 2018 in contrast from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 drought thresholds resulting in 30 40 50 maize yield losses increase by 0 16 0 65 2 16 0 16 0 41 0 96 and 0 6 1 13 2 37 respectively in heilongjiang province jilin province and liaoning province these results indicate that from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 the same magnitude of drought results in different degrees of maize yield reduction in different provinces increasing the risk of agricultural drought and the need for the agricultural sector to take measures to address and mitigate drought risks combining the information in figs 5 and 6 and table 5 maize in jilin province is the most sensitive to drought i e when mild drought occurs the conditional probability of yield loss is highest and losses in jilin province are considerable however with the intensification of drought the conditional probabilities of maize yield reduction and the maize yield losses increase significantly in liaoning and heilongjiang provinces it is worth noting that under the same drought stress maize yield losses in the three northeastern provinces increased significantly from 2000 to 2018 compared to 1980 1999 understanding the vulnerability of farmland ecosystem in the three northeastern provinces can help in effective drought prevention and risk management 5 discussion 5 1 changes of meteorological factors and irrigation conditions in three northeastern provinces to understand the reasons for the different maize yield losses under the influence of drought in different provinces of the northeast china precipitation p evapotranspiration e the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration p e in different periods and the aridity index ai ai is defined by the ratio of precipitation p to reference crop evapotranspiration et0 unep 1992 and is considered an important indicator of climate regionalization it is widely used in modern climatology to evaluate aridity fu and feng 2014 zhao et al 2019 the mean changes of these indexes were analyzed to explore the aridity table 6 and the effective irrigation efficiency eie to analyze irrigation conditions fig 7 by comparing the mean of p the mean of difference between p and e and the mean of ai in the growing season at different periods 1980 2018 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 it is found that 1 in any study period heilongjiang province has the highest degree of dryness followed by jilin province and liaoning province has the lowest degree of dryness 2 from 1980 1999 to 2000 2018 dry and wet conditions in the three provinces tend to become drier 3 more importantly it is also found that drought conditions in heilongjiang and liaoning provinces are more severe than that in jilin province during 2000 2018 which may explain the reason why the threshold values of drought inducing maize yield losses in liaoning and heilongjiang province are smaller than that in jilin province during the study period table 5 on average in the whole study period 1980 2018 or the segmentation study period 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 the eie from high to low of the three provinces is liaoning jilin and heilongjiang fig 7 which illustrates that irrigation condition in liaoning province is the best followed by jilin province and the worst is heilongjiang province it suggests liaoning province has the greatest degree of water use and stability of agricultural production cao et al 2015 with a larger proportion of irrigated agriculture and heilongjiang province basically uses rain fed agriculture cao et al 2015 huang et al 2022 with maize growing condition in suboptimal environment previous studies have found that crop water use efficiency in developing countries performed better under drought than that in developed countries possibly because crops in developed countries tend to be grown under optimal conditions including adequate irrigation and advanced irrigation equipment bhargava and sawant 2013 yu et al 2021 under drought stress in order to adapt to the drought in suboptimal environment crops often respond by improving water use efficiency bhargava and sawant 2013 in terms of irrigation conditions maize in liaoning province had strong resistance to mild and moderate drought in contrast maize in heilongjiang province has been in a suboptimal environment for a long time and is more likely to cope with extreme drought fig 5 although liaoning province has the best irrigation condition among the three northeastern provinces it suffered the largest maize yield losses caused by droughts from 2000 to 2018 effective irrigation efficiency in liaoning province is good which is beneficial in the event of a mild drought but in the event of a severe drought there may not be enough irrigation to alleviate crop water shortages in time based on table 6 it can be seen that the main reason for the reduction in maize yields is the change in meteorological factors 5 2 analysis of drought characteristics of three provinces in northeast china in order to further explore the causes of the changes of drought threshold inducing maize yield losses in different periods 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 this study identifies the changes of the characteristics of the frequency mean duration and mean severity of drought events by means of run theory method wu et al 2020 in two study periods of the three provinces in northeast china table 7 it can be seen from table 7 that except for jilin province the number of drought events decreased in the other two provinces furthermore from 1980 t to 1999 to 2000 2018 the severity of drought increase in all three provinces and the drought duration increase in the other two provinces except heilongjiang province drought conditions are aggravated in the three provinces which is consistent with the results in table 6 indicating that the decrease in precipitation and the increase in evapotranspiration lead to the more severe droughts in 2000 2018 which in turn leads to the greater losses of maize yield according to the information in figs 5 7 and tables 5 7 these results indicate that irrigation conditions in liaoning province are better and there is sufficient water supply to cope with drought stress however as the drought continues to become moderate or even severe there will not be enough irrigation water to meet the water shortage for maize growth which could lead to greater yield losses maize in heilongjiang province has been in a relatively dry environment and is therefore sensitive to drought and responds strongly in the early stages of drought bhargava and sawant 2013 cao et al 2015 yu et al 2021 however with the onset and development of moderate and severe drought maize in heilongjiang province has better drought resistance than maize in liaoning province where irrigation conditions are better it is worth noting that the aridity in heilongjiang province is slightly stronger than that of liaoning province and jilin province on average among the three provinces liaoning province has the best irrigation conditions these results demonstrate that drought adaptation or acclimation of crops in suboptimal environment may improve water use efficiency under drought stress yu et al 2021 thereby enhancing their drought resistance fernando et al 2020 6 conclusions based on the copula bayesian probability assessment theory this study developed a bivariate probabilistic framework which facilitates the quantification of crop vulnerability to drought stress at multiple levels and the identification of drought vulnerable farmland ecosystems in a more informative way in the proposed framework drought conditions are characterized by the spei which can be flexibly replaced by any other yield related climate variable as part of an effort to understand the control of different climate extremes on the health of farmland ecosystems in the agricultural regions of the world in addition the study quantified the drought thresholds that induce various maize yield losses in three northeastern provinces of china the results of the study can help investors and farmers to provide effective water regimes based on regional drought thresholds at different drought occurrences thereby enabling precision irrigation mitigating the adverse effects of drought on crops reducing waste of agricultural water resources and improving irrigation efficiency for farmers furthermore the results can also support the development of drought tolerant maize varieties based on drought thresholds that are better suitable to local climate

9742,in the context of global warming and human interventions the impact of climate on crop yield may change over time therefore assessing the dynamics of drought thresholds that trigger various maize yield losses is critical for food security under climate change to this end this study aims to assess the vulnerability of maize to drought stress in three provinces of northeast china heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces and to quantify the drought thresholds that cause different levels of maize yield loss a copula bayesian conditional probability bivariate model is constructed to combine drought conditions and maize yield results indicate that 1 for the whole study period 1980 2018 drought thresholds that induced different levels of maize yield reduction were significantly different in the three northeastern provinces of china on average the drought thresholds that induced 30 40 and 50 maize yield losses were 1 06 1 53 and 2 23 in the three provinces of northeast china 2 during the transition from mild to moderate and severe drought maize vulnerability in liaoning province gradually exceeded that of jilin and heilongjiang province 3 from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 the drought thresholds that triggered the same percentage of maize yield reduction increased in all three provinces suggesting a dramatically increasing trend in the vulnerability of maize yields to drought 4 the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration leading to increased drought severity were the main factors inducing drought threshold dynamics in both sub study periods the probabilistic assessment of the impact of drought on maize yield is expected to provide useful insights into the mitigation of drought and its effects under climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords crop yield vulnerability spei dynamic thresholds northeast china 1 introduction global climate change has become one of the most studied topics in recent decades due to its adverse impacts on social economy environment and biology ipcc 2014 climate change is increasing the frequency severity and duration of droughts in many regions of the world liu et al 2020 peng et al 2020 vogt et al 2021 over the past few decades droughts have caused significant impacts on the agricultural sector leading to food insecurity especially in developing countries chi et al 2020 randell et al 2021 despite significant research breakthroughs in the technology and crop yield potential food production and security remain highly dependent on weather and climate change as temperature and precipitation are key drivers of crop growth petritsch and hasenauer 2014 zou et al 2019 thus studying the response of crop yield to climate change is essential to ensure food security leng and hall 2019 feng et al 2019 as a result food security issues caused by extreme weather events such as drought have generated research and public interest in climate change analysis hameed et al 2019 guo et al 2019 fang et al 2019 cui et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 a number of studies have explored the effect of drought on crop yield liu et al 2018 marina et al 2019 leng and hall 2019 venkatappa et al 2021 the mechanism of crop yield reduction caused by drought has been explored based on the knowledge of crop physiology shah et al 2017 feng et al 2019 leng and hall 2019 temperature anomalies were found to cause crop yield changes during the growing season deryng et al 2014 high temperature can reduce production by shortening the growing season and destroying plant cells zampieri et al 2016 2018 in order to detect and quantify droughts the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 to account for the effects of both temperature and precipitation spei has been proved to be an effective drought indicator and been widely used in a range of studies e g liu et al 2018 maize is the crop with the largest planting area and yield in china tian et al 2019 the three provinces of northeast china heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces are an important commodity grain production base in which maize is one of the most important crops therefore the present study focuses on the investigation of drought impacts on maize yield in these three provinces the gar special report on drought 2021 states that while droughts may develop gradually over several months they can also trigger sudden and dramatic famines and subsequent food riots when a social tipping point is crossed vogt et al 2021 tipping points occur in nonlinear dynamic systems and the effects of droughts on the food system are highly nonlinear vogt et al 2021 it is critical to assess the tipping point of drought impacts on food systems namely to quantify drought thresholds that induce grain yield reduction some studies have analyzed drought thresholds and their effects on crops based on field experiments liu et al 2021 however few studies have explored and quantified through probabilistic statistics the drought thresholds that can cause different levels of food yield reduction at the provincial level probabilistic methods for comprehensive assessment of drought impacts on crop production are helpful to capture the multivariate characteristics of agricultural drought risk ribeiro et al 2019 it has been widely recognized that copula functions are becoming quite popular among multivariate analysis approaches e g lee et al 2013 li et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2019 the application of copula theory in agrometeorological research is also relatively new madadgar et al 2017 and bokusheva et al 2016 have recently modeled the joint distribution of agricultural crops and drought conditions with copula model the advantage of using copula in multivariate modeling is that the probability distributions of individual variables are not necessarily the same nelsen 1999 ribeiro et al 2019 existing studies have assessed grain yield reduction under different drought levels e g mild moderate severe and extreme drought but did not accurately quantify the drought thresholds that can cause dynamic food production losses the impact of climate on yields may vary over time due to global warming and related extremes and changes in agricultural practices trnka et al 2016 zipper et al 2016 feng et al 2021 accurate estimates of drought thresholds triggering corresponding food yield losses and their dynamics over different periods can help individuals and societies to appropriately predict these impacts and adjust agriculture practices to maximize agricultural yields therefore the purpose of this study is to assess the probability response of maize yield to drought conditions based on a copula bayesian framework in three provinces of northeast china a model of multivariate distribution is employed to jointly study the behavior of drought and maize yields the conditional probability distribution framework for maize yield loss under different drought conditions was then used to quantify the drought thresholds that induce different yield losses the main objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the vulnerability of maize yield in different provinces under drought stress at different periods 2 to quantify the drought thresholds inducing maize yield loss and their dynamics in different provinces 2 study area and data this study selects three provinces in northeast china 118 50 135 20 e 38 43 53 33 n as the research area which includes heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces covering an area of 7 87 105 km2 with complex topography of plains and mountains fig 1 located in the northernmost part of china this region is the country s largest granary the largest grain output and an important forestry base in china the changbai mountains the greater khingan mountains and the lesser khingan mountains are very important natural barriers for the ecosystem in northeast china in the three great plains sanjiang plain songnen plain and liaohe plain fertile and deep soil provides natural conditions suitable for growing crops several major rivers such as the songhua river the east liao river the west liao river and the yalu river all originate here in general the three northeastern provinces are of great economic and ecological value the northeast china is in a cold temperate mid temperate humid semi humid climatic zone with mean annual temperature ranging from 5 10 c and mean summer temperature ranging from 20 c to 25 c the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the region is uneven with the largest proportion of precipitation 60 occurring in july and september the annual precipitation ranges from 400 mm to 1000 mm but there are large differences in the spatial distribution of precipitation decreasing from southeast to northwest guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 due to its special geographical location the northeast region is severely influenced by climate disasters which makes the region become the most vulnerable drought prone region in china since 2001 economic losses due to drought related disasters in the region have amounted to rmb 890 million per year zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 in this study 68 meteorological stations 20 in liaoning province 23 in jilin province and 25 in heilongjiang province with 39 year precipitation and temperature data records 1980 2018 were downloaded from the national climate center china climate administration http data cma cn zhang et al 2009 these datasets have been processed with quality control by the national climate center and have a data missing rate of p 0 1 in this study the data of maize yield per unit area and effective irrigation at the provincial scale from 1980 to 2018 were collected from the statistical yearbook of three provinces in northeast china in this study maize yield data were de trended to minimize the impact of slow changing factors feng et al 2019 it was then averaged to the stage of the maize growing season in the three northeastern provinces to facilitate research and analysis 3 methods 3 1 drought index calculation in terms of meteorological drought indices the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at growing season from may to september average growing season of maize in the three northeastern provinces at scales of 5 spei5 during 1980 2018 is used in this study the detailed steps for the calculation of the spei are as follows first the monthly potential evapotranspiration were estimated based on the climate data precipitation and temperature using the method of thornthwaite 1948 for all stations during the study period vicente serrano et al 2010 second the difference between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was calculated to represent the monthly water balance finally the monthly water balance data for all stations were used to calculate the spei values at multiple time scales using the spei r package http cran r project org web packages spei the classification of drought based on spei is shown in table 1 3 2 copula bayesian probability statistical framework the copula function joe 1997 nelsen 1999 is defined as the multivariate distribution function c of two or more uniformly distributed variables in the interval 0 1 nelsen 1999 madadgar et al 2017 the corresponding joint distribution is expressed as follows 1 f x 1 x n x 1 x i x n c f x 1 x 1 f x i x i f x n x n c u 1 u i u n where c is the cumulative distribution function cdf of copula and f x i x i also denoted by u i is the non exceedance probability of x j i e the marginal distribution note that c joins the cdf of random variables i e u i while f x 1 x n joins the original random variables i e x i the flexible structure of copula in combining random variables i e x i with different types of marginal distributions i e u i is a unique feature that has inspired applications of copulas in hydrological research madadgar et al 2017 fang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in this study copula function is utilized to construct the joint probability distribution of maize yield and spei5 based on their dependency structure before the establishment of the joint distribution the marginal distribution of random variables should be identified the gamma distribution exponential exp distribution generalized pareto gp distribution generalized extreme value gev distribution weibull wbl distribution and normal distribution were applied to fit the marginal distribution of maize yield in the study the copula bayesian probabilistic evaluation framework used in this study is shown in fig 2 which consists of three main parts the fitting of marginal distributions the modelling of joint distributions and the calculation of conditional probability the bivariate statistical framework combines the drought information with maize yield series and provides a joint distribution to form a two dimensional probability space based on copula based joint distribution and conditional distribution formulas conditional probabilities corresponding to drought thresholds for maize yields below different percentiles 50th 60th and 70th percentile were calculated the corresponding expression is shown in eq 2 2 p y y x x p x x y y p x x c f x x f y y f x x c u v u the conditional probability of maize yield loss occurring under various drought scenarios can be calculated for a given yield reduction the probability of this maize yield reduction occurring as drought conditions increase will be infinitely close to 1 in this model the confidence level for the drought threshold for inducing a maize yield reduction is 0 8 meaning that when the conditional probability is larger than 0 8 the corresponding drought index value will be considered as the threshold for triggering this level of maize yield reduction the probability density function pdf of p y y x x can be inferred with the bayesian network as follows madadgar and moradkhani 2013 mazdiyasni et al 2017 3 f y x y x c f x x f y y f y y in which c u v c u v u v denotes the pdf of the copula function f x x and f y y are pdfs of the spei5 and detrended maize yield respectively once the conditional pdf f y x y x for a specific drought condition is computed from eq 3 the cumulative probability of a decline in maize yield to a particular threshold y y is given by the area under the curve f y x y x for y y 4 results 4 1 impact of drought on maize yield during the growing season fig 3a shows the variation of maize yield per unit area in the three provinces of northeast china during 1980 2018 in general during this period of time strong human interventions such as the improvement of agricultural practice investment and technological progress have led to a steady increase in maize yield nevertheless the trend of sharp decline and significant decline in maize yield were found during severe drought years as shown in the gray vertical shadow in fig 3 fig 3b and c respectively show the detrended maize yields time series and a comparison with spei5 over the period 1980 2018 it can be seen that maize yield also dramatically reduces during severe droughts climate yield relationship is usually evaluated using correlation coefficients troy et al 2015 feng et al 2021 for example feng et al 2021 showed that there is overall positive precipitation yield correlation in most countries in this study the correlation coefficients between detrended maize yield and the spei5 were computed to show the climate maize yield relationship of the three provinces in northeast china to further explore changes in climate yield relationship we divided the 39 year data into two periods including the first period from 1980 to 1999 and the recent period from 2000 to 2018 the results are shown in table 2 the correlation analysis shows that spei5 exhibits a strong correlation with the annual detrended maize yields see table 2 detrended maize yields of heilongjiang province and jilin province have the most and least correlation with the selected drought index table 2 which suggesting that maize yield in heilongjiang province may be easier to reduce under the influence of drought beyond that in two different sub periods the correlation between detrended maize yield and spei5 in liaoning province passed the 95 confidence test while detrended maize yield and spei5 in the other two provinces did not exceed the 95 confidence test 4 2 the marginal distribution and the joint distribution in the study gamma norm gev gp exp and wbl distributions were used to fit the detrended annual maize yield and the selected drought indicator spei in three provinces of northeast china quantitative k s test and root mean square error rmse fit tests were applied to select the best fit distribution the results are shown in table 4 copula functions e g student s t gaussian clayton gumbel and frank were used to find the joint probability distribution of the detrended annual maize yield and spei5 the joint probability distribution integrates drought condition and maize yield data based on their dependency structure in this study the type of copula function was selected by quantitative aic and bic and graphical goodness of fit tests the results are shown in table 3 table 4 and fig 4 4 3 verifying the reliability of the bivariate probabilistic framework for vulnerability assessment in the proposed probabilistic framework detrended maize yield was connected with growing season spei series spei5 to gain their joint distributions with the copula method then a collection of conditional probabilities eq 2 of maize yield reduction under multiple drought scenarios were estimated for maize yield vulnerability evaluation in northeast china given the complexity of the framework shown in fig 2 it is necessary to verify its reliability before conducting maize yield vulnerability analysis accurate modeling of the dependence of maize yield on water availability is the key of maize yield vulnerability assessment the reliability of the framework in this study was verified by comparing the pairwise observed values of maize yield spei5 with the estimated maize yield distribution based on different spei5 values fig 4 compares the estimated maize yield distribution with the observed annual detrended production for the three provinces in northeast china the conditional pdfs of the maize yield were computed using eq 3 each panel indicates where the observed annual detrended maize yields black dots locate within the estimated maize yield distribution the color of any pixel on the panel represents the probability density function pdf of the spei5 value the colors represent normalized probability density function at a given spei5 every column of a panel denotes the conditional pdf of the maize yield for a given spei value which is discretized in steps of 0 1 the probability density is normalized into an interval of 0 1 with 1 for the highest possibility and 0 for the lowest possibility as seen in all panels the majority of paired maize yield spei5 observations fall into the high density portion of the pdfs demonstrating an accurate simulation of the correlation between maize health and water availability therefore the proposed frame work is considered reliable for maize vulnerability assessment 4 4 the maize yield vulnerability to drought stress at various levels as demonstrated in section 4 3 we can generate probability distributions of detrended maize yields for different projected meteorological conditions based on the copula bayesian framework model the joint distributions of the detrended maize yield spei5 content were estimated in the three provinces of northeast china where maize yield values had a threshold conditional probability y y30th an expression of maize yield vulnerability assessed under preparatory meteorological stress x x30th the conditional probabilities of maize yield lower than different percentiles under different drought scenarios were quantified e g p y y30th 50th 2 x 0 5 when the probability of 0 8 is recognized to be reliable the conditional probabilities of maize yield losses under different drought levels were identified an additional consideration is the maize yield value at 0 5 0 4 and 0 3 quantiles which denote diverse levels of damage to the health of the agricultural system in ascending order the results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the loss of maize yield is increasing with the intensification of drought in the three provinces however as the stress is amplified the rate of loss gradually decreases as shown in the left column of fig 5 this study also finds that the conditional probabilities of maize yield losses in jilin province are significantly higher than that in liaoning and heilongjiang province under the influence of mild drought under moderate and severe drought conditions the conditional probabilities of maize yield reduction in liaoning province is higher than that in jilin province these results indicate that maize in jilin province has the highest vulnerability under mild drought while maize in liaoning province has the highest vulnerability under moderate and severe drought it is seen from panels at the second column in fig 5 middle that the conditional probabilities of drought induced maize yield reduction are the largest in jilin province indicating that jilin province is more susceptible to drought among the three provinces in northeast china during 1980 1999 the results illustrate that the maize in jilin province was the most vulnerable to drought during the study period in addition it can be seen from panels in fig 5 right column that in contrast the conditional probabilities of moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought resulting in maize yield losses during 2000 2018 are significantly higher than that of maize yield losses due to the same drought during 1980 1999 it is worth noting that the conditional probabilities of maize yield reduction caused by drought in liaoning province are significantly higher than that in the other two provinces fig 5c f and 5i this may be due to significant changes in meteorological conditions and irrigation conditions at different time periods in addition the above results indicate that the vulnerability of maize to drought is the strongest in liaoning province from 2000 to 2018 and the yield losses of maize are the largest under the influence of drought 4 5 drought thresholds triggering maize yield loss at various levels the results of the quantified drought thresholds corresponding to maize yield losses were considered plausible when the conditional probability was 0 8 on this basis the corresponding drought thresholds under different maize yield losses were quantified in the total study period and the two subperiods the results of the detailed estimates of the combination of drought conditions and maize yield losses in the three northeastern provinces were shown in fig 6 it can be seen that there are differences in thresholds of maize yield reduction caused by drought in the three provinces of northeast china maize yield losses under mild moderate severe and extreme drought conditions in heilongjiang province were 22 24 25 32 33 49 and 49 respectively fig 6a left extreme drought can even lead to crop failure hao and singh 2015 liu et al 2018 among them the drought threshold inducing 22 maize yield loss is 0 5 leading to 24 maize yield reduction is 1 0 resulting in 42 maize yield decline is 1 5 and causing 49 maize yield loss is 2 0 in heilongjiang province in contrast for jilin province the maize yield losses under slight moderate severe and severe drought varies in the range of 27 36 37 39 40 45 and 45 respectively fig 6a middle for the drought thresholds of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 it could lead to a reduction of maize yield by 27 37 40 and 45 in jilin province respectively in addition under the same drought conditions the average maize yield reductions are 23 6 29 3 39 0 and 55 respectively as drought increase in severity exaggerated probabilities of maize yield losses are expected which is the same case when the levels of maize yield decline are investigated in heilongjiang province compared to heilongjiang and jilin provinces under the same drought conditions maize yields in liaoning province fell by 22 28 29 46 47 71 and 71 when suffering from mild moderate severe and extreme drought respectively fig 6a right interestingly the conditional probabilities of maize yield losses under severe drought in liaoning province are significantly higher than that in jilin and heilongjiang provinces in addition for the whole study period from 1980 to 2018 the drought threshold leading to the average maize yield reduction of 32 in heilongjiang province is 1 5 the drought threshold inducing the average maize yield loss of 36 in jilin province is 1 0 and the drought threshold triggering the average maize yield decline of 40 in liaoning province is 1 3 fig 6a in order to further compare the changes of drought thresholds leading to maize yield losses in different provinces at different periods the drought thresholds inducing maize yield reduction for the two periods 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 are shown in fig 6b and c it is shown that maize yield loss 20 22 in heilongjiang province does not change dramatically with the increase of drought intensity during 1980 1999 fig 6b left in contrast during 2000 2018 maize yield losses change relatively strong under different drought scenarios increasing from 23 to 72 fig 6 c left on average from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 when mild drought occurred the maize yield losses in heilongjiang province increased from 20 to 24 a 4 increase in losses similarly under moderate drought and severe drought maize yield in heilongjiang province increased by 15 and 39 respectively interestingly similar maize yield losses responses to drought were observed in jilin and liaoning provinces changing from 23 42 to 27 55 and from 18 25 to 28 82 respectively furthermore the conditional probability of maize yield loss in liaoning province jilin province increased by an average of 19 43 and 57 4 3 and 10 respectively from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 under mild moderate and severe drought respectively overall under various drought conditions e g spei5 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 maize yields in liaoning province were reduced by 22 28 46 and 71 with the conditional probability of 0 8 during the whole study period 1980 2018 while under the same conditions maize yields in jilin province were reduced by 27 36 39 and 45 respectively and in heilongjiang province by 22 24 32 and 49 from 1980 1999 2000 2018 under the same drought conditions the maize yield losses in liaoning province change from 18 19 22 and 25 28 47 76 and 82 respectively by contrast the maize yield reduction in heilongjiang province change from 20 21 22 and 22 in 1980 1999 23 25 49 and 72 in 2000 2018 respectively under the same drought conditions the maize yield losses in jilin province change from 23 30 38 and 42 27 35 41 and 55 respectively from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 in addition this study further analyses the characteristics of changes in drought thresholds in different periods using the thresholds of 30 40 and 50 reduction in maize yield due to drought as an example table 5 as can be seen from table 5 for the whole study period 1980 2018 drought thresholds inducing 30 40 50 maize yield reduction in heilongjiang province jilin province and liaoning province are 1 30 1 60 2 20 0 80 1 70 2 70 and 1 10 1 30 1 80 respectively on average drought thresholds inducing 30 40 and 50 maize yield losses in the three provinces of northeast china are 1 06 1 53 and 2 23 during 1980 2018 in contrast from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 drought thresholds resulting in 30 40 50 maize yield losses increase by 0 16 0 65 2 16 0 16 0 41 0 96 and 0 6 1 13 2 37 respectively in heilongjiang province jilin province and liaoning province these results indicate that from 1980 to 1999 2000 2018 the same magnitude of drought results in different degrees of maize yield reduction in different provinces increasing the risk of agricultural drought and the need for the agricultural sector to take measures to address and mitigate drought risks combining the information in figs 5 and 6 and table 5 maize in jilin province is the most sensitive to drought i e when mild drought occurs the conditional probability of yield loss is highest and losses in jilin province are considerable however with the intensification of drought the conditional probabilities of maize yield reduction and the maize yield losses increase significantly in liaoning and heilongjiang provinces it is worth noting that under the same drought stress maize yield losses in the three northeastern provinces increased significantly from 2000 to 2018 compared to 1980 1999 understanding the vulnerability of farmland ecosystem in the three northeastern provinces can help in effective drought prevention and risk management 5 discussion 5 1 changes of meteorological factors and irrigation conditions in three northeastern provinces to understand the reasons for the different maize yield losses under the influence of drought in different provinces of the northeast china precipitation p evapotranspiration e the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration p e in different periods and the aridity index ai ai is defined by the ratio of precipitation p to reference crop evapotranspiration et0 unep 1992 and is considered an important indicator of climate regionalization it is widely used in modern climatology to evaluate aridity fu and feng 2014 zhao et al 2019 the mean changes of these indexes were analyzed to explore the aridity table 6 and the effective irrigation efficiency eie to analyze irrigation conditions fig 7 by comparing the mean of p the mean of difference between p and e and the mean of ai in the growing season at different periods 1980 2018 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 it is found that 1 in any study period heilongjiang province has the highest degree of dryness followed by jilin province and liaoning province has the lowest degree of dryness 2 from 1980 1999 to 2000 2018 dry and wet conditions in the three provinces tend to become drier 3 more importantly it is also found that drought conditions in heilongjiang and liaoning provinces are more severe than that in jilin province during 2000 2018 which may explain the reason why the threshold values of drought inducing maize yield losses in liaoning and heilongjiang province are smaller than that in jilin province during the study period table 5 on average in the whole study period 1980 2018 or the segmentation study period 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 the eie from high to low of the three provinces is liaoning jilin and heilongjiang fig 7 which illustrates that irrigation condition in liaoning province is the best followed by jilin province and the worst is heilongjiang province it suggests liaoning province has the greatest degree of water use and stability of agricultural production cao et al 2015 with a larger proportion of irrigated agriculture and heilongjiang province basically uses rain fed agriculture cao et al 2015 huang et al 2022 with maize growing condition in suboptimal environment previous studies have found that crop water use efficiency in developing countries performed better under drought than that in developed countries possibly because crops in developed countries tend to be grown under optimal conditions including adequate irrigation and advanced irrigation equipment bhargava and sawant 2013 yu et al 2021 under drought stress in order to adapt to the drought in suboptimal environment crops often respond by improving water use efficiency bhargava and sawant 2013 in terms of irrigation conditions maize in liaoning province had strong resistance to mild and moderate drought in contrast maize in heilongjiang province has been in a suboptimal environment for a long time and is more likely to cope with extreme drought fig 5 although liaoning province has the best irrigation condition among the three northeastern provinces it suffered the largest maize yield losses caused by droughts from 2000 to 2018 effective irrigation efficiency in liaoning province is good which is beneficial in the event of a mild drought but in the event of a severe drought there may not be enough irrigation to alleviate crop water shortages in time based on table 6 it can be seen that the main reason for the reduction in maize yields is the change in meteorological factors 5 2 analysis of drought characteristics of three provinces in northeast china in order to further explore the causes of the changes of drought threshold inducing maize yield losses in different periods 1980 1999 and 2000 2018 this study identifies the changes of the characteristics of the frequency mean duration and mean severity of drought events by means of run theory method wu et al 2020 in two study periods of the three provinces in northeast china table 7 it can be seen from table 7 that except for jilin province the number of drought events decreased in the other two provinces furthermore from 1980 t to 1999 to 2000 2018 the severity of drought increase in all three provinces and the drought duration increase in the other two provinces except heilongjiang province drought conditions are aggravated in the three provinces which is consistent with the results in table 6 indicating that the decrease in precipitation and the increase in evapotranspiration lead to the more severe droughts in 2000 2018 which in turn leads to the greater losses of maize yield according to the information in figs 5 7 and tables 5 7 these results indicate that irrigation conditions in liaoning province are better and there is sufficient water supply to cope with drought stress however as the drought continues to become moderate or even severe there will not be enough irrigation water to meet the water shortage for maize growth which could lead to greater yield losses maize in heilongjiang province has been in a relatively dry environment and is therefore sensitive to drought and responds strongly in the early stages of drought bhargava and sawant 2013 cao et al 2015 yu et al 2021 however with the onset and development of moderate and severe drought maize in heilongjiang province has better drought resistance than maize in liaoning province where irrigation conditions are better it is worth noting that the aridity in heilongjiang province is slightly stronger than that of liaoning province and jilin province on average among the three provinces liaoning province has the best irrigation conditions these results demonstrate that drought adaptation or acclimation of crops in suboptimal environment may improve water use efficiency under drought stress yu et al 2021 thereby enhancing their drought resistance fernando et al 2020 6 conclusions based on the copula bayesian probability assessment theory this study developed a bivariate probabilistic framework which facilitates the quantification of crop vulnerability to drought stress at multiple levels and the identification of drought vulnerable farmland ecosystems in a more informative way in the proposed framework drought conditions are characterized by the spei which can be flexibly replaced by any other yield related climate variable as part of an effort to understand the control of different climate extremes on the health of farmland ecosystems in the agricultural regions of the world in addition the study quantified the drought thresholds that induce various maize yield losses in three northeastern provinces of china the results of the study can help investors and farmers to provide effective water regimes based on regional drought thresholds at different drought occurrences thereby enabling precision irrigation mitigating the adverse effects of drought on crops reducing waste of agricultural water resources and improving irrigation efficiency for farmers furthermore the results can also support the development of drought tolerant maize varieties based on drought thresholds that are better suitable to local climate

9743,the relationships between the factors that influence the water retention properties of soils bulk density sand silt clay organic matter and caco3 contents and their gravimetric moisture at field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and their available water capacity awc were studied in 104 surface horizons and 95 subsurface horizons of vineyard soils in the castilla la mancha region of spain taking all soil types together the depth of the horizon was found to influence pwp and awc while the factors with the most significant linear relationship with awc both for surface and subsurface horizons were sand content r 0 47 and 0 63 respectively and silt content r 0 37 and 0 62 respectively however when each fao reference soil group was studied independently only calcisols luvisols and regosols showed significant differences between these horizons in terms of awc greater clay contents were associated with greater fc pwp and awc only in luvisol surface horizons r 0 44 0 40 and 0 33 respectively and with fc and pwp in subsurface horizons r 0 64 and 0 64 a greater caco3 content was associated with a greater awc only in calcisols both in surface and subsurface horizons r 0 49 for both finally the organic matter content and bulk density of the different soil types showed no clear trend with respect to any soil water retention property a certain positive effect of organic matter on water retention properties was observed only in the surface horizon and not in the subsurface horizon a map of the spatial distribution of awc in surface and subsurface horizons is proposed as a soil management instrument keywords water retention properties maps surface horizon subsurface horizon field capacity permanent wilting point available water capacity 1 introduction knowing how much water in a soil can be used by plants is required for the appropriate management of irrigation it can be determined using the concept of available water capacity awc calculated as the difference between the gravimetric moisture content at field capacity fc amount of water in the soil at 33 kpa and the gravimetric moisture content at the permanent wilting point pwp amount of water at 1500 kpa fc and pwp can be measured directly in the field or in the laboratory but this is time consuming and over the last 20 years pedotransfer functions ptf for estimating soil hydraulic properties have become ever more used as an alternative however while ptfs have undergone much development and have contributed to our knowledge on the soil properties that influence water retention and despite their being used to predict and map some of these properties malone et al 2009 hong et al 2013 ugbaje and reuter 2013 direct measurements are simpler more accurate and more reliable additionally growers are used to interpreting and using the results of direct measurements when determining the water retention properties of soils by direct methods only the surface horizon is normally considered irrigation calculations are thus made using data for this layer alone however the roots of woody crops such as grapevine take up water from almost every soil profile horizon the awc of both the surface and subsurface horizons should therefore be known morlat and jacquet 1993 owing to their pedogenesis surface and subsurface horizons have different physical characteristics that influence their water retention properties but the literature contains very little information on how depth affects those of vineyard soils li et al 2021 it is also of interest to know the type of soil on which grapevines are cultivated since this influences the management of vineyards and helps define the viticultural environment terroir that renders a wine its individual character certainly knowing the water retention properties of fao reference soil group types in vineyards would be valuable to growers hong et al 2013 given the above the aims of the present work were 1 to determine whether the soil water characteristics of vineyard soils in castilla la mancha spain are influenced by depth 2 to relate the water retention properties of soils to their physicochemical properties and thus contribute to our knowledge of the hydro behaviour of these soils and 3 to produce a distribution map of soil water retention properties that might guide growers in the area when making decisions regarding grapevine irrigation the results obtained should help in agricultural and irrigation management in this region which has a great diversity and quantity of vineyard soils and which receives little rainfall the results might be extrapolated to other grapevine growing areas with similar reference soil groups 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling procedure the work examines the surface and subsurface horizons of 104 profiles of vineyard soils belonging to five fao reference groups the study area lies in the region of castilla la mancha spain which in 2019 had a total 468 027 ha dedicated to vineyards oemv 2019 it has a mediterranean climate all the studied soils supported the cultivation of grapevines but of different varieties and subjected to different crop management systems rainfed or irrigated in an effort to represent the greatest possible diversity of soils the study area was subdivided into its major physiographic environments and sampling points based on bedrock type slope erosion landform land use and local growers opinion of soil types were then established fig 1 all samplings were performed during 2010 2012 soil profiles were opened with a backhoe the samples were taken from the ap horizon surface horizon and bt or bw horizons subsurface horizons taking into account that the majority of the active vine roots are located at a depth of 20 80 cm later samples were transported to the laboratory these were then air dried and sieved 2 mm prior to analysis 2 2 laboratory methods for all horizon samples the sand silt and clay contents were determined using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 the organic carbon content by potassium dichromate oxidation and titration of the remaining dichromate with ammonium ferrous sulphate anne 1945 and the organic matter content was calculated as the product of organic carbon content multiplied by the van bemmelen factor 1 724 the caco3 content was determined using a bernard calcimeter porta et al 1986 and the bulk density of the surface horizons using the cylinder method blake and hartge 1986 for each horizon disturbed sample gravimetric moisture values were determined according to the matric potentials of richards 1948 method the gravimetric moisture percentage was determined at 33 kpa for the establishment of the field capacity fc and at 1500 kpa for the permanent wilting point pwp available water capacity awc was calculated according to eq 1 1 awc fc pwp values for 10 subsurface horizon samples could not be determined since they corresponded to bedrock or a cemented horizon all laboratory tests were conducted in accordance with scs usda 1972 criteria and performed in triplicate finally the studied soils were classified as arenosols calcisols cambisols luvisols and regosols to examine the effect of depth on the water retention properties of these fao reference group soil types iuss working group wrb 2015 2 3 statistical methods fc pwp and awc data for different soil and horizon types were analysed by anova followed by a fisher s least significant difference test as required significance was set at p 0 05 the bulk density sand silt clay organic matter and caco3 contents and the fc pwp and awc values were subjected to correlation analysis and correlation coefficients r determined all calculations were performed using statgraphics centurion vii statpoint technologies inc 1982 2014 and excel 2013 software microsoft 2014 2 4 soil mapping spatial distribution maps of water retention properties were made using arcgis 10 3 software under license from the university of castilla la mancha uclm for all geostatistical interpolations inverse distance weighting idw was used to predict spatial variability 3 results and discussion table 1 provides the descriptive statistics for the soil physical properties of the surface and subsurface horizons of vineyard soils taken together and with respect to fao reference soil groups iuss working group wrb 2015 the initial hypothesis was that water retention properties would differ depending on whether samples came from a surface or subsurface horizon the surface horizon is that in which most biological activity occurs it therefore contains more organic matter and less pedogenic material the subsurface horizon consists of mineral layers which are significantly altered by pedogenesis and by the accumulation of other minerals migrating downwards from the surface horizon illuviated horizon plant roots can penetrate this layer anova revealed statistically significant differences between the pwp and awc data for the surface and subsurface horizons but no significant difference was seen in terms of fc this may be explained in that both fc and pwp depend on the textural fractions of the soil which define pore size and the present subsurface horizons showed a higher content of finer particles table 1 al majou et al 2008 indicate that texture has a greater influence on water retention properties than horizon type the incorporation of horizon type did not improve the predictive performance of the ptf they used in their work in the present work although no significant difference between the horizons in terms of fc was noticed one might have been expected since the surface horizon is where cultivation work is performed which changes its original properties including its water retention properties li et al 2021 table 2 shows the matrix of correlation coefficients between the different soil physical and water retention properties for the different horizons the presence of sand was found to be inversely related to fc pwp and awc with correlation coefficients of 0 68 0 68 and 0 47 in the surface horizons and 0 76 0 67 and 0 63 in subsurface horizons correlation analysis returned an r value of 0 5 between sand content and fc and pwp in both types of horizons and a weaker relationship r 0 5 between sand content and awc in the surface horizons an inverse relationship was observed between sand content and awc fig 2 the same has been reported by other authors who studied soils in semi arid madankumar 1985 walczak et al 2006 and temperate regions reeve et al 1973 walczak et al 2006 saxton and rawls 2006 the caco3 content was also found to be significantly but not very strongly related to fc pwp and awc table 2 in both the surface r 0 45 0 31 and 0 49 respectively and subsurface horizons r 0 21 0 06 and 0 49 respectively fig 2 few studies have examined the influence of the caco3 content on soil moisture retention especially for semi arid regions abrol et al 1968 reported a significant correlation between the caco3 content and the awc r 0 68 of 79 samples from a semi arid region in india and indicated that the manner in which calcium carbonate will behave will depend much on the size fraction in which calcium carbonate occurs walczak et al 2006 also found significant correlations between the caco3 content and fc r 0 59 and pwp r 0 40 in 74 samples taken at depths of 10 100 cm from seville spain another semi arid region in addition p√©rez de los reyes et al 2011 reported a 34 5 increase in the awc of surface horizons of semi arid soils treated with sugar foam 4 in untreated soil a consequence of the increase in caco3 and organic matter in the soil silt content also influenced soil water retention properties table 2 this relationship was first reported by abrol et al 1968 who described it as the most influential factor contributing to the accumulation of moisture at 33 kpa a higher silt content was said to ensure greater retention of water at fc since it governed the distribution of pores the present results are consistent with these findings stronger correlations were seen between the silt content and water retention variables for the surface horizons 0 50 0 49 and 0 37 for fc pwp and awc respectively than between the clay content and the same variables significant but weak at 0 36 0 39 and 0 22 respectively however abrol et al 1968 and nguyen et al 2015 in their study of 160 soils from the mekong delta in vietnam indicated the linear relationship between clay content and fc and pwp to be stronger r 0 82 and r 0 84 respectively than those between the silt content and fc and pwp r 0 53 and r 0 54 respectively in the subsurface horizons the silt content seems to be more influential than in surface horizons with the linear relationship between silt content and awc stronger 0 62 and 0 37 for the surface and subsurface horizons respectively the clay content of the subsurface horizons appeared to be more important than for the superficial horizons r 0 53 0 54 and 0 29 for fc pwp and awc respectively which might be explained by the accumulation of clay at depth a habitual pedogenetic process the bulk density a variable widely used to determine soil water retention properties via ptfs w√∂sten et al 2001 walczak et al 2006 appears to have only a weak relationship with water retention properties in the surface horizons of the studied soils a significant inverse relationship was observed r 0 34 0 27 and 0 33 for fc pwp and awc respectively these correlation coefficients are lower than those previously reported reeve et al 1973 walczak et al 2006 igwe et al 2013 soil organic matter content has long been considered one of the most influential factors affecting water retention rawls et al 2003 olness and archer 2005 eden et al 2017 for the surface horizons the present work revealed positive linear relationships between the organic matter content and fc pwp and awc table 2 although the correlation coefficients were relatively weak 0 38 0 35 and 0 31 respectively no such relationships were seen for the subsurface horizons which usually have a low to very low organic matter content previous studies have reported wide ranges in organic matter content from 0 1 to 20 by rawls et al 2003 and from 1 7 to 9 3 by p√©rez de los reyes et al 2011 in the present work the organic matter content for the surface horizons ranged from 0 1 to 6 2 mean 1 96 sd 0 97 table 1 ninety two of the samples however contained 3 organic matter which may explain the low correlation coefficients found rawls et al 2003 indicated that when the organic matter content is low as in most of the present soils the influence it actually exerts depends on the soil texture olness and archer 2005 drew a similar conclusion from their data which showed a 1 increase in soil organic carbon to induce a 2 5 increase in soil awc depending on the soil texture table 1 shows the mean fc pwp and awc values for the different reference soil groups according to depth for all classifications the mean awc value for the surface horizons was higher than recorded for the subsurface horizons as previously indicated malone et al 2009 ugbaje and reuter 2013 p√©rez de los reyes et al 2015 however only calcisols luvisols and regosols showed significant differences in awc between the surface and subsurface horizons table 3 shows the significant correlation coefficients detected between soil physical properties and water retention properties in terms of the different reference soil groups at different depths neither arenosols nor regosols showed a linear relationship between soil physical properties and water retention properties except for bulk density and pwp in arenosols probably this absence of statistically significant correlations in arenosols and regosols can be attributed to the very low number of samples for calcisols which are commonly used soils in viticulture amor√≥s et al 2012 the sand content appeared to be more related to fc r 0 66 pwp r 0 50 and awc r 0 71 in the subsurface horizons than in the surface horizons r 0 37 and r 0 39 for fc and pwp respectively the textural fractions had no influence on the awc in surface horizons but had a moderately strong influence on subsurface horizons r 0 71 and r 0 68 for sand content and silt content respectively for calcisols a significant although relatively weak relationship was seen between awc and the caco3 content both for the surface and subsurface horizons r 0 49 and r 0 49 respectively with an increase in the caco3 content inducing a rise in the awc fig 3 similar conclusions have been reported by other authors abrol et al 1968 khodaverdiloo et al 2011 p√©rez de los reyes et al 2015 in cambisols the sand and silt contents were found to have significant and moderately strong linear relationships with fc and pwp for both the surface and subsurface horizons table 3 awc was influenced only by the organic matter content in subsurface horizons although the correlation was weak r 0 44 finally in luvisols the sand and silt contents were once again the properties that most strongly influenced fc pwp and awc in both the surface and subsurface horizons table 3 an influence of the clay content on these three water retention properties was manifested in luvisols surface horizons r 0 44 0 40 and 0 33 for fc pwp and awc respectively and subsurface horizons r 0 64 for both fc and pwp however no linear relationship was detected between awc and the clay content in subsurface horizons this result is surprising since the evolution of these soils results in a clay enriched horizon bt which is usually the subsurface horizon other authors igwe et al 2013 report a positive correlation between fc pwp and awc and clay content with high correlation coefficients r 0 98 0 99 and 0 74 respectively for growers knowledge of their soil s fc pwp and awc would help in getting the most out of irrigation spatial distribution maps of fc pwp and awc were therefore prepared fig 4 moisture retention properties are one of the least mapped of all soil properties although digital awc maps have been made based on the predictions of ptfs malone et al 2009 hong et al 2013 ugbaje and reuter 2013 in the present work these prediction methods were not used but direct measurements were made since ptfs are often tainted with considerable uncertainty and error gijsman et al 2003 saxton and rawls 2006 pachepsky et al 2015 the maps produced show a different spatial distribution for fc in the surface and subsurface horizons with more areas with high fc 25 blue colours in the latter for pwp the surface and subsurface horizon maps are similar with a predominance of very low values green colours bearing in mind the geological map of the region bravo et al 2019 the awc spatial distribution maps show that the geological origin of soils and their evolution can condition their water retention properties thus soils with a low water retention capacity which have predominantly coarse sand textures are developed on granitic soils see 1 in the northwest of maps e and f and on quaternary soils via the accumulation of fluvial sediments see 2 in the centre east of maps e and f corresponding to the basins of the upper river guadiana and its z√°ncara and giguela tributaries soils with high medium water retention capacity which show textures with a large percentage of silt and to a lesser extent clay are developed on miocene soils see 3 in the central part of maps e and f the large accumulation of water in the subsurface horizons in these areas can be explained by the presence of calcic and petrocalcic horizons common in semi arid regions that release much of the retained water at plant available potentials duniway and herrick 2007 this last type of texture is also shown by soils produced by the erosion of the montes de toledo mountain range composed of quartzites and slate see 4 in the west of maps e and f and those lying over mesozoic rock see 5 in the south of maps e and f the area of highest viticultural intensity in castilla la mancha see map reported by amor√≥s et al 2018 coincides with point 3 in the centre of maps e and f and has soils with medium high water retention capacities both in the surface and subsurface horizons the ability of these soils to store more water in the surface horizon and much in the more subsurface horizon make them ideal for vineyards in an area where irrigation is very restricted and the climate is semi arid it is very common for soil analyses to only involve surface layers insufficient when dealing with crops such as grapevines that develop deep root systems morlat and jacquet 1993 the above maps however could be very useful to growers for determining the awc of their soils and thus the need for irrigation they could also be very useful when deciding whether or not to plant grapevines using the utm coordinates of their land growers can get a good idea of the soil s water retention properties 4 conclusions depth is here shown to influence the water retention properties of soils anova revealed significant differences between the pwp and awc of the surface and subsurface horizons but no significant differences were seen in fc the fc pwp and awc of surface horizons appear to be influenced by soil bulk density and the sand silt and clay organic matter and caco3 contents in subsurface horizons they appear to be affected by the sand silt and clay contents and to a lesser extent the caco3 content correlations between water retention variables and sand silt and clay content are stronger in subsurface horizons than in surface ones only the organic matter content and the caco3 content appears to be stronger related to water retention in surface horizons from the standpoint of reference soil group classification only calcisols luvisols and regosols show significant differences between their surface and subsurface horizons in terms of awc the property most linearly related to moisture retention properties is sand content seen for 85 of the studied soils but not for arenosols or regosols in either horizon in calcisols cambisols and luvisols the silt content shows a linear relationship with fc pwp and awc in luvisols the same is seem for the clay content and in calcisols for the caco3 content bulk density only appears to have a strong influence on pwp in arenosols no pattern was seen for organic matter in the majority of soil types the spatial distribution maps produced could be used by growers in the region to estimate the water retention properties of their soils and may be useful to growers in other areas with similar reference soil groups declaration of

9743,the relationships between the factors that influence the water retention properties of soils bulk density sand silt clay organic matter and caco3 contents and their gravimetric moisture at field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and their available water capacity awc were studied in 104 surface horizons and 95 subsurface horizons of vineyard soils in the castilla la mancha region of spain taking all soil types together the depth of the horizon was found to influence pwp and awc while the factors with the most significant linear relationship with awc both for surface and subsurface horizons were sand content r 0 47 and 0 63 respectively and silt content r 0 37 and 0 62 respectively however when each fao reference soil group was studied independently only calcisols luvisols and regosols showed significant differences between these horizons in terms of awc greater clay contents were associated with greater fc pwp and awc only in luvisol surface horizons r 0 44 0 40 and 0 33 respectively and with fc and pwp in subsurface horizons r 0 64 and 0 64 a greater caco3 content was associated with a greater awc only in calcisols both in surface and subsurface horizons r 0 49 for both finally the organic matter content and bulk density of the different soil types showed no clear trend with respect to any soil water retention property a certain positive effect of organic matter on water retention properties was observed only in the surface horizon and not in the subsurface horizon a map of the spatial distribution of awc in surface and subsurface horizons is proposed as a soil management instrument keywords water retention properties maps surface horizon subsurface horizon field capacity permanent wilting point available water capacity 1 introduction knowing how much water in a soil can be used by plants is required for the appropriate management of irrigation it can be determined using the concept of available water capacity awc calculated as the difference between the gravimetric moisture content at field capacity fc amount of water in the soil at 33 kpa and the gravimetric moisture content at the permanent wilting point pwp amount of water at 1500 kpa fc and pwp can be measured directly in the field or in the laboratory but this is time consuming and over the last 20 years pedotransfer functions ptf for estimating soil hydraulic properties have become ever more used as an alternative however while ptfs have undergone much development and have contributed to our knowledge on the soil properties that influence water retention and despite their being used to predict and map some of these properties malone et al 2009 hong et al 2013 ugbaje and reuter 2013 direct measurements are simpler more accurate and more reliable additionally growers are used to interpreting and using the results of direct measurements when determining the water retention properties of soils by direct methods only the surface horizon is normally considered irrigation calculations are thus made using data for this layer alone however the roots of woody crops such as grapevine take up water from almost every soil profile horizon the awc of both the surface and subsurface horizons should therefore be known morlat and jacquet 1993 owing to their pedogenesis surface and subsurface horizons have different physical characteristics that influence their water retention properties but the literature contains very little information on how depth affects those of vineyard soils li et al 2021 it is also of interest to know the type of soil on which grapevines are cultivated since this influences the management of vineyards and helps define the viticultural environment terroir that renders a wine its individual character certainly knowing the water retention properties of fao reference soil group types in vineyards would be valuable to growers hong et al 2013 given the above the aims of the present work were 1 to determine whether the soil water characteristics of vineyard soils in castilla la mancha spain are influenced by depth 2 to relate the water retention properties of soils to their physicochemical properties and thus contribute to our knowledge of the hydro behaviour of these soils and 3 to produce a distribution map of soil water retention properties that might guide growers in the area when making decisions regarding grapevine irrigation the results obtained should help in agricultural and irrigation management in this region which has a great diversity and quantity of vineyard soils and which receives little rainfall the results might be extrapolated to other grapevine growing areas with similar reference soil groups 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling procedure the work examines the surface and subsurface horizons of 104 profiles of vineyard soils belonging to five fao reference groups the study area lies in the region of castilla la mancha spain which in 2019 had a total 468 027 ha dedicated to vineyards oemv 2019 it has a mediterranean climate all the studied soils supported the cultivation of grapevines but of different varieties and subjected to different crop management systems rainfed or irrigated in an effort to represent the greatest possible diversity of soils the study area was subdivided into its major physiographic environments and sampling points based on bedrock type slope erosion landform land use and local growers opinion of soil types were then established fig 1 all samplings were performed during 2010 2012 soil profiles were opened with a backhoe the samples were taken from the ap horizon surface horizon and bt or bw horizons subsurface horizons taking into account that the majority of the active vine roots are located at a depth of 20 80 cm later samples were transported to the laboratory these were then air dried and sieved 2 mm prior to analysis 2 2 laboratory methods for all horizon samples the sand silt and clay contents were determined using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 the organic carbon content by potassium dichromate oxidation and titration of the remaining dichromate with ammonium ferrous sulphate anne 1945 and the organic matter content was calculated as the product of organic carbon content multiplied by the van bemmelen factor 1 724 the caco3 content was determined using a bernard calcimeter porta et al 1986 and the bulk density of the surface horizons using the cylinder method blake and hartge 1986 for each horizon disturbed sample gravimetric moisture values were determined according to the matric potentials of richards 1948 method the gravimetric moisture percentage was determined at 33 kpa for the establishment of the field capacity fc and at 1500 kpa for the permanent wilting point pwp available water capacity awc was calculated according to eq 1 1 awc fc pwp values for 10 subsurface horizon samples could not be determined since they corresponded to bedrock or a cemented horizon all laboratory tests were conducted in accordance with scs usda 1972 criteria and performed in triplicate finally the studied soils were classified as arenosols calcisols cambisols luvisols and regosols to examine the effect of depth on the water retention properties of these fao reference group soil types iuss working group wrb 2015 2 3 statistical methods fc pwp and awc data for different soil and horizon types were analysed by anova followed by a fisher s least significant difference test as required significance was set at p 0 05 the bulk density sand silt clay organic matter and caco3 contents and the fc pwp and awc values were subjected to correlation analysis and correlation coefficients r determined all calculations were performed using statgraphics centurion vii statpoint technologies inc 1982 2014 and excel 2013 software microsoft 2014 2 4 soil mapping spatial distribution maps of water retention properties were made using arcgis 10 3 software under license from the university of castilla la mancha uclm for all geostatistical interpolations inverse distance weighting idw was used to predict spatial variability 3 results and discussion table 1 provides the descriptive statistics for the soil physical properties of the surface and subsurface horizons of vineyard soils taken together and with respect to fao reference soil groups iuss working group wrb 2015 the initial hypothesis was that water retention properties would differ depending on whether samples came from a surface or subsurface horizon the surface horizon is that in which most biological activity occurs it therefore contains more organic matter and less pedogenic material the subsurface horizon consists of mineral layers which are significantly altered by pedogenesis and by the accumulation of other minerals migrating downwards from the surface horizon illuviated horizon plant roots can penetrate this layer anova revealed statistically significant differences between the pwp and awc data for the surface and subsurface horizons but no significant difference was seen in terms of fc this may be explained in that both fc and pwp depend on the textural fractions of the soil which define pore size and the present subsurface horizons showed a higher content of finer particles table 1 al majou et al 2008 indicate that texture has a greater influence on water retention properties than horizon type the incorporation of horizon type did not improve the predictive performance of the ptf they used in their work in the present work although no significant difference between the horizons in terms of fc was noticed one might have been expected since the surface horizon is where cultivation work is performed which changes its original properties including its water retention properties li et al 2021 table 2 shows the matrix of correlation coefficients between the different soil physical and water retention properties for the different horizons the presence of sand was found to be inversely related to fc pwp and awc with correlation coefficients of 0 68 0 68 and 0 47 in the surface horizons and 0 76 0 67 and 0 63 in subsurface horizons correlation analysis returned an r value of 0 5 between sand content and fc and pwp in both types of horizons and a weaker relationship r 0 5 between sand content and awc in the surface horizons an inverse relationship was observed between sand content and awc fig 2 the same has been reported by other authors who studied soils in semi arid madankumar 1985 walczak et al 2006 and temperate regions reeve et al 1973 walczak et al 2006 saxton and rawls 2006 the caco3 content was also found to be significantly but not very strongly related to fc pwp and awc table 2 in both the surface r 0 45 0 31 and 0 49 respectively and subsurface horizons r 0 21 0 06 and 0 49 respectively fig 2 few studies have examined the influence of the caco3 content on soil moisture retention especially for semi arid regions abrol et al 1968 reported a significant correlation between the caco3 content and the awc r 0 68 of 79 samples from a semi arid region in india and indicated that the manner in which calcium carbonate will behave will depend much on the size fraction in which calcium carbonate occurs walczak et al 2006 also found significant correlations between the caco3 content and fc r 0 59 and pwp r 0 40 in 74 samples taken at depths of 10 100 cm from seville spain another semi arid region in addition p√©rez de los reyes et al 2011 reported a 34 5 increase in the awc of surface horizons of semi arid soils treated with sugar foam 4 in untreated soil a consequence of the increase in caco3 and organic matter in the soil silt content also influenced soil water retention properties table 2 this relationship was first reported by abrol et al 1968 who described it as the most influential factor contributing to the accumulation of moisture at 33 kpa a higher silt content was said to ensure greater retention of water at fc since it governed the distribution of pores the present results are consistent with these findings stronger correlations were seen between the silt content and water retention variables for the surface horizons 0 50 0 49 and 0 37 for fc pwp and awc respectively than between the clay content and the same variables significant but weak at 0 36 0 39 and 0 22 respectively however abrol et al 1968 and nguyen et al 2015 in their study of 160 soils from the mekong delta in vietnam indicated the linear relationship between clay content and fc and pwp to be stronger r 0 82 and r 0 84 respectively than those between the silt content and fc and pwp r 0 53 and r 0 54 respectively in the subsurface horizons the silt content seems to be more influential than in surface horizons with the linear relationship between silt content and awc stronger 0 62 and 0 37 for the surface and subsurface horizons respectively the clay content of the subsurface horizons appeared to be more important than for the superficial horizons r 0 53 0 54 and 0 29 for fc pwp and awc respectively which might be explained by the accumulation of clay at depth a habitual pedogenetic process the bulk density a variable widely used to determine soil water retention properties via ptfs w√∂sten et al 2001 walczak et al 2006 appears to have only a weak relationship with water retention properties in the surface horizons of the studied soils a significant inverse relationship was observed r 0 34 0 27 and 0 33 for fc pwp and awc respectively these correlation coefficients are lower than those previously reported reeve et al 1973 walczak et al 2006 igwe et al 2013 soil organic matter content has long been considered one of the most influential factors affecting water retention rawls et al 2003 olness and archer 2005 eden et al 2017 for the surface horizons the present work revealed positive linear relationships between the organic matter content and fc pwp and awc table 2 although the correlation coefficients were relatively weak 0 38 0 35 and 0 31 respectively no such relationships were seen for the subsurface horizons which usually have a low to very low organic matter content previous studies have reported wide ranges in organic matter content from 0 1 to 20 by rawls et al 2003 and from 1 7 to 9 3 by p√©rez de los reyes et al 2011 in the present work the organic matter content for the surface horizons ranged from 0 1 to 6 2 mean 1 96 sd 0 97 table 1 ninety two of the samples however contained 3 organic matter which may explain the low correlation coefficients found rawls et al 2003 indicated that when the organic matter content is low as in most of the present soils the influence it actually exerts depends on the soil texture olness and archer 2005 drew a similar conclusion from their data which showed a 1 increase in soil organic carbon to induce a 2 5 increase in soil awc depending on the soil texture table 1 shows the mean fc pwp and awc values for the different reference soil groups according to depth for all classifications the mean awc value for the surface horizons was higher than recorded for the subsurface horizons as previously indicated malone et al 2009 ugbaje and reuter 2013 p√©rez de los reyes et al 2015 however only calcisols luvisols and regosols showed significant differences in awc between the surface and subsurface horizons table 3 shows the significant correlation coefficients detected between soil physical properties and water retention properties in terms of the different reference soil groups at different depths neither arenosols nor regosols showed a linear relationship between soil physical properties and water retention properties except for bulk density and pwp in arenosols probably this absence of statistically significant correlations in arenosols and regosols can be attributed to the very low number of samples for calcisols which are commonly used soils in viticulture amor√≥s et al 2012 the sand content appeared to be more related to fc r 0 66 pwp r 0 50 and awc r 0 71 in the subsurface horizons than in the surface horizons r 0 37 and r 0 39 for fc and pwp respectively the textural fractions had no influence on the awc in surface horizons but had a moderately strong influence on subsurface horizons r 0 71 and r 0 68 for sand content and silt content respectively for calcisols a significant although relatively weak relationship was seen between awc and the caco3 content both for the surface and subsurface horizons r 0 49 and r 0 49 respectively with an increase in the caco3 content inducing a rise in the awc fig 3 similar conclusions have been reported by other authors abrol et al 1968 khodaverdiloo et al 2011 p√©rez de los reyes et al 2015 in cambisols the sand and silt contents were found to have significant and moderately strong linear relationships with fc and pwp for both the surface and subsurface horizons table 3 awc was influenced only by the organic matter content in subsurface horizons although the correlation was weak r 0 44 finally in luvisols the sand and silt contents were once again the properties that most strongly influenced fc pwp and awc in both the surface and subsurface horizons table 3 an influence of the clay content on these three water retention properties was manifested in luvisols surface horizons r 0 44 0 40 and 0 33 for fc pwp and awc respectively and subsurface horizons r 0 64 for both fc and pwp however no linear relationship was detected between awc and the clay content in subsurface horizons this result is surprising since the evolution of these soils results in a clay enriched horizon bt which is usually the subsurface horizon other authors igwe et al 2013 report a positive correlation between fc pwp and awc and clay content with high correlation coefficients r 0 98 0 99 and 0 74 respectively for growers knowledge of their soil s fc pwp and awc would help in getting the most out of irrigation spatial distribution maps of fc pwp and awc were therefore prepared fig 4 moisture retention properties are one of the least mapped of all soil properties although digital awc maps have been made based on the predictions of ptfs malone et al 2009 hong et al 2013 ugbaje and reuter 2013 in the present work these prediction methods were not used but direct measurements were made since ptfs are often tainted with considerable uncertainty and error gijsman et al 2003 saxton and rawls 2006 pachepsky et al 2015 the maps produced show a different spatial distribution for fc in the surface and subsurface horizons with more areas with high fc 25 blue colours in the latter for pwp the surface and subsurface horizon maps are similar with a predominance of very low values green colours bearing in mind the geological map of the region bravo et al 2019 the awc spatial distribution maps show that the geological origin of soils and their evolution can condition their water retention properties thus soils with a low water retention capacity which have predominantly coarse sand textures are developed on granitic soils see 1 in the northwest of maps e and f and on quaternary soils via the accumulation of fluvial sediments see 2 in the centre east of maps e and f corresponding to the basins of the upper river guadiana and its z√°ncara and giguela tributaries soils with high medium water retention capacity which show textures with a large percentage of silt and to a lesser extent clay are developed on miocene soils see 3 in the central part of maps e and f the large accumulation of water in the subsurface horizons in these areas can be explained by the presence of calcic and petrocalcic horizons common in semi arid regions that release much of the retained water at plant available potentials duniway and herrick 2007 this last type of texture is also shown by soils produced by the erosion of the montes de toledo mountain range composed of quartzites and slate see 4 in the west of maps e and f and those lying over mesozoic rock see 5 in the south of maps e and f the area of highest viticultural intensity in castilla la mancha see map reported by amor√≥s et al 2018 coincides with point 3 in the centre of maps e and f and has soils with medium high water retention capacities both in the surface and subsurface horizons the ability of these soils to store more water in the surface horizon and much in the more subsurface horizon make them ideal for vineyards in an area where irrigation is very restricted and the climate is semi arid it is very common for soil analyses to only involve surface layers insufficient when dealing with crops such as grapevines that develop deep root systems morlat and jacquet 1993 the above maps however could be very useful to growers for determining the awc of their soils and thus the need for irrigation they could also be very useful when deciding whether or not to plant grapevines using the utm coordinates of their land growers can get a good idea of the soil s water retention properties 4 conclusions depth is here shown to influence the water retention properties of soils anova revealed significant differences between the pwp and awc of the surface and subsurface horizons but no significant differences were seen in fc the fc pwp and awc of surface horizons appear to be influenced by soil bulk density and the sand silt and clay organic matter and caco3 contents in subsurface horizons they appear to be affected by the sand silt and clay contents and to a lesser extent the caco3 content correlations between water retention variables and sand silt and clay content are stronger in subsurface horizons than in surface ones only the organic matter content and the caco3 content appears to be stronger related to water retention in surface horizons from the standpoint of reference soil group classification only calcisols luvisols and regosols show significant differences between their surface and subsurface horizons in terms of awc the property most linearly related to moisture retention properties is sand content seen for 85 of the studied soils but not for arenosols or regosols in either horizon in calcisols cambisols and luvisols the silt content shows a linear relationship with fc pwp and awc in luvisols the same is seem for the clay content and in calcisols for the caco3 content bulk density only appears to have a strong influence on pwp in arenosols no pattern was seen for organic matter in the majority of soil types the spatial distribution maps produced could be used by growers in the region to estimate the water retention properties of their soils and may be useful to growers in other areas with similar reference soil groups declaration of

maize is used as human food animal feed pharmaceutical and industrial manufacture which plays an important role in agricultural and industrial production abd el waheda and ali 2013 increasing maize yield is one of the important strategies of national food security q guo et al 2021 by 2050 global food demand is expected to double and sustainably feeding the growing population is thus a great challenge godfray et al 2010 zheng et al 2019 more importantly the high frequency and longer water shortage associated with climate change has reduced crop growth and food production in most agricultural regions gholamhoseini et al 2013 yu et al 2020 maize is very sensitive to water stress mainly in morphological physiological and biochemical processes aydinsakir et al 2013 water stress could slow down the growth of maize reduce maize biomass and grain number or grain weight and eventually lead to maize yield reduction payero et al 2009 in addition many reports have demonstrated that excessive irrigation not only failed to increase crop yield but also caused resource waste soil salinity and reduced soil fertility yan et al 2021 developing high efficient and water saving production technologies is required to increase maize yield while avoiding excessive water input maintaining agricultural sustainable production and improving farmland soil environment yu et al 2020 drip irrigation one of the most effective irrigation methods for crops has been widely used in crop production in water scarce regions fan et al 2017 sampathkumar et al 2013 drip irrigation can accurately control water amount to reduce water evaporation and deep leakage pablo et al 2007 this technology reduces water and fertilizer uses on crops and greatly lowers the agricultural production costs lekakis et al 2011 wu et al 2019 previous studies have shown that drip irrigation significantly increased crop yield and wp li et al 2019 pablo et al 2007 sampathkumar and pandian 2011 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2021 n also plays an important role in achieving the maximum potential yield of maize j j guo et al 2021 similar with water inputs excessive n application causes waste of resources and greatly pollutes agricultural and ecological environment zhang et al 2016 therefore optimizing n management has been an important approach to balance n use efficiency nue and crop yield duan et al 2019 ma et al 2021 traditional urea u is usually applied as basal fertilizer resulting in n surplus at the early maize growth stage and increasing the risk of soil no3 n leaching zheng et al 2020 besides u could not satisfy the maize demand for n at the late growth stage which was not conducive to grain filling and thus reduced grain yield feng et al 2015 fernandez et al 2020 found that increasing n availability at the late growth stage of crop was to synchronize maize n demand of crop with soil n supply liu et al 2020 found that slow release n fertilizer srf impeded the water transport necessary for urea dissolution in the membrane by coating materials thereby prolonging the effectiveness of n fertilizer therefore srf could delay the release of n to meet the crop demand for n at the late growth stages zhang et al 2019 fan et al 2021 also reported that the mixture of urea and slow release n fertilizer uns could reduce soil n supply when crop absorption capacity was low and improve soil fertility during the period of high crop n demand uns could better match crop demand for n greatly reduced the risk of n loss to the environment li et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 moreover uns can be used as basal fertilizer due to its n release rate being synchronized with crop n uptake which not only saves labor and time but also increases maize yield economic return and nue guo et al 2017 garcia et al 2018 therefore with the development of effective and environmentally friendly fertilizers uns has been an optimized n fertilizer strategy that is extensively applied to rice wheat maize and other field crops grant et al 2012 geng et al 2015 guo et al 2017 garcia et al 2018 li et al 2020 post silking n uptake and pre silking n remobilization of vegetative organs are two primary sources of grain n content at maturity ciampitti and vyn 2013 li et al 2017 previous studies showed that increased n supply at the early stage of maize could increase n uptake by maize vegetative organs promoting n remobilization from vegetative organs to grains he et al 1998 huang et al 2007 found that prolonging the availability of n fertilizer could increase maize post silking n uptake delay leaf senescence maintain photosynthetic activity and thus improve grain yield however fowler 2003 reported that increasing n supply may be not useful for the ultimate formation of grain yield due to the intensified nutrient competition between vegetative organs and grains cui et al 2010 and sun et al 2020 reported that synchronized soil n supply with maize n demand could avoid grain yield reduction and environmental pollution caused by insufficient or excessive n in maize production lu et al 2021 reported that reducing soil no3 n leaching losses improving crop yield and nue with effective water and n management strategies were extremely important for sustainable agricultural development nitrate leaching losses mainly depend on the concentration of no3 n in soil solution and soil moisture content jia et al 2014 the residual no3 n in soil depends on the n input and crop n uptake a negligible amount of fertilizer n remains in soil at harvest when applying suitable water and n regimes that match plant demand wu et al 2019 li et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to explore scientific water and n management strategies to reduce n losses while maintaining high yield the interaction of water and n fertilizer urea or slow release n fertilizer has been demonstrated to promote crop growth increase n uptake and yield ye et al 2013 lu et al 2021 yan et al 2021 however the effects of irrigation water and uns on n uptake and remobilization as well as grain yield and residual soil no3 n of maize are rarely reported compared with traditional water and n strategies the interaction between drip irrigation and uns on maize production in arid and semi arid regions is still unclear the objectives of this study were thus to 1 investigate the effects of drip irrigation n fertilizer types and their interaction on maize growth n uptake grain yield and residual soil no3 n 2 explore the source of grain n content and its response to n uptake and n remobilization under

significantly higher than those in u and srf at r1 at r6 the grain and leaf n uptake in u were lower than those in uns and srf but no significant difference was observed between uns and srf moreover we found no significant difference in total n uptake at r6 and post silking n uptake between uns and srf but with values of both parameters higher than in u table 4 for various n fertilizer types the

grain n in u and uns was higher than that in srf but no significant difference was obtained in stalk the contribution of stalk n remobilization to grain n was higher in 2020 17 1 than that in 2019 11 5 however the contribution of leaf n remobilization to grain n was higher in 2019 23 0 than that in 2020 18 9 therefore the contribution of total n remobilization to grain n in 2020 36 0 was greater than that in 2019 34 6 3 5 grain yield and n use efficiency grain yield in 2019 were greater than that in 2020 fig 5 grain yield significantly increased with a greater irrigation amount compared with

2019 and 2020 grain yield followed the order of uns srf u under w1 and w2 while it followed the order of srf uns u under w3 w1uns significantly increased grain yield by 22 1 and 3 6 in 2019 and 25 0 and 10 4 in 2020 compared with that in w1u and w1srf moreover w2uns significantly increased grain yield by 24 2 and 4 4 in 2019 and 15 4 and 5 3 in 2020 compared with that in w2u and w2srf the maximum grain yield in w3srf was 9739 4 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 7945 4 kg ha 1 in 2020 which were 1 0 60 3 in 2019 and 4 1 56 9 in 2020 higher than those in other treatments respectively however we did not observe significant difference between uns and srf in 2019 nue in 2019 was greater than that in 2020 fig 5 with no significant difference observed between 2019 47 96 kg kg 1 and 2020 47 26 kg kg 1 nue increased with a larger irrigation amount nue under w3 in 2019 was significantly increased compared with that in w1 and w2 but no significant difference was observed among w1 w2 and w3 in 2020 under the same irrigation amount nue followed the order of uns srf u the highest nue was obtained in w2uns 49 12 kg kg 1 in 2019 and w3uns 48 47 kg kg 1 in 2020 was increased by 0 2 6 4 and 0 5 6 0 compared with that in other treatment 3 6 residual soil no3 n after maize harvest the soil no3 n content varied from 3 81 mg kg 1 to 16 78 mg kg 1 in 2019 and from 4 47 to 17 96 mg kg 1 in 2020 fig 6 no3 n content in 0 100 cm soil layer generally decreased with the increase of irrigation amount however no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer increased with the increase of irrigation amount soil no3 n content in u was relatively homogeneous without obvious accumulation area in the 0 200 cm layer in addition soil no3 n content at a given soil depth showed an initially decreasing and then increasing trend when moving horizontally away from the drip tape soil no3 n content of uns was mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm layer and soil no3 n content of srf was mainly distributed in the 0 60 cm layer soil no3 n content in uns and srf decreased with the increase of horizontal distance from drip tape however there was a soil no3 n accumulation zone at a horizontal distance of 0 15 cm from the drip tape and at a depth of 30 cm below the soil surface in u compared with u uns increased the soil no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil layer but decreased the soil no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer especially below the drip tape compared with srf uns decreased the soil no3 n content in the 0 60 cm soil layer and there was no significant difference in the top 60 cm soil layer between uns and srf the accumulated residual soil no3 n in the 0 200 cm soil profile after maize harvest in 2020 was 9 1 13 7 higher than that in 2019 the accumulated residual soil no3 n decreased with increasing irrigation amount in 2019 and 2020 fig 7 the accumulated residual soil no3 n under w1 was 5 8 and 11 9 greater than that under w2 and w3 the accumulated residual soil no3 n followed the order of u srf uns under w1 and w2 and the order of u uns srf under w3 compared with u 192 6 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 213 4 kg ha 1 in 2020 uns and s significantly reduced accumulation residual soil no3 n by 8 3 and 5 2 in 2019 and by 6 5 and 4 4 in 2020 respectively w1u obtained the highest accumulation residual soil no3 n in both 2019 and 2020 accumulation of residual soil no3 n in w3srf was the lowest decreased by 2 2 18 4 in 2019 and 2 6 15 7 in 2020 compared with other treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation amounts and n fertilizer types on maize dry matter n uptake grain yield and nue dry matter accumulation is the guarantee of yield formation and n uptake of crop is the basis of dry matter formation wei et al 2017 qi et al 2020 in this study w3 significantly increased dry matter and n uptake of maize at various growth stages this was consistent with the finding of sarker et al 2020 who showed that dry matter accumulation was linearly related to irrigation amount and dry matter loss under water stress treatment was up to 45 compared with full irrigation these results may be due to the poor development of root system under severity water stress w1 affecting maize growth and canopy development reducing maize photosynthetic rate and ultimately affecting maize dry matter and n accumulation cirilo et al 2009 sampathkumar et al 2013 in this study the dry matter and n uptake in u and uns were higher than those in srf at the early growth stage this was because urea in u and uns was rapidly hydrolyzed by urease when applied to soil thereby providing the required n for maize zheng et al 2020 j j guo et al 2021 fan et al 2021 and ma et al 2021 also reported that like srf uns could slowly release n into soil over a long period to ensure continued n supply therefore uns could meet the n requirement of maize during the whole growth period zheng et al 2020 this also explained why uns obtained higher dry matter accumulation total n uptake grain yield and nue under w1 and w2 in addition compared with w1 and w2 w3 promoted the complete release of srf which was beneficial to dry matter accumulation and n uptake of maize thereby increased grain yield these results demonstrated that uns reduced the adverse effects of water deficit stress on maize productivity which was conducive to increase or stabilize maize yield srf could increase maize yield under sufficient irrigation sarker et al 2020 reported that irrigation water is the main driving factor of maize yield but increasing irrigation amount did not necessarily increase crop yield there were no significant improvements in maize yield when the irrigation amount was increased from 80 etc to 100 etc el hendawy et al 2008 sampathkumar et al 2013 however the grain yield in w3 100 etc was significantly increased in this study similar to the finding of abd el waheda and ali 2013 this may be due to that the experiment was conducted in a shelter without natural rainfall supplies and only w3 had no water stress 4 2 effects of irrigation amounts and n fertilizer types on pre silking n remobilization and post silking n uptake of maize organs gholamhoseini et al 2013 emphasized that n uptake by crops depended on soil moisture content once soil moisture was limited the effect of n on crops would be weakened in this study limited pro silking n uptake due to severe water stress substantially affected the n remobilization of stalks and leaves w1 reduced stalks and leaves n remobilization by about 30 and reduced stalks and leaves n remobilization efficiency by about 13 this may be due to water deficit was not conducive to the development of maize roots thereby reducing the root absorption of nitrogen from the soil sampathkumar et al 2013 this result was similar to the finding of fernandez et al 2020 who reported that n remobilization amount and n remobilization efficiency decreased in response to irrigation reduction in this study we found that maize n uptake was more affected by n fertilizer type ye et al 2013 for u post silking n uptake could not match the n demand of grain development therefore more n was remobilized from vegetative organs to grains leading to rapid senescence of leaves and reduced maize yield ning et al 2017 for srf the slow n release rate at the early growth stage led to reduced n uptake in maize stalks and leaves thereby reducing the n remobilization hu et al 2013 this result was consistent with the finding of wang et al 2012 who demonstrated that decreasing n accumulation in stalks and leaves would limit n remobilization from vegetative organs to grain which was not conducive to high grain yield in this study uns provided sufficient n for maize at early growth stages compared with srf which conducive to n remobilization from vegetative organs to grains qu et al 2020 compared with u uns prolonged the availability of n fertilizer and directly increased the maize grain n content these results may be due to the fact that uns could better meet the n demands of maize during the whole growth period j j guo et al 2021 in addition under water stressed conditions w1 and w2 n release capacity of uns was still relatively high compensating the decrease of n uptake and remobilization related to water stress which was supported by li et al 2017 in this study the post silking n uptake contribution to grain n content was about 65 while the contribution to grain n by n remobilization from vegetative organs was about 35 a linear relationship was established between post silking n uptake and grain yield fig 8a with r2 of 0 95 p 0 01 in 2019 and 0 87 p 0 01 in 2020 we also found a linear relationship between n remobilization and grain yield fig 8b with the r2 of 0 68 p 0 01 in 2019 and 0 55 p 0 01 in 2020 hence a higher grain n of maize was likely due to higher post silking n uptake he et al 2005 and pommel et al 2006 also reported that the increase of grain n firstly came from the uptake of soil n rather than n remobilization from vegetative organs at the reproductive growth stages in addition kichey et al 2007 and duan et al 2018 reported that 10 30 of n uptake was retained before silking during senescence and the remaining n was remobilized to grains these indicate that it was important to ensure n uptake during the maize growing season which could increase pro silking n remobilization and post silking n uptake which conducive to high grain yield ning et al 2017 consequently uns can be used as an optimized n fertilizer to meet maize n demand during the whole growth period fernandez et al 2020 4 3 effects of irrigation amounts and n fertilizer types on soil no3 n n leaching was driven by water transport through the soil profile jia et al 2014 thereby soil no3 n content first increased and then decreased with the increasing soil depth below the drip line soil no3 n content at the sampling points 15 cm and 30 cm from the drip tape decreased with increasing soil depth due to the n was uptake chen et al 2006 in addition soil no3 n accumulation zone of u tended to move horizontally towards the sampling site 15 cm from the drip tape with the increase of irrigation amount the no3 n directly below the drip irrigation line was easy to leach into soil depth layer with water and no3 n in the root zone was absorbed by maize therefore soil no3 n of u easily accumulated between the drip tape and maize root zone yan et al 2021 the rapid hydrolysis of conventional urea in soil solution especially when combined with irrigation resulted in a sharp increase in soil no3 n content and the risk of n loss fan et al 2021 therefore soil no3 n of u tended to move to lower soil layers than those of uns and srf especially under w3 the soil n leaching of u was increased and the soil no3 n was evenly distributed in 0 200 cm layer however soil no3 n of srf was mainly distributed in the upper soil layer this was due to the slow release coating material that impeded the water transport necessary for n dissolution in the membrane and thus slowed down the n release rate li et al 2019 moreover n release rate of uns was well synchronized with maize n uptake which reduced n losses and fully utilized the surface nitrate n j j guo et al 2021 j guo et al 2021 previous studies showed that applying more irrigation water to meet crop water demand would increase soil residual no3 n after harvest yan et al 2021 however the residual soil no3 n of w1 was greater than that of w2 and w3 in this study this was consistent with the finding of pandey et al 2000 who reported that more no3 n remained in the soil after harvest when soil water was insufficient than full irrigation treatment these results may be due to modified maize n uptake by water supply liu et al 2016 with the same n application rate excessive water deficit led to premature senescence of maize which significantly reduced n uptake and resulted in more n retention in soil rather than being absorbed by maize teixeira et al 2014 the most effective way to reduce leaching loss was to minimize soil no3 n content especially at the early growth stage zhou et al 2008 however u was applied as basal fertilizer in this study and thus irrigation led to soil no3 n leaching into soil depth layer resulting in insufficient n content in the root zone which could not be absorbed by maize lu et al 2021 this was consistent with feng et al 2015 who reported that higher soil no3 n content at the early growth stage of maize increased soil fertility but also increased the risk of no3 n leaching to groundwater because it could not be completely absorbed by maize ciampitti and vyn 2013 reported that better synchronization between maize n demand and fertilizer n supply could reduce n loss at the crop level this explained why uns and srf reduced soil no3 n accumulation by 7 4 and 4 8 compared with u and significantly decreased soil no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer therefore optimizing irrigation water and n fertilization management can not only improve crop n uptake and yield but also reduce n leaching gholamhoseini et al 2013 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that uns better synchronized soil n release with maize n demand under different irrigation amount compared with u and srf uns increased post silking n uptake 19 1 and pre silking n remobilization 15 0 of maize thereby increasing grain yield 18 3 and 2 3 uns improved wp and nue and significantly decreased residual soil no3 n w3srf obtain the maximum dry matter n uptake and grain yield but no significant difference between w3uns and w3srf therefore uns can be used as an optimizing n fertilizer to increase stabilize grain yield under deficit irrigation conditions srf can be applied to increase grain yield in regions with abundant water resources and rainfall further studies may focus on the interaction between drip irrigation and slow release n fertilizer under different n application rates and mixing ratios of u srf

post silking n uptake by 19 1 thereby enhancing grain yield by 18 3 compared with srf uns increased n remobilization from vegetative organs to grains by 15 0 thereby resulting in 2 3 increase in grain

maize is used as human food animal feed pharmaceutical and industrial manufacture which plays an important role in agricultural and industrial production abd el waheda and ali 2013 increasing maize yield is one of the important strategies of national food security q guo et al 2021 by 2050 global food demand is expected to double and sustainably feeding the growing population is thus a great challenge godfray et al 2010 zheng et al 2019 more importantly the high frequency and longer water shortage associated with climate change has reduced crop growth and food production in most agricultural regions gholamhoseini et al 2013 yu et al 2020 maize is very sensitive to water stress mainly in morphological physiological and biochemical processes aydinsakir et al 2013 water stress could slow down the growth of maize reduce maize biomass and grain number or grain weight and eventually lead to maize yield reduction payero et al 2009 in addition many reports have demonstrated that excessive irrigation not only failed to increase crop yield but also caused resource waste soil salinity and reduced soil fertility yan et al 2021 developing high efficient and water saving production technologies is required to increase maize yield while avoiding excessive water input maintaining agricultural sustainable production and improving farmland soil environment yu et al 2020 drip irrigation one of the most effective irrigation methods for crops has been widely used in crop production in water scarce regions fan et al 2017 sampathkumar et al 2013 drip irrigation can accurately control water amount to reduce water evaporation and deep leakage pablo et al 2007 this technology reduces water and fertilizer uses on crops and greatly lowers the agricultural production costs lekakis et al 2011 wu et al 2019 previous studies have shown that drip irrigation significantly increased crop yield and wp li et al 2019 pablo et al 2007 sampathkumar and pandian 2011 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2021 n also plays an important role in achieving the maximum potential yield of maize j j guo et al 2021 similar with water inputs excessive n application causes waste of resources and greatly pollutes agricultural and ecological environment zhang et al 2016 therefore optimizing n management has been an important approach to balance n use efficiency nue and crop yield duan et al 2019 ma et al 2021 traditional urea u is usually applied as basal fertilizer resulting in n surplus at the early maize growth stage and increasing the risk of soil no3 n leaching zheng et al 2020 besides u could not satisfy the maize demand for n at the late growth stage which was not conducive to grain filling and thus reduced grain yield feng et al 2015 fernandez et al 2020 found that increasing n availability at the late growth stage of crop was to synchronize maize n demand of crop with soil n supply liu et al 2020 found that slow release n fertilizer srf impeded the water transport necessary for urea dissolution in the membrane by coating materials thereby prolonging the effectiveness of n fertilizer therefore srf could delay the release of n to meet the crop demand for n at the late growth stages zhang et al 2019 fan et al 2021 also reported that the mixture of urea and slow release n fertilizer uns could reduce soil n supply when crop absorption capacity was low and improve soil fertility during the period of high crop n demand uns could better match crop demand for n greatly reduced the risk of n loss to the environment li et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 moreover uns can be used as basal fertilizer due to its n release rate being synchronized with crop n uptake which not only saves labor and time but also increases maize yield economic return and nue guo et al 2017 garcia et al 2018 therefore with the development of effective and environmentally friendly fertilizers uns has been an optimized n fertilizer strategy that is extensively applied to

two primary sources of grain n content at maturity ciampitti and vyn 2013 li et al 2017 previous studies showed that increased n supply at the early stage of maize could increase n uptake by maize vegetative organs promoting n remobilization from vegetative organs to grains he et al 1998 huang et al 2007 found that prolonging the availability of n fertilizer could increase maize post silking n uptake delay leaf senescence maintain photosynthetic activity and thus improve grain yield however fowler 2003 reported that increasing n supply may be not useful for the ultimate formation of grain yield due to the intensified nutrient competition between vegetative organs and grains cui et al 2010 and sun et al 2020 reported that synchronized soil n supply with maize n demand could avoid grain yield reduction and environmental pollution caused by insufficient or excessive n in maize production lu et al 2021 reported that reducing soil no3 n leaching losses improving crop yield and nue with effective water and n management strategies were extremely important for sustainable agricultural development nitrate leaching losses mainly depend on the concentration of no3 n in soil solution and soil moisture content jia et al 2014 the residual no3 n in soil depends on the n input and crop n uptake a negligible amount of fertilizer n remains in soil at harvest when applying suitable water and n regimes that match plant demand wu et al 2019 li et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to explore scientific water and n management strategies to reduce n losses while maintaining high yield the interaction of water and n fertilizer urea or slow release n fertilizer has been demonstrated to promote crop growth increase n uptake and yield ye et al 2013 lu et al 2021 yan et al 2021 however the effects of irrigation water and uns on n uptake and remobilization as well as grain yield and residual soil no3 n of maize are rarely reported compared with traditional water and n strategies the interaction between drip irrigation and uns on maize production in arid and semi arid regions is still unclear the objectives of this study were thus to 1 investigate the effects of drip irrigation n fertilizer types and their interaction on maize growth n uptake grain yield and residual soil no3 n 2 explore the source of grain n content and its response to n uptake and n remobilization under various water and n management 3 provide a new direction for optimizing maize water and n fertilizer management in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field

grain n in u and uns was higher than that in srf but no significant difference was obtained in stalk the contribution of stalk n remobilization to grain n was higher in 2020 17 1 than that in 2019 11 5 however the contribution of leaf n remobilization to grain n was higher in 2019 23 0 than that in 2020 18 9 therefore the contribution of total n remobilization to grain n in 2020 36 0 was greater than that in 2019 34 6 3 5 grain yield and n use efficiency grain yield in 2019 were greater than that in 2020 fig 5 grain yield significantly increased with a greater irrigation amount compared with

2019 and 2020 grain yield followed the order of uns srf u under w1 and w2 while it followed the order of srf uns u under w3 w1uns significantly increased grain yield by 22 1 and 3 6 in 2019 and 25 0 and 10 4 in 2020 compared with that in w1u and w1srf moreover w2uns significantly increased grain yield by 24 2 and 4 4 in 2019 and 15 4 and 5 3 in 2020 compared with that in w2u and w2srf the maximum grain yield in w3srf was 9739 4 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 7945 4 kg ha 1 in 2020 which were 1 0 60 3 in 2019 and 4 1 56 9 in 2020 higher than those in other treatments respectively however we did not observe significant difference between uns and srf in 2019 nue in 2019 was greater than that in 2020 fig 5 with no significant difference observed between 2019 47 96 kg kg 1 and 2020 47 26 kg kg 1 nue increased with a larger irrigation amount nue under w3 in 2019 was significantly increased compared with that in w1 and w2 but no significant difference was observed among w1 w2 and w3 in 2020 under the same irrigation amount nue followed the order of uns srf u the highest nue was obtained in w2uns 49 12 kg kg 1 in 2019 and w3uns 48 47 kg kg 1 in 2020 was increased by 0 2 6 4 and 0 5 6 0 compared with that in other treatment 3 6 residual soil no3 n after maize harvest the soil no3 n content varied from 3 81 mg kg 1 to 16 78 mg kg 1 in 2019 and from 4 47 to 17 96 mg kg 1 in 2020 fig 6 no3 n content in 0 100 cm soil layer generally decreased with the increase of irrigation amount however no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer increased with the increase of irrigation amount soil no3 n content in u was relatively homogeneous without obvious accumulation area in the 0 200 cm layer in addition soil no3 n content at a given soil depth showed an initially decreasing and then increasing trend when moving horizontally away from the drip tape soil no3 n content of uns was mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm layer and soil no3 n content of srf was mainly distributed in the 0 60 cm layer soil no3 n content in uns and srf decreased with the increase of horizontal distance from drip tape however there was a soil no3 n accumulation zone at a horizontal distance of 0 15 cm from the drip tape and at a depth of 30 cm below the soil surface in u compared with u uns increased the soil no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil layer but decreased the soil no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer especially below the drip tape compared with srf uns decreased the soil no3 n content in the 0 60 cm soil layer and there was no significant difference in the top 60 cm soil layer between uns and srf the accumulated residual soil no3 n in the 0 200 cm soil profile after maize harvest in 2020 was 9 1 13 7 higher than that in 2019 the accumulated residual soil no3 n decreased with increasing irrigation amount in 2019 and 2020 fig 7 the accumulated residual soil no3 n under w1 was 5 8 and 11 9 greater than that under w2 and w3 the accumulated residual soil no3 n followed the order of u srf uns under w1 and w2 and the order of u uns srf under w3 compared with u 192 6 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 213 4 kg ha 1 in 2020 uns and s significantly reduced accumulation residual soil no3 n by 8 3 and 5 2 in 2019 and by 6 5 and 4 4 in 2020 respectively w1u obtained the highest accumulation residual soil no3 n in both 2019 and 2020 accumulation of residual soil no3 n in w3srf was the lowest decreased by 2 2 18 4 in 2019 and 2 6 15 7 in 2020 compared with other treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation amounts and n fertilizer types on maize dry matter n uptake grain yield and nue dry matter accumulation is the guarantee of yield formation and n uptake of crop is the basis of dry matter formation wei et al 2017 qi et al 2020 in this study w3 significantly increased dry matter and n uptake of maize at various growth stages this was consistent with the finding of sarker et al 2020 who showed that dry matter accumulation was linearly related to irrigation amount and dry matter loss under water stress treatment was up to 45 compared with full irrigation these results may be due to the poor development of root system under severity water stress w1 affecting maize growth and canopy development reducing maize photosynthetic rate and ultimately affecting maize dry matter and n accumulation cirilo et al 2009 sampathkumar et al 2013 in this study the dry matter and n uptake in u and uns were higher than those in srf at the early growth stage this was because urea in u and uns was rapidly hydrolyzed by urease when applied to soil thereby providing the required n for maize zheng et al 2020 j j guo et al 2021 fan et al 2021 and ma et al 2021 also reported that like srf uns could slowly release n into soil over a long period to ensure continued n supply therefore uns could meet the n requirement of maize during the whole growth period zheng et al 2020 this also explained why uns obtained higher dry matter accumulation total n uptake grain yield and nue under w1 and w2 in addition compared with w1 and w2 w3 promoted the complete release of srf which was beneficial to dry matter accumulation and n uptake of maize thereby increased grain yield these results demonstrated that uns reduced the adverse effects of water deficit stress on maize productivity which was conducive to increase or stabilize maize yield srf could increase maize yield under sufficient irrigation sarker et al 2020 reported that irrigation water is the main driving factor of maize yield but increasing irrigation amount did not necessarily increase crop yield there were no significant improvements in maize yield when the irrigation amount was increased from 80 etc to 100 etc el hendawy et al 2008 sampathkumar et al 2013 however the grain yield in w3 100 etc was significantly increased in this study similar to the finding of abd el waheda and ali 2013 this may be due to that the experiment was conducted in a shelter without natural rainfall supplies and only w3 had no water stress 4 2 effects of irrigation amounts and n fertilizer types on pre silking n remobilization and post silking n uptake of maize organs gholamhoseini et al 2013 emphasized that n uptake by crops depended on soil moisture content once soil moisture was limited the effect of n on crops would be weakened in this study limited pro silking n uptake due to severe water stress substantially affected the n remobilization of stalks and leaves w1 reduced stalks and leaves n remobilization by about 30 and reduced stalks and leaves n remobilization efficiency by about 13 this may be due to water deficit was not conducive to the development of maize roots thereby reducing the root absorption of nitrogen from the soil sampathkumar et al 2013 this result was similar to the finding of fernandez et al 2020 who reported that n remobilization amount and n remobilization efficiency decreased in response to irrigation reduction in this study we found that maize n uptake was more affected by n fertilizer type ye et al 2013 for u post silking n uptake could not match the n demand of grain development therefore more n was remobilized from vegetative organs to grains leading to rapid senescence of leaves and reduced maize yield ning et al 2017 for srf the slow n release rate at the early growth stage led to reduced n uptake in maize stalks and leaves thereby reducing the n remobilization hu et al 2013 this result was consistent with the finding of wang et al 2012 who demonstrated that decreasing n accumulation in stalks and leaves would limit n remobilization from vegetative organs to grain which was not conducive to high grain yield in this study uns provided sufficient n for maize at early growth stages compared with srf which conducive to n remobilization from vegetative organs to grains qu et al 2020 compared with u uns prolonged the availability of n fertilizer and directly increased the maize grain n content these results may be due to the fact that uns could better meet the n demands of maize during the whole growth period j j guo et al 2021 in addition under water stressed conditions w1 and w2 n release capacity of uns was still relatively high compensating the decrease of n uptake and remobilization related to water stress which was supported by li et al 2017 in this study the post silking n uptake contribution to grain n content was about 65 while the contribution to grain n by n remobilization from vegetative organs was about 35 a linear relationship was established between post silking n uptake and grain yield fig 8a with r2 of 0 95 p 0 01 in 2019 and 0 87 p 0 01 in 2020 we also found a linear relationship between n remobilization and grain yield fig 8b with the r2 of 0 68 p 0 01 in 2019 and 0 55 p 0 01 in 2020 hence a higher grain n of maize was likely due to higher post silking n uptake he et al 2005 and pommel et al 2006 also reported that the increase of grain n firstly came from the uptake of soil n rather than n remobilization from vegetative organs at the reproductive growth stages in addition kichey et al 2007 and duan et al 2018 reported that 10 30 of n uptake was retained before silking during senescence and the remaining n was remobilized to grains these indicate that it was important to ensure n uptake during the maize growing season which could increase pro silking n remobilization and post silking n uptake which conducive to high grain yield ning et al 2017 consequently uns can be used as an optimized n fertilizer to meet maize n demand during the whole growth period fernandez et al 2020 4 3 effects of irrigation amounts and n fertilizer types on soil no3 n n leaching was driven by water transport through the soil profile jia et al 2014 thereby soil no3 n content first increased and then decreased with the increasing soil depth below the drip line soil no3 n content at the sampling points 15 cm and 30 cm from the drip tape decreased with increasing soil depth due to the n was uptake chen et al 2006 in addition soil no3 n accumulation zone of u tended to move horizontally towards the sampling site 15 cm from the drip tape with the increase of irrigation amount the no3 n directly below the drip irrigation line was easy to leach into soil depth layer with water and no3 n in the root zone was absorbed by maize therefore soil no3 n of u easily accumulated between the drip tape and maize root zone yan et al 2021 the rapid hydrolysis of conventional urea in soil solution especially when combined with irrigation resulted in a sharp increase in soil no3 n content and the risk of n loss fan et al 2021 therefore soil no3 n of u tended to move to lower soil layers than those of uns and srf especially under w3 the soil n leaching of u was increased and the soil no3 n was evenly distributed in 0 200 cm layer however soil no3 n of srf was mainly distributed in the upper soil layer this was due to the slow release coating material that impeded the water transport necessary for n dissolution in the membrane and thus slowed down the n release rate li et al 2019 moreover n release rate of uns was well synchronized with maize n uptake which reduced n losses and fully utilized the surface nitrate n j j guo et al 2021 j guo et al 2021 previous studies showed that applying more irrigation water to meet crop water demand would increase soil residual no3 n after harvest yan et al 2021 however the residual soil no3 n of w1 was greater than that of w2 and w3 in this study this was consistent with the finding of pandey et al 2000 who reported that more no3 n remained in the soil after harvest when soil water was insufficient than full irrigation treatment these results may be due to modified maize n uptake by water supply liu et al 2016 with the same n application rate excessive water deficit led to premature senescence of maize which significantly reduced n uptake and resulted in more n retention in soil rather than being absorbed by maize teixeira et al 2014 the most effective way to reduce leaching loss was to minimize soil no3 n content especially at the early growth stage zhou et al 2008 however u was applied as basal fertilizer in this study and thus irrigation led to soil no3 n leaching into soil depth layer resulting in insufficient n content in the root zone which could not be absorbed by maize lu et al 2021 this was consistent with feng et al 2015 who reported that higher soil no3 n content at the early growth stage of maize increased soil fertility but also increased the risk of no3 n leaching to groundwater because it could not be completely absorbed by maize ciampitti and vyn 2013 reported that better synchronization between maize n demand and fertilizer n supply could reduce n loss at the crop level this explained why uns and srf reduced soil no3 n accumulation by 7 4 and 4 8 compared with u and significantly decreased soil no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer therefore optimizing irrigation water and n fertilization management can not only improve crop n uptake and yield but also reduce n leaching gholamhoseini et al 2013 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that uns better synchronized soil n release with maize n demand under different irrigation amount compared with u and srf uns increased post silking n uptake 19 1 and pre silking n remobilization 15 0 of maize thereby increasing grain yield 18 3 and 2 3 uns improved wp and nue and significantly decreased residual soil no3 n w3srf obtain the maximum dry matter n uptake and grain yield but no significant difference between w3uns and w3srf therefore uns can be used as an optimizing n fertilizer to increase stabilize grain yield under deficit irrigation conditions srf can be applied to increase grain yield in regions with abundant water resources and rainfall further studies may focus on the interaction between drip irrigation and slow release n fertilizer under different n application rates and mixing ratios of u srf
