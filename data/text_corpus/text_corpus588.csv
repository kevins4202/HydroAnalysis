2940,with the recent warming trend over europe and the arctic the nordic regions have experienced more frequent and damaging extreme hydrological events which are anticipated to increase towards the end of the 21st century despite explicit trends large variations have been observed across basins and regions when it comes to precipitation and floods hinting at a strong natural hydroclimatic variability that further complicates any assessment of potential future changes in this study we aim to better understand how climate variability links with the current extremes and future projections of floods in norway in the context of the last millennium and the future specifically we simulate over 1000 years 850 2099 daily discharge and floods at 34 catchments over five regions of norway from the last millennium including a warm period and a cold period 850 1849 to the end of the 21st century by an ensemble model chain method including four global climate models gcms two bias correction methods and two hydrological models the modelling results show i all gcms except miroc esm simulate a higher mean temperature in medieval climate anomaly mca period than little ice age lia period while simulated annual precipitation varies a lot in different gcms and catchments ii no significant change of flood characteristics during the last millennium from ensemble mean results iii in future we will have an extraordinary shift in flood seasonality and generating processes and flood frequency increase in most of the study catchments in norway and iv climate projections represent the largest contribution to overall uncertainty in the projected changes in hydrological extremes for most of the catchments keywords flood changes climate variability seasonality last millennium future norway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 floods in past 1000 climate global warming has led to an accelerated hydrological cycle which has been manifested by more intense precipitation benestad 2013 as well as changes in runoff regimes this is for instance evident in the shifting seasonality of snow accumulation and snow melt at high latitudes and altitudes dyrrdal et al 2013 such changes are likely to influence river floods throughout the year and in fact several studies have detected significant changes in the flood sizes flood generating processes and seasonality across europe with new spatial patterns emerging hall et al 2014 blöschl et al 2019 2020 in regions with seasonal snow covers a warmer climate can lead to a transition in flood generating processes from what earlier would tend to be more snowmelt driven towards more rain driven floods such as sustained shift in seasonality would tend to more frequent autumn winter floods dyrrdal et al 2013 hanssen bauer et al 2009 floods driven by rain are predicted to increase until the end of the 21st century whereas the trend for snowmelt floods will reverse according to lawrence 2020 for northern europe a negative trend in the spring summer flood events is observed and explained by a decline in the frequency of summer rain and snowmelt events hundecha et al 2020 beyond the noted variability in flood magnitudes and frequencies changes in both flood generating processes and seasonality of floods are of crucial importance for advancing the present understanding of how climate change impacts on flooding however flood events with long return periods seldom appear in the series of observed data hirabayashi et al 2013 the most important thing is that it is hard to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of climate change on observed floods due to the shortage of hydrological station with long observational datasets sheng et al 2020 milliman and farnsworth 2013 therefore large uncertainties exist in the predictions of the frequency and magnitudes of future flood events due to these short records holmes and dinicola 2010 yang and yin 2018 and detecting non stationarities in these time series is often challenging wirth et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 therefore new approaches to analyze flood characteristics during the past are necessary to detect the connections between floods and other climate characteristics e g støren and paasche 2014 this knowledge can further be used to predict the risk of future flood disasters and main control factors more effectively one approach to analyzing floods during the past is to use riverine or lacustrine sedimentological records and historical flood level records at bridges stones and so on to infer the variability of floods over the past and this domain is now known as paleoflood hydrology baker 2008 benito and o connor 2013 li et al 2013 tombrink 2017 however sedimentary records are affected by different ranges of flooding magnitudes and frequencies magilligan et al 1998 sambrook smith et al 2010 and using sedimentary records only to precisely distinguish floods of different sizes and quantify the magnitude and frequency of past 1000 floods is a great challenge sambrook smith et al 2010 moreover the limited records of historical flood level are not enough to reconstruct a complete flood sequence consequently complementary approaches are needed to realize the characteristics of flood events for those periods without instrumental records numerical modeling is a complementary approach that can be used to reconstruct river discharge over a long term period syvitski and morehead 1999 in order to reconstruct maximum annual discharges sheng et al 2020 used the echo g climate model output and the hydrotrend hydrological model to generate daily discharge of yalu river basin during 1000 2012 in their paper they used the records of historical flood frequency to verify model performance where the number of flood disasters was compared between historical data and model simulations to better assess the future projections of hydrology under ongoing global warming scenarios studies have been carried out on the past climate of the last interglacial lig 129 to 116 kyr ago which was somewhat warmer than the present climate the lig it can be argued has a special relevance to the future because of its proximity in geological time and its partial temperature analogy with possible futures scussolini et al 2020 scussolini et al 2020 investigated lig hydrology including mean annual lig runoff discharge and 100 yr floods based on the hydrological model pcr globwb and hydrodynamic model cama flood with daily output of preindustrial and lig simulations from eight new climate models they found that lig positive negative discharge anomalies agree with future projections from the cmip3 and cmip5 models for certain areas compared to preindustrial discharge the annual mean lig discharge and 100 yr flood volume was considerably larger in the northern hemisphere these studies only dealt with 100 year floods without considering if different flood quantiles e g floods with 10 year or 1000 year return period have a similar variability in the northern hemisphere paleoclimatic reconstructions identify two periods with a distinct difference in climate during the 1000 recent years a warm period called the medieval climate anomaly mca during 950 1250 and a cold period known as the little ice age lia during 1500 1800 mann et al 2009 this transition from the warm mca to the cold lia period provides a welcome opportunity to investigate the response of floods to changes in climate and look for the relationship between climate and hydrology floods the context of the past millennium provides an extended temporal window for framing for future scenarios which is precisely what we have provided here 1 2 floods in future climate to quantify and evaluate climate change impacts global climate models gcm have not only been widely used to simulate the past 1000 climate but also used to project future climates the precipitation and temperature derived from gcms are however biased and typically have a coarse spatial resolution that can be limiting for regional and local scale hydrological modeling akhtar et al 2008 yoo and na 2017 this limitation compels post processing of the gcms outputs if one is to connect output from large scale climate models with local hydrological modelling maraun et al 2010 chen et al 2011 many studies show that the use of bias corrected gcm data as input to hydrological models could improve runoff simulation for catchments pierce et al 2015 hakala et al 2018 hakala et al 2018 confirmed the importance of bias correction bc method and demonstrated that quantile mapping method improved the gcm rcm precipitation cycle temperature and discharge simulations in all the considered catchments two classes of downscaling techniques i e dynamical and statistical downscaling methods are often employed to correct the gcm outputs regional climate models rcms are used for dynamical downscaling some recent studies using rcm outputs highlight the need for proper evaluation before the use of rcms owing to the limited process descriptions biased fluxes at the boundaries of rcm and numerical approximations for example lorenz et al 2017 found that the precipitation of cordex africa rcms shows a bias in the distribution of rainfall intensities and wet day frequencies over west africa in addition singh et al 2017 compared nine rcms with their host gcms and found no consistent improvement in the rcms for simulating indian monsoon rainfall statistical approaches are often used to bias correct gcms and rcms outputs that are subsequently used for hydrological modeling because they are computationally cheap and relatively easy to apply to minimize biases fang et al 2015 smitha et al 2018 two commonly used empirical statistical methods include change factor and bias correction approaches ho et al 2012 change factor approaches suppose that climate models make reasonable projections for the climate change signal ccs and assume constant interannual variability in the future the ccs will tend to match that of the underlying climate model bias correction methods suppose that the established mapping relationship between observed and modeled variables for the reference period could be used for the future period chen et al 2013 indicated that there are some differences for cumulative distribution functions of annual precipitation changes bias corrected by these two approaches to take into account the uncertainty introduced by bc method we chose here a change factor approach distribution delta mapping ddm and a bias correction approach daily bias correction dbc in the study besides previous studies demonstrated that for discharge simulation the gcm related uncertainty was the main contributor followed by hydrological model uncertainty chen et al 2011 chan et al 2020 besides uncertainty from downscaling methods is also non negligible sharma et al 2018 therefore four gcms and two hydrological models are also considered in the study climate projections predict that temperatures and precipitation in norway at the end of the 21st century will increase by 2 3 4 6 c and 5 30 respectively hanssen bauer et al 2009 for mountainous and nordic regions it is worth noting that changes in the ratio of snowfall to precipitation due to temperature rise are of chief importance because they have direct impacts on flood seasonality and generating processes several previous studies have investigated the climate change impacts on the hydrology of nordic regions e g veijalainen et al 2010 lawrence and haddeland 2011 lawrence 2020 lawrence and haddeland 2011 found for instance that the magnitude of 200 year flood in western and coastal area of norway rainfall dominated will increase whereas the floods dominated by snowmelt in inland regions and some parts of northern regions are expected to decrease in the future blöschl et al 2011 considered that more attention should be given to seasonal changes in floods rather than just the magnitude and frequency of floods correspondingly changes in the flood generating processes are also key to understanding the direction increase vs decrease of future floods due to climate change along these lines vormoor et al 2015 show that autumn winter events become more frequent in six norwegian catchments and for two catchments located in northern and south eastern norway a shift from spring summer to autumn winter was observed where increasing rainfall was identified as the main flood generating process in other words rainfall will replace snowmelt as dominant flood generating process because of rising temperature in warming climates all studies that use gcms and hydrological models to address the impact of climate change on floods in norway only focus on the future this study is the first to apply climate model outputs from the past 1000 years to gain knowledge on the links between floods and climate during past 1000 years and thereby provide complementary information to paleo flood studies based on sediment cores 1 3 objectives this study aims to address the following research questions 1 what are the changes in flood characteristics i e seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency for the past and the future at a longer timescale 850 2099 in norway 2 can the last 100 years instrumental measurements 1900 present of river discharge represent discharge and flood variability over a long term period of more than 1 000 years 3 how much are the contributions of the different sources e g gcms hydrological models and bc methods to the ensemble spread of modeling flood changes for the past and the future in order to answer the three questions above we investigated the daily discharge and floods using a modeling chain consisting of four gcms two bc methods and two hydrological models over 1250 years covering the last millennium period past 1000 850 1849 historical period historical 1850 2005 and future period both representative concentration pathway 2 6 and representative concentration pathway 8 5 2006 2099 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area due to the high latitude mountainous topography and location on the west side of the scandinavian peninsula the hydroclimate of norway is diverse covering many different spatial patterns the average annual temperature on the southwest coast is 7 7 and the average annual temperature is 3 in the inland areas of northern norway and the high altitude areas in central norway hanssen bauer et al 2009 the mean annual precipitation varies from approximately 300 mm in northeastern and central norway to more than 3500 mm in western norway hanssen bauer et al 2009 western norway has the most precipitation in autumn and winter while the inland areas of the east have the most precipitation in summer there are three basic runoff regimes in norway gottschalk et al 1979 1 snowmelt is the main runoff generating process which is affected by snowpack volumes and the snow season because of different regional temperature regimes 2 rainfall is another important runoff generating process and 3 mixed rainfall and snowmelt runoff regimes also exist 34 catchments selected in our study reflect the variability of these three runoff regimes the catchments are all included in the studies of vormoor et al 2016 and lawrence 2020 which listed the dominant flood generating processes in 140 and 115 catchments of norway respectively hence changes in the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation due to temperature rise have direct implications for both flood seasonality and the dominant flood generating process it is worth noting that the inland and northernmost parts of norway have large spring and summer flows mainly owing to snowmelt while western norway and coastal areas have the highest flows in autumn and winter due to heavy rainfall vormoor et al 2016 in addition catchments partially covered by glaciers can be affected by glacier melt in late summer the locations of the 34 catchments used in this study and five regions in norway are shown in fig 1 there are six regions finnmark nordland trøndelag vestlandet sørlandet and østlandet defined by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve pettersson 2012 in our study finnmark and nordland are merged as north region trøndelag vestlandet sørlandet and østlandet are named as middle west south and east region in the paper according to their geographical location other catchment characteristics including area elevation and land cover are given in table 1 in the latest national climate report these runoff areas are also used as reference areas for observing runoff changes and analyzing future changes based on climate model projections hanssen bauer et al 2015 dahl and pedersen 2021 in this study we have chosen catchments of different sizes and no or minor impacts of river regulations on floods since flood seasonality and generation processes is mainly influenced by reservoirs and not run of river hydro plants we used the regulation degree of a catchment calculated by dividing the total regulated reservoir volume by the mean annual runoff to assess the impact of river regulations however the regulation impact is actually hard to avoid when so many catchments were chosen covering five regions all over norway for example elverum and losna with a regulation degree of 10 and 14 respectively were chosen in these catchments we might expect limited impact from dam reservoir regulations which may result in uncertainty of their discharge simulations in addition we keep austenå in the south of norway basin with a regulation degree of 6 because the number of catchments in this region is fewer than others the changes of flood regimes i e flood seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency at a basin scale will be analyzed and the results will be integrated in the five regions 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate model data we used the daily precipitation and temperature data from four cmip5 gcms to simulate daily discharge table 2 and four cmip5 experiments including the paleo climate simulation 850 1849 past 1000 20th century simulation 1850 2005 historical and two scenarios into the future 2006 2099 rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 were used table 3 in the past 1000 simulation the time evolving forcings include solar changes volcanic aerosols well mixed greenhouse gases land use and orbital parameters lewis 2018 however the values of ozone and anthropogenic aerosols are same as in the pre industrial experiment the historical simulations start from the pre industrial run and use the data of external forcing from the mid 19th century to the present to be specific the external forcings include greenhouse gases aerosols ozone solar and volcanic activities huo et al 2020 the representative concentration pathway scenarios used are rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 peters et al 2013 the values after rcp indicating the assumed radiative forcing by 2100 are 2 6 and 8 5 w m2 respectively it is worth noting that there is no volcanic forcing in future scenarios and other forcings including greenhouse gases aerosols ozone scenarios and solar are changing over time in this study the cmip5 gcms where data were available for all experiments were used including bcc csm1 1 miroc esm mri cgcm3 and ccsm4 2 2 2 observed data we used the senorge2 daily observational gridded dataset i e precipitation and temperature 1 km of grid spacing over norway for 1957 2012 lussana and tveito 2017 as input data for the hydrological modeling additionally senorge2 dataset was also used as observed data for the baseline period for calibration validation of the bc methods daily discharge data from 34 selected gauge stations distributed across norway were made available by the national hydrological database at the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve most of the catchments are not affected by dam construction or regulation and only three of them elverum losna and austenå have river regulations that might impact low flows and floods furthermore the observed discharge data series between 1957 and 2012 helped ensure a robust calibration and validation of the hydrological models 3 methods 3 1 model chain method the analyses of changes in flood seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency from 850 to 2099 are based on an ensemble model chain consisting of i four cmip5 gcm models ii two bc methods including ddm and dbc and iii two hydrological models including hydrologiska byråns vattenbalans model hbv and xin anjiang model xaj the contributions from the different modeling components of the model chain will be investigated and discussed in the study the subsections below describe the individual components of the model chain in detail 3 2 bias correction methods to study the uncertainty of bc methods two different types methods including dbc a bias correction method and ddm a change factor method were used in this study for the dbc a transfer function between the gcm outputs of the reference period and observations is applied to correct the gcm outputs for the future period for the ddm the change from reference to future period projected by the gcm is applied to the observations besides the precipitation and temperature extremes are chosen to fit general pareto distribution in ddm approach because the major variable of our interest is extreme streamflow this method was chosen to be compared with dbc both bc methods were calibrated for the reference period of 1957 2005 and these two methods were used to correct time series of past 1000 and future modeling data 850 2099 per 50 years for precipitation and temperature the past 1000 and future gcm data were all bias corrected by historical observations the details of two methods are shown as follow 3 2 1 daily bias correction dbc the dbc method chen et al 2011 is a quantile based method that corrects the precipitation frequency and quantity this method involves two steps 1 a wet day threshold is determined from the gcm simulated daily precipitation series for each month to ensure that the frequency of precipitation occurrence of corrected data for the reference period matches that of the observed data 2 the ratio between observed and gcm simulated precipitation during the reference period is calculated for the 1st percentile to the 100th percentile and subsequently each daily value of the future and past 1000 time series is multiplied by the factor for the corresponding percentile the second step is applied to correct the temperature however instead of using ratios the difference in temperature for each percentile between observed and gcm simulated data at the reference period is added to the future and past 1000 time series the formulas for adjusted daily precipitation p and temperature t for the future period are shown in equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p o b s p e r c p ref p e r c 2 t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs p e r c t ref p e r c where p adj f u t d and p gcm f u t d represent the adjusted and raw gcm precipitation respectively for day d in the future period p obs p e r c and p ref p e r c represent the daily observed and raw gcm precipitation respectively for the reference period for the specified percentile perc in addition the t means air temperature 3 2 2 distribution delta mapping ddm the ddm method was used for correcting the gcm data of future scenarios through the scaling of the observed daily precipitation and temperature data given in kelvin with the following three steps equations 3 6 for precipitation as an example 1 fit gamma for precipitation or normal for temperature cumulative distribution function to the observed data and future modeling data 2 fit general pareto cumulative distribution function to the observed data and future modeling data above the threshold given by the chosen percentile 3 map the future modeling data onto the observations to obtain p obs g c m r e f f u t using the inverse cumulative distribution function eqs 3 and 4 and pr gcm f u t d represents the percentiles 4 a scaling factor δ gcm d is calculated for each percentile of the cumulative distribution function based on changes between the gcm future and reference daily values eq 5 and 5 the scaling factor is then multiplied for precipitation or added for temperature to the observed data eq 6 the wet day frequency of precipitation occurrence is also corrected with the same procedure of dbc in addition it is worth noting that the extreme values of precipitation and temperature are selected to fit a different distribution in this approach daily precipitation larger than the 90th percentile is defined as extreme values the given percentiles for high and low temperatures are 90 and 10 respectively this method is very similar to the method used in the study of cannon et al 2015 3 pr gcm f u t d gamma gcm f u t p gcm f u t d 4 p

lumped conceptual hydrological models i e the hbv and xaj models forced by bias corrected gcm data were used for analyzing the impacts of climate change at the catchment scale the hbv model was originally developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi bergström 1976 and has since been widely used the model version applied in this study follows the structure and formulas of the hbv light version consisting of four main components a snow accumulation and melt routine a soil moisture accounting routine a response routine and a river routing routine seibert and vis 2012 yang et al 2020 the xaj model has been broadly used in humid and subhumid areas in many countries including norway and has also been recommended by the world meteorological organization to all countries in the world zhao 1992 zeng et al 2016 the hydrological processes of this model consist of four sections evapotranspiration runoff production separation of runoff components and flow routing which are related to 15 parameters zhao 1992 and we coupled a degree day snow module with xaj which is consistent with the snow routine of hbv there are some differences between these two models firstly storage capacity curve is introduced into the xaj model to consider the spatial distribution of storage capacity however a response routine of the hbv model is generalized as a two layer reservoir to calculate runoff secondly for the simulation of evaporation the xaj model uses a three layer evaporation model but the hbv model adopts a one layer model in the study we chose two conceptual hydrological models because they produce acceptable results and only require daily precipitation and air temperature as input data which typically are easy to access xaj and hbv models are chosen from the conceptual model s category because of their widespread application by the way the available meteorological variables at a daily timescale from the past 1000 experiments of cmip5 are only precipitation and temperature which limits the selection of hydrological models the two hydrological models were calibrated at each catchment using area averaged daily precipitation and temperature from senorge2 data and observed discharge data during 1958 2002 and validated on the period 2003 2012 to minimize the impact of the initial condition on model performance a warm up period was set to one year before the calibration period because the best performing parameter set would be used to simulate discharge data during a long term period of 1 250 years longer calibration period is helpful to cover more relevant processes merz et al 2009 the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua see duan et al 1992 which is a popular global optimization algorithm was used for calibrating both hydrological models automatically the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function to match the simulated discharge to the observed discharge the percentage of bias p b i a s as calculated in equation 7 was also used for evaluation and comparison 7 p b i a s q sim t q obs t q obs t 100 3 4 period division two distinctly different climatic excursions are commonly recognized during the past 1000 years they include the warm interval from ad 950 1250 known as the medieval climate anomaly mca and the cool centennial interval from ce 1500 1800 better known as the little ice age lia e g matthews and briffa 2005 mann et al 2009 to statistically compare the changes of flood events in those two climate periods we divided the past 1000 years into the two subperiods according to the ensemble variability in temperature for all gcms due to the large differences among the gcms the uncertainty of the statistical analysis for extreme discharge is significantly affected by the number of samples i e the length of time period therefore the length of discharge data series from different experiments should be the same in this case we divided the 1250 year into 4 periods with equal length 962 1055 within the mca past1 1562 1655 within the lia past2 1912 2005 history and 2006 2099 future 3 5 flood analysis and change 3 5 1 changes of flood seasonality the annual maximum discharge am was used to analyze the floods to reflect the basic flood regimes of extreme events we defined two seasons i the spring summer flood related to snowmelt as the primary flood generating process from march to august and ii the autumn winter flood associated with rainfall as the most important flood generating process from september to february to quantify the seasonality of flood events we used a seasonality index s d defined by vormoor et al 2015 8 s d am sep f e b am all am mar a u g am all where the first and second terms describe the ratio of the number of flood events during september february or march august over the total number of flood events respectively the index ranges from 1 to 1 negative values indicate that spring summer floods are more frequent whereas positive values suggest more frequent events in autumn winter s d was calculated for each ensemble member for the four periods 3 5 2 changes of flood generating processes we analyzed the relative contribution of rainfall and snowmelt for each flood event using the runoff components simulated by the hbv and xaj models in a time window of 3 days prior to each flood event the total simulated snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff were extracted from both models and used to estimate the relative contribution of each component in our study in addition we tested the impact of different time windows of 7 and 11 days with 3 and 5 days prior and after a flood peak for all catchments respectively it shows that there is not a major impact on the results from different time windows the uncertainty is 10 and it doesn t change the main results of flood classification in the method the floods were classified into i rainfall if more than 2 3 of the flood water originated from rain ii mixed if between 1 3 and 2 3 of the flood water originated from rain and iii snowmelt if 1 3 of the flood water originated from rainfall subsequently the ratios for rainfall snowmelt and mixed generated events relative to all events were calculated for all the catchments and for all four identified periods changes in the ratios will indicate corresponding changes in flood generating processes in different catchments from the past 1000 to future periods we should also note that this averaged three day time window for all the catchments may result in the uncertainty of the snowmelt vs rain contribution comparing with reality however in the study we are most interested in the changes during the different phases of past 1000 historical future period so the averaged time window allows us to have a consistent comparison in the study for different time periods as well as climate conditions 3 5 3 flood magnitude and frequency analysis at different extreme levels we fitted the annual maximum discharge to the generalized extreme value gev distribution to estimate the flood discharge for selected return periods gev distribution has been widely used in the statistical analysis of annual extreme value series for meteorology hydrology and other fields khaliq et al 2006 the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev is as follows 9 f x e x p 1 k x ξ α 1 k k 0 where α ξ and k are the scale parameter location parameter and shape parameter respectively the quantile x t of the gev distribution with a return period of t can be obtained by 10 x t ξ α k 1 l n t t 1 k to analyze changes in flood magnitude and frequency we counted for each of the four periods the magnitude and frequency of floods greater than 50 100 and 200 year floods estimated for the historical period 3 6 testing significance of changes the t test was applied to detect whether there was significant difference in the mean of the two data series efron 1969 in the test indices representing flood characteristics are compared for two different periods and the null hypothesis h0 is that the flood indices are statistically similar whereas the alternate hypothesis h1 is that the indices differ between the two periods if standardized test statistic t t 1 α 2 n m 2 h0 is rejected which means that there is a statistically significant difference between the hydrologic variables of two periods the test statistics t is calculated by 11 t x y s x 2 n s y 2 m where x and y are the sample means s x and s y are the sample standard deviations n and m are the sample sizes and α is the significance level 3 7 analysis of ensemble spread contribution to flood changes in the past 1000 and future the range achieved by all ensemble members provides a measure for quantifying overall uncertainty assuming that each projection is equally probable the average variance σ 2 as a measure of ensemble spread contribution is defined here as the sum of average variances from the individual components of the ensemble vormoor et al 2015 12 σ 2 ensemble σ 2 gcm σ 2 ds σ 2 hm the computation of average variances for the cmip5 gcm models σ 2 gcm is as follows for each combination i out of n possible combinations of bc methods and hydrological models we compute the variance σ gcm i 2 subject to 4 gcms then we compute σ 2 gcm as the average over all σ gcm i n 2 similarly for each combination j out of m possible combinations of gcms and hydrological models the variance σ ds j 2 subject to two bc methods is computed in addition the σ 2 ds as the average of all σ ds j m 2 σ 2 hm is calculated as shown above this method was used to recognize the ensemble spread contribution generated by different sources in the model chain for two variables between the two periods past1 past2 past2 historical historical future i the change in the index s d and ii the change in the difference between snowmelt and rainfall generated events 4 results 4 1 model evaluations the calibration 1958 2002 and validation 2003 2012 metrics from the hbv and xaj models for the 34 study catchments are given in table 4 the average nse values for the xaj and hbv models are 0 79 and 0 75 for the calibration as well as 0 76 and 0 71 for the validation period respectively in addition the average p b i a s values of the xaj and hbv models are 8 and 11 for the calibration period and 10 and 12 for the validation period comparisons of simulated and observed hydrographs as well as peak discharge are shown in figs s1 and s2 both hydrological models have relatively good and similar performances in simulating the seasonal pattern and observed peak flow distribution for most catchments in addition it is worth noting that the hbv model underestimates the winter low flow for elverum losna and austenå these three catchments are regulated and the relatively high observed winter low flow is most likely caused by reservoir release while the xaj model manages to capture the winter low flows which might be because the recession coefficient from the groundwater module in the xaj model is very much adjustable to fit into the observation even it is regulated in general these two models perform satisfactorily for daily discharge simulation in all basins of norway the bias corrected precipitation and temperature from both dbc and ddm methods were evaluated by comparing with the observations during the period of 1958 2002 see fig s3 we calculated the relative error and absolute error between observed and gcm simulated precipitation and temperature indices respectively the deviations of mean annual precipitation and temperature are close to zero for the extreme precipitation we can see that raw gcm models all underestimate maximum 1 day precipitation but after bias correction by either dbc or ddm method the median of biases between simulated and observed precipitation approaches zero and smaller deviations are also found furthermore we compared the observed and simulated discharges the boxplots of the empirical distributions of annual maximum discharge from observations and five different discharge simulations over the reference period 1958 2002 are shown in fig 2 the simulated discharges shown with different colors are based on the calibrated hbv and xaj models driven by the observed climate data senorge dbc bias corrected gcms ddm bias corrected gcms and the raw gcm data bc methods not only considerably narrow the range of simulated distributions based on raw gcm data but also correct the large discrepancies underestimation or overestimation in the peak flow distributions between the observed and the simulated it can be seen from fig 2 that the median values of annual maximum discharges based on the bias corrected gcms with both the dbc and ddm methods are similar to those based on the senorge data although they all slightly underestimate the median values compared with those from the observed discharge for most of the catchments the distributions of annual maximum discharge from ddm corrected gcms are closer to those from the observed discharge than those from dbc corrected gcms and senorge data this might be related to the ddm method where extreme 90 precipitation and temperature 90 and 10 are applied to fit the generalized pareto distribution which provides larger values for the extremes than those from the dbc method this can be confirmed with the further significant difference analysis of extreme distributions based on the kolmogorov smirnov test in table s1 we are unable to draw a conclusion in the study that which bc method is more suitable for all the catchments in general hundecha et al 2016 pointed out that the choice of appropriate bc method for precipitation may depend on the flood regime of the catchment and the variables of interest mean or extreme a further comparison is made to assess the differences of two hydrological models in fig s4 we can see that the range as well as median value of the annual maximum discharge distribution from two models are similar although we can see the ranges from hbv model are slightly larger than those of xaj model in a few catchments in general the two hydrological models driven by the bias corrected gcms based on both dbc and ddm methods are able to reproduce satisfactorily the distribution of annual maximum discharge compared with that from the observed discharge as well as that from the simulations with senorge data for all the catchments in the following sections we will analyze the changes in flood characteristics based on the simulations driven by the bias corrected gcms with both dbc and ddm methods 4 2 changes in precipitation and temperature figs 3 and 4 show the mean temperature and annual precipitation from dbc corrected gcms respectively the figures present the changes over different periods including past1 past2 historical and future periods rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 from fig 3 we can see that three out of four climate models miroc esm is the exception show quite similar results for the mean annual temperature changes from past to future period for all catchments all gcms except miroc esm simulate a higher temperature in past1 than that in past2 which is consistent with previous studies about warmer climate condition in mca past1 and cooler climate in the lia past2 osborn and briffa 2006 mann et al 2009 for example the temperature reconstructions in scandinavia also indicate that the early 11th century was warmer and a distinct cooling was recorded from proxy data during 1550 1800 zawiska et al 2017 regarding the opposite temperature trend from past1 to past2 from miroc esm model it exhibits possible drifts for the trends of temperature during past 1000 years bothe et al 2013 the two future periods are much warmer compared with the historical period as well as the past periods which can be seen from all gcms the similar results can be seen in the mean annual temperature from bias corrected gcms by ddm method fig s5 for annual precipitation we see that dbc bias corrected gcms show different changes across periods in each catchment especially past1 vs past2 fig 4 for example in the knappom basin from east region of norway the past2 period is slightly dryer than the past1 period from mri cgcm3 and ccsm4 whereas we see the opposite trend in bcc csm1 1 and miroc esm it should be noted that unlike the change of mean annual temperature the change of annual precipitation during past future varies a lot in different gcms as well as in different catchments in general miroc esm gives the largest changes in annual precipitation from past1 to the future periods for almost all catchments whereas mri cgcm3 gives the smallest changes for most catchments of southwest middle and north norway similar changes are also seen in the annual precipitation for past1 past2 historical and future periods from ddm bias corrected gcms in fig s6 4 3 changes in flood seasonality and generating processes figs 5 and 6 show the seasonality index s d and the percentage of different flood generating processes for the past1 past2 historical and future periods at 34 study catchments from five subregions in norway moreover we used the t test significance level 0 01 for all catchments to investigate whether the mean of the samples from two adjacent periods is significantly different fig 5 shows that most of the seasonality indices s d are negative indicating the importance of the spring and summer floods we note that the distribution of the index s d changes in some catchments for past1 vs past2 and past2 vs historical period although the change is small compared with future change for example the median s d of bulken from west region shows a slightly increase from past1 to past2 and a decrease from past2 to historical period this change can be seen in all catchments except osenelv øren from west region as well as some catchments from east region i e knappom and magnor south region i e tingvatn and flaksvatn middle region i e høggås bru and north region i e fustvatn skarsvatn and jordbrufjell however none of the changes for past1 vs past2 or past2 vs historical period is significant we find most of the changes from historical vs future period are statistically significant by the t test besides when we compare past1 vs historical period we find that the interquartile range or median of the seasonality index s d show an increase in some catchments e g høggås bru krinsvatn and trangen the s d increase indicates less spring summer floods and more autumn winter floods this is probably because three out of four gcms project a warmer climate condition in historical period than that in past periods mca and lia this results in potentially more rainfall as well as higher chance of rainfall generated floods than snowmelt generated floods in fig 6 we see the ratios of rainfall snowmelt and mixed generated events relative to all events have changes from past1 to the past2 and from past 2 to the historical period for some of the catchments although none of the changes are statistically significant it is worth noting that snowmelt generated events have occasionally been more dominant during the mca than during the lia in some catchments e g eggafoss and skarsvatn with snowmelt floods one potential explanation for this might be a higher frequency of suddenly higher temperatures in spring summer during warm intervals compared to the lia as this phenomena is a known flood trigger however for the future scenarios the median of s d tends to increase to varying degrees or the interquartile range of the s d distribution becomes wider for most catchments especially for the rcp8 5 scenario this indicates that the proportion of autumn winter events relative to all flood events in all catchments will increase in the future for several catchments e g fusvatn tingvatn and viksvatn we see that the current flood system may shift from spring summer to autumn winter the fraction of snowmelt generated flood events is decreasing more or less in the future period under both rcp scenarios which is consistent with the results of flood seasonality the significant changes in the index s d and the difference in snowmelt and rainfall generated flood events from the historical period to the future could also be demonstrated based on the results of the t test for most catchments it is worth noting that the changes in flood seasonality are more significant than those of the flood generating processes from the above we can see some changes in both the flood seasonality index s d and the fraction of snowmelt or rainfall generated flood events from past1 to the historical period although none of the change is as significant as the change of future however it should be noted that some catchments have more autumn winter i e rainfall generated floods in lia period comparing with mca period which indicates that colder environment with smaller evapotranspiration may allow more rainfall flood events therefore the changes in flood seasonality and generating processes between past1 and past2 periods depend on the variability of precipitation and temperature that varies in different catchments for example it is not always more spring summer floods during past2 lia than during past1 mca which are influenced by the meteorological output of different gcms in general the flood changes from past1 mca warm to past 2 lia cold are not significant from the ensemble results which is probably mainly resulted from the limited difference between past1 and past2 in climate driving especially precipitation in addition we found that changes in flood seasonality are basically consistent with the changes in the generating processes for flood events which means that a decreased dominance of spring summer floods is closely related to rainfall replacing snowmelt as the main flood driving factor in the future mainly due to rising temperatures 4 4 changes in flood magnitude and frequency to answer the question of how flood magnitude and frequency change from past1 to the future we used the generalized extreme value gev distribution to estimate the flood sizes for selected return periods 50 year 100 year and 200 year for each ensemble member in the historical period fig 7 shows for each of the four periods past1 past2 historical and future rcp26 rcp85 the frequency of flood events exceeding the respective 50 year 100 year and 200 year flood levels whereas table 5 shows significant changes in flood frequency from past1 to past2 and past2 to historical and historical to future first we see that the median of the frequency of flood events at different extreme levels exhibits relatively consistent variability for the four periods for almost all study catchments from past1 and past2 to the historical periods there were small changes in the flood frequency in most of the catchments the results of the t test for flood frequency show significant changes in 3 catchments from past1 to past2 and in 7 catchments from past2 to historical periods table 5 for east region only one significant change was identified for the transition from the historical to the future periods i e the 50 year flood in engeren for the change to the future rcp8 5 scenario table 5 however significant increasing trends of flood frequency from the historical period to the future under both scenarios are seen in table 6 for many catchments in the other regions for example 11 of 23 and 17 of 23 catchments have significant flood frequency increases from the historical period to the rcp2 6 scenario and from the historical period to the rcp8 5 scenario respectively the changes between the same four periods of the magnitudes of the floods exceeding the 50 year 100 year and 200 year floods estimated for the historical period are shown in fig s7 we also used the t test for the mean magnitude of 50 100 and 200 year flood events not shown although there are some changes and a small fluctuation for the median and range of the flood events magnitudes at different return periods in fig s7 we find that there are no significant changes for the mean magnitude of the floods exceeding the 50 year 100 year and 200 year return periods for the past1 past2 historical and future periods in almost all catchments of norway based on the results of t test overall nonsignificant changes can be seen in the frequency and magnitude changes of floods from past1 to past2 as well as from past2 to the historical period based on the ensemble mean however the frequency of floods at different return periods tends to increase in some catchments from historical to future periods both rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 significant changes in flood driving factors and seasonality in most of the catchments are also detected from historical to future periods which all show a possible nonstationarity of floods characteristics in norway as the climate warmed 4 5 estimate ensemble spread contribution to flood changes in past1 past2 historical and future tables 6 and 7 show the fractional contribution to the total variance from the different elements of the ensemble for the changes in the seasonality index s d and the flood generating processes i e snowmelt and rainfall for the five regions of norway a more detailed result for each catchment can be seen in figs s8 and s9 in these two tables each column from left to right represents the changes of past1 vs past2 past2 vs historical period and historical period vs future under both the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios for almost all cases the gcm models give the largest contribution to the total ensemble spread the contribution of hydrological models is larger than that of bc methods for the changes from the past1 to past2 in all regions whereas bc methods uncertainty tends to be more important than that of hydrological models for changes historical vs future in all regions except the east and west for north middle and south region the bc methods uncertainty is rather higher than that of hydrological models except from the past1 to past2 the contributions of hydrological models are higher for the seasonality index s d than for the flood generating processes we also find that the contribution of gcm models and the bc methods is rather high in the catchments with an apparent change in the flood generating processes e g engesvatn krinsvatn and gåslandsvatn one explanation for this might be that the input data are closely connected to the gcm models and bc methods and then the changes in precipitation and temperature lead to changes in flood characteristics it s noteworthy that the contributions of hydrological models are relatively high in some catchments e g haugland lovatn and røykenes where the flood seasonality and generating processes show insignificant changes from past1 to the future period the minor changes of gcm ensembles between two adjacent periods might be due to the fact that difference between the two hydrological models two optimal parameter sets itself becomes the largest contributor 4 6 the uncertainty of climate models from the results presented in the previous section we observe that gcms ensembles have the highest contribution to the total ensemble spread for the changes in the index s d possible explanations for this can be that some gcms represent certain parts of the climate system poorly and are consequently unable to resolve certain processes related to the climate system or have inadequately constrained parameters this might again lead to systematic errors from these models in order to identify the uncertainties among the four gcms we conducted an in depth comparison of the four gcms for six selected catchments including i two snowmelt dominated catchments jordbrufjell and øvrevatn in north region ii two rainfall dominated catchments flaksvatn and osenelvv øren in south and west region and iii two mixed catchments lovatn and viksvatn in west region fig 8 presents the results of flood seasonality from past1 to the future period by the four bias corrected gcms the flood seasonality changes based on the four gcms are very different in all catchments the most robust signal across all catchments except lovatn and gcms is a positive shift in s d from the historical to the future periods the changes in s d across the past1 past2 and historical periods are less consistent for example the s d of model bcc csm1 1 is negative from past1 to the historical period in flaksvatn and osenelvv øren rainfall dominated catchments which is different from the other three gcms for the two snowmelt dominated catchments s d is larger in past1 mca period than past2 lia for nearly all gcms indicating that more spring summer floods occurred in the colder period of past2 however for the two rainfall dominated catchments the four gcms show large differences in flood seasonality changes for example the seasonality index s d is smaller in past1 than in past2 lia from ccsm4 and miroc esm in osenelvv øren which is opposite to the other two gcms this is somehow consistent with what we can see in the changes of mean annual precipitation in fig 3 where the mean annual precipitation increases from past1 to past2 from ccsm4 and miroc esm models while no big change in precipitation is seen for the other two models in addition for the two mixed catchments we see a higher s d in past2 compared with past1 for almost all gcms which is most likely caused by an increase in precipitation as well seen in fig 3 in general we can see that the uncertainty for analyzing flood changes is inevitable due to the large uncertainty of gcms simulation of both precipitation and temperature the flood frequency from past1 to the future by the four bias corrected gcms is presented in fig 9 from past1 to past2 for the two snowmelt dominated catchments the frequency of flood events exceeding different return levels shows relatively small variability from the gcms but with varying degrees of changes while for rainfall dominated and mixed catchments there are larger differences including trends and ranges for the change in flood frequency from the gcms in addition we also used the statistical t test to check the significance of the differences between past1 and past2 for each of the four gcms our analysis reveals that there are large differences among the gcms although no significant changes are detected from past1 to past2 for flood seasonality and frequency changes in most basins see fig 8 and table s2 more importantly the changes in different extreme levels between past1 and past2 for each of the four gcms are different from what we see in the results based on the gcm ensemble mean 5 discussions 5 1 future flood implications observational data and model projections indicated a future increasing intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events worldwide although with considerable regional variations jian et al 2014 meanwhile an increase of flood events in some regions in the future is also projected by the results of climate and hydrological models hirabayashi et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 in our study we focus not only on the magnitude and frequency of flood events but also on evolution in flood seasonality and generating processes across longer time scales some previous studies have discussed the above mentioned changes in flood events in the future vormoor et al 2015 found for instance that autumn winter floods become more numerous and important in six study catchments in norway which may lead to the flood regimes shifting from spring summer to autumn winter for those northernmost catchments furthermore rainfall generated events tend to occur more frequently in the future perhaps more importantly the greatest increase in the importance of rainfall is expected to occur in the northernmost catchments where the changes in flood seasonality also happened to be the highest this agrees with our study and other similar findings köplin et al 2014 arnell 1999 the strongest shift in flood seasonality and generating processes can be explained by decreased snow cover and shorter snow seasons due to rising temperatures under a warmer climate this change may cause a reduction in the occurrence of flood events driven by snowmelt støren and paasche 2014 vormoor et al 2016 we also investigated the magnitude and frequency of floods exceeding different extreme levels from past1 to the future estimated frequency changes in the flood events based on the ensemble results indicate both increases and decreases for the future in the catchments considered the direction of change may be related to the change in the dominant flood generation process however the magnitudes of floods exceeding the 100 year flood level seem to change slightly across all periods from the two past and historical periods to the future period the results show that changes in flood frequency dominate over changes in magnitude vormoor et al 2015 also pointed out that change of flood magnitudes or frequencies or both is the cause for the change of flood seasonality they found that two of all study catchments øvrevatn and junkerdalselv with the strongest changes in flood seasonality associated with flood generating processes show decreasing magnitudes of flood events but increasing frequency compared 1961 1990 with 2071 2100 5 2 norwegian flood events over a long term period from the past 1000 to the historical period in this study we attempt to realize if the last 100 years owning instrumental measurements could cover the variability of flood events over a long term period of more than 1000 years the characteristics of flood events in norway from the two past and historical periods to the future are explored in the present study we found that all ensemble results show an insignificant and mild variability in flood event changes including seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency from past1 subperiod in mca and past2 subperiod in lia to the historical period in addition changes in the characteristics of flood events are not consistent among the ensemble members in contrast a possible systematic shift in flood seasonality and generating processes as well as an increase in flood frequency for some study catchments in norway are unambiguously obvious in future rcp simulations from the 19th century to the end of the 21st century which align well with other studies lawrence 2020 vormoor et al 2015 in our study we used the annual maximum floods amf in the analysis whereas in previous studies flood events from a peak over threshold pot approach is used for analyzing flood seasonality vormoor et al 2015 2016 since the pot approach will result in more than flood event per year in particular in mixed and rainfall driven flood regimes it is possible that pot data would be more sensitive to identify mixed regimes nevertheless our results shows that the amf data enables us to identify several cases with mixed regimes where we see a seasonality index around zero fig 5 we therefor believe that the seasonality analysis based on amf data shown in fig 5 provides robust results and using pot data might slightly change the results without influencing our conclusions some studies focus on the change in extreme precipitation at decades or centuries and cover time periods longer than the instrumental data record for instance similar to our study lewis 2018 showed that compared with the observation 100 years in australia there is no systematic difference in extreme precipitation as the length of the time series increases 1000 years huo et al 2020 reported that no direct evidence was shown for the nonstationarity of precipitation extremes in europe from past 1000 to the historical period although a wider range of extremes may be produced over a long term simulation a previous study by sheng et al 2020 used a climate model and a numerical model to obtain the maximum annual discharge during 1000 2012 period for the yalu river in china and estimate flood annual exceedance probabilities they discovered that the fitted flood frequency curves between mca and lia period were similar even though the climate between these two periods was different in addition the occurrence frequency of 50 year flood events during 1000 1450 was close to that of the lia 1450 1840 which is in line with our results however it is obvious that the flood frequency curves for 1841 2012 are different from the other two periods 1000 1450 and 1451 1840 this is because the higher frequency of extreme precipitation lead to higher frequency of extreme discharge this apparent difference in results compared to our study may have several explanations first there were differences in the study area and inconsistent divisions for historical and future periods second sheng et al 2020 used a single model millennial realization echo g climate model that coupled the spectral atmospheric model echam4 and a primitive equation global model hope g whereas the model chain in our study included a multimodel suite of cmip5 simulations bc methods and hydrological models another study using ccsm4 last millennium simulations also demonstrated that unlike surface temperature responses effective precipitation i e precipitation minus evaporation losses differences throughout periods of the last 1000 years were not statistically significant including when comparing the mca and lia landrum et al 2013 high resolution reconstructions of flood variability during the last 10 000 years of glomma the largest river in central eastern norway show that there is considerable non stationarity for the last 1000 years engeland et al 2020 similarly ekblom johansson et al 2020 have observed a marked variability in flood frequency for western norway where the influence of changes in precipitation rain typically is somewhat higher than for eastern norway the growing body of empirical evidence for non stationarity in flooding in norway støren et al 2012 støren and paasche 2014 engeland et al 2020 ekblom johansson et al 2020 strongly suggests that this is a prevailing feature that cuts across catchment typology and interactions with climate this might suggest that the underlying natural climate variability in the climate models applied here is not entirely captured there are also other catchment land feedback mechanisms that are not directly dictated by climate such as changes in vegetation cover for the past due to forest clearing and livestock as well as the establishment of more pastoral landscapes that can impact the frequency and magnitude of floods e g tollan 2002 hall et al 2014 specifically forest clearing will reduce interception losses and intensify snowmelt on the ground and decrease in vegetation cover will reduce infiltration capacity and evapotranspiration making more precipitation and snowmelt converting to runoff which may heighten the risk of flooding 5 3 uncertainties of modeling floods over the past 1000 years gcms vs ensemble mean it should be pointed out that only four cmip5 gcms with one single member each for the past 1000 simulations were used in our study the limited number of gcms without different initial condition ensembles might lead to a loss of generality of the uncertainty caused by gcms moreover in this study we included most gcms that contributed past 1000 years simulations to cmip5 and we did not exclude models based on their skills in capturing observed precipitation and temperature variability due to the small number of gcms providing past 1000 years simulations this may also result in bias errors in the modeling floods from the ensemble mean however each experiment used the same set of models hence possible biases in model representations compared to observations are not considered as inherent obstacles to studying flood variability lewis 2018 in addition we used means and interquartile ranges based on the model chain ensembles 16 members to assess the differences in several flood characteristics between past1 and past2 periods representing the mca and lia respectively this approach might mask the signal provided by each gcm since a large variability of mean annual precipitation and temperature changes over past 1000 years from different gcms was seen it is worth mentioning that the uncertainty range of the ensemble does not show any systematic pattern from past1 to past2 which rather depends on the gcm the time period and the catchment considered therefore we identified some changes in the flood characteristics between past1 and past2 based on each individual gcm even if the ensemble mean indicated no changes we found more autumn winter floods in past2 lia than in past1 mca from the miroc esm and ccsm4 models in several catchments which is probably associated with the increased precipitation from the ccsm4 model and the increased temperature from the miroc esm model from past1 mca to past2 lia in addition increased flood frequency from past1 mca to past2 lia was seen in snow dominated catchments several previous studies show more frequent flooding in the little ice age specifically during the late maunder solar minimum 1675 1725 which potentially can be related to lower surface air temperatures blöschl et al 2020 identified nine flood rich periods and associated regions in the past half millennium in europe based on reconstructed data most flood rich periods in western and central europe occurred during ce 1500 to 1800 period and blöschl et al 2020 suggested that lower temperatures during this period lead to less evaporation and hence higher soil moisture which in turn resulted in larger floods further in depth investigations are needed to confirm this since the depth of soil layers and its impacts on flooding events are different in different regions of europe for example the soil depth is thinner in norway than in western europe it is also worth noting that despite the possible biases between cmip5 simulations for the last millennium climate and reconstructed hydroclimates in northern hemisphere global climate models still provide useful insights into the characteristics of pre instrumental hydroclimates ljungqvist et al 2016 6 conclusions in this study for the first time we present the modelled daily river discharge and floods in norway from the last millennium past 1000 to the end of the 21st century using a model chain approach with multi model ensembles including four gcms two bc methods and two hydrological models the model simulation is over 1000 years 850 2099 which is divided into four periods of past1 mca past2 lia historical and future periods the flood changes i e the changes in flood seasonality generating processes as well as frequency and magnitude were further investigated in 34 catchments over five subregions of norway we further estimate the uncertainty contributions from different components of model chain to flood changes and find that the gcms are the biggest contributor at last more specific analysis is given for comparison of four gcms in six selected catchments the following conclusions can be drawn from the results all gcms except miroc esm simulate a higher mean temperature in past1 mca than past2 lia while from past1 to past2 no consistent change can be seen across the annual precipitation which varies a lot in different gcms and catchments there are changes in flood characteristics i e seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency in some catchments from past1 to past2 and past2 to historical but none of the changes is statistically significant based on the ensemble mean results there will be a flood frequency increase in the future for most of the catchments in norway more autumn winter floods are projected in the future with fewer spring summer floods and snowmelt dominated floods will shift to rainfall dominated floods in some catchments over the east south and west four gcms show large differences in flood changes seasonality and frequency from past1 mca to past2 lia over three types of floods due to the uncertainty from both precipitation and temperature overall the gcm ensemble is the largest contributor to the total variance in flood changes followed by the bc methods or the hydrological models hydrological models uncertainty tends to be more important than bc methods for the changes of past1 vs past2 in most catchments while it is opposite rank for the changes of historical vs future period in this study we attempted to explore whether large scale gcms could show some commonalities for local regional flood events more questions arise from the study for example what are the dynamic mechanisms of gcms from large scale circulation driving the variability of extreme precipitation temperature leading to different local regional flood events how can we better evaluate the modeling of flood events over the past 1000 years for example by documented climate signal at large regional scale e g dry wet periods or proxy data that can give long term high resolution historical flood information at local basin scale furthermore what are the different hydrological models abilities to account for all processes that might lead to changes in flood sizes e g evapotranspiration soil frost changes in land use further investigations are needed to provide in depth insight into these questions credit authorship contribution statement ran huo

2940,with the recent warming trend over europe and the arctic the nordic regions have experienced more frequent and damaging extreme hydrological events which are anticipated to increase towards the end of the 21st century despite explicit trends large variations have been observed across basins and regions when it comes to precipitation and floods hinting at a strong natural hydroclimatic variability that further complicates any assessment of potential future changes in this study we aim to better understand how climate variability links with the current extremes and future projections of floods in norway in the context of the last millennium and the future specifically we simulate over 1000 years 850 2099 daily discharge and floods at 34 catchments over five regions of norway from the last millennium including a warm period and a cold period 850 1849 to the end of the 21st century by an ensemble model chain method including four global climate models gcms two bias correction methods and two hydrological models the modelling results show i all gcms except miroc esm simulate a higher mean temperature in medieval climate anomaly mca period than little ice age lia period while simulated annual precipitation varies a lot in different gcms and catchments ii no significant change of flood characteristics during the last millennium from ensemble mean results iii in future we will have an extraordinary shift in flood seasonality and generating processes and flood frequency increase in most of the study catchments in norway and iv climate projections represent the largest contribution to overall uncertainty in the projected changes in hydrological extremes for most of the catchments keywords flood changes climate variability seasonality last millennium future norway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 floods in past 1000 climate global warming has led to an accelerated hydrological cycle which has been manifested by more intense precipitation benestad 2013 as well as changes in runoff regimes this is for instance evident in the shifting seasonality of snow accumulation and snow melt at high latitudes and altitudes dyrrdal et al 2013 such changes are likely to influence river floods throughout the year and in fact several studies have detected significant changes in the flood sizes flood generating processes and seasonality across europe with new spatial patterns emerging hall et al 2014 blöschl et al 2019 2020 in regions with seasonal snow covers a warmer climate can lead to a transition in flood generating processes from what earlier would tend to be more snowmelt driven towards more rain driven floods such as sustained shift in seasonality would tend to more frequent autumn winter floods dyrrdal et al 2013 hanssen bauer et al 2009 floods driven by rain are predicted to increase until the end of the 21st century whereas the trend for snowmelt floods will reverse according to lawrence 2020 for northern europe a negative trend in the spring summer flood events is observed and explained by a decline in the frequency of summer rain and snowmelt events hundecha et al 2020 beyond the noted variability in flood magnitudes and frequencies changes in both flood generating processes and seasonality of floods are of crucial importance for advancing the present understanding of how climate change impacts on flooding however flood events with long return periods seldom appear in the series of observed data hirabayashi et al 2013 the most important thing is that it is hard to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of climate change on observed floods due to the shortage of hydrological station with long observational datasets sheng et al 2020 milliman and farnsworth 2013 therefore large uncertainties exist in the predictions of the frequency and magnitudes of future flood events due to these short records holmes and dinicola 2010 yang and yin 2018 and detecting non stationarities in these time series is often challenging wirth et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 therefore new approaches to analyze flood characteristics during the past are necessary to detect the connections between floods and other climate characteristics e g støren and paasche 2014 this knowledge can further be used to predict the risk of future flood disasters and main control factors more effectively one approach to analyzing floods during the past is to use riverine or lacustrine sedimentological records and historical flood level records at bridges stones and so on to infer the variability of floods over the past and this domain is now known as paleoflood hydrology baker 2008 benito and o connor 2013 li et al 2013 tombrink 2017 however sedimentary records are affected by different ranges of flooding magnitudes and frequencies magilligan et al 1998 sambrook smith et al 2010 and using sedimentary records only to precisely distinguish floods of different sizes and quantify the magnitude and frequency of past 1000 floods is a great challenge sambrook smith et al 2010 moreover the limited records of historical flood level are not enough to reconstruct a complete flood sequence consequently complementary approaches are needed to realize the characteristics of flood events for those periods without instrumental records numerical modeling is a complementary approach that can be used to reconstruct river discharge over a long term period syvitski and morehead 1999 in order to reconstruct maximum annual discharges sheng et al 2020 used the echo g climate model output and the hydrotrend hydrological model to generate daily discharge of yalu river basin during 1000 2012 in their paper they used the records of historical flood frequency to verify model performance where the number of flood disasters was compared between historical data and model simulations to better assess the future projections of hydrology under ongoing global warming scenarios studies have been carried out on the past climate of the last interglacial lig 129 to 116 kyr ago which was somewhat warmer than the present climate the lig it can be argued has a special relevance to the future because of its proximity in geological time and its partial temperature analogy with possible futures scussolini et al 2020 scussolini et al 2020 investigated lig hydrology including mean annual lig runoff discharge and 100 yr floods based on the hydrological model pcr globwb and hydrodynamic model cama flood with daily output of preindustrial and lig simulations from eight new climate models they found that lig positive negative discharge anomalies agree with future projections from the cmip3 and cmip5 models for certain areas compared to preindustrial discharge the annual mean lig discharge and 100 yr flood volume was considerably larger in the northern hemisphere these studies only dealt with 100 year floods without considering if different flood quantiles e g floods with 10 year or 1000 year return period have a similar variability in the northern hemisphere paleoclimatic reconstructions identify two periods with a distinct difference in climate during the 1000 recent years a warm period called the medieval climate anomaly mca during 950 1250 and a cold period known as the little ice age lia during 1500 1800 mann et al 2009 this transition from the warm mca to the cold lia period provides a welcome opportunity to investigate the response of floods to changes in climate and look for the relationship between climate and hydrology floods the context of the past millennium provides an extended temporal window for framing for future scenarios which is precisely what we have provided here 1 2 floods in future climate to quantify and evaluate climate change impacts global climate models gcm have not only been widely used to simulate the past 1000 climate but also used to project future climates the precipitation and temperature derived from gcms are however biased and typically have a coarse spatial resolution that can be limiting for regional and local scale hydrological modeling akhtar et al 2008 yoo and na 2017 this limitation compels post processing of the gcms outputs if one is to connect output from large scale climate models with local hydrological modelling maraun et al 2010 chen et al 2011 many studies show that the use of bias corrected gcm data as input to hydrological models could improve runoff simulation for catchments pierce et al 2015 hakala et al 2018 hakala et al 2018 confirmed the importance of bias correction bc method and demonstrated that quantile mapping method improved the gcm rcm precipitation cycle temperature and discharge simulations in all the considered catchments two classes of downscaling techniques i e dynamical and statistical downscaling methods are often employed to correct the gcm outputs regional climate models rcms are used for dynamical downscaling some recent studies using rcm outputs highlight the need for proper evaluation before the use of rcms owing to the limited process descriptions biased fluxes at the boundaries of rcm and numerical approximations for example lorenz et al 2017 found that the precipitation of cordex africa rcms shows a bias in the distribution of rainfall intensities and wet day frequencies over west africa in addition singh et al 2017 compared nine rcms with their host gcms and found no consistent improvement in the rcms for simulating indian monsoon rainfall statistical approaches are often used to bias correct gcms and rcms outputs that are subsequently used for hydrological modeling because they are computationally cheap and relatively easy to apply to minimize biases fang et al 2015 smitha et al 2018 two commonly used empirical statistical methods include change factor and bias correction approaches ho et al 2012 change factor approaches suppose that climate models make reasonable projections for the climate change signal ccs and assume constant interannual variability in the future the ccs will tend to match that of the underlying climate model bias correction methods suppose that the established mapping relationship between observed and modeled variables for the reference period could be used for the future period chen et al 2013 indicated that there are some differences for cumulative distribution functions of annual precipitation changes bias corrected by these two approaches to take into account the uncertainty introduced by bc method we chose here a change factor approach distribution delta mapping ddm and a bias correction approach daily bias correction dbc in the study besides previous studies demonstrated that for discharge simulation the gcm related uncertainty was the main contributor followed by hydrological model uncertainty chen et al 2011 chan et al 2020 besides uncertainty from downscaling methods is also non negligible sharma et al 2018 therefore four gcms and two hydrological models are also considered in the study climate projections predict that temperatures and precipitation in norway at the end of the 21st century will increase by 2 3 4 6 c and 5 30 respectively hanssen bauer et al 2009 for mountainous and nordic regions it is worth noting that changes in the ratio of snowfall to precipitation due to temperature rise are of chief importance because they have direct impacts on flood seasonality and generating processes several previous studies have investigated the climate change impacts on the hydrology of nordic regions e g veijalainen et al 2010 lawrence and haddeland 2011 lawrence 2020 lawrence and haddeland 2011 found for instance that the magnitude of 200 year flood in western and coastal area of norway rainfall dominated will increase whereas the floods dominated by snowmelt in inland regions and some parts of northern regions are expected to decrease in the future blöschl et al 2011 considered that more attention should be given to seasonal changes in floods rather than just the magnitude and frequency of floods correspondingly changes in the flood generating processes are also key to understanding the direction increase vs decrease of future floods due to climate change along these lines vormoor et al 2015 show that autumn winter events become more frequent in six norwegian catchments and for two catchments located in northern and south eastern norway a shift from spring summer to autumn winter was observed where increasing rainfall was identified as the main flood generating process in other words rainfall will replace snowmelt as dominant flood generating process because of rising temperature in warming climates all studies that use gcms and hydrological models to address the impact of climate change on floods in norway only focus on the future this study is the first to apply climate model outputs from the past 1000 years to gain knowledge on the links between floods and climate during past 1000 years and thereby provide complementary information to paleo flood studies based on sediment cores 1 3 objectives this study aims to address the following research questions 1 what are the changes in flood characteristics i e seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency for the past and the future at a longer timescale 850 2099 in norway 2 can the last 100 years instrumental measurements 1900 present of river discharge represent discharge and flood variability over a long term period of more than 1 000 years 3 how much are the contributions of the different sources e g gcms hydrological models and bc methods to the ensemble spread of modeling flood changes for the past and the future in order to answer the three questions above we investigated the daily discharge and floods using a modeling chain consisting of four gcms two bc methods and two hydrological models over 1250 years covering the last millennium period past 1000 850 1849 historical period historical 1850 2005 and future period both representative concentration pathway 2 6 and representative concentration pathway 8 5 2006 2099 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area due to the high latitude mountainous topography and location on the west side of the scandinavian peninsula the hydroclimate of norway is diverse covering many different spatial patterns the average annual temperature on the southwest coast is 7 7 and the average annual temperature is 3 in the inland areas of northern norway and the high altitude areas in central norway hanssen bauer et al 2009 the mean annual precipitation varies from approximately 300 mm in northeastern and central norway to more than 3500 mm in western norway hanssen bauer et al 2009 western norway has the most precipitation in autumn and winter while the inland areas of the east have the most precipitation in summer there are three basic runoff regimes in norway gottschalk et al 1979 1 snowmelt is the main runoff generating process which is affected by snowpack volumes and the snow season because of different regional temperature regimes 2 rainfall is another important runoff generating process and 3 mixed rainfall and snowmelt runoff regimes also exist 34 catchments selected in our study reflect the variability of these three runoff regimes the catchments are all included in the studies of vormoor et al 2016 and lawrence 2020 which listed the dominant flood generating processes in 140 and 115 catchments of norway respectively hence changes in the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation due to temperature rise have direct implications for both flood seasonality and the dominant flood generating process it is worth noting that the inland and northernmost parts of norway have large spring and summer flows mainly owing to snowmelt while western norway and coastal areas have the highest flows in autumn and winter due to heavy rainfall vormoor et al 2016 in addition catchments partially covered by glaciers can be affected by glacier melt in late summer the locations of the 34 catchments used in this study and five regions in norway are shown in fig 1 there are six regions finnmark nordland trøndelag vestlandet sørlandet and østlandet defined by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve pettersson 2012 in our study finnmark and nordland are merged as north region trøndelag vestlandet sørlandet and østlandet are named as middle west south and east region in the paper according to their geographical location other catchment characteristics including area elevation and land cover are given in table 1 in the latest national climate report these runoff areas are also used as reference areas for observing runoff changes and analyzing future changes based on climate model projections hanssen bauer et al 2015 dahl and pedersen 2021 in this study we have chosen catchments of different sizes and no or minor impacts of river regulations on floods since flood seasonality and generation processes is mainly influenced by reservoirs and not run of river hydro plants we used the regulation degree of a catchment calculated by dividing the total regulated reservoir volume by the mean annual runoff to assess the impact of river regulations however the regulation impact is actually hard to avoid when so many catchments were chosen covering five regions all over norway for example elverum and losna with a regulation degree of 10 and 14 respectively were chosen in these catchments we might expect limited impact from dam reservoir regulations which may result in uncertainty of their discharge simulations in addition we keep austenå in the south of norway basin with a regulation degree of 6 because the number of catchments in this region is fewer than others the changes of flood regimes i e flood seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency at a basin scale will be analyzed and the results will be integrated in the five regions 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate model data we used the daily precipitation and temperature data from four cmip5 gcms to simulate daily discharge table 2 and four cmip5 experiments including the paleo climate simulation 850 1849 past 1000 20th century simulation 1850 2005 historical and two scenarios into the future 2006 2099 rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 were used table 3 in the past 1000 simulation the time evolving forcings include solar changes volcanic aerosols well mixed greenhouse gases land use and orbital parameters lewis 2018 however the values of ozone and anthropogenic aerosols are same as in the pre industrial experiment the historical simulations start from the pre industrial run and use the data of external forcing from the mid 19th century to the present to be specific the external forcings include greenhouse gases aerosols ozone solar and volcanic activities huo et al 2020 the representative concentration pathway scenarios used are rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 peters et al 2013 the values after rcp indicating the assumed radiative forcing by 2100 are 2 6 and 8 5 w m2 respectively it is worth noting that there is no volcanic forcing in future scenarios and other forcings including greenhouse gases aerosols ozone scenarios and solar are changing over time in this study the cmip5 gcms where data were available for all experiments were used including bcc csm1 1 miroc esm mri cgcm3 and ccsm4 2 2 2 observed data we used the senorge2 daily observational gridded dataset i e precipitation and temperature 1 km of grid spacing over norway for 1957 2012 lussana and tveito 2017 as input data for the hydrological modeling additionally senorge2 dataset was also used as observed data for the baseline period for calibration validation of the bc methods daily discharge data from 34 selected gauge stations distributed across norway were made available by the national hydrological database at the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve most of the catchments are not affected by dam construction or regulation and only three of them elverum losna and austenå have river regulations that might impact low flows and floods furthermore the observed discharge data series between 1957 and 2012 helped ensure a robust calibration and validation of the hydrological models 3 methods 3 1 model chain method the analyses of changes in flood seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency from 850 to 2099 are based on an ensemble model chain consisting of i four cmip5 gcm models ii two bc methods including ddm and dbc and iii two hydrological models including hydrologiska byråns vattenbalans model hbv and xin anjiang model xaj the contributions from the different modeling components of the model chain will be investigated and discussed in the study the subsections below describe the individual components of the model chain in detail 3 2 bias correction methods to study the uncertainty of bc methods two different types methods including dbc a bias correction method and ddm a change factor method were used in this study for the dbc a transfer function between the gcm outputs of the reference period and observations is applied to correct the gcm outputs for the future period for the ddm the change from reference to future period projected by the gcm is applied to the observations besides the precipitation and temperature extremes are chosen to fit general pareto distribution in ddm approach because the major variable of our interest is extreme streamflow this method was chosen to be compared with dbc both bc methods were calibrated for the reference period of 1957 2005 and these two methods were used to correct time series of past 1000 and future modeling data 850 2099 per 50 years for precipitation and temperature the past 1000 and future gcm data were all bias corrected by historical observations the details of two methods are shown as follow 3 2 1 daily bias correction dbc the dbc method chen et al 2011 is a quantile based method that corrects the precipitation frequency and quantity this method involves two steps 1 a wet day threshold is determined from the gcm simulated daily precipitation series for each month to ensure that the frequency of precipitation occurrence of corrected data for the reference period matches that of the observed data 2 the ratio between observed and gcm simulated precipitation during the reference period is calculated for the 1st percentile to the 100th percentile and subsequently each daily value of the future and past 1000 time series is multiplied by the factor for the corresponding percentile the second step is applied to correct the temperature however instead of using ratios the difference in temperature for each percentile between observed and gcm simulated data at the reference period is added to the future and past 1000 time series the formulas for adjusted daily precipitation p and temperature t for the future period are shown in equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p o b s p e r c p ref p e r c 2 t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs p e r c t ref p e r c where p adj f u t d and p gcm f u t d represent the adjusted and raw gcm precipitation respectively for day d in the future period p obs p e r c and p ref p e r c represent the daily observed and raw gcm precipitation respectively for the reference period for the specified percentile perc in addition the t means air temperature 3 2 2 distribution delta mapping ddm the ddm method was used for correcting the gcm data of future scenarios through the scaling of the observed daily precipitation and temperature data given in kelvin with the following three steps equations 3 6 for precipitation as an example 1 fit gamma for precipitation or normal for temperature cumulative distribution function to the observed data and future modeling data 2 fit general pareto cumulative distribution function to the observed data and future modeling data above the threshold given by the chosen percentile 3 map the future modeling data onto the observations to obtain p obs g c m r e f f u t using the inverse cumulative distribution function eqs 3 and 4 and pr gcm f u t d represents the percentiles 4 a scaling factor δ gcm d is calculated for each percentile of the cumulative distribution function based on changes between the gcm future and reference daily values eq 5 and 5 the scaling factor is then multiplied for precipitation or added for temperature to the observed data eq 6 the wet day frequency of precipitation occurrence is also corrected with the same procedure of dbc in addition it is worth noting that the extreme values of precipitation and temperature are selected to fit a different distribution in this approach daily precipitation larger than the 90th percentile is defined as extreme values the given percentiles for high and low temperatures are 90 and 10 respectively this method is very similar to the method used in the study of cannon et al 2015 3 pr gcm f u t d gamma gcm f u t p gcm f u t d 4 p

lumped conceptual hydrological models i e the hbv and xaj models forced by bias corrected gcm data were used for analyzing the impacts of climate change at the catchment scale the hbv model was originally developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi bergström 1976 and has since been widely used the model version applied in this study follows the structure and formulas of the hbv light version consisting of four main components a snow accumulation and melt routine a soil moisture accounting routine a response routine and a river routing routine seibert and vis 2012 yang et al 2020 the xaj model has been broadly used in humid and subhumid areas in many countries including norway and has also been recommended by the world meteorological organization to all countries in the world zhao 1992 zeng et al 2016 the hydrological processes of this model consist of four sections evapotranspiration runoff production separation of runoff components and flow routing which are related to 15 parameters zhao 1992 and we coupled a degree day snow module with xaj which is consistent with the snow routine of hbv there are some differences between these two models firstly storage capacity curve is introduced into the xaj model to consider the spatial distribution of storage capacity however a response routine of the hbv model is generalized as a two layer reservoir to calculate runoff secondly for the simulation of evaporation the xaj model uses a three layer evaporation model but the hbv model adopts a one layer model in the study we chose two conceptual hydrological models because they produce acceptable results and only require daily precipitation and air temperature as input data which typically are easy to access xaj and hbv models are chosen from the conceptual model s category because of their widespread application by the way the available meteorological variables at a daily timescale from the past 1000 experiments of cmip5 are only precipitation and temperature which limits the selection of hydrological models the two hydrological models were calibrated at each catchment using area averaged daily precipitation and temperature from senorge2 data and observed discharge data during 1958 2002 and validated on the period 2003 2012 to minimize the impact of the initial condition on model performance a warm up period was set to one year before the calibration period because the best performing parameter set would be used to simulate discharge data during a long term period of 1 250 years longer calibration period is helpful to cover more relevant processes merz et al 2009 the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua see duan et al 1992 which is a popular global optimization algorithm was used for calibrating both hydrological models automatically the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function to match the simulated discharge to the observed discharge the percentage of bias p b i a s as calculated in equation 7 was also used for evaluation and comparison 7 p b i a s q sim t q obs t q obs t 100 3 4 period division two distinctly different climatic excursions are commonly recognized during the past 1000 years they include the warm interval from ad 950 1250 known as the medieval climate anomaly mca and the cool centennial interval from ce 1500 1800 better known as the little ice age lia e g matthews and briffa 2005 mann et al 2009 to statistically compare the changes of flood events in those two climate periods we divided the past 1000 years into the two subperiods according to the ensemble variability in temperature for all gcms due to the large differences among the gcms the uncertainty of the statistical analysis for extreme discharge is significantly affected by the number of samples i e the length of time period therefore the length of discharge data series from different experiments should be the same in this case we divided the 1250 year into 4 periods with equal length 962 1055 within the mca past1 1562 1655 within the lia past2 1912 2005 history and 2006 2099 future 3 5 flood analysis and change 3 5 1 changes of flood seasonality the annual maximum discharge am was used to analyze the floods to reflect the basic flood regimes of extreme events we defined two seasons i the spring summer flood related to snowmelt as the primary flood generating process from march to august and ii the autumn winter flood associated with rainfall as the most important flood generating process from september to february to quantify the seasonality of flood events we used a seasonality index s d defined by vormoor et al 2015 8 s d am sep f e b am all am mar a u g am all where the first and second terms describe the ratio of the number of flood events during september february or march august over the total number of flood events respectively the index ranges from 1 to 1 negative values indicate that spring summer floods are more frequent whereas positive values suggest more frequent events in autumn winter s d was calculated for each ensemble member for the four periods 3 5 2 changes of flood generating processes we analyzed the relative contribution of rainfall and snowmelt for each flood event using the runoff components simulated by the hbv and xaj models in a time window of 3 days prior to each flood event the total simulated snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff were extracted from both models and used to estimate the relative contribution of each component in our study in addition we tested the impact of different time windows of 7 and 11 days with 3 and 5 days prior and after a flood peak for all catchments respectively it shows that there is not a major impact on the results from different time windows the uncertainty is 10 and it doesn t change the main results of flood classification in the method the floods were classified into i rainfall if more than 2 3 of the flood water originated from rain ii mixed if between 1 3 and 2 3 of the flood water originated from rain and iii snowmelt if 1 3 of the flood water originated from rainfall subsequently the ratios for rainfall snowmelt and mixed generated events relative to all events were calculated for all the catchments and for all four identified periods changes in the ratios will indicate corresponding changes in flood generating processes in different catchments from the past 1000 to future periods we should also note that this averaged three day time window for all the catchments may result in the uncertainty of the snowmelt vs rain contribution comparing with reality however in the study we are most interested in the changes during the different phases of past 1000 historical future period so the averaged time window allows us to have a consistent comparison in the study for different time periods as well as climate conditions 3 5 3 flood magnitude and frequency analysis at different extreme levels we fitted the annual maximum discharge to the generalized extreme value gev distribution to estimate the flood discharge for selected return periods gev distribution has been widely used in the statistical analysis of annual extreme value series for meteorology hydrology and other fields khaliq et al 2006 the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev is as follows 9 f x e x p 1 k x ξ α 1 k k 0 where α ξ and k are the scale parameter location parameter and shape parameter respectively the quantile x t of the gev distribution with a return period of t can be obtained by 10 x t ξ α k 1 l n t t 1 k to analyze changes in flood magnitude and frequency we counted for each of the four periods the magnitude and frequency of floods greater than 50 100 and 200 year floods estimated for the historical period 3 6 testing significance of changes the t test was applied to detect whether there was significant difference in the mean of the two data series efron 1969 in the test indices representing flood characteristics are compared for two different periods and the null hypothesis h0 is that the flood indices are statistically similar whereas the alternate hypothesis h1 is that the indices differ between the two periods if standardized test statistic t t 1 α 2 n m 2 h0 is rejected which means that there is a statistically significant difference between the hydrologic variables of two periods the test statistics t is calculated by 11 t x y s x 2 n s y 2 m where x and y are the sample means s x and s y are the sample standard deviations n and m are the sample sizes and α is the significance level 3 7 analysis of ensemble spread contribution to flood changes in the past 1000 and future the range achieved by all ensemble members provides a measure for quantifying overall uncertainty assuming that each projection is equally probable the average variance σ 2 as a measure of ensemble spread contribution is defined here as the sum of average variances from the individual components of the ensemble vormoor et al 2015 12 σ 2 ensemble σ 2 gcm σ 2 ds σ 2 hm the computation of average variances for the cmip5 gcm models σ 2 gcm is as follows for each combination i out of n possible combinations of bc methods and hydrological models we compute the variance σ gcm i 2 subject to 4 gcms then we compute σ 2 gcm as the average over all σ gcm i n 2 similarly for each combination j out of m possible combinations of gcms and hydrological models the variance σ ds j 2 subject to two bc methods is computed in addition the σ 2 ds as the average of all σ ds j m 2 σ 2 hm is calculated as shown above this method was used to recognize the ensemble spread contribution generated by different sources in the model chain for two variables between the two periods past1 past2 past2 historical historical future i the change in the index s d and ii the change in the difference between snowmelt and rainfall generated events 4 results 4 1 model evaluations the calibration 1958 2002 and validation 2003 2012 metrics from the hbv and xaj models for the 34 study catchments are given in table 4 the average nse values for the xaj and hbv models are 0 79 and 0 75 for the calibration as well as 0 76 and 0 71 for the validation period respectively in addition the average p b i a s values of the xaj and hbv models are 8 and 11 for the calibration period and 10 and 12 for the validation period comparisons of simulated and observed hydrographs as well as peak discharge are shown in figs s1 and s2 both hydrological models have relatively good and similar performances in simulating the seasonal pattern and observed peak flow distribution for most catchments in addition it is worth noting that the hbv model underestimates the winter low flow for elverum losna and austenå these three catchments are regulated and the relatively high observed winter low flow is most likely caused by reservoir release while the xaj model manages to capture the winter low flows which might be because the recession coefficient from the groundwater module in the xaj model is very much adjustable to fit into the observation even it is regulated in general these two models perform satisfactorily for daily discharge simulation in all basins of norway the bias corrected precipitation and temperature from both dbc and ddm methods were evaluated by comparing with the observations during the period of 1958 2002 see fig s3 we calculated the relative error and absolute error between observed and gcm simulated precipitation and temperature indices respectively the deviations of mean annual precipitation and temperature are close to zero for the extreme precipitation we can see that raw gcm models all underestimate maximum 1 day precipitation but after bias correction by either dbc or ddm method the median of biases between simulated and observed precipitation approaches zero and smaller deviations are also found furthermore we compared the observed and simulated discharges the boxplots of the empirical distributions of annual maximum discharge from observations and five different discharge simulations over the reference period 1958 2002 are shown in fig 2 the simulated discharges shown with different colors are based on the calibrated hbv and xaj models driven by the observed climate data senorge dbc bias corrected gcms ddm bias corrected gcms and the raw gcm data bc methods not only considerably narrow the range of simulated distributions based on raw gcm data but also correct the large discrepancies underestimation or overestimation in the peak flow distributions between the observed and the simulated it can be seen from fig 2 that the median values of annual maximum discharges based on the bias corrected gcms with both the dbc and ddm methods are similar to those based on the senorge data although they all slightly underestimate the median values compared with those from the observed discharge for most of the catchments the distributions of annual maximum discharge from ddm corrected gcms are closer to those from the observed discharge than those from dbc corrected gcms and senorge data this might be related to the ddm method where extreme 90 precipitation and temperature 90 and 10 are applied to fit the generalized pareto distribution which provides larger values for the extremes than those from the dbc method this can be confirmed with the further significant difference analysis of extreme distributions based on the kolmogorov smirnov test in table s1 we are unable to draw a conclusion in the study that which bc method is more suitable for all the catchments in general hundecha et al 2016 pointed out that the choice of appropriate bc method for precipitation may depend on the flood regime of the catchment and the variables of interest mean or extreme a further comparison is made to assess the differences of two hydrological models in fig s4 we can see that the range as well as median value of the annual maximum discharge distribution from two models are similar although we can see the ranges from hbv model are slightly larger than those of xaj model in a few catchments in general the two hydrological models driven by the bias corrected gcms based on both dbc and ddm methods are able to reproduce satisfactorily the distribution of annual maximum discharge compared with that from the observed discharge as well as that from the simulations with senorge data for all the catchments in the following sections we will analyze the changes in flood characteristics based on the simulations driven by the bias corrected gcms with both dbc and ddm methods 4 2 changes in precipitation and temperature figs 3 and 4 show the mean temperature and annual precipitation from dbc corrected gcms respectively the figures present the changes over different periods including past1 past2 historical and future periods rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 from fig 3 we can see that three out of four climate models miroc esm is the exception show quite similar results for the mean annual temperature changes from past to future period for all catchments all gcms except miroc esm simulate a higher temperature in past1 than that in past2 which is consistent with previous studies about warmer climate condition in mca past1 and cooler climate in the lia past2 osborn and briffa 2006 mann et al 2009 for example the temperature reconstructions in scandinavia also indicate that the early 11th century was warmer and a distinct cooling was recorded from proxy data during 1550 1800 zawiska et al 2017 regarding the opposite temperature trend from past1 to past2 from miroc esm model it exhibits possible drifts for the trends of temperature during past 1000 years bothe et al 2013 the two future periods are much warmer compared with the historical period as well as the past periods which can be seen from all gcms the similar results can be seen in the mean annual temperature from bias corrected gcms by ddm method fig s5 for annual precipitation we see that dbc bias corrected gcms show different changes across periods in each catchment especially past1 vs past2 fig 4 for example in the knappom basin from east region of norway the past2 period is slightly dryer than the past1 period from mri cgcm3 and ccsm4 whereas we see the opposite trend in bcc csm1 1 and miroc esm it should be noted that unlike the change of mean annual temperature the change of annual precipitation during past future varies a lot in different gcms as well as in different catchments in general miroc esm gives the largest changes in annual precipitation from past1 to the future periods for almost all catchments whereas mri cgcm3 gives the smallest changes for most catchments of southwest middle and north norway similar changes are also seen in the annual precipitation for past1 past2 historical and future periods from ddm bias corrected gcms in fig s6 4 3 changes in flood seasonality and generating processes figs 5 and 6 show the seasonality index s d and the percentage of different flood generating processes for the past1 past2 historical and future periods at 34 study catchments from five subregions in norway moreover we used the t test significance level 0 01 for all catchments to investigate whether the mean of the samples from two adjacent periods is significantly different fig 5 shows that most of the seasonality indices s d are negative indicating the importance of the spring and summer floods we note that the distribution of the index s d changes in some catchments for past1 vs past2 and past2 vs historical period although the change is small compared with future change for example the median s d of bulken from west region shows a slightly increase from past1 to past2 and a decrease from past2 to historical period this change can be seen in all catchments except osenelv øren from west region as well as some catchments from east region i e knappom and magnor south region i e tingvatn and flaksvatn middle region i e høggås bru and north region i e fustvatn skarsvatn and jordbrufjell however none of the changes for past1 vs past2 or past2 vs historical period is significant we find most of the changes from historical vs future period are statistically significant by the t test besides when we compare past1 vs historical period we find that the interquartile range or median of the seasonality index s d show an increase in some catchments e g høggås bru krinsvatn and trangen the s d increase indicates less spring summer floods and more autumn winter floods this is probably because three out of four gcms project a warmer climate condition in historical period than that in past periods mca and lia this results in potentially more rainfall as well as higher chance of rainfall generated floods than snowmelt generated floods in fig 6 we see the ratios of rainfall snowmelt and mixed generated events relative to all events have changes from past1 to the past2 and from past 2 to the historical period for some of the catchments although none of the changes are statistically significant it is worth noting that snowmelt generated events have occasionally been more dominant during the mca than during the lia in some catchments e g eggafoss and skarsvatn with snowmelt floods one potential explanation for this might be a higher frequency of suddenly higher temperatures in spring summer during warm intervals compared to the lia as this phenomena is a known flood trigger however for the future scenarios the median of s d tends to increase to varying degrees or the interquartile range of the s d distribution becomes wider for most catchments especially for the rcp8 5 scenario this indicates that the proportion of autumn winter events relative to all flood events in all catchments will increase in the future for several catchments e g fusvatn tingvatn and viksvatn we see that the current flood system may shift from spring summer to autumn winter the fraction of snowmelt generated flood events is decreasing more or less in the future period under both rcp scenarios which is consistent with the results of flood seasonality the significant changes in the index s d and the difference in snowmelt and rainfall generated flood events from the historical period to the future could also be demonstrated based on the results of the t test for most catchments it is worth noting that the changes in flood seasonality are more significant than those of the flood generating processes from the above we can see some changes in both the flood seasonality index s d and the fraction of snowmelt or rainfall generated flood events from past1 to the historical period although none of the change is as significant as the change of future however it should be noted that some catchments have more autumn winter i e rainfall generated floods in lia period comparing with mca period which indicates that colder environment with smaller evapotranspiration may allow more rainfall flood events therefore the changes in flood seasonality and generating processes between past1 and past2 periods depend on the variability of precipitation and temperature that varies in different catchments for example it is not always more spring summer floods during past2 lia than during past1 mca which are influenced by the meteorological output of different gcms in general the flood changes from past1 mca warm to past 2 lia cold are not significant from the ensemble results which is probably mainly resulted from the limited difference between past1 and past2 in climate driving especially precipitation in addition we found that changes in flood seasonality are basically consistent with the changes in the generating processes for flood events which means that a decreased dominance of spring summer floods is closely related to rainfall replacing snowmelt as the main flood driving factor in the future mainly due to rising temperatures 4 4 changes in flood magnitude and frequency to answer the question of how flood magnitude and frequency change from past1 to the future we used the generalized extreme value gev distribution to estimate the flood sizes for selected return periods 50 year 100 year and 200 year for each ensemble member in the historical period fig 7 shows for each of the four periods past1 past2 historical and future rcp26 rcp85 the frequency of flood events exceeding the respective 50 year 100 year and 200 year flood levels whereas table 5 shows significant changes in flood frequency from past1 to past2 and past2 to historical and historical to future first we see that the median of the frequency of flood events at different extreme levels exhibits relatively consistent variability for the four periods for almost all study catchments from past1 and past2 to the historical periods there were small changes in the flood frequency in most of the catchments the results of the t test for flood frequency show significant changes in 3 catchments from past1 to past2 and in 7 catchments from past2 to historical periods table 5 for east region only one significant change was identified for the transition from the historical to the future periods i e the 50 year flood in engeren for the change to the future rcp8 5 scenario table 5 however significant increasing trends of flood frequency from the historical period to the future under both scenarios are seen in table 6 for many catchments in the other regions for example 11 of 23 and 17 of 23 catchments have significant flood frequency increases from the historical period to the rcp2 6 scenario and from the historical period to the rcp8 5 scenario respectively the changes between the same four periods of the magnitudes of the floods exceeding the 50 year 100 year and 200 year floods estimated for the historical period are shown in fig s7 we also used the t test for the mean magnitude of 50 100 and 200 year flood events not shown although there are some changes and a small fluctuation for the median and range of the flood events magnitudes at different return periods in fig s7 we find that there are no significant changes for the mean magnitude of the floods exceeding the 50 year 100 year and 200 year return periods for the past1 past2 historical and future periods in almost all catchments of norway based on the results of t test overall nonsignificant changes can be seen in the frequency and magnitude changes of floods from past1 to past2 as well as from past2 to the historical period based on the ensemble mean however the frequency of floods at different return periods tends to increase in some catchments from historical to future periods both rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 significant changes in flood driving factors and seasonality in most of the catchments are also detected from historical to future periods which all show a possible nonstationarity of floods characteristics in norway as the climate warmed 4 5 estimate ensemble spread contribution to flood changes in past1 past2 historical and future tables 6 and 7 show the fractional contribution to the total variance from the different elements of the ensemble for the changes in the seasonality index s d and the flood generating processes i e snowmelt and rainfall for the five regions of norway a more detailed result for each catchment can be seen in figs s8 and s9 in these two tables each column from left to right represents the changes of past1 vs past2 past2 vs historical period and historical period vs future under both the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios for almost all cases the gcm models give the largest contribution to the total ensemble spread the contribution of hydrological models is larger than that of bc methods for the changes from the past1 to past2 in all regions whereas bc methods uncertainty tends to be more important than that of hydrological models for changes historical vs future in all regions except the east and west for north middle and south region the bc methods uncertainty is rather higher than that of hydrological models except from the past1 to past2 the contributions of hydrological models are higher for the seasonality index s d than for the flood generating processes we also find that the contribution of gcm models and the bc methods is rather high in the catchments with an apparent change in the flood generating processes e g engesvatn krinsvatn and gåslandsvatn one explanation for this might be that the input data are closely connected to the gcm models and bc methods and then the changes in precipitation and temperature lead to changes in flood characteristics it s noteworthy that the contributions of hydrological models are relatively high in some catchments e g haugland lovatn and røykenes where the flood seasonality and generating processes show insignificant changes from past1 to the future period the minor changes of gcm ensembles between two adjacent periods might be due to the fact that difference between the two hydrological models two optimal parameter sets itself becomes the largest contributor 4 6 the uncertainty of climate models from the results presented in the previous section we observe that gcms ensembles have the highest contribution to the total ensemble spread for the changes in the index s d possible explanations for this can be that some gcms represent certain parts of the climate system poorly and are consequently unable to resolve certain processes related to the climate system or have inadequately constrained parameters this might again lead to systematic errors from these models in order to identify the uncertainties among the four gcms we conducted an in depth comparison of the four gcms for six selected catchments including i two snowmelt dominated catchments jordbrufjell and øvrevatn in north region ii two rainfall dominated catchments flaksvatn and osenelvv øren in south and west region and iii two mixed catchments lovatn and viksvatn in west region fig 8 presents the results of flood seasonality from past1 to the future period by the four bias corrected gcms the flood seasonality changes based on the four gcms are very different in all catchments the most robust signal across all catchments except lovatn and gcms is a positive shift in s d from the historical to the future periods the changes in s d across the past1 past2 and historical periods are less consistent for example the s d of model bcc csm1 1 is negative from past1 to the historical period in flaksvatn and osenelvv øren rainfall dominated catchments which is different from the other three gcms for the two snowmelt dominated catchments s d is larger in past1 mca period than past2 lia for nearly all gcms indicating that more spring summer floods occurred in the colder period of past2 however for the two rainfall dominated catchments the four gcms show large differences in flood seasonality changes for example the seasonality index s d is smaller in past1 than in past2 lia from ccsm4 and miroc esm in osenelvv øren which is opposite to the other two gcms this is somehow consistent with what we can see in the changes of mean annual precipitation in fig 3 where the mean annual precipitation increases from past1 to past2 from ccsm4 and miroc esm models while no big change in precipitation is seen for the other two models in addition for the two mixed catchments we see a higher s d in past2 compared with past1 for almost all gcms which is most likely caused by an increase in precipitation as well seen in fig 3 in general we can see that the uncertainty for analyzing flood changes is inevitable due to the large uncertainty of gcms simulation of both precipitation and temperature the flood frequency from past1 to the future by the four bias corrected gcms is presented in fig 9 from past1 to past2 for the two snowmelt dominated catchments the frequency of flood events exceeding different return levels shows relatively small variability from the gcms but with varying degrees of changes while for rainfall dominated and mixed catchments there are larger differences including trends and ranges for the change in flood frequency from the gcms in addition we also used the statistical t test to check the significance of the differences between past1 and past2 for each of the four gcms our analysis reveals that there are large differences among the gcms although no significant changes are detected from past1 to past2 for flood seasonality and frequency changes in most basins see fig 8 and table s2 more importantly the changes in different extreme levels between past1 and past2 for each of the four gcms are different from what we see in the results based on the gcm ensemble mean 5 discussions 5 1 future flood implications observational data and model projections indicated a future increasing intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events worldwide although with considerable regional variations jian et al 2014 meanwhile an increase of flood events in some regions in the future is also projected by the results of climate and hydrological models hirabayashi et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 in our study we focus not only on the magnitude and frequency of flood events but also on evolution in flood seasonality and generating processes across longer time scales some previous studies have discussed the above mentioned changes in flood events in the future vormoor et al 2015 found for instance that autumn winter floods become more numerous and important in six study catchments in norway which may lead to the flood regimes shifting from spring summer to autumn winter for those northernmost catchments furthermore rainfall generated events tend to occur more frequently in the future perhaps more importantly the greatest increase in the importance of rainfall is expected to occur in the northernmost catchments where the changes in flood seasonality also happened to be the highest this agrees with our study and other similar findings köplin et al 2014 arnell 1999 the strongest shift in flood seasonality and generating processes can be explained by decreased snow cover and shorter snow seasons due to rising temperatures under a warmer climate this change may cause a reduction in the occurrence of flood events driven by snowmelt støren and paasche 2014 vormoor et al 2016 we also investigated the magnitude and frequency of floods exceeding different extreme levels from past1 to the future estimated frequency changes in the flood events based on the ensemble results indicate both increases and decreases for the future in the catchments considered the direction of change may be related to the change in the dominant flood generation process however the magnitudes of floods exceeding the 100 year flood level seem to change slightly across all periods from the two past and historical periods to the future period the results show that changes in flood frequency dominate over changes in magnitude vormoor et al 2015 also pointed out that change of flood magnitudes or frequencies or both is the cause for the change of flood seasonality they found that two of all study catchments øvrevatn and junkerdalselv with the strongest changes in flood seasonality associated with flood generating processes show decreasing magnitudes of flood events but increasing frequency compared 1961 1990 with 2071 2100 5 2 norwegian flood events over a long term period from the past 1000 to the historical period in this study we attempt to realize if the last 100 years owning instrumental measurements could cover the variability of flood events over a long term period of more than 1000 years the characteristics of flood events in norway from the two past and historical periods to the future are explored in the present study we found that all ensemble results show an insignificant and mild variability in flood event changes including seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency from past1 subperiod in mca and past2 subperiod in lia to the historical period in addition changes in the characteristics of flood events are not consistent among the ensemble members in contrast a possible systematic shift in flood seasonality and generating processes as well as an increase in flood frequency for some study catchments in norway are unambiguously obvious in future rcp simulations from the 19th century to the end of the 21st century which align well with other studies lawrence 2020 vormoor et al 2015 in our study we used the annual maximum floods amf in the analysis whereas in previous studies flood events from a peak over threshold pot approach is used for analyzing flood seasonality vormoor et al 2015 2016 since the pot approach will result in more than flood event per year in particular in mixed and rainfall driven flood regimes it is possible that pot data would be more sensitive to identify mixed regimes nevertheless our results shows that the amf data enables us to identify several cases with mixed regimes where we see a seasonality index around zero fig 5 we therefor believe that the seasonality analysis based on amf data shown in fig 5 provides robust results and using pot data might slightly change the results without influencing our conclusions some studies focus on the change in extreme precipitation at decades or centuries and cover time periods longer than the instrumental data record for instance similar to our study lewis 2018 showed that compared with the observation 100 years in australia there is no systematic difference in extreme precipitation as the length of the time series increases 1000 years huo et al 2020 reported that no direct evidence was shown for the nonstationarity of precipitation extremes in europe from past 1000 to the historical period although a wider range of extremes may be produced over a long term simulation a previous study by sheng et al 2020 used a climate model and a numerical model to obtain the maximum annual discharge during 1000 2012 period for the yalu river in china and estimate flood annual exceedance probabilities they discovered that the fitted flood frequency curves between mca and lia period were similar even though the climate between these two periods was different in addition the occurrence frequency of 50 year flood events during 1000 1450 was close to that of the lia 1450 1840 which is in line with our results however it is obvious that the flood frequency curves for 1841 2012 are different from the other two periods 1000 1450 and 1451 1840 this is because the higher frequency of extreme precipitation lead to higher frequency of extreme discharge this apparent difference in results compared to our study may have several explanations first there were differences in the study area and inconsistent divisions for historical and future periods second sheng et al 2020 used a single model millennial realization echo g climate model that coupled the spectral atmospheric model echam4 and a primitive equation global model hope g whereas the model chain in our study included a multimodel suite of cmip5 simulations bc methods and hydrological models another study using ccsm4 last millennium simulations also demonstrated that unlike surface temperature responses effective precipitation i e precipitation minus evaporation losses differences throughout periods of the last 1000 years were not statistically significant including when comparing the mca and lia landrum et al 2013 high resolution reconstructions of flood variability during the last 10 000 years of glomma the largest river in central eastern norway show that there is considerable non stationarity for the last 1000 years engeland et al 2020 similarly ekblom johansson et al 2020 have observed a marked variability in flood frequency for western norway where the influence of changes in precipitation rain typically is somewhat higher than for eastern norway the growing body of empirical evidence for non stationarity in flooding in norway støren et al 2012 støren and paasche 2014 engeland et al 2020 ekblom johansson et al 2020 strongly suggests that this is a prevailing feature that cuts across catchment typology and interactions with climate this might suggest that the underlying natural climate variability in the climate models applied here is not entirely captured there are also other catchment land feedback mechanisms that are not directly dictated by climate such as changes in vegetation cover for the past due to forest clearing and livestock as well as the establishment of more pastoral landscapes that can impact the frequency and magnitude of floods e g tollan 2002 hall et al 2014 specifically forest clearing will reduce interception losses and intensify snowmelt on the ground and decrease in vegetation cover will reduce infiltration capacity and evapotranspiration making more precipitation and snowmelt converting to runoff which may heighten the risk of flooding 5 3 uncertainties of modeling floods over the past 1000 years gcms vs ensemble mean it should be pointed out that only four cmip5 gcms with one single member each for the past 1000 simulations were used in our study the limited number of gcms without different initial condition ensembles might lead to a loss of generality of the uncertainty caused by gcms moreover in this study we included most gcms that contributed past 1000 years simulations to cmip5 and we did not exclude models based on their skills in capturing observed precipitation and temperature variability due to the small number of gcms providing past 1000 years simulations this may also result in bias errors in the modeling floods from the ensemble mean however each experiment used the same set of models hence possible biases in model representations compared to observations are not considered as inherent obstacles to studying flood variability lewis 2018 in addition we used means and interquartile ranges based on the model chain ensembles 16 members to assess the differences in several flood characteristics between past1 and past2 periods representing the mca and lia respectively this approach might mask the signal provided by each gcm since a large variability of mean annual precipitation and temperature changes over past 1000 years from different gcms was seen it is worth mentioning that the uncertainty range of the ensemble does not show any systematic pattern from past1 to past2 which rather depends on the gcm the time period and the catchment considered therefore we identified some changes in the flood characteristics between past1 and past2 based on each individual gcm even if the ensemble mean indicated no changes we found more autumn winter floods in past2 lia than in past1 mca from the miroc esm and ccsm4 models in several catchments which is probably associated with the increased precipitation from the ccsm4 model and the increased temperature from the miroc esm model from past1 mca to past2 lia in addition increased flood frequency from past1 mca to past2 lia was seen in snow dominated catchments several previous studies show more frequent flooding in the little ice age specifically during the late maunder solar minimum 1675 1725 which potentially can be related to lower surface air temperatures blöschl et al 2020 identified nine flood rich periods and associated regions in the past half millennium in europe based on reconstructed data most flood rich periods in western and central europe occurred during ce 1500 to 1800 period and blöschl et al 2020 suggested that lower temperatures during this period lead to less evaporation and hence higher soil moisture which in turn resulted in larger floods further in depth investigations are needed to confirm this since the depth of soil layers and its impacts on flooding events are different in different regions of europe for example the soil depth is thinner in norway than in western europe it is also worth noting that despite the possible biases between cmip5 simulations for the last millennium climate and reconstructed hydroclimates in northern hemisphere global climate models still provide useful insights into the characteristics of pre instrumental hydroclimates ljungqvist et al 2016 6 conclusions in this study for the first time we present the modelled daily river discharge and floods in norway from the last millennium past 1000 to the end of the 21st century using a model chain approach with multi model ensembles including four gcms two bc methods and two hydrological models the model simulation is over 1000 years 850 2099 which is divided into four periods of past1 mca past2 lia historical and future periods the flood changes i e the changes in flood seasonality generating processes as well as frequency and magnitude were further investigated in 34 catchments over five subregions of norway we further estimate the uncertainty contributions from different components of model chain to flood changes and find that the gcms are the biggest contributor at last more specific analysis is given for comparison of four gcms in six selected catchments the following conclusions can be drawn from the results all gcms except miroc esm simulate a higher mean temperature in past1 mca than past2 lia while from past1 to past2 no consistent change can be seen across the annual precipitation which varies a lot in different gcms and catchments there are changes in flood characteristics i e seasonality generating processes magnitude and frequency in some catchments from past1 to past2 and past2 to historical but none of the changes is statistically significant based on the ensemble mean results there will be a flood frequency increase in the future for most of the catchments in norway more autumn winter floods are projected in the future with fewer spring summer floods and snowmelt dominated floods will shift to rainfall dominated floods in some catchments over the east south and west four gcms show large differences in flood changes seasonality and frequency from past1 mca to past2 lia over three types of floods due to the uncertainty from both precipitation and temperature overall the gcm ensemble is the largest contributor to the total variance in flood changes followed by the bc methods or the hydrological models hydrological models uncertainty tends to be more important than bc methods for the changes of past1 vs past2 in most catchments while it is opposite rank for the changes of historical vs future period in this study we attempted to explore whether large scale gcms could show some commonalities for local regional flood events more questions arise from the study for example what are the dynamic mechanisms of gcms from large scale circulation driving the variability of extreme precipitation temperature leading to different local regional flood events how can we better evaluate the modeling of flood events over the past 1000 years for example by documented climate signal at large regional scale e g dry wet periods or proxy data that can give long term high resolution historical flood information at local basin scale furthermore what are the different hydrological models abilities to account for all processes that might lead to changes in flood sizes e g evapotranspiration soil frost changes in land use further investigations are needed to provide in depth insight into these questions credit authorship contribution statement ran huo

2941,the past decades have witnessed frequent flood peak discharges increase in the lower yellow river lyr yet no consensus for its mechanism has been achieved here 21 events of the peak discharge increase pdi in the period of 1973 2012 are analysed it is shown that the mean increment of peak discharge increases from 810 m3 s to 1158 m3 s and the frequency also increases from once every 2 years to once every 1 5 years after the completion of xiaolangdi xld reservoir afterwards the ordinary differential equations odes along the characteristics for the discharge are derived from which seven factors terms i vii that may affect the discharge variation are identified the effects related to the longitudinal change in flow density i and in the product of flow density and flow area ii the pressure terms due to river width gradient iii and flow density iv the external forces v the momentum term due to bed deformation vi and the imbalanced advection vii using field data of the 21 events the bed manning roughness is back calculated from the ordinary discharge equation which agrees with the documented values very well quantitative comparisons of the seven factors indicate that the pressure term due to the river width gradient plays a major role in promoting the pdi in most events whereas the external forces term is the primary cause that attenuates pdi the rest influencing factors have marginal effects with a much smaller magnitude keywords river flood hyperconcentrated flow peak discharge increase lower yellow river influencing factor data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the yellow river is noted for the huge amount of sediment it carries from the loess plateau wang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 a consequence of the heavy sediment load is widespread flooding in vulnerable regions causing serious casualties in history singh et al 2021 tian et al 2019 consequently the yellow river flooding has been a major disaster to chinese people in ancient times the mainstream of the lower yellow river lyr shifted frequently due to the easily erodible river bed and banks as well as the very high sediment overloading at the time of the ming dynasty this problem was partly alleviated by the strategy of building high levees and thus clearing sediments by converging flow wang and liu 2019 nevertheless this has caused a perched river in the lower reach where an abnormal phenomenon of downstream flooding peak discharge increase pdi has been noted mostly in the reach from xiaolangdi xld to huanyuankou hyk and farther to jiahetan jht fig 1 a an illustrative example is shown in fig 1 b the flood peak discharge at hyk station is much higher than that at the xld station since the pdi phenomenon may greatly aggravate flood risks much attention has been paid to its forming mechanism li 2008 li et al 2014 2017 qi et al 2011 there have been two types of pdis depending on whether the floodplain is inundated for pdis before the completion of the xld reservoir in 1999 floods often inundate the floodplain and it has been proposed that both strong erosion and the interaction between the main channel and the floodplain may play important roles for these pdis for example wang et al 2009 inferred that the main channel erosion and floodplain deposition may transit a wide shallow channel to a narrow deep channel leading to acceleration of the flood propagation and subsequently overlap of flood waves qi and li 1996 suggested that the main channel erosion and floodplain deposition may increase the water surface gradient between the main channel and the floodplain accelerating the water flowing from the floodplain to the channel this could add to a next flood thus resulting in a pdi li et al 2017 simulated the hyperconcentrated flood hf of august 1992 in a schematized representation of the channel floodplain system in the lyr this study successfully reproduced the morphological features of channel erosion and floodplain deposition which is an important basis for those previous explanations qi and li 1996 wang et al 2009 moreover some scholars have highlighted the role of strong bed erosion during the flooding process cao et al 2012 2006 dong et al 2012 kuang et al 1999 li et al 2014 wan and wang 1994 cao et al 2006 2012 numerically investigated the 1977 hf in the xiaobeiganliu reach of the middle yellow river and the 1992 hf in the lower yellow river in a schematic channel these indicate that sufficient bed erosion can lead to considerable increase in the volume of water sediment mixture and thus a pdi event similar findings were reported by qi et al 2011 and li et al 2014 when analysing the field data of the 1977 hf based on the eigenvalues of the governing equations ding et al 2010 also suggested that considerable bed deformations may play a significant role in the propagation of shallow water waves after the xld reservoir became operational in october 1999 floods are mainly constrained within the relatively deep channel without floodplain inundation for such in channel flooding pdis the following mechanisms have been proposed first the tail of the flood can be accelerated by hyperconcentration induced drag reduction and catch up with the peak thus yielding a pdi jiang et al 2006 li et al 2014 the opinion of drag reduction is mainly motivated by experimental data between the drag coefficient and the sediment concentration einstein and chien 1955 vanoni 1946 wang et al 1998 zhu and hao 2008 relevant arguments include the hyperconcentration related turbulence damping van maren et al 2009b winterwerp 2001 2006 winterwerp et al 2009 zhang 1963 the increase of viscous sublayer thickness in hyperconcentrated circumstances gust 1976 and a reduced of form drag by lack of sand dunes qi and sun 2013 wan 1985 in contrast ma et al 2017 reported that flood conditions in the lower yellow river approach the upper plane bed regime so large scale sand dunes may not exist second the pdi is possibly caused by the instability during flood propagation zhong et al 2013 near bed flow may behave as a bingham fluid and form a stagnant layer engelund and wan 1984 wan and wang 1994 wang 2002 wang and chien 1984 below the main flow region dominated by turbulent newtonian flow if the propagating dynamic wave behaves as a reverse diffusion process the stagnant layer may become unstable and mix with the flow above thus contributing to the pdi on the other hand qi and sun 2013 argue that flood flow in the lower yellow river is fully turbulent chien 1989 chien and wan 1999 van maren et al 2009a wang 2002 and that river clogging and instability of laminar flows will rarely happen physically flood wave propagation can be described by the shallow water equations swes since the swes are hyperbolic they can be rewritten as a set of ordinary compatibility equations along the characteristics therefore ordinary differential equations odes for the discharge are derived here which facilitate an analytical investigation of the main contributors for discharge variations from the ordinary discharge equations influencing factors that may affect the discharge variation are identified and quantified using field data of 21 pdi events in the lyr the validity of these understandings is supported by the satisfactory agreements between the back calculated manning roughness and the documented roughness values section 2 reviews the 21 pdi flood events during 1973 2012 as the data preparation and the detailed derivation and application of the odes are also introduced in section 2 in section 3 the model validation and the contributions of influencing terms are analysed uncertainties for these analyses are discussed in section 4 finally we summarize conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 data preparation the pdi phenomenon usually occurs at the xld hyk jht reach in the lyr fig 1 the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc has documented hydrological data of these three stations from these data 12 pdi events are identified during 1973 1999 before the completion of the xld reservoir and 9 pdi events are identified during 1999 2012 this means approximately one pdi event occurs every two years before 1999 but every one and a half years after 1999 table 1 summarized some specific hydrographic and morphological data of the 12 9 pdi events at the three stations for the xld and hyk stations the following data are given the time for occurrence of the peak discharge date and clock the flood peak discharge q the flow area a and the river width at the water surface b the volumetric sediment concentration c corresponding to the peak discharge the change of the bed area at cross section over the flooding event δ a s for the jht station the timings for these measured data are not the time when the peak discharge arrives at jht instead the time for the measured data of jht corresponds to the time of the peak discharge at xld the propagation time of peak discharge from xld to hyk δ t i is also shown in table 1 see the last column which is calculated by 10 11 column minus 3 4 column fig 2 presents the statistics of these 21 pdi events including the discharge increase magnitude q hyk q xld from xld to hyk fig 2 a and the increasing percentage q hyk q xld q xld fig 2 b from table 1 and fig 2 the averaged peak discharge increment and increasing percentage are 810 m3 s and 17 2 before 1999 in contrast these are 1158 m3 s and 41 5 after 1999 which are much larger than those before 1999 nevertheless the averaged peak discharges before 1999 are 4713 m3 s at xld and 5523 m3 s at hyk which is much larger than those after 1999 2792 m3 s at xld and 3950 m3 s at hyk these indicate that although the flow discharge has been modulated greatly due to the xld reservoir the pdi phenomenon has become more and more serious higher frequency larger increasing increment and higher increasing percentage of discharges 2 2 derivation and application of odes this section introduces the odes derived along the characteristics and discuss their application and applicability specifically the odes are derived in section 2 2 1 in section 2 2 2 we propose two strategies applied to obtain the formulations for discharge variation and the applicability of the deduced odes for the lyr is explored in

spatial gradients of the river width and flow density and 2 the longitudinal variation features of the river width and the flow density may be different along the two characteristics in the above parameters β 1 0 1 and β 2 0 1 represent the weighting parameters for the relative contribution of m in the m f reach and of n in the n f reach respectively 2 2 2 strategies for using the ode of discharge variation there can be two strategies to use eq 7 to attain the flow discharge at f the most straightforward strategy strategy 1 is only to use eq 7a from which a relation of peak discharges between m and f can be obtained in the following 8 q f q m α 1 q m part 1 α 2 ρ m a m ρ m a f part 2 α 3 δ t part 3 where α 1 ρ m m ρ m f 1 α 2 d 1 ρ m f α 3 1 ρ m f e 1 k 1 δ t from eq 8 the discharge at f is dictated by the discharge at m and three additional parts part 1 part 2 and part 3 as shown in table 2 part 1 2 involve only one influencing term respectively i e i in part 1 and ii in part 2 while part 3 can be further divided into four influencing terms iii vi by the substitution of the expressions of e 1 and k 1 all these terms have the dimension of l3 t following the expressions of the six influencing terms in table 2 see the forth column one can readily deduce their effects on pdi from a qualitative perspective which lead to fig 4 term i is the product of the coefficient α 1 and the discharge at m since the discharge at m is always positive the α 1 value determines the role of term i since α 1 ρ m m ρ m f 1 term i represents the effect of the longitudinal flow density change on the pdi considering that the flow density depends directly on sediment concentration a longitudinal decreasing sediment concentration means α 1 0 and vice versa consequently longitudinal decreasing sediment concentration would promote pdi whereas a longitudinal increasing sediment concentration would attenuate pdi term ii is the product of the coefficient α 2 and the longitudinal variation of ρ m a i e ρ m b h in the m f reach where the coefficient α 2 depends on d 1 given that the flow in yellow river is always subcritical e g gh q a it can be easily proved that d 1 is always positive consequently α 2 would be always positive therefore it is the longitudinal variation of the product ρ m a that determines the effect of term ii on the pdi it is appreciated that a longitudinal decreasing ρ m a would promote pdi and in contrast a longitudinal increasing ρ m a would attenuate pdi terms iii vi are included in part 3 reflecting the accumulated effects of four factors the cumulative effects of pressure term due to the longitudinal river width gradient and the longitudinal flow density gradient are involved in terms iii and iv respectively from the expression of term iii it is apparent that ρ m δ t g h are always positive and accordingly the effect of term iii is dictated by the critical parameter b x apparently a positive b x leads to a positive term iii and the reverse a negative value in other words an increasing river width in the streamwise direction would facilitate pdi and vice versa likewise the effect of term iv depends on the critical factor ρ m x as other parameters ρ m δ t g h h c a involved in its expression are always positive therefore a longitudinal increasing flow density would promote pdi whereas a longitudinal decreasing flow density would attenuate pdi term v is related to the cumulative effects of external force composed of gravity and resistance it is recognized that the relative strength of the two forces determines the effect of term v because other parameters ρ m δ t are positive in the expression when the gravity is greater than the resistance i e g t 0 term v would promote pdi and vice versa term vi reflects the effect of the momentum term due to the bed deformation the expression of k 1 constituting term vi predominately involves two parts i e the product of q a gh ρ s δ a s at m and f respectively and the weighting parameter β 1 determines their respective magnitudes since q a gh and ρ s are always positive the effect of term vi is dictated by the change of bed area δ a s it follows that the simultaneous bed degradation i e δ a s 0 at both the two neighbouring stations would promote pdi and vice versa obviously it is hard to determine the effect of term vi given the inconsistent bed deformation deposition or erosion at the two stations under this condition one has to take the value of β 1 and the bed deformations of two stations into account to deduce the effect of term vi the second strategy uses both eq 7a and 7b by the mathematical manipulation eq 7b d 1 eq 7a d 2 from which a relation of peak discharges among m n and f can be obtained in the following 9 q f q m α 1 q m part 1 α 2 ρ m a m ρ m a n part 2 α 3 δ t part 3 α 4 ρ m q m ρ m q n part 4 where α 1 ρ m m ρ m f 1 α 2 1 ρ m f d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 α 3 1 ρ m f e 1 d 2 e 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 k 1 d 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 1 δ t α 4 1 ρ m f d 1 d 2 d 1 from eq 9 the discharge at f depends on the discharge at m and four additional parts part 1 4 where the effects of the discharge at n are involved four influencing terms iii vi constitute part 3 while only one influencing term for the other parts i e i in part 1 ii in part 2 and vii in part 4 all terms here also have the same dimension of l3 t a total of seven influencing terms i vii defined in this strategy are shown in table 2 see the fifth column from which their qualitative performance also is illustrated in fig 4 term i obtained here is the same as that in strategy 1 associated with the longitudinal change of flow density in the m f reach as deduced above a longitudinal decreasing sediment concentration would promote pdi and the reverse would attenuate pdi term ii is the product of the coefficient α 2 and the difference of ρ m a i e ρ m b h between m and n in which the coefficient α 2 is determined by both d 1 and d 2 it can be proved that α 2 is invariably positive due to the positive value of d 1 and the negative value of d 2 given the subcritical flow e g gh q a accordingly the effect of term ii depends on the difference of ρ m a irrespective of the change of the middle reach it is appreciated that a decreasing ρ m a directed from m to n would promote pdi whereas an increasing ρ m a would inhibit pdi see fig 4 it is similar to strategy 1 terms iii vi constitute part 3 reflecting the accumulated effects related to the four key factors i e b x ρ m x g t δ a s however the qualitative performances of the four terms are not identical to that in strategy 1 because the expressions are more complicated see the fifth column in table 2 taking into account the impact of the f n reach specifically positive parameters d 1 and d 2 d 2 are introduced in terms iii vi following the expressions of terms iii v their effects are directly determined by b x ρ m x g t due to other parameters ρ m δ t g h h c a are always positive for terms iii and iv a monotonically increasing trend of the key factor in the streamwise direction would promote pdi and vice versa for term v g t 0 would promote pdi while g t 0 would inhibit pdi the effect of term vi depends on k 1 d 2 k 2 d 1 where k 1 involves the bed deformation at m and f affected by β 1 and k 2 involves the bed deformation at n and f affected by β 2 it is difficult to determine the sign of term vi due to the complicated components in the expression which prevent a qualitative understanding for term vi given β 1 β 2 the complicated expression can be simplified as the sum of three parts related to the longitudinal variation of δ a s in the m n m f and f n reach as shown in the notes of table 2 this provides an approach to clarify how the term vi is affected by bed deformation and facilitates the qualitative understanding of term vi accordingly the longitudinal variation of δ a s is used to predict the effect of term vi i e a monotonically increasing δ a s would promote pdi whereas a monotonically decreasing δ a s would attenuate pdi it is different from strategy 1 in which the δ a s at m and f i e erosion or deposition are directly used to predict the effect of term vi it is also noted that the effects of terms iii vi are difficult to be determined qualitatively in the case of non monotonic variation along the m f n reach alternatively their impacts may depend on the dominant reach apart from the above influencing terms an additional term vii in part 4 representing the influence of imbalanced advection transport between upstream and downstream is also considered term vii is the product of a coefficient α 4 and the difference of ρ m q i e ρ m b h u between m and n the α 4 is invariably negative with a positive d 1 and a negative d 2 and thus term vii is determined by the difference of ρ m q accordingly an increasing ρ m q would promote pdi whereas a decreasing ρ m q would attenuate pdi 2 2 3 correspondence between m f n and xld hyk jht before applying the discharge equation either strategy 1 or strategy 2 one should check whether the three stations xld hyk and jht can have a similar relation as m f n shown in fig 3 under the assumption that the correspondence between xld hyk jht and m f n is established the following relations are required 10a x 1 x 0 t 1 t 0 β 1 q a gh xld 1 β 1 q a gh hyk 10b x 1 x 2 t 1 t 0 β 2 q a gh jht 1 β 2 q a gh hyk for eq 10 we can take x 1 x 0 i e l mf in fig 3 as an unknown which can be back estimated from other parameters using measured data at the three stations the discrepancy between the calculated l mf and the actual distance from xld to hyk i e l xh 132 km would indicate whether the three stations have a similar relation as m f n however flood wave propagation in the lyr is very complex from inside the channel to overflowing on the floodplain from relatively narrow deep to wide shallow channel it is therefore inaccurate to directly adopt the characteristic celerity for estimation as a compromise the characteristic celerity along the s characteristics the right hand side of eq 10a is replaced by the following estimation l xh δ t i where δ t i is the actual time interval for peak discharge propagation from xld to hyk see the last column in table 1 in addition it is necessary to specify the β 2 value for calculating l mf here we tentatively take three values 1 0 5 0 as examples fig 5 a shows the range of calculated l mf with different β 2 on average the calculated value of l mf is 108 km 106 km and 109 km against the β 2 value of 1 0 5 and 0 respectively fig 5 b shows the relative deviation of the calculated distance l mf from the actual distance between xld and hyk l xh which is defined as r x l mf l xh l xh from fig 5 b there are approximately two thirds of floods with r x 30 the area highlighted by blue shading indeed inevitable discrepancies arise in the above calculation this is because a more accurate result requires a very small distance between m and n in fig 3 based on the assumption that the disturbance propagates at a constant celerity however the hydrological survey is carried out only at the three adjacent stations xld hyk and jht along the river there are no other stations in between and the next station is gaocun which is 70 km downstream of jht station accordingly in the absence of more available data for the lyr it is advisable to assume m f and n as xld hyk and jht stations respectively 3 results 3 1 validation of the back estimated roughness prior to proceeding to estimate the following parameters are specified as ρ w 1000 kg m3 ρ s 2650 kg m3 p 0 45 by referring to the yellow river background parameters from the decomposition of each term in eqs 8 9 can be categorized into four types i e type 1 4 values of parameters in type 1 have been documented e g q a or can be readily computed e g h h c ρ m ρ s δ t δ t i and δ a s the difference in the cross sectional area of the bed above a reference datum before and after the flood season see table 1 from the documented data in table 1 i e q a b c and the parameters that have been specified above i e ρ w ρ s p values of parameters in type 2 e g b x ρ m x j b can be computed from type 1 parameters using linear assumption among type 2 parameters b x and ρ m x are concerned about the spatial gradients of the river width and the flow density and the values of which in the xld hyk and hyk jht reach are used at xld and jht respectively while b x and ρ m x at hyk depend on which one of the characteristics follows along i e the xld hyk reach is used at hyk for the s characteristics whereas the hyk jht reach for the s characteristics see fig 6 fig 7 shows the values of j b which are estimated by the longitudinal gradient of the bed elevation of the thalweg it exhibits the appreciable difference between the upstream xld hyk reach and the downstream hyk jht reach of the hyk station that is the upstream reach black line is steeper than the downstream reach red line in most floods to accurately describe this feature the bed slopes of the xld hyk reach and the hyk jht reach are adopted at xld and jht respectively in particular the bed elevation gradient in the xld jht reach is used at the hyk station it is noted that the filed data of bed elevation at the xld station before 2006 are missing and thus the data at the closest tiexie station is used as a replacement values of parameters in type 3 i e β 1 β 2 must be specified manually and three values 1 0 5 0 are tentatively used here in addition for the values of manning roughness i e n in type 4 there is no systematically documented data but a rough range of which can be given from rare measured data therefore it is proposed here to back calculate the manning roughness from parameters of types 1 3 afterwards the back calculated bed roughness is compared to the documented range of which the discrepancy is adopted as an indicator for the reasonableness of the present method of particular note is that the bed material and bedform also considerably affect the roughness value for instance bed incisions accompanied by sediment coarsening after damming and the change of bed topography facilitate the development of large dunes which contribute to the increase of flow resistance ma et al 2022 all these impacts are incorporated into the back calculated roughness value in the present study fig 8 shows the back calculated manning roughness in strategy 1 and strategy 2 where three scenarios are conducted in both strategies specifically β 1 1 0 5 and 0 are used in strategy 1 for convenience in analysis assuming β 1 β 2 in strategy 2 and also three values 1 0 5 0 are used in strategy 1 the roughness varies in 0 007 0 036 0 008 0 031 and 0 006 0 04 with the average roughness of 0 019 0 015 and 0 013 corresponding to β 1 1 0 5 and 0 respectively in strategy 2 the average manning roughness are 0 016 0 014 and 0 014 whose variation ranges are 0 009 0 03 0 008 0 03 and 0 009 0 039 corresponding to β 1 β 2 1 0 5 and 0 respectively it is appreciated that a larger roughness value is observed in no 2 3 4 18 floods this is because of the relatively larger water depth or flow area in these floods which leads to a larger c 1 in no 2 3 4 floods when weighting parameters β 1 β 2 take 1 or a larger g in no 18 flood when weighting parameters β 1 β 2 take 0 or 0 5 these differences contribute to a large magnitude of parameter t t c 1 c 2 g c and therefore obtain a comparatively large roughness value t ρ m g a j f j f n 2 q a 2 h 4 3 numerical uncertainties are inevitable due to simplified assumptions of complex parameters during calculation e g linear assumptions for parameters in type 2 although the roughness values in these floods exhibit deviations from most floods they are appreciable only in specific weighting parameters nevertheless all the back calculated roughness values are almost entirely within the rough range of previously documented results by the yrcc 0 004 0 058 the reasonably good agreement between the back calculated roughness and the documented data proves the applicability of the ordinary equations for describing the downstream variation of peak discharge 3 2 performance of influencing terms in this section both the qualitative analysis of influencing terms and the quantitative results of 21 actual floods are employed to reveal insights into the physical mechanism of pdi specifically fig 9 shows the actually longitudinal change of some key factors ρ m b h δ a s q from the observed data which is prepared to figure out the qualitative performances of influencing terms in 21 floods the longitudinal variation of field data involves six trends given the monotonicity of the longitudinal trend and the relative magnitude of xld and jht both monotonic trend and non monotonic trend are observed for the longitudinal change of flow density river width water depth and bed deformation at the xld hyk jht reach relative to the non monotonic variation of flow discharge that always increases in the xld hyk reach and decreases in the hyk jht reach for strategy 1 it is available to obtain the qualitative performances of terms i iii iv by corresponding the actual trends of the flow density river width in the xld hyk reach to the theoretical analysis in fig 4 similarly the qualitative performances of terms i iii iv vi in strategy 2 can be determined by the consistency between the monotonic trends of flow density river width bed deformation at the xld hyk jht reach and that in fig 4 however the qualitative effects of terms ii vii is extremely hard to predict directly because the synchronous consideration of multiple factors is necessitated ρ m b h are involved in term ii and ρ m q are involved in term vii apart from this the qualitative performances of the influencing terms dictated by a non monotonic variation in strategy 2 are also unpredictable the quantification appears to be an imminent step towards revealing enhanced understanding of pdi in recognition the fact that the uncertainty of the effects for influencing terms may remain if only analyse from a qualitative perspective hence the seven influencing terms are further quantified by documented data to better compare their influence each term is divided by the discharge increment and the results are shown in fig 10 strategy 1 and fig 11 strategy 2 from figs 10 11 three types of factors that affect pdi are identified as promoting factors inhibiting factors and uncertain factors which are discussed in detail below for convenience results relating to β 1 β 2 1 is used for discussion whereas the influence of β 1 β 2 is discussed in section 4 3 2 1 promoting factors 3 2 1 1 pressure term due to the river width gradient term iii is the pressure term due to the gradient of river width which is always positive in fig 10 from a qualitative sense the effect of term iii in strategy 1 depends on the longitudinal variation of river width in the xld hyk reach it is recognized that a longitudinal increasing river width would promote pdi see fig 4 not surprisingly appreciable increases of the river width from xld to hyk station are observed in all the 21 floods see fig 9 confirming the promoting effect of term iii also in fig 10 the much greater magnitude of term iii further illustrates the dominant role of term iii in promoting pdi from a quantitative sense in strategy 2 term iii is closely related with the longitudinal variation of river width in the xld hyk jht reach qualitatively term iii would promote pdi when the river width monotonically increases in the streamwise direction and vice versa see fig 4 yet as shown in fig 9 the river width monotonically increases only in 4 floods nos 6 9 14 19 while it always increases along xld hyk reach but decreases along hyk jht reach in the rest floods interestingly it is seen in fig 11 that term iii is invariably positive in 21 floods it is apparent that the promoting effect due to a positive term iii still prevails in each flood this indicates the increasing river width in the xld hyk reach appears to be more dominant for these non monotonic circumstances from a quantitative sense term iii is still prevailing with a relatively appreciable magnitude which is the largest in 9 floods nos 7 10 14 18 20 and the second largest in 11 floods nos 1 6 9 15 17 21 3 2 2 inhibiting factors 3 2 2 1 external force term term v is the external force term that comprises gravity and resistance whose effects is determined by the relative strength of gravity and resistance it is seen in fig 10 and fig 11 that term v is negative in nearly 20 floods except no 15 in both strategies indicating that the resistance prevails and it is greater than gravity in most floods accordingly the greater magnitude of negative term v is evoked by the prevailing of the resistance in strategy 1 term v is a secondary influencing factor relative to term iii for most floods from a quantitative sense except nos 2 10 15 while in strategy 2 term v is the most dominant in 12 floods nos 1 6 8 9 15 17 21 and it is subdominant for other 9 floods these all demonstrate the external force term plays the paramount role in attenuating the pdi 3 2 2 2 longitudinal decreasing flow density the influence of longitudinal flow density change is incorporated both in term i and term iv the former reflects the effect of density variation on upstream flow discharge and the latter is the pressure term due to the longitudinal density gradient a unique feature is obvious according to the qualitative analysis of strategy 1 see fig 4 that is as the flow density decreases longitudinally in the m f reach term i promotes pdi but term iv attenuates pdi and vice versa it is seen from fig 9 that the flow density decreases in the xld hyk reach in 19 floods except nos 1 2 floods consequently one can readily infer that term i promotes pdi and term iv attenuates pdi is prevalent yet the magnitudes of terms i and iv are mostly far smaller than other terms so that they are hardly found to be visible in fig 10 thus fig 12 is given to exhibit the term iv against term i where the horizontal coordinate represents term i and the vertical coordinate represents term iv it is clearly seen in fig 12 a that the data points are mostly distributed in the fourth quadrant this quantitative performance further underpins the inference from the above qualitative analysis i e term i predominantly promotes pdi while term iv shows the completely reverse effect term i in strategy 2 is the same as that in strategy 1 while an essential difference has to be noted in term iv is that its effect depends on the density change in the xld hyk jht reach it is obvious that the attenuation of pdi due to term iv would be achieved given the flow density decreases monotonically in the xld hyk jht reach from fig 9 it is seen that the density decreases monotonically in most floods nos 3 10 12 13 15 21 consequently one can readily deduce the reverse effects of term i in relation to term iv are evident in these floods i e term i plays a facilitating role in pdi while term iv plays an inhibitory role see fig 12 b yet also a few floods with non monotonic changes of flow density are documented in fig 9 specifically the flow density decreases in the xld hyk reach but increases in the hyk jht reach for nos 11 14 floods which is in contrast to nos 1 2 floods it is hard to infer the effect of term iv for these floods with complex variation of the longitudinal density from a qualitative sense by referring to the quantitative results it is found that term iv promotes pdi in no 1 flood and it attenuates pdi in nos 2 11 14 floods it is also noted that both term i and term iv play a role in promoting pdi in the no 2 flood this indicates the effects of term i and term iv may not be rigorously opposite under the condition of a non monotonic variation of flow density furthermore a significant feature deserves particular attention that is although term i is positive in most floods e g nos 2 21 flood its magnitude is generally lower than term iv see fig 12 from the quantitative results considering the combined role of term i and term iv an inhibiting effect on pdi due to the longitudinal density variation prevails in most floods except nos 1 2 8 flood in strategy 1 and nos 1 8 14 in strategy 2 consequently the longitudinal change of flow density mostly plays a role in inhibiting pdi however this effect is marginal with a sufficiently small magnitude 3 2 2 3 imbalanced advection transport term vii is an additional term due to the lower hyk jht reach is considered in strategy 2 it represents the effect of imbalanced advection transport which is dependent on the difference of ρ m q between xld and jht according to the qualitative analysis an increasing ρ m q directed from xld to jht would promote pdi and vice versa the documented observation provides the respective features of the flow density and the flow discharge which are the decomposition of ρ m q see fig 9 specifically the flow density and the flow discharge of xld station are mostly greater than that of jht station except no 14 flood with a greater density and nos 2 19 20 floods with a greater discharge at jht station consequently the product of the density and the discharge of xld station is mostly greater than that of jht station except in no 19 flood this results in a negative term vii to attenuate pdi for most floods also term vii has only a marginal influence on pdi because its magnitude is comparatively small 3 2 3 uncertain factors 3 2 3 1 longitudinal change of ρ m a due to the pressure gradient and advection the effect of term ii depends on the longitudinal variation of ρ m a i e ρ m b h it is recognized that a longitudinal decreasing ρ m b h would promote pdi and vice versa obviously the variations of the physical quantities e g ρ m b h may affect the value of the product ρ m b h according to the field data see fig 9 the river width increases in all floods while the flow density except nos 1 2 and the water depth except nos 14 15 18 19 mostly decreases along the xld hyk reach to clarify how the term ii is affected by these physical quantities ρ m b h further calculations of the spatial gradients of ρ m b bh and ρ m b h are conducted as shown in fig 13 the values of these gradients measure the longitudinal variations of ρ m b bh and ρ m b h in which a positive value means increasing longitudinally and the reverse means decreasing longitudinally fig 13 a shows the gradients for the xld hyk reach corresponding to strategy 1 it is seen that ρ m b bh and ρ m b h are longitudinally increases in most floods the longitudinal increasing river width appears to be dominant in the variations of ρ m b and bh due to the density and water depth are generally decrease it is also noted that the longitudinal variation of ρ m b h is basically in accordance with that of bh i e flow area as a result the negative term ii always attenuate pdi except no 12 in strategy 2 the effect of term ii is dependent on the longitudinal variation of ρ m b h between xld and jht according to the field data see fig 9 the river width increases except nos 8 15 while and the flow density except no 14 and the water depth mostly decreases between xld and jht station fig 13 b shows the variations of ρ m b bh and ρ m b h between xld and jht station it is found that the ρ m b also increases in most floods which is primarily ascribed to the increasing river width however it is hard to find out the predominant physical quantity that affects the longitudinal variation of bh because of its uncertain performance which increases in some floods nos 2 3 6 9 11 19 21 and decreases in other floods nevertheless the longitudinal variation of ρ m b h is also consistent with that of bh in most of floods except no 2 this means the effect of term ii is indeed sophisticated it plays a dual role in pdi i e promoting or attenuating pdi in different floods 3 2 3 2 momentum term due to bed deformation term vi reflects the effect of momentum term caused by bed deformation which is determined by not only the local bed deformation of the neighbouring stations but also the value of weighting factor under the assumption of β 1 1 herein term vi would promote pdi with the erosion of xld in strategy 1 from table 1 it is seen that the river bed is eroded i e δ a s 0 at xld station in more than a half of floods nos 1 9 16 19 21 not surprisingly the promoting effect of term vi in these floods nos 1 9 16 19 21 is expected according to the quantitative results in strategy 2 term vi is closely related to the longitudinal variation of δ a s from fig 9 the δ a s varies monotonically only in a few floods e g nos 3 4 16 21 flood with a longitudinal increasing δ a s and nos 15 18 19 flood with a longitudinal decreasing δ a s correspondingly it is certain that term vi promotes pdi in nos 3 4 16 21 flood while it attenuates pdi in nos 15 18 19 flood see fig 11 there are some floods in which the δ a s varies non monotonically see fig 9 it is found that term vi promotes pdi in nos 1 2 5 9 17 flood in which the δ a s increases along the xld hyk reach and decreases along the hyk jht reach in contrast term vi attenuates pdi in nos 10 14 20 flood in which the δ a s decreases along the xld hyk reach and increases along the hyk jht reach there is in fact reasonably good agreement between the quantitative performance of term vi and its qualitative analysis exclusively based on the xld hyk reach this also suggests that the flow discharge increases at hyk station seem to be more sensitive to the bed deformation upstream of hyk station 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the weighting parameters β 1 and β 2 from eqs 6 7 the weighting parameters β 1 and β 2 determines the relative contribution of two neighbouring stations β 1 for m and f β 2 for n and f on estimation of these seven factors in section 3 2 results are obtained by setting β 1 β 2 1 here their effects are discussed by setting their values to 0 and 0 5 fig 14 presents the effects of weighting parameters on estimation of influencing terms firstly it is seen that the responses of influencing terms to the increasing weighting parameter involve two tendencies i e increasing either positively or negatively of the influencing terms in magnitude a larger value of weighting parameter seems to mainly lead to a positive increasing trend for term iii relative to a negative increasing trend for term v and term vii yet uncertainties in changes of terms ii iv vi remain as the weighting parameter increases secondly variations of weighting parameters are inevitably affect the value of influencing terms in a quantitative sense yet the general impacts on pdi hold qualitatively for most terms as presented above in figs 10 11 nevertheless it is noted that there are still a few terms whose effects on pdi are rather sensitive to the change of weighting parameter the most telling case is terms v and vi in strategy 1 the effects of which involve apparent inconsistency as the change of β 1 in some floods e g nos 3 5 9 15 for term v and nos 1 9 13 17 20 for term vi the discrepancy of which are almost invisible in some floods because the small order of magnitude of terms see fig 10 the discrepancy is justified because the deformation area as the key factor in term vi may show considerable discrepancy in neighbouring stations which may indirectly affect term v irrespective of these minor variation term iii and term v always play the predominant role over all influencing terms regardless of the value of β 1 and β 2 for most floods finally the considerable span of the circle points is seen relative to the diamond points which concentrate near the origin this indicates the difference as the change of weighting parameter appears to be enlarged for floods before 1999 relative to that after 1999 which may be ascribed to the difference features of pdi events after the completion of xld reservoir in summary the weighting parameter has a marginal influence on the qualitative effects of terms though the values of influencing terms inevitably exhibit quantitative discrepancies with the change of weighting parameter and may lead to the reverse effects for a few influencing terms that are sensitive to the weighting parameter nevertheless their effects are substantiated comparatively weak on pdi in a quantitative sense therefore the recognition that the effects of term iii and term v prevail are invariable 4 2 sensitivity of manning roughness to estimated parameters 4 2 1 performance of sensitivity metric in this study the accuracy of the estimated discharge variation depends on the precise knowledge of parameters involved in the eqs 8 9 however it is difficult to determine the parameters with highly complex evolution during the spatial and temporal development of the fluvial process due to the fact that synchronous accurate field measurements are lacking this necessitates simplified estimations for some parameters in poorly available data occasions for example multiple distinct peak discharges may successively ensue over the whole ongoing flood season severely limiting the conduct of field surveys for individual floods this leads to the real time measurements of bed deformation during the flood season are prohibitively difficult to make therefore the bed deformation data for the multiple floods in the same year used in this study are identical similarly parameters like the gradient of river width the gradient of flow density and bed slope are also uncertain with longitudinal heterogeneity due to the absence of measurements between the adjacent stations herein the assumption of linear variation approximately for these parameters is employed to address this point to gain further insights into the potential error due to these approximation constraints on the parameters we recalculate the manning roughness after multiplying these parameters by factors of 2 and 0 5 respectively the relative deviation of roughness value i e the relative deviation r n n n n where n represents the value of manning roughness calculated by doubled parameter or halved parameter and n is the back estimated roughness value in section 3 1 makes it available for assessing the sensitivity of the approximation fig 15 shows the relative deviations of roughness for the variation of δ a s b x ρ m x and j b in fig 15 the horizontal coordinate denotes different values of weighting parameter the relative deviations of 21 floods are denoted by the scatter dots and the box represents the distribution range of 10 90 of the data from fig 15 the maximum average deviations corresponding to the variations including doubled and halved of δ a s b x ρ m x and j b are 2 3 10 8 0 14 and 43 5 in strategy 1 while that in strategy 2 are 0 4 8 3 0 12 and 40 6 respectively it is apparent that the slight deviations for the parameters δ a s b x ρ m x are generally satisfactory yet the deviation of the roughness value in line with the variation of j b appears to be unexpected with the variation of bed slope a comparatively large error tolerance is attained which even amounts to 89 and 45 in strategy 1 and strategy 2 respectively in this regard fig 16 is papered to exhibit the values of manning roughness for the variation of bed slope it is seen in fig 16 that the values of roughness are entirely within a rational range determined by the rare measured data indicating the applicability of the roughness even with varied bed slopes in general although the manning roughness is rather sensitive to the variation of bed slope the simplified assumption has only a marginal influence on the estimation 4 2 2 restriction of sensitivity verification a pivotal issue about the approach to testing sensitivity merits attention indeed flood propagation is accompanied by energy conversion from upstream to downstream during the process intimate relationships are not only developed between the hydraulic parameters but also between the upstream and downstream stations yet the treatment of exclusively changing the tested parameter to recalculate roughness value may bring uncertainty to the application in actual floods in present study such a particular case occurs in the no 8 flood with β 1 0 of strategy 1 it is apparent that the value of manning roughness can be obtained by t ρ m g a j f ρ m g a n 2 q a 2 h 4 3 one has to pre determine the value of t during the back estimation to solve for roughness however a negative resistance t is obtained by t ρ m g h 2 b x g a h h c ρ m x g c during the back estimation resulting in no solution for roughness under this circumstance this is because the parameter c is sufficiently large to lead to a negative t on the premise of other items are positive in this expression thereby a large value of e is required to figure out the sufficiently large value of c following eq 7a e 1 can be calculated by e 1 ρ m q f ρ m q m d 1 ρ m a f ρ m a m k 1 δ t from which a larger value of e 1 can be obtained by the negative k 1 or a smaller δ t accordingly the no 8 flood is featured by heavy deposition of riverbed and the short propagation time of flood peak the former leads to a large e 1 by affecting k 1 and the latter provides a small δ t both of which contribute to a negative t 4 3 evaluation of strategies present two strategies in this study have led to the recognition that the most predominant factors spurring pdi events are the pressure term due to the river width gradient term iii and the external force term term v yet quantitative differences in influencing terms are expected due to distinct approaches to applying the odes for evaluating the discharge variation following the eqs 8 9 deduced by these approaches the differences in each term arise from the different river reach adopted to solve discharge at hyk the xld hyk reach upstream of the hyk is used in strategy 1 while the upstream xld hyk and downstream hyk jht reach of the hyk both are used in strategy 2 in strategy 2 term vii is added to represent the influence of discharge change between upstream and downstream nevertheless term vii has a marginal effect on pdi in terms of its magnitude instead a more marked distinction occurs in term ii to better compare its influence the value of term ii is divided by the discharge increment as shown in fig 17 term ii mostly inhibits pdi in strategy 1 but promotes pdi in strategy 2 this is because the longitudinal variation of ρ m a increases in xld hyk reach of strategy 1 but rather decreases in xld jht reach of strategy 2 see fig 13 a3 b3 of more interest is which strategy can explain the causes of pdi precisely it requires a reliable analysis based on the field data during floods for validation not only from a qualitative perspective but also from a quantitative perspective some previous studies have provided valuable insights into the primary causes of pdi from a qualitative sense however these studies mostly focus on the predominant causes in a few specific floods it is appreciated that whether the flood peak increases or decreases is a very complicated process that depends on the interaction of multiple factors according to the analysis in this study yet the causes with a marginal influence on pdi have rarely been incorporated in the aforementioned studies in addition the quantitative analysis based upon field data is mostly hindered by the insufficient consecutive observations as such the applicability in practice of the two strategies remains to be verified however a basic consensus that should be reached is that the primary influencing factors of pdi i e term iii and term v are identical in both strategies 5 conclusions the ordinary differential equations along the characteristics are derived from the cross sectional integrated continuity and momentum equations for sediment laden flows two strategies are proposed to use the derived equations for evaluating the discharge variation from which seven factors that may affect the pdi are obtained the seven influencing factors of pdi are further quantified by applying the hydrological data of 21 floods during 1973 2012 in the lower yellow river to reveal new insights into the mechanisms for pdi the following conclusions are drawn from this study the pdi phenomenon caused by the hyperconcentrated floods appears more intense after the completion of xld reservoir with 2 4 times increment and 1 5 times frequency higher than before the pdi is a complicated process depending on the interaction of multiple factors involving the effects of the flow density change on the upstream discharge term i the longitudinal change of ρ m a due to the pressure gradient and advection term ii the pressure term due to the river width gradient term iii the pressure term due to the flow density term iv the external forces composed of gravity and resistance term v the momentum term due to bed deformation term vi and the imbalanced advection term vii the quantitative comparison of influencing factors confirms that the effects of term iii and term v prevail whereas other influencing terms are minor specifically the pdi is mostly promoted by the positive pressure term iii due to the longitudinal increasing river width while it is attenuated by the external forces term v the imbalanced advection transport term vii and the combined role of terms i and iv related to the longitudinal decreasing density yet the effects of term ii and term vi remain uncertain because the appreciable discrepancy of the performance in different floods uncertainty is inevitable due to the uniqueness of each flood and the approximation constraints for insufficient observations nevertheless the consensus of pdi can be reached in this study on the basis of the commonalities of most floods by reasonable assumption and approximation this is sensible given the fact that precise estimation of each flood is hard to carry out at present due to the lacking of available data additionally the quantification in the present study tentatively provides an approach to realizing the mechanism of pdi in a physical sense which facilitates the enhanced understanding of the reasons for pdi credit authorship contribution statement wei li conceptualization methodology investigation

2941,the past decades have witnessed frequent flood peak discharges increase in the lower yellow river lyr yet no consensus for its mechanism has been achieved here 21 events of the peak discharge increase pdi in the period of 1973 2012 are analysed it is shown that the mean increment of peak discharge increases from 810 m3 s to 1158 m3 s and the frequency also increases from once every 2 years to once every 1 5 years after the completion of xiaolangdi xld reservoir afterwards the ordinary differential equations odes along the characteristics for the discharge are derived from which seven factors terms i vii that may affect the discharge variation are identified the effects related to the longitudinal change in flow density i and in the product of flow density and flow area ii the pressure terms due to river width gradient iii and flow density iv the external forces v the momentum term due to bed deformation vi and the imbalanced advection vii using field data of the 21 events the bed manning roughness is back calculated from the ordinary discharge equation which agrees with the documented values very well quantitative comparisons of the seven factors indicate that the pressure term due to the river width gradient plays a major role in promoting the pdi in most events whereas the external forces term is the primary cause that attenuates pdi the rest influencing factors have marginal effects with a much smaller magnitude keywords river flood hyperconcentrated flow peak discharge increase lower yellow river influencing factor data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the yellow river is noted for the huge amount of sediment it carries from the loess plateau wang et al 2022 xu et al 2022 a consequence of the heavy sediment load is widespread flooding in vulnerable regions causing serious casualties in history singh et al 2021 tian et al 2019 consequently the yellow river flooding has been a major disaster to chinese people in ancient times the mainstream of the lower yellow river lyr shifted frequently due to the easily erodible river bed and banks as well as the very high sediment overloading at the time of the ming dynasty this problem was partly alleviated by the strategy of building high levees and thus clearing sediments by converging flow wang and liu 2019 nevertheless this has caused a perched river in the lower reach where an abnormal phenomenon of downstream flooding peak discharge increase pdi has been noted mostly in the reach from xiaolangdi xld to huanyuankou hyk and farther to jiahetan jht fig 1 a an illustrative example is shown in fig 1 b the flood peak discharge at hyk station is much higher than that at the xld station since the pdi phenomenon may greatly aggravate flood risks much attention has been paid to its forming mechanism li 2008 li et al 2014 2017 qi et al 2011 there have been two types of pdis depending on whether the floodplain is inundated for pdis before the completion of the xld reservoir in 1999 floods often inundate the floodplain and it has been proposed that both strong erosion and the interaction between the main channel and the floodplain may play important roles for these pdis for example wang et al 2009 inferred that the main channel erosion and floodplain deposition may transit a wide shallow channel to a narrow deep channel leading to acceleration of the flood propagation and subsequently overlap of flood waves qi and li 1996 suggested that the main channel erosion and floodplain deposition may increase the water surface gradient between the main channel and the floodplain accelerating the water flowing from the floodplain to the channel this could add to a next flood thus resulting in a pdi li et al 2017 simulated the hyperconcentrated flood hf of august 1992 in a schematized representation of the channel floodplain system in the lyr this study successfully reproduced the morphological features of channel erosion and floodplain deposition which is an important basis for those previous explanations qi and li 1996 wang et al 2009 moreover some scholars have highlighted the role of strong bed erosion during the flooding process cao et al 2012 2006 dong et al 2012 kuang et al 1999 li et al 2014 wan and wang 1994 cao et al 2006 2012 numerically investigated the 1977 hf in the xiaobeiganliu reach of the middle yellow river and the 1992 hf in the lower yellow river in a schematic channel these indicate that sufficient bed erosion can lead to considerable increase in the volume of water sediment mixture and thus a pdi event similar findings were reported by qi et al 2011 and li et al 2014 when analysing the field data of the 1977 hf based on the eigenvalues of the governing equations ding et al 2010 also suggested that considerable bed deformations may play a significant role in the propagation of shallow water waves after the xld reservoir became operational in october 1999 floods are mainly constrained within the relatively deep channel without floodplain inundation for such in channel flooding pdis the following mechanisms have been proposed first the tail of the flood can be accelerated by hyperconcentration induced drag reduction and catch up with the peak thus yielding a pdi jiang et al 2006 li et al 2014 the opinion of drag reduction is mainly motivated by experimental data between the drag coefficient and the sediment concentration einstein and chien 1955 vanoni 1946 wang et al 1998 zhu and hao 2008 relevant arguments include the hyperconcentration related turbulence damping van maren et al 2009b winterwerp 2001 2006 winterwerp et al 2009 zhang 1963 the increase of viscous sublayer thickness in hyperconcentrated circumstances gust 1976 and a reduced of form drag by lack of sand dunes qi and sun 2013 wan 1985 in contrast ma et al 2017 reported that flood conditions in the lower yellow river approach the upper plane bed regime so large scale sand dunes may not exist second the pdi is possibly caused by the instability during flood propagation zhong et al 2013 near bed flow may behave as a bingham fluid and form a stagnant layer engelund and wan 1984 wan and wang 1994 wang 2002 wang and chien 1984 below the main flow region dominated by turbulent newtonian flow if the propagating dynamic wave behaves as a reverse diffusion process the stagnant layer may become unstable and mix with the flow above thus contributing to the pdi on the other hand qi and sun 2013 argue that flood flow in the lower yellow river is fully turbulent chien 1989 chien and wan 1999 van maren et al 2009a wang 2002 and that river clogging and instability of laminar flows will rarely happen physically flood wave propagation can be described by the shallow water equations swes since the swes are hyperbolic they can be rewritten as a set of ordinary compatibility equations along the characteristics therefore ordinary differential equations odes for the discharge are derived here which facilitate an analytical investigation of the main contributors for discharge variations from the ordinary discharge equations influencing factors that may affect the discharge variation are identified and quantified using field data of 21 pdi events in the lyr the validity of these understandings is supported by the satisfactory agreements between the back calculated manning roughness and the documented roughness values section 2 reviews the 21 pdi flood events during 1973 2012 as the data preparation and the detailed derivation and application of the odes are also introduced in section 2 in section 3 the model validation and the contributions of influencing terms are analysed uncertainties for these analyses are discussed in section 4 finally we summarize conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 data preparation the pdi phenomenon usually occurs at the xld hyk jht reach in the lyr fig 1 the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc has documented hydrological data of these three stations from these data 12 pdi events are identified during 1973 1999 before the completion of the xld reservoir and 9 pdi events are identified during 1999 2012 this means approximately one pdi event occurs every two years before 1999 but every one and a half years after 1999 table 1 summarized some specific hydrographic and morphological data of the 12 9 pdi events at the three stations for the xld and hyk stations the following data are given the time for occurrence of the peak discharge date and clock the flood peak discharge q the flow area a and the river width at the water surface b the volumetric sediment concentration c corresponding to the peak discharge the change of the bed area at cross section over the flooding event δ a s for the jht station the timings for these measured data are not the time when the peak discharge arrives at jht instead the time for the measured data of jht corresponds to the time of the peak discharge at xld the propagation time of peak discharge from xld to hyk δ t i is also shown in table 1 see the last column which is calculated by 10 11 column minus 3 4 column fig 2 presents the statistics of these 21 pdi events including the discharge increase magnitude q hyk q xld from xld to hyk fig 2 a and the increasing percentage q hyk q xld q xld fig 2 b from table 1 and fig 2 the averaged peak discharge increment and increasing percentage are 810 m3 s and 17 2 before 1999 in contrast these are 1158 m3 s and 41 5 after 1999 which are much larger than those before 1999 nevertheless the averaged peak discharges before 1999 are 4713 m3 s at xld and 5523 m3 s at hyk which is much larger than those after 1999 2792 m3 s at xld and 3950 m3 s at hyk these indicate that although the flow discharge has been modulated greatly due to the xld reservoir the pdi phenomenon has become more and more serious higher frequency larger increasing increment and higher increasing percentage of discharges 2 2 derivation and application of odes this section introduces the odes derived along the characteristics and discuss their application and applicability specifically the odes are derived in section 2 2 1 in section 2 2 2 we propose two strategies applied to obtain the formulations for discharge variation and the applicability of the deduced odes for the lyr is explored in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 derivation of the odes the 1d cross sectional integrated continuity and momentum equations for sediment laden flows can be written as dou et al 2014 wu and wang 2007 1 ρ m a t ρ m

spatial gradients of the river width and flow density and 2 the longitudinal variation features of the river width and the flow density may be different along the two characteristics in the above parameters β 1 0 1 and β 2 0 1 represent the weighting parameters for the relative contribution of m in the m f reach and of n in the n f reach respectively 2 2 2 strategies for using the ode of discharge variation there can be two strategies to use eq 7 to attain the flow discharge at f the most straightforward strategy strategy 1 is only to use eq 7a from which a relation of peak discharges between m and f can be obtained in the following 8 q f q m α 1 q m part 1 α 2 ρ m a m ρ m a f part 2 α 3 δ t part 3 where α 1 ρ m m ρ m f 1 α 2 d 1 ρ m f α 3 1 ρ m f e 1 k 1 δ t from eq 8 the discharge at f is dictated by the discharge at m and three additional parts part 1 part 2 and part 3 as shown in table 2 part 1 2 involve only one influencing term respectively i e i in part 1 and ii in part 2 while part 3 can be further divided into four influencing terms iii vi by the substitution of the expressions of e 1 and k 1 all these terms have the dimension of l3 t following the expressions of the six influencing terms in table 2 see the forth column one can readily deduce their effects on pdi from a qualitative perspective which lead to fig 4 term i is the product of the coefficient α 1 and the discharge at m since the discharge at m is always positive the α 1 value determines the role of term i since α 1 ρ m m ρ m f 1 term i represents the effect of the longitudinal flow density change on the pdi considering that the flow density depends directly on sediment concentration a longitudinal decreasing sediment concentration means α 1 0 and vice versa consequently longitudinal decreasing sediment concentration would promote pdi whereas a longitudinal increasing sediment concentration would attenuate pdi term ii is the product of the coefficient α 2 and the longitudinal variation of ρ m a i e ρ m b h in the m f reach where the coefficient α 2 depends on d 1 given that the flow in yellow river is always subcritical e g gh q a it can be easily proved that d 1 is always positive consequently α 2 would be always positive therefore it is the longitudinal variation of the product ρ m a that determines the effect of term ii on the pdi it is appreciated that a longitudinal decreasing ρ m a would promote pdi and in contrast a longitudinal increasing ρ m a would attenuate pdi terms iii vi are included in part 3 reflecting the accumulated effects of four factors the cumulative effects of pressure term due to the longitudinal river width gradient and the longitudinal flow density gradient are involved in terms iii and iv respectively from the expression of term iii it is apparent that ρ m δ t g h are always positive and accordingly the effect of term iii is dictated by the critical parameter b x apparently a positive b x leads to a positive term iii and the reverse a negative value in other words an increasing river width in the streamwise direction would facilitate pdi and vice versa likewise the effect of term iv depends on the critical factor ρ m x as other parameters ρ m δ t g h h c a involved in its expression are always positive therefore a longitudinal increasing flow density would promote pdi whereas a longitudinal decreasing flow density would attenuate pdi term v is related to the cumulative effects of external force composed of gravity and resistance it is recognized that the relative strength of the two forces determines the effect of term v because other parameters ρ m δ t are positive in the expression when the gravity is greater than the resistance i e g t 0 term v would promote pdi and vice versa term vi reflects the effect of the momentum term due to the bed deformation the expression of k 1 constituting term vi predominately involves two parts i e the product of q a gh ρ s δ a s at m and f respectively and the weighting parameter β 1 determines their respective magnitudes since q a gh and ρ s are always positive the effect of term vi is dictated by the change of bed area δ a s it follows that the simultaneous bed degradation i e δ a s 0 at both the two neighbouring stations would promote pdi and vice versa obviously it is hard to determine the effect of term vi given the inconsistent bed deformation deposition or erosion at the two stations under this condition one has to take the value of β 1 and the bed deformations of two stations into account to deduce the effect of term vi the second strategy uses both eq 7a and 7b by the mathematical manipulation eq 7b d 1 eq 7a d 2 from which a relation of peak discharges among m n and f can be obtained in the following 9 q f q m α 1 q m part 1 α 2 ρ m a m ρ m a n part 2 α 3 δ t part 3 α 4 ρ m q m ρ m q n part 4 where α 1 ρ m m ρ m f 1 α 2 1 ρ m f d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 α 3 1 ρ m f e 1 d 2 e 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 k 1 d 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 1 δ t α 4 1 ρ m f d 1 d 2 d 1 from eq 9 the discharge at f depends on the discharge at m and four additional parts part 1 4 where the effects of the discharge at n are involved four influencing terms iii vi constitute part 3 while only one influencing term for the other parts i e i in part 1 ii in part 2 and vii in part 4 all terms here also have the same dimension of l3 t a total of seven influencing terms i vii defined in this strategy are shown in table 2 see the fifth column from which their qualitative performance also is illustrated in fig 4 term i obtained here is the same as that in strategy 1 associated with the longitudinal change of flow density in the m f reach as deduced above a longitudinal decreasing sediment concentration would promote pdi and the reverse would attenuate pdi term ii is the product of the coefficient α 2 and the difference of ρ m a i e ρ m b h between m and n in which the coefficient α 2 is determined by both d 1 and d 2 it can be proved that α 2 is invariably positive due to the positive value of d 1 and the negative value of d 2 given the subcritical flow e g gh q a accordingly the effect of term ii depends on the difference of ρ m a irrespective of the change of the middle reach it is appreciated that a decreasing ρ m a directed from m to n would promote pdi whereas an increasing ρ m a would inhibit pdi see fig 4 it is similar to strategy 1 terms iii vi constitute part 3 reflecting the accumulated effects related to the four key factors i e b x ρ m x g t δ a s however the qualitative performances of the four terms are not identical to that in strategy 1 because the expressions are more complicated see the fifth column in table 2 taking into account the impact of the f n reach specifically positive parameters d 1 and d 2 d 2 are introduced in terms iii vi following the expressions of terms iii v their effects are directly determined by b x ρ m x g t due to other parameters ρ m δ t g h h c a are always positive for terms iii and iv a monotonically increasing trend of the key factor in the streamwise direction would promote pdi and vice versa for term v g t 0 would promote pdi while g t 0 would inhibit pdi the effect of term vi depends on k 1 d 2 k 2 d 1 where k 1 involves the bed deformation at m and f affected by β 1 and k 2 involves the bed deformation at n and f affected by β 2 it is difficult to determine the sign of term vi due to the complicated components in the expression which prevent a qualitative understanding for term vi given β 1 β 2 the complicated expression can be simplified as the sum of three parts related to the longitudinal variation of δ a s in the m n m f and f n reach as shown in the notes of table 2 this provides an approach to clarify how the term vi is affected by bed deformation and facilitates the qualitative understanding of term vi accordingly the longitudinal variation of δ a s is used to predict the effect of term vi i e a monotonically increasing δ a s would promote pdi whereas a monotonically decreasing δ a s would attenuate pdi it is different from strategy 1 in which the δ a s at m and f i e erosion or deposition are directly used to predict the effect of term vi it is also noted that the effects of terms iii vi are difficult to be determined qualitatively in the case of non monotonic variation along the m f n reach alternatively their impacts may depend on the dominant reach apart from the above influencing terms an additional term vii in part 4 representing the influence of imbalanced advection transport between upstream and downstream is also considered term vii is the product of a coefficient α 4 and the difference of ρ m q i e ρ m b h u between m and n the α 4 is invariably negative with a positive d 1 and a negative d 2 and thus term vii is determined by the difference of ρ m q accordingly an increasing ρ m q would promote pdi whereas a decreasing ρ m q would attenuate pdi 2 2 3 correspondence between m f n and xld hyk jht before applying the discharge equation either strategy 1 or strategy 2 one should check whether the three stations xld hyk and jht can have a similar relation as m f n shown in fig 3 under the assumption that the correspondence between xld hyk jht and m f n is established the following relations are required 10a x 1 x 0 t 1 t 0 β 1 q a gh xld 1 β 1 q a gh hyk 10b x 1 x 2 t 1 t 0 β 2 q a gh jht 1 β 2 q a gh hyk for eq 10 we can take x 1 x 0 i e l mf in fig 3 as an unknown which can be back estimated from other parameters using measured data at the three stations the discrepancy between the calculated l mf and the actual distance from xld to hyk i e l xh 132 km would indicate whether the three stations have a similar relation as m f n however flood wave propagation in the lyr is very complex from inside the channel to overflowing on the floodplain from relatively narrow deep to wide shallow channel it is therefore inaccurate to directly adopt the characteristic celerity for estimation as a compromise the characteristic celerity along the s characteristics the right hand side of eq 10a is replaced by the following estimation l xh δ t i where δ t i is the actual time interval for peak discharge propagation from xld to hyk see the last column in table 1 in addition it is necessary to specify the β 2 value for calculating l mf here we tentatively take three values 1 0 5 0 as examples fig 5 a shows the range of calculated l mf with different β 2 on average the calculated value of l mf is 108 km 106 km and 109 km against the β 2 value of 1 0 5 and 0 respectively fig 5 b shows the relative deviation of the calculated distance l mf from the actual distance between xld and hyk l xh which is defined as r x l mf l xh l xh from fig 5 b there are approximately two thirds of floods with r x 30 the area highlighted by blue shading indeed inevitable discrepancies arise in the above calculation this is because a more accurate result requires a very small distance between m and n in fig 3 based on the assumption that the disturbance propagates at a constant celerity however the hydrological survey is carried out only at the three adjacent stations xld hyk and jht along the river there are no other stations in between and the next station is gaocun which is 70 km downstream of jht station accordingly in the absence of more available data for the lyr it is advisable to assume m f and n as xld hyk and jht stations respectively 3 results 3 1 validation of the back estimated roughness prior to proceeding to estimate the following parameters are specified as ρ w 1000 kg m3 ρ s 2650 kg m3 p 0 45 by referring to the yellow river background parameters from the decomposition of each term in eqs 8 9 can be categorized into four types i e type 1 4 values of parameters in type 1 have been documented e g q a or can be readily computed e g h h c ρ m ρ s δ t δ t i and δ a s the difference in the cross sectional area of the bed above a reference datum before and after the flood season see table 1 from the documented data in table 1 i e q a b c and the parameters that have been specified above i e ρ w ρ s p values of parameters in type 2 e g b x ρ m x j b can be computed from type 1 parameters using linear assumption among type 2 parameters b x and ρ m x are concerned about the spatial gradients of the river width and the flow density and the values of which in the xld hyk and hyk jht reach are used at xld and jht respectively while b x and ρ m x at hyk depend on which one of the characteristics follows along i e the xld hyk reach is used at hyk for the s characteristics whereas the hyk jht reach for the s characteristics see fig 6 fig 7 shows the values of j b which are estimated by the longitudinal gradient of the bed elevation of the thalweg it exhibits the appreciable difference between the upstream xld hyk reach and the downstream hyk jht reach of the hyk station that is the upstream reach black line is steeper than the downstream reach red line in most floods to accurately describe this feature the bed slopes of the xld hyk reach and the hyk jht reach are adopted at xld and jht respectively in particular the bed elevation gradient in the xld jht reach is used at the hyk station it is noted that the filed data of bed elevation at the xld station before 2006 are missing and thus the data at the closest tiexie station is used as a replacement values of parameters in type 3 i e β 1 β 2 must be specified manually and three values 1 0 5 0 are tentatively used here in addition for the values of manning roughness i e n in type 4 there is no systematically documented data but a rough range of which can be given from rare measured data therefore it is proposed here to back calculate the manning roughness from parameters of types 1 3 afterwards the back calculated bed roughness is compared to the documented range of which the discrepancy is adopted as an indicator for the reasonableness of the present method of particular note is that the bed material and bedform also considerably affect the roughness value for instance bed incisions accompanied by sediment coarsening after damming and the change of bed topography facilitate the development of large dunes which contribute to the increase of flow resistance ma et al 2022 all these impacts are incorporated into the back calculated roughness value in the present study fig 8 shows the back calculated manning roughness in strategy 1 and strategy 2 where three scenarios are conducted in both strategies specifically β 1 1 0 5 and 0 are used in strategy 1 for convenience in analysis assuming β 1 β 2 in strategy 2 and also three values 1 0 5 0 are used in strategy 1 the roughness varies in 0 007 0 036 0 008 0 031 and 0 006 0 04 with the average roughness of 0 019 0 015 and 0 013 corresponding to β 1 1 0 5 and 0 respectively in strategy 2 the average manning roughness are 0 016 0 014 and 0 014 whose variation ranges are 0 009 0 03 0 008 0 03 and 0 009 0 039 corresponding to β 1 β 2 1 0 5 and 0 respectively it is appreciated that a larger roughness value is observed in no 2 3 4 18 floods this is because of the relatively larger water depth or flow area in these floods which leads to a larger c 1 in no 2 3 4 floods when weighting parameters β 1 β 2 take 1 or a larger g in no 18 flood when weighting parameters β 1 β 2 take 0 or 0 5 these differences contribute to a large magnitude of parameter t t c 1 c 2 g c and therefore obtain a comparatively large roughness value t ρ m g a j f j f n 2 q a 2 h 4 3 numerical uncertainties are inevitable due to simplified assumptions of complex parameters during calculation e g linear assumptions for parameters in type 2 although the roughness values in these floods exhibit deviations from most floods they are appreciable only in specific weighting parameters nevertheless all the back calculated roughness values are almost entirely within the rough range of previously documented results by the yrcc 0 004 0 058 the reasonably good agreement between the back calculated roughness and the documented data proves the applicability of the ordinary equations for describing the downstream variation of peak discharge 3 2 performance of influencing terms in this section both the qualitative analysis of influencing terms and the quantitative results of 21 actual floods are employed to reveal insights into the physical mechanism of pdi specifically fig 9 shows the actually longitudinal change of some key factors ρ m b h δ a s q from the observed data which is prepared to figure out the qualitative performances of influencing terms in 21 floods the longitudinal variation of field data involves six trends given the monotonicity of the longitudinal trend and the relative magnitude of xld and jht both monotonic trend and non monotonic trend are observed for the longitudinal change of flow density river width water depth and bed deformation at the xld hyk jht reach relative to the non monotonic variation of flow discharge that always increases in the xld hyk reach and decreases in the hyk jht reach for strategy 1 it is available to obtain the qualitative performances of terms i iii iv by corresponding the actual trends of the flow density river width in the xld hyk reach to the theoretical analysis in fig 4 similarly the qualitative performances of terms i iii iv vi in strategy 2 can be determined by the consistency between the monotonic trends of flow density river width bed deformation at the xld hyk jht reach and that in fig 4 however the qualitative effects of terms ii vii is extremely hard to predict directly because the synchronous consideration of multiple factors is necessitated ρ m b h are involved in term ii and ρ m q are involved in term vii apart from this the qualitative performances of the influencing terms dictated by a non monotonic variation in strategy 2 are also unpredictable the quantification appears to be an imminent step towards revealing enhanced understanding of pdi in recognition the fact that the uncertainty of the effects for influencing terms may remain if only analyse from a qualitative perspective hence the seven influencing terms are further quantified by documented data to better compare their influence each term is divided by the discharge increment and the results are shown in fig 10 strategy 1 and fig 11 strategy 2 from figs 10 11 three types of factors that affect pdi are identified as promoting factors inhibiting factors and uncertain factors which are discussed in detail below for convenience results relating to β 1 β 2 1 is used for discussion whereas the influence of β 1 β 2 is discussed in section 4 3 2 1 promoting factors 3 2 1 1 pressure term due to the river width gradient term iii is the pressure term due to the gradient of river width which is always positive in fig 10 from a qualitative sense the effect of term iii in strategy 1 depends on the longitudinal variation of river width in the xld hyk reach it is recognized that a longitudinal increasing river width would promote pdi see fig 4 not surprisingly appreciable increases of the river width from xld to hyk station are observed in all the 21 floods see fig 9 confirming the promoting effect of term iii also in fig 10 the much greater magnitude of term iii further illustrates the dominant role of term iii in promoting pdi from a quantitative sense in strategy 2 term iii is closely related with the longitudinal variation of river width in the xld hyk jht reach qualitatively term iii would promote pdi when the river width monotonically increases in the streamwise direction and vice versa see fig 4 yet as shown in fig 9 the river width monotonically increases only in 4 floods nos 6 9 14 19 while it always increases along xld hyk reach but decreases along hyk jht reach in the rest floods interestingly it is seen in fig 11 that term iii is invariably positive in 21 floods it is apparent that the promoting effect due to a positive term iii still prevails in each flood this indicates the increasing river width in the xld hyk reach appears to be more dominant for these non monotonic circumstances from a quantitative sense term iii is still prevailing with a relatively appreciable magnitude which is the largest in 9 floods nos 7 10 14 18 20 and the second largest in 11 floods nos 1 6 9 15 17 21 3 2 2 inhibiting factors 3 2 2 1 external force term term v is the external force term that comprises gravity and resistance whose effects is determined by the relative strength of gravity and resistance it is seen in fig 10 and fig 11 that term v is negative in nearly 20 floods except no 15 in both strategies indicating that the resistance prevails and it is greater than gravity in most floods accordingly the greater magnitude of negative term v is evoked by the prevailing of the resistance in strategy 1 term v is a secondary influencing factor relative to term iii for most floods from a quantitative sense except nos 2 10 15 while in strategy 2 term v is the most dominant in 12 floods nos 1 6 8 9 15 17 21 and it is subdominant for other 9 floods these all demonstrate the external force term plays the paramount role in attenuating the pdi 3 2 2 2 longitudinal decreasing flow density the influence of longitudinal flow density change is incorporated both in term i and term iv the former reflects the effect of density variation on upstream flow discharge and the latter is the pressure term due to the longitudinal density gradient a unique feature is obvious according to the qualitative analysis of strategy 1 see fig 4 that is as the flow density decreases longitudinally in the m f reach term i promotes pdi but term iv attenuates pdi and vice versa it is seen from fig 9 that the flow density decreases in the xld hyk reach in 19 floods except nos 1 2 floods consequently one can readily infer that term i promotes pdi and term iv attenuates pdi is prevalent yet the magnitudes of terms i and iv are mostly far smaller than other terms so that they are hardly found to be visible in fig 10 thus fig 12 is given to exhibit the term iv against term i where the horizontal coordinate represents term i and the vertical coordinate represents term iv it is clearly seen in fig 12 a that the data points are mostly distributed in the fourth quadrant this quantitative performance further underpins the inference from the above qualitative analysis i e term i predominantly promotes pdi while term iv shows the completely reverse effect term i in strategy 2 is the same as that in strategy 1 while an essential difference has to be noted in term iv is that its effect depends on the density change in the xld hyk jht reach it is obvious that the attenuation of pdi due to term iv would be achieved given the flow density decreases monotonically in the xld hyk jht reach from fig 9 it is seen that the density decreases monotonically in most floods nos 3 10 12 13 15 21 consequently one can readily deduce the reverse effects of term i in relation to term iv are evident in these floods i e term i plays a facilitating role in pdi while term iv plays an inhibitory role see fig 12 b yet also a few floods with non monotonic changes of flow density are documented in fig 9 specifically the flow density decreases in the xld hyk reach but increases in the hyk jht reach for nos 11 14 floods which is in contrast to nos 1 2 floods it is hard to infer the effect of term iv for these floods with complex variation of the longitudinal density from a qualitative sense by referring to the quantitative results it is found that term iv promotes pdi in no 1 flood and it attenuates pdi in nos 2 11 14 floods it is also noted that both term i and term iv play a role in promoting pdi in the no 2 flood this indicates the effects of term i and term iv may not be rigorously opposite under the condition of a non monotonic variation of flow density furthermore a significant feature deserves particular attention that is although term i is positive in most floods e g nos 2 21 flood its magnitude is generally lower than term iv see fig 12 from the quantitative results considering the combined role of term i and term iv an inhibiting effect on pdi due to the longitudinal density variation prevails in most floods except nos 1 2 8 flood in strategy 1 and nos 1 8 14 in strategy 2 consequently the longitudinal change of flow density mostly plays a role in inhibiting pdi however this effect is marginal with a sufficiently small magnitude 3 2 2 3 imbalanced advection transport term vii is an additional term due to the lower hyk jht reach is considered in strategy 2 it represents the effect of imbalanced advection transport which is dependent on the difference of ρ m q between xld and jht according to the qualitative analysis an increasing ρ m q directed from xld to jht would promote pdi and vice versa the documented observation provides the respective features of the flow density and the flow discharge which are the decomposition of ρ m q see fig 9 specifically the flow density and the flow discharge of xld station are mostly greater than that of jht station except no 14 flood with a greater density and nos 2 19 20 floods with a greater discharge at jht station consequently the product of the density and the discharge of xld station is mostly greater than that of jht station except in no 19 flood this results in a negative term vii to attenuate pdi for most floods also term vii has only a marginal influence on pdi because its magnitude is comparatively small 3 2 3 uncertain factors 3 2 3 1 longitudinal change of ρ m a due to the pressure gradient and advection the effect of term ii depends on the longitudinal variation of ρ m a i e ρ m b h it is recognized that a longitudinal decreasing ρ m b h would promote pdi and vice versa obviously the variations of the physical quantities e g ρ m b h may affect the value of the product ρ m b h according to the field data see fig 9 the river width increases in all floods while the flow density except nos 1 2 and the water depth except nos 14 15 18 19 mostly decreases along the xld hyk reach to clarify how the term ii is affected by these physical quantities ρ m b h further calculations of the spatial gradients of ρ m b bh and ρ m b h are conducted as shown in fig 13 the values of these gradients measure the longitudinal variations of ρ m b bh and ρ m b h in which a positive value means increasing longitudinally and the reverse means decreasing longitudinally fig 13 a shows the gradients for the xld hyk reach corresponding to strategy 1 it is seen that ρ m b bh and ρ m b h are longitudinally increases in most floods the longitudinal increasing river width appears to be dominant in the variations of ρ m b and bh due to the density and water depth are generally decrease it is also noted that the longitudinal variation of ρ m b h is basically in accordance with that of bh i e flow area as a result the negative term ii always attenuate pdi except no 12 in strategy 2 the effect of term ii is dependent on the longitudinal variation of ρ m b h between xld and jht according to the field data see fig 9 the river width increases except nos 8 15 while and the flow density except no 14 and the water depth mostly decreases between xld and jht station fig 13 b shows the variations of ρ m b bh and ρ m b h between xld and jht station it is found that the ρ m b also increases in most floods which is primarily ascribed to the increasing river width however it is hard to find out the predominant physical quantity that affects the longitudinal variation of bh because of its uncertain performance which increases in some floods nos 2 3 6 9 11 19 21 and decreases in other floods nevertheless the longitudinal variation of ρ m b h is also consistent with that of bh in most of floods except no 2 this means the effect of term ii is indeed sophisticated it plays a dual role in pdi i e promoting or attenuating pdi in different floods 3 2 3 2 momentum term due to bed deformation term vi reflects the effect of momentum term caused by bed deformation which is determined by not only the local bed deformation of the neighbouring stations but also the value of weighting factor under the assumption of β 1 1 herein term vi would promote pdi with the erosion of xld in strategy 1 from table 1 it is seen that the river bed is eroded i e δ a s 0 at xld station in more than a half of floods nos 1 9 16 19 21 not surprisingly the promoting effect of term vi in these floods nos 1 9 16 19 21 is expected according to the quantitative results in strategy 2 term vi is closely related to the longitudinal variation of δ a s from fig 9 the δ a s varies monotonically only in a few floods e g nos 3 4 16 21 flood with a longitudinal increasing δ a s and nos 15 18 19 flood with a longitudinal decreasing δ a s correspondingly it is certain that term vi promotes pdi in nos 3 4 16 21 flood while it attenuates pdi in nos 15 18 19 flood see fig 11 there are some floods in which the δ a s varies non monotonically see fig 9 it is found that term vi promotes pdi in nos 1 2 5 9 17 flood in which the δ a s increases along the xld hyk reach and decreases along the hyk jht reach in contrast term vi attenuates pdi in nos 10 14 20 flood in which the δ a s decreases along the xld hyk reach and increases along the hyk jht reach there is in fact reasonably good agreement between the quantitative performance of term vi and its qualitative analysis exclusively based on the xld hyk reach this also suggests that the flow discharge increases at hyk station seem to be more sensitive to the bed deformation upstream of hyk station 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the weighting parameters β 1 and β 2 from eqs 6 7 the weighting parameters β 1 and β 2 determines the relative contribution of two neighbouring stations β 1 for m and f β 2 for n and f on estimation of these seven factors in section 3 2 results are obtained by setting β 1 β 2 1 here their effects are discussed by setting their values to 0 and 0 5 fig 14 presents the effects of weighting parameters on estimation of influencing terms firstly it is seen that the responses of influencing terms to the increasing weighting parameter involve two tendencies i e increasing either positively or negatively of the influencing terms in magnitude a larger value of weighting parameter seems to mainly lead to a positive increasing trend for term iii relative to a negative increasing trend for term v and term vii yet uncertainties in changes of terms ii iv vi remain as the weighting parameter increases secondly variations of weighting parameters are inevitably affect the value of influencing terms in a quantitative sense yet the general impacts on pdi hold qualitatively for most terms as presented above in figs 10 11 nevertheless it is noted that there are still a few terms whose effects on pdi are rather sensitive to the change of weighting parameter the most telling case is terms v and vi in strategy 1 the effects of which involve apparent inconsistency as the change of β 1 in some floods e g nos 3 5 9 15 for term v and nos 1 9 13 17 20 for term vi the discrepancy of which are almost invisible in some floods because the small order of magnitude of terms see fig 10 the discrepancy is justified because the deformation area as the key factor in term vi may show considerable discrepancy in neighbouring stations which may indirectly affect term v irrespective of these minor variation term iii and term v always play the predominant role over all influencing terms regardless of the value of β 1 and β 2 for most floods finally the considerable span of the circle points is seen relative to the diamond points which concentrate near the origin this indicates the difference as the change of weighting parameter appears to be enlarged for floods before 1999 relative to that after 1999 which may be ascribed to the difference features of pdi events after the completion of xld reservoir in summary the weighting parameter has a marginal influence on the qualitative effects of terms though the values of influencing terms inevitably exhibit quantitative discrepancies with the change of weighting parameter and may lead to the reverse effects for a few influencing terms that are sensitive to the weighting parameter nevertheless their effects are substantiated comparatively weak on pdi in a quantitative sense therefore the recognition that the effects of term iii and term v prevail are invariable 4 2 sensitivity of manning roughness to estimated parameters 4 2 1 performance of sensitivity metric in this study the accuracy of the estimated discharge variation depends on the precise knowledge of parameters involved in the eqs 8 9 however it is difficult to determine the parameters with highly complex evolution during the spatial and temporal development of the fluvial process due to the fact that synchronous accurate field measurements are lacking this necessitates simplified estimations for some parameters in poorly available data occasions for example multiple distinct peak discharges may successively ensue over the whole ongoing flood season severely limiting the conduct of field surveys for individual floods this leads to the real time measurements of bed deformation during the flood season are prohibitively difficult to make therefore the bed deformation data for the multiple floods in the same year used in this study are identical similarly parameters like the gradient of river width the gradient of flow density and bed slope are also uncertain with longitudinal heterogeneity due to the absence of measurements between the adjacent stations herein the assumption of linear variation approximately for these parameters is employed to address this point to gain further insights into the potential error due to these approximation constraints on the parameters we recalculate the manning roughness after multiplying these parameters by factors of 2 and 0 5 respectively the relative deviation of roughness value i e the relative deviation r n n n n where n represents the value of manning roughness calculated by doubled parameter or halved parameter and n is the back estimated roughness value in section 3 1 makes it available for assessing the sensitivity of the approximation fig 15 shows the relative deviations of roughness for the variation of δ a s b x ρ m x and j b in fig 15 the horizontal coordinate denotes different values of weighting parameter the relative deviations of 21 floods are denoted by the scatter dots and the box represents the distribution range of 10 90 of the data from fig 15 the maximum average deviations corresponding to the variations including doubled and halved of δ a s b x ρ m x and j b are 2 3 10 8 0 14 and 43 5 in strategy 1 while that in strategy 2 are 0 4 8 3 0 12 and 40 6 respectively it is apparent that the slight deviations for the parameters δ a s b x ρ m x are generally satisfactory yet the deviation of the roughness value in line with the variation of j b appears to be unexpected with the variation of bed slope a comparatively large error tolerance is attained which even amounts to 89 and 45 in strategy 1 and strategy 2 respectively in this regard fig 16 is papered to exhibit the values of manning roughness for the variation of bed slope it is seen in fig 16 that the values of roughness are entirely within a rational range determined by the rare measured data indicating the applicability of the roughness even with varied bed slopes in general although the manning roughness is rather sensitive to the variation of bed slope the simplified assumption has only a marginal influence on the estimation 4 2 2 restriction of sensitivity verification a pivotal issue about the approach to testing sensitivity merits attention indeed flood propagation is accompanied by energy conversion from upstream to downstream during the process intimate relationships are not only developed between the hydraulic parameters but also between the upstream and downstream stations yet the treatment of exclusively changing the tested parameter to recalculate roughness value may bring uncertainty to the application in actual floods in present study such a particular case occurs in the no 8 flood with β 1 0 of strategy 1 it is apparent that the value of manning roughness can be obtained by t ρ m g a j f ρ m g a n 2 q a 2 h 4 3 one has to pre determine the value of t during the back estimation to solve for roughness however a negative resistance t is obtained by t ρ m g h 2 b x g a h h c ρ m x g c during the back estimation resulting in no solution for roughness under this circumstance this is because the parameter c is sufficiently large to lead to a negative t on the premise of other items are positive in this expression thereby a large value of e is required to figure out the sufficiently large value of c following eq 7a e 1 can be calculated by e 1 ρ m q f ρ m q m d 1 ρ m a f ρ m a m k 1 δ t from which a larger value of e 1 can be obtained by the negative k 1 or a smaller δ t accordingly the no 8 flood is featured by heavy deposition of riverbed and the short propagation time of flood peak the former leads to a large e 1 by affecting k 1 and the latter provides a small δ t both of which contribute to a negative t 4 3 evaluation of strategies present two strategies in this study have led to the recognition that the most predominant factors spurring pdi events are the pressure term due to the river width gradient term iii and the external force term term v yet quantitative differences in influencing terms are expected due to distinct approaches to applying the odes for evaluating the discharge variation following the eqs 8 9 deduced by these approaches the differences in each term arise from the different river reach adopted to solve discharge at hyk the xld hyk reach upstream of the hyk is used in strategy 1 while the upstream xld hyk and downstream hyk jht reach of the hyk both are used in strategy 2 in strategy 2 term vii is added to represent the influence of discharge change between upstream and downstream nevertheless term vii has a marginal effect on pdi in terms of its magnitude instead a more marked distinction occurs in term ii to better compare its influence the value of term ii is divided by the discharge increment as shown in fig 17 term ii mostly inhibits pdi in strategy 1 but promotes pdi in strategy 2 this is because the longitudinal variation of ρ m a increases in xld hyk reach of strategy 1 but rather decreases in xld jht reach of strategy 2 see fig 13 a3 b3 of more interest is which strategy can explain the causes of pdi precisely it requires a reliable analysis based on the field data during floods for validation not only from a qualitative perspective but also from a quantitative perspective some previous studies have provided valuable insights into the primary causes of pdi from a qualitative sense however these studies mostly focus on the predominant causes in a few specific floods it is appreciated that whether the flood peak increases or decreases is a very complicated process that depends on the interaction of multiple factors according to the analysis in this study yet the causes with a marginal influence on pdi have rarely been incorporated in the aforementioned studies in addition the quantitative analysis based upon field data is mostly hindered by the insufficient consecutive observations as such the applicability in practice of the two strategies remains to be verified however a basic consensus that should be reached is that the primary influencing factors of pdi i e term iii and term v are identical in both strategies 5 conclusions the ordinary differential equations along the characteristics are derived from the cross sectional integrated continuity and momentum equations for sediment laden flows two strategies are proposed to use the derived equations for evaluating the discharge variation from which seven factors that may affect the pdi are obtained the seven influencing factors of pdi are further quantified by applying the hydrological data of 21 floods during 1973 2012 in the lower yellow river to reveal new insights into the mechanisms for pdi the following conclusions are drawn from this study the pdi phenomenon caused by the hyperconcentrated floods appears more intense after the completion of xld reservoir with 2 4 times increment and 1 5 times frequency higher than before the pdi is a complicated process depending on the interaction of multiple factors involving the effects of the flow density change on the upstream discharge term i the longitudinal change of ρ m a due to the pressure gradient and advection term ii the pressure term due to the river width gradient term iii the pressure term due to the flow density term iv the external forces composed of gravity and resistance term v the momentum term due to bed deformation term vi and the imbalanced advection term vii the quantitative comparison of influencing factors confirms that the effects of term iii and term v prevail whereas other influencing terms are minor specifically the pdi is mostly promoted by the positive pressure term iii due to the longitudinal increasing river width while it is attenuated by the external forces term v the imbalanced advection transport term vii and the combined role of terms i and iv related to the longitudinal decreasing density yet the effects of term ii and term vi remain uncertain because the appreciable discrepancy of the performance in different floods uncertainty is inevitable due to the uniqueness of each flood and the approximation constraints for insufficient observations nevertheless the consensus of pdi can be reached in this study on the basis of the commonalities of most floods by reasonable assumption and approximation this is sensible given the fact that precise estimation of each flood is hard to carry out at present due to the lacking of available data additionally the quantification in the present study tentatively provides an approach to realizing the mechanism of pdi in a physical sense which facilitates the enhanced understanding of the reasons for pdi credit authorship contribution statement wei li conceptualization methodology investigation

2942,the spatial distribution of rainfall in a watershed has an important impact on flood warning and forecasting in this study we used the k means clustering method to classify the spatial characteristics of typhoon rainfall events in the songtao reservoir watershed in the central region of hainan island based on 63 typhoon rainfall event data from 1990 to 2020 then the relationship between the synoptic fields spatial patterns of rainfall and flood characteristics was explained based on tropical cyclone best track datasets atmospheric reanalysis data and inflow flood series the results showed that there are three types of cumulative rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed the heavy rainfall region of pattern 1 is concentrated east of the watershed whereas the heavy rainfall regions of pattern 2 are mainly concentrated southwest and east of the watersheds of many mountains the heavy rainfall region of pattern 3 with a southwest northeast orientation is located on the west side of the watershed the spatial coefficient of variation and index of rainfall location clearly distinguished among these three patterns the composite analysis of typhoon tracks wind fields and moisture flux fields can be used to interpret the formation mechanism of these spatial patterns of rainfall events in the watershed the spatial patterns of cumulative rainfall for each type were dominated by one or two types of hourly spatial rainfall patterns flood events resulting from cumulative rainfall patterns 1 and 2 have similar flood behavior metrics large floods in the watershed show an obvious seasonal variation and the corresponding rainfall events mostly show the spatial characteristics of the cumulative rainfall pattern 3 these results can enhance the understanding of the linkage between typhoons mountainous watershed rainfall and flooding processes keywords k means clustering method mountainous watershed typhoon rainfall flood characteristics data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as one of the most serious natural disasters on earth typhoons have two sides emanuel 2005 on the one hand typhoons can alleviate drought with corresponding rainfall prat and nelson 2013 kam et al 2013 on the other hand typhoons always bring great damage due to strong winds and heavy rainfall properties zhang et al 2009 rappaport 2014 the rainstorms caused by typhoons could lead to flash floods overflowing rivers and collapsing reservoirs chen et al 2013 as global warming becomes more and more intense in recent years some studies have shown that both the intensity and track of typhoons may change therefore researches related to typhoon rainfall have attracted large attention knutson et al 2020 murakami et al 2020 related studies have shown that the rainstorms caused by typhoons will increase because of the uplifting effect of island topography yu and cheng 2008 yu and cheng 2013 moreover the rainfall will become complex and variable due to the disturbance effect of island topography on typhoon airflow xie and zhang 2012 hence studies of typhoon island interaction have been paid more and more attention in recent years de bruijn and brandsma 2000 smith et al 2009 nugent and rios berrios 2018 many studies involve the rainstorm flood response of mountainous watersheds during typhoon island interactions abon et al 2011 analyzed the flood response of the marikina river watershed in the philippines during tropical storm ketsana and found that the time lag between peak rainfall and peak discharge varied with flow distance from the watershed smith et al 2005 pointed out that there were significant east west differences in the rainfall distribution in puerto rico caused by hurricane georges in which the orographic precipitation mechanisms play a key role they further analyzed the rainfall and discharge in 10 mountainous watersheds and finally showed the importance of short term rainfall rates for extreme flood response ogden 2016 explored the flood response of 16 small mountainous watersheds less than35 km2 in the island of dominica during tropical storm erika based on radar data and indirect peak discharge measurements and found that rainfall rates were the main determinant of peak discharge li et al 2005 investigated the flood responses of three typhoons in the shihman reservoir watershed of taiwan island based on rainfall station data mesoscale modeled rainfall and a distributed hydrological model the results show that the typhoon flood response is rapid and peak discharge is high in this mountainous watershed which infers that the small differences in peak rainfall and phase lag may lead to a significant amplification of flood response huang et al 2011 analysed eight typhoon cases in a mountainous watershed 355 km2 in taiwan and found that the typhoon induced rainfall in this watershed was less variable in space and more concentrated on the time scale making high spatial resolution of rainfall inputs unnecessary for predicting peak discharge timing in mesoscale watersheds trošelj and lee 2021 simulated the flood response of nine mountainous watersheds in the northeastern part of the japanese during three passing by typhoons hagibis roke and chataan and found that similar typhoon tracks are more important than rainfall intensity and central pressure for flood simulation in these mountainous watersheds with the development of observation technology a growing number of watersheds have high quality and long persistence of rainfall data the clustering method can realize feature extraction of massive data lin et al 2017 huang et al 2012 classified the spatial distribution of hourly rainfall into three major types over a subtropical mesoscale mountainous watershed using the kappa method and k means cluster analysis based on spatially high resolution radar derived rainfall estimates by analyzing the frequency of each rainfall type under different typhoon tracks they found that different typhoon tracks tended to have preferable rainfall types liu et al 2020 established three different temporal spatial distribution patterns using the dynamic cluster method in conjunction with a locally linear embedding algorithm based on 178 short duration less than 3h rainstorm samples from 63 automatic meteorological stations the results show the characteristics of the rainfall band movement and the variation of the rainfall spatial distribution in different patterns they inferred that the three patterns are caused by different weather systems indicating that the clustering results have physical significance however this study did not establish a clear link between the weather system and the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of rainfall previous studies have shown that the characteristics of the spatial distribution movement and intensity of rainstorms in mountainous watersheds are complex and variable caused by the interaction between different weather systems and topography smith et al 1997 buytaert et al 2006 in mountainous watersheds with high topographical complexity the triggering of topography induced disturbances and the collocation of meso and local scale flows result in significant variability in the spatial distribution of rainfall zou et al 2013 yu and cheng 2013 zhu et al 2021 bai et al 2020 the topography does not change with time while typhoons usually move along some certain paths it is assumed that the spatial distribution of mountainous watershed rainfall could be bounded within several specific patterns hainan island is a tropical island located in the northwestern south china sea which is characterized by plains in the northeast and mountains in the southwest hainan island is affected by monsoons tropical cyclones low pressure troughs fronts and jets and the interaction between these weather systems and topography leads to rainstorms huang et al 2021 among the rainstorms caused by these different weather systems typhoon rainfall is the most common in the watersheds of hainan island wu et al 2007 feng et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 in this study we revealed the spatial distribution pattern of typhoon rainfall events in the central mountainous watershed of hainan island using the k means clustering method based on rain gauge data meanwhile we explored the characterization of each pattern by existing common rainfall inhomogeneity indexes and briefly analyzed the formation mechanism of each pattern by using the tropical cyclone best track dataset and atmospheric reanalysis then the spatial pattern of typhoon rainfall events and the spatial pattern of hourly typhoon rainfall in the watershed were used to investigate the temporal and spatial variation in rainfall during typhoon events finally we explored the flood causing pattern of typhoon rainfall in the watershed and its relationship with flood characteristics 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the songtao reservoir watershed is located upstream of the nandu river in the hainan province with a drainage area of 1 496 km2 and a river length of 137 km the songtao reservoir watershed is a low medium mountainous area with elevations mostly above 500 m the yajiada and limu mountains are located to the west and east of the watershed respectively the wuzhishan mountains the highest point on the island with a height of 1 867 m are located to the southeast of the watershed overall the elevation is higher southwest and lower northeast of the watershed woodland areas such as virgin and commercial forests account for over 70 of the watershed area the songtao reservoir in the watershed is the largest water conservancy project on nandu river and plays an important role in flood regulation upstream of nandu river rainfall in the songtao reservoir watershed located in a tropical climate zone is abundant the mean annual rainfall from 1965 to 2015 was 1 925 mm with the rainfall amount during the wet season may to november accounting for 88 of the annual rainfall affected by the rammasun typhoon in 2014 a catastrophic flood exceeding the historical record occurred at the fucai hydrological station in the watershed with a peak stage of 7 48 m above the warning water level the flood caused six villages in baisha county in the watershed to be flooded 2 059 people to be trapped and 3 624 acres of crops to be ruined additionally the total direct economic loss of the county reached 633 million rmb under the influence of global warming typhoon intensity in the south china sea has intensified mei and xie 2016 ying et al 2012 the cumulative amount of extreme rainfall events induced by typhoons has increased significantly in hainan wu et al 2007 thus it is meaningful to study the rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed on hainan island 2 2 data the data used in this study include 1 hourly rainfall data and inflow flood tables from may to november during the 1990 2020 period were acquired from the hainan hydrology and water resources survey bureau which strictly controls the data quality before releasing them no missing or outlier data were found in the dataset specifically the inflow flood tables recorded flood events including the beginning and ending times of flood events duration of events and discharge every two hours the accuracy of the rain gauges used in this study is 0 5 mm the locations of the stations are shown in fig 1 2 the tropical cyclone tc best track datasets for the western north pacific were provided by the china meteorological administration https tcdata typhoon org cn this dataset contains the center locations and intensities of tcs at 6 h intervals from 1949 to 2020 ying et al 2014 lu et al 2021 3 the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis era5 hourly data were utilized with an horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 starting from 1979 https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset reanalysis era5 pressure levels circulation conditions at 850 hpa can more clearly display specific weather processes in addition the selection of the synoptic field layer needs to be considered with local elevation tai et al 2020 therefore the u component of wind v component of wind and specific humidity at 850 hpa were used in this study typhoons entering the impact area 15 23 n 106 114 e may have caused rainfall in the songtao reservoir watershed based on the inflow flood tables and typhoons that may affect rainfall in the watershed we selected 63 flood events caused by typhoons in the songtao reservoir watershed and further obtained typhoon rainfall events corresponding to the flood events specifically the beginning times of rainfall events are defined as 1 h rainfall exceeding a 0 5 mm occurrence at any station within the studied watershed rainfall was recorded continuously until no rainfall occurred at any station in the studied watershed finally 63 typhoon rainfall events were extracted for detailed study there were 28 typhoon events in summer june to august and 35 typhoon events in autumn september to november 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 cluster analysis of rainfall spatial patterns the k means clustering algorithm is a classic unsupervised learning algorithm that is widely used owing to its speed and simplicity in classification hartigan and wong 1979 kapoor and singhal 2017 the steps of the algorithm are as follows ① choose k initial cluster centers c c1 c2 ck at random ② calculate the euclidean distance between each sample and the k initial cluster center and then assign the sample to one of the classes whose center is closest according to the calculated distance ③ calculate the centroid of all points in each class as new cluster centers ④ steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the position of the cluster centers no longer changes the choice of the initial cluster centers has a large impact on the convergence of the k means method arthur and vassilvitskii 2007 optimized the choice of initial cluster centers i e step 1 for the k means method namely k means this method is more effective and robust in the choice of initial cluster centers lazri et al 2020 in this study the k means clustering algorithm was used to classify the spatial pattern of cumulative rainfall in an event and the spatial pattern of the hourly rainfall field cumulative rainfall clustering is in order to obtain the spatial distribution patterns caused by typhoon weather in the watershed hourly rainfall clustering is in order to obtain the hourly rainfall patterns during a typhoon because variations of hourly rainfall patterns have an impact on the flood process huang et al 2012 singh 1997 it should be noted that both rainfall sample preprocessing methods focus on the spatial distribution of rainfall and remove the difference in rainfall magnitude between samples the input data for the classification of the spatial pattern of the cumulative rainfall in the event are as follows 1 ω q 1 q 2 q n n 63 2 q i p 1 p 2 p 16 where ω is the sample set and qi is the spatial field of the ith rainfall event to remove the influence of rainfall intensity between rainfall events on the results p 1 p 2 p16 is defined as the ratio of the cumulative rainfall over the duration of a rainfall event at this station to the sum of the cumulative rainfall over the duration of a rainfall event at all stations as the randomness of the hourly rainfall field increased when the rainfall amount was smaller we excluded the hourly rainfall field with a mean areal rainfall of less than 1 mm among the 63 rainfall events then the difference between the maximum and minimum in the rainfall field at the ith hour was divided into five intensities at equal intervals that is i pmax pmin 5 the rainfall amounts of the 16 rain gauges were assigned intensity values according to groups namely 0 i 1 i 2i 2 2i 3i 3 3i 4i 4 and 4i 5i 5 the assigned values of p1 p2 p16 constitute the rainfall field at the ith hour the number of samples n obtained by preprocessing was 2 244 in this study the best k was chosen based on visualization data t sne method silhouette coefficient and calinski harabasz index after examining the number of cluster from 3 to 7 pham et al 2005 rousseeuw 1987 caliński and harabasz 1974 after clustering we obtained the centers of the clusters that is the centers of the rainfall samples of each class finally the rainfall spatial patterns were obtained from the interpolation of the centers of the rainfall samples of each class using the thiessen polygon method 2 3 2 rainfall spatial and temporal variability indexes 1 spatial coefficient of variation cv s the spatial coefficient of variation arnaud et al 2002 reflects the spatial variation of rainfall amount which is defined as 3 c v s i 1 n a i p i p m 2 p m where pm is the cumulative areal rainfall p m i 1 n a i p i ai is the thiessen polygon weight of station i pi is the cumulative rainfall at station i and n is the number of stations a larger cv s indicates that the measures of dispersion are larger whereas values of cv s close to 0 indicate that the measures of dispersion are smaller 2 rainfall location index referring to the study of smith et al 2004 we first calculated the centroid of the rainfall field for each time step i e 1 h 4 c p c p i 1 n p i a i l i i 1 n p i a i where pi is the rainfall amount at station i and li is the flow path distance from station i to the watershed outlet the flow path distances were calculated using a grid dem obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm database with a 90 m resolution the calculation of the flow path adopts the d8 method jenson and domingue 1998 ai is the thiessen polygon weight of station i and n is the number of stations the ratio of the rainfall centroid for each time step can be expressed as a dimensionless index 5 i p c p c p c p c w s n the formula for the watershed centroid c w s n is the same as that of c p c p but pi 1 i p c p is less than 1 indicating that the heavier rainfall is near the watershed outlet whereas i p c p values greater than 1 reflect heavier rainfall far away from the watershed outlet for a rainfall event of length t the location index can be defined as 6 i l t 1 t i p c p t p t t 1 t p t where i p c p t and p t are the rainfall location index and areal mean rainfall for one time step t respectively the areal mean rainfall was obtained using the thiessen polygon method 3 temporal coefficient of variation cv t 7 c v t t 1 n p t p 2 n 1 p where p t is the areal rainfall amount at the tth hour and n is the duration of the rainfall events p is the rainfall intensity of the event p t 1 n p t n a cv t value closer to 0 indicates that the temporal distribution of rainfall is more even when cv t is larger the temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven 2 3 3 flood behavior metrics five flood behavior metrics including flood peak characteristic and flow dynamics categories were used to describe the flood characteristics corresponding to different rainfall spatial patterns in this study the peak discharge qp and flood timescale ts belong to the flood peak characteristic category the mean rate of rising period rq mean rate of declining period dq and coefficient of variation of the flood process cv belong to the flow dynamics category zhai et al 2021 table 1 lists the detailed definitions and calculation formulas for the five flood behavior metrics in particular qp measures the magnitude of flood peaks whereas ts describes the concentration of flood peaks during an event through the relationship between flood volume and peak gaál et al 2012 fischer et al 2016 when the value of ts is smaller flooding is more destructive in a short time the values of rq dq and cv were larger the flood rising and declining were faster and the change in the flood process was more dramatic 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the spatial characteristics of cumulative rainfall for the studied events as described in section 2 the spatial distributions of cumulative rainfall for the 63 typhoon rainfall events over the studied watershed were classified using the k means cluster method three types of cumulative rainfall patterns were identified as shown in fig 2 to clearly depict each pattern the maximum and minimum values of colorbar in the three cumulative rainfall patterns were different there were 21 12 and 30 events presenting the spatial characteristics of patterns 1 2 and 3 respectively pattern 1 shows that the heavy rainfall region is concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed pattern 2 shows that the heavy rainfall region is concentrated in the southwestern and eastern parts of the watershed at high elevation pattern 3 presents a region of heavy rainfall along the southwest northeast direction from the southwest corner of the watershed we then revealed the monthly distribution of events within the three patterns as shown in fig 3 the rainfall events of pattern 1 occurred in autumn and accounted for as much as 95 with the highest number of events occurring in october the rainfall events of pattern 2 mainly occurred in autumn accounting for 58 with the largest occurrence in september the proportion of rainfall events in pattern 3 occurring in summer was 73 and mainly occurred in july and august we further analyzed the cumulative areal rainfall areal rainfall intensity and areal maximum hourly rainfall peak rainfall for events within the three patterns and the results are shown in fig 4 a c the cumulative areal rainfall areal rainfall intensity and areal maximum hourly rainfall of pattern 3 were generally larger than those of the other two patterns especially in terms of areal rainfall intensity and peak rainfall compared with pattern 2 the areal maximum hourly rainfall of pattern 1 was slightly larger but the areal rainfall intensity was lower in addition spatial and temporal variability indexes were used to characterize the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns as shown in fig 4 d f the average spatial coefficient of variation of the rainfall events of pattern 2 is the largest followed by those of patterns 1 and 3 in descending order which indicates that the spatial distribution of rainfall events in pattern 3 is generally more even as shown in table 2 the heavier rainfall of pattern 1 was slightly away from the watershed outlet the heavier rainfall of pattern 2 was significantly away from the watershed outlet and the rainfall of pattern 3 was concentrated near the watershed centroid the median values of patterns 1 and 3 are similar in terms of the index of the temporal coefficient of variation pattern 2 is clearly smaller than the other two patterns indicating that the temporal distribution of rainfall events of this pattern is more even than those of the other patterns we further calculated the proportion of the maximum 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h rainfall to the total rainfall as shown in table 3 the rainfall events of pattern 3 are significantly more concentrated than those of the other two patterns in terms of temporal distribution in summary pattern 2 is clearly distinguished from the other two patterns in terms of the three indexes used in this study the main distinction between pattern 1 and pattern 3 lies in the index of rainfall location and rainfall spatial coefficient of variation which indicates that the cumulative rainfall patterns obtained in this study could not only reflect the characteristics of the spatial rainfall distribution location meanwhile we find that the rainfall events of pattern 3 mostly have large rainfall amounts and strong intensities with even spatial distribution while they are concentrated in terms of temporal distribution therefore it should be the most noteworthy disaster causing rainstorm pattern in the watershed 3 2 relationship between cumulative rainfall patterns and synoptic fields to explore the causes of the three types of cumulative rainfall spatial patterns corresponding to flood events in the watershed we analyzed the relationship between cumulative rainfall patterns and synoptic fields fig 5 show that the typhoon tracks corresponding to the three types of cumulative rainfall spatial patterns and wind rose diagrams at 850 hpa for events within three types of cumulative rainfall patterns which were obtained by hourly areal average wind direction and hourly areal average wind speed the corresponding typhoon tracks of pattern 1 are further south either landing on the south of hainan island and then moving westward across hainan island into the beibu gulf or passing to the south of hainan island and moving westward until landing on vietnam the horizontal wind over the watershed of pattern 1 at 850 hpa was easterly in this pattern the songtao reservoir watershed as a whole was located on the leeward slope of wuzhi mountains influenced by the limu mountains windward slope effect the heavy rainfall was concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed zhu et al 2021 the typhoon tracks corresponding to pattern 2 were of two different types one type of typhoon makes landfall southeast of hainan island and moves northwest to the beibu gulf the other type of typhoon passes over the south of hainan island moving north from offshore of the southern hainan island into the beibu gulf the average horizontal wind over watershed at 850hpa of the two different tracks within pattern 2 were both southeasterly in this pattern the songtao reservoir watershed as a whole was located on the leeward slope of wuzhi mountains influenced by easterly and southerly winds during the typhoon events heavy rainfall was concentrated southwest and east of the watershed owing to the windward effect of terrain rainfall in the limu mountains zhu et al 2021 the corresponding typhoon tracks of pattern 3 mostly moved northwest making landfall in the area from northeast of hainan island to the leizhou peninsula and passing to the north of hainan island or qiongzhou strait into the beibu gulf the average horizontal wind over the watershed at 850 hpa was northwesterly the songtao reservoir watershed as a whole is located on the windward slope of the wuzhi mountains which explains the generally larger rainfall in this pattern than in the other two patterns moreover heavy rainfall is concentrated on the western side of the watershed owing to the windward effect of terrain rainfall of the yajiada mountains jiang et al 2018 inferred that these typhoon tracks could produce the western region rainfall type of hainan island in which topography plays a key role a steady and continuous supply of moisture is necessary conditions of extreme rainfall events we further obtained the moisture flux fields at 850 hpa for the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns by composite analysis as shown in fig 6 the rainfall events of pattern 1 generally occurred in autumn and their moisture mainly was brought by the easterly wind on the north side of the typhoon the moisture of the rainfall events of pattern 2 was brought by the southeastly on the northeast side of the typhoon the moisture of the rainfall events of pattern 3 was brought by the westerly on the south side of the typhoon 3 3 variation of hourly rainfall field under the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns to explore the variation of the hourly rainfall field under the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns we had to obtain the hourly rainfall patterns in the watershed four types of hourly rainfall patterns were identified as shown in fig 7 specifically 520 684 418 and 622 samples presented spatial characteristics of hourly rainfall patterns 1 2 3 and 4 respectively pattern 1 shows that heavy rainfall was concentrated on the western side of the watershed pattern 2 shows that heavy rainfall was concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed pattern 3 shows that heavy rainfall was concentrated in the reservoir near the watershed outlet pattern 4 shows that heavy rainfall was distributed at high altitudes in the upstream watershed then we selected four rainfall events with peak discharge higher than 5 000 m3 s 15th percentile of the peak discharge of 63 events in the watershed caused by typhoon damrey in 2005 typhoon nesat in 2011 typhoon rammasum and typhoon kalmaegi in 2014 the variations of the hourly rainfall patterns for the four rainfall events are plotted in fig 8 the total rainfall in the watershed caused by damrey showed a cumulative rainfall pattern 2 hourly rainfall usually varies between hourly rainfall pattern 2 and hourly rainfall pattern 4 when the areal rainfall is higher than 10 mm for the hourly rainfall field its spatial characteristics mainly belong to hourly rainfall pattern 4 with a proportion of 86 the total rainfall in the watershed caused by nesat rammasum and kalmaegi displayed a cumulative rainfall pattern 3 hourly rainfall usually varies between hourly rainfall patterns 1 and 4 when the areal rainfall is higher than 10 mm for the hourly rainfall field its spatial characteristics mainly belong to hourly rainfall pattern 1 with proportions of 71 67 and 80 respectively these results indicate that the variation of hourly rainfall patterns for events in each cumulative rainfall pattern is mostly within one or two hourly rainfall patterns we further analyzed the spatial characteristics of the hourly rainfall field under three types of cumulative rainfall patterns as shown in fig 9 when the spatial characteristics of the total rainfall of events showed cumulative rainfall pattern 1 the frequency of hourly rainfall pattern 2 was significantly higher than that of the other three hourly rainfall patterns when the spatial characteristics of the total rainfall of events showed cumulative rainfall pattern 2 the frequencies of hourly rainfall patterns 2 and 4 were significantly higher than those of the other two hourly rainfall patterns when the spatial characteristics of the total rainfall of events showed cumulative rainfall pattern 3 the frequency and mean rainfall amount of hourly rainfall pattern 1 were highest 3 4 flood characteristics corresponding to three types of cumulative rainfall patterns in this section we study flood characteristics under different types of cumulative rainfall patterns fig 10 shows the flood behavior metrics of flood events corresponding to the three rainfall patterns flood events resulting from cumulative rainfall patterns 1 and 2 have similar flood behavior metrics especially in terms of peak discharge and a larger peak discharge is prone to occur in september for the flood events caused by cumulative rainfall pattern 3 the average value of peak discharge mean rate of rising period mean rate of declining period and coefficient of variation of flood process were significantly higher than those of the other two patterns and the average value of the flood timescale was smaller than that of the other two patterns meanwhile a larger peak discharge mainly occurred in august and september under this rainfall pattern in summary we conclude that the flood control pressure in the songtao reservoir watershed is mainly emphasized after august cumulative rainfall pattern 3 is the dominant pattern of rainfall that causes a peak discharge greater than 5 000 m3 s in the watershed we further used the least squares method to fit the peak rainfall and peak discharge maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h runoff of the rainfall events under the three patterns as shown in fig 11 the correlation coefficient between the peak rainfall and peak discharge for rainfall events under the three cumulative rainfall patterns was above 0 6 among them the correlation coefficients between the peak rainfall and peak discharge for the rainfall events of cumulative rainfall pattern 1 and cumulative rainfall pattern 2 are close to 0 8 indicating that the peak rainfall has a significant impact on the flood peak discharge in these two cumulative rainfall patterns the correlation coefficient between the peak rainfall and peak discharge for the rainfall events of cumulative rainfall pattern 3 was the lowest among the three patterns indicating that the peak discharge of cumulative rainfall pattern 3 is prone to be also affected by other factors except rainfall than the other two cumulative rainfall patterns in addition the linear correlation coefficient between the maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h runoff for events under the three patterns was above 0 8 the above results support the view of mcintyre et al 2007 that the rainfall amount is the main control of the flow volume and peak the maximum 24 h runoff regression formulae fit better than those of the peak discharge regression equations for events under the three patterns in summary we conclude that to a certain extent a linear regression formula can show the rainfall runoff relationship for typhoon events in the songtao reservoir watershed 4 conclusions the aim of this study was to quantitatively characterize the spatial characteristics of rainfall events in a mountainous watershed on a tropical island based on 63 rainfall events we used the k means clustering algorithm to classify the spatial characteristics of rainfall for typhoon events in the mountainous watershed of the central hainan island the degree of unevenness of the rainfall spatial distribution and rainfall distribution location in the watershed were considered we further analyzed variation of hourly rainfall fields under each type of cumulative rainfall pattern in detail and explored the relationship between the weather field spatial patterns of rainfall and flood characteristics in the watershed the results are summarized as follows 1 there were three types of cumulative rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed the heavy rainfall of pattern 1 was concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed the heavy rainfall of pattern 2 was mainly concentrated in the high altitude region of the watershed the heavy rainfall of pattern 3 was located in the western part of the watershed with a southwest northeast orientation the existing common rainfall spatial and temporal variability indexes can distinguish between three types of cumulative rainfall patterns the collocation of the topography and moisture flux fields can explain the formation of three cumulative rainfall patterns at the watershed scale 2 there were four types of hourly rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed hourly rainfall pattern 2 was the dominant pattern of the hourly rainfall field under the events of cumulative rainfall pattern 1 hourly rainfall patterns 2 and 4 were the dominant patterns of the hourly rainfall field under cumulative rainfall pattern 2 hourly rainfall pattern 1 was the dominant pattern of the hourly rainfall field under cumulative rainfall pattern 3 3 cumulative rainfall pattern 3 is the main rainfall spatial pattern when typhoons cause large floods in the songtao reservoir watershed which mostly occurs in august and september to a certain extent a linear regression formula can reflect the relationship between peak rainfall and peak discharge maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h runoff in different spatial patterns of the songtao reservoir watershed in this study we only considered the flood characteristics corresponding to events under three types of cumulative rainfall patterns without considering how spatial variation in rainfall affects the flood processes of each pattern we will explore this link in detail using

2942,the spatial distribution of rainfall in a watershed has an important impact on flood warning and forecasting in this study we used the k means clustering method to classify the spatial characteristics of typhoon rainfall events in the songtao reservoir watershed in the central region of hainan island based on 63 typhoon rainfall event data from 1990 to 2020 then the relationship between the synoptic fields spatial patterns of rainfall and flood characteristics was explained based on tropical cyclone best track datasets atmospheric reanalysis data and inflow flood series the results showed that there are three types of cumulative rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed the heavy rainfall region of pattern 1 is concentrated east of the watershed whereas the heavy rainfall regions of pattern 2 are mainly concentrated southwest and east of the watersheds of many mountains the heavy rainfall region of pattern 3 with a southwest northeast orientation is located on the west side of the watershed the spatial coefficient of variation and index of rainfall location clearly distinguished among these three patterns the composite analysis of typhoon tracks wind fields and moisture flux fields can be used to interpret the formation mechanism of these spatial patterns of rainfall events in the watershed the spatial patterns of cumulative rainfall for each type were dominated by one or two types of hourly spatial rainfall patterns flood events resulting from cumulative rainfall patterns 1 and 2 have similar flood behavior metrics large floods in the watershed show an obvious seasonal variation and the corresponding rainfall events mostly show the spatial characteristics of the cumulative rainfall pattern 3 these results can enhance the understanding of the linkage between typhoons mountainous watershed rainfall and flooding processes keywords k means clustering method mountainous watershed typhoon rainfall flood characteristics data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as one of the most serious natural disasters on earth typhoons have two sides emanuel 2005 on the one hand typhoons can alleviate drought with corresponding rainfall prat and nelson 2013 kam et al 2013 on the other hand typhoons always bring great damage due to strong winds and heavy rainfall properties zhang et al 2009 rappaport 2014 the rainstorms caused by typhoons could lead to flash floods overflowing rivers and collapsing reservoirs chen et al 2013 as global warming becomes more and more intense in recent years some studies have shown that both the intensity and track of typhoons may change therefore researches related to typhoon rainfall have attracted large attention knutson et al 2020 murakami et al 2020 related studies have shown that the rainstorms caused by typhoons will increase because of the uplifting effect of island topography yu and cheng 2008 yu and cheng 2013 moreover the rainfall will become complex and variable due to the disturbance effect of island topography on typhoon airflow xie and zhang 2012 hence studies of typhoon island interaction have been paid more and more attention in recent years de bruijn and brandsma 2000 smith et al 2009 nugent and rios berrios 2018 many studies involve the rainstorm flood response of mountainous watersheds during typhoon island interactions abon et al 2011 analyzed the flood response of the marikina river watershed in the philippines during tropical storm ketsana and found that the time lag between peak rainfall and peak discharge varied with flow distance from the watershed smith et al 2005 pointed out that there were significant east west differences in the rainfall distribution in puerto rico caused by hurricane georges in which the orographic precipitation mechanisms play a key role they further analyzed the rainfall and discharge in 10 mountainous watersheds and finally showed the importance of short term rainfall rates for extreme flood response ogden 2016 explored the flood response of 16 small mountainous watersheds less than35 km2 in the island of dominica during tropical storm erika based on radar data and indirect peak discharge measurements and found that rainfall rates were the main determinant of peak discharge li et al 2005 investigated the flood responses of three typhoons in the shihman reservoir watershed of taiwan island based on rainfall station data mesoscale modeled rainfall and a distributed hydrological model the results show that the typhoon flood response is rapid and peak discharge is high in this mountainous watershed which infers that the small differences in peak rainfall and phase lag may lead to a significant amplification of flood response huang et al 2011 analysed eight typhoon cases in a mountainous watershed 355 km2 in taiwan and found that the typhoon induced rainfall in this watershed was less variable in space and more concentrated on the time scale making high spatial resolution of rainfall inputs unnecessary for predicting peak discharge timing in mesoscale watersheds trošelj and lee 2021 simulated the flood response of nine mountainous watersheds in the northeastern part of the japanese during three passing by typhoons hagibis roke and chataan and found that similar typhoon tracks are more important than rainfall intensity and central pressure for flood simulation in these mountainous watersheds with the development of observation technology a growing number of watersheds have high quality and long persistence of rainfall data the clustering method can realize feature extraction of massive data lin et al 2017 huang et al 2012 classified the spatial distribution of hourly rainfall into three major types over a subtropical mesoscale mountainous watershed using the kappa method and k means cluster analysis based on spatially high resolution radar derived rainfall estimates by analyzing the frequency of each rainfall type under different typhoon tracks they found that different typhoon tracks tended to have preferable rainfall types liu et al 2020 established three different temporal spatial distribution patterns using the dynamic cluster method in conjunction with a locally linear embedding algorithm based on 178 short duration less than 3h rainstorm samples from 63 automatic meteorological stations the results show the characteristics of the rainfall band movement and the variation of the rainfall spatial distribution in different patterns they inferred that the three patterns are caused by different weather systems indicating that the clustering results have physical significance however this study did not establish a clear link between the weather system and the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of rainfall previous studies have shown that the characteristics of the spatial distribution movement and intensity of rainstorms in mountainous watersheds are complex and variable caused by the interaction between different weather systems and topography smith et al 1997 buytaert et al 2006 in mountainous watersheds with high topographical complexity the triggering of topography induced disturbances and the collocation of meso and local scale flows result in significant variability in the spatial distribution of rainfall zou et al 2013 yu and cheng 2013 zhu et al 2021 bai et al 2020 the topography does not change with time while typhoons usually move along some certain paths it is assumed that the spatial distribution of mountainous watershed rainfall could be bounded within several specific patterns hainan island is a tropical island located in the northwestern south china sea which is characterized by plains in the northeast and mountains in the southwest hainan island is affected by monsoons tropical cyclones low pressure troughs fronts and jets and the interaction between these weather systems and topography leads to rainstorms huang et al 2021 among the rainstorms caused by these different weather systems typhoon rainfall is the most common in the watersheds of hainan island wu et al 2007 feng et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 in this study we revealed the spatial distribution pattern of typhoon rainfall events in the central mountainous watershed of hainan island using the k means clustering method based on rain gauge data meanwhile we explored the characterization of each pattern by existing common rainfall inhomogeneity indexes and briefly analyzed the formation mechanism of each pattern by using the tropical cyclone best track dataset and atmospheric reanalysis then the spatial pattern of typhoon rainfall events and the spatial pattern of hourly typhoon rainfall in the watershed were used to investigate the temporal and spatial variation in rainfall during typhoon events finally we explored the flood causing pattern of typhoon rainfall in the watershed and its relationship with flood characteristics 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the songtao reservoir watershed is located upstream of the nandu river in the hainan province with a drainage area of 1 496 km2 and a river length of 137 km the songtao reservoir watershed is a low medium mountainous area with elevations mostly above 500 m the yajiada and limu mountains are located to the west and east of the watershed respectively the wuzhishan mountains the highest point on the island with a height of 1 867 m are located to the southeast of the watershed overall the elevation is higher southwest and lower northeast of the watershed woodland areas such as virgin and commercial forests account for over 70 of the watershed area the songtao reservoir in the watershed is the largest water conservancy project on nandu river and plays an important role in flood regulation upstream of nandu river rainfall in the songtao reservoir watershed located in a tropical climate zone is abundant the mean annual rainfall from 1965 to 2015 was 1 925 mm with the rainfall amount during the wet season may to november accounting for 88 of the annual rainfall affected by the rammasun typhoon in 2014 a catastrophic flood exceeding the historical record occurred at the fucai hydrological station in the watershed with a peak stage of 7 48 m above the warning water level the flood caused six villages in baisha county in the watershed to be flooded 2 059 people to be trapped and 3 624 acres of crops to be ruined additionally the total direct economic loss of the county reached 633 million rmb under the influence of global warming typhoon intensity in the south china sea has intensified mei and xie 2016 ying et al 2012 the cumulative amount of extreme rainfall events induced by typhoons has increased significantly in hainan wu et al 2007 thus it is meaningful to study the rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed on hainan island 2 2 data the data used in this study include 1 hourly rainfall data and inflow flood tables from may to november during the 1990 2020 period were acquired from the hainan hydrology and water resources survey bureau which strictly controls the data quality before releasing them no missing or outlier data were found in the dataset specifically the inflow flood tables recorded flood events including the beginning and ending times of flood events duration of events and discharge every two hours the accuracy of the rain gauges used in this study is 0 5 mm the locations of the stations are shown in fig 1 2 the tropical cyclone tc best track datasets for the western north pacific were provided by the china meteorological administration https tcdata typhoon org cn this dataset contains the center locations and intensities of tcs at 6 h intervals from 1949 to 2020 ying et al 2014 lu et al 2021 3 the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis era5 hourly data were utilized with an horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 starting from 1979 https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset reanalysis era5 pressure levels circulation conditions at 850 hpa can more clearly display specific weather processes in addition the selection of the synoptic field layer needs to be considered with local elevation tai et al 2020 therefore the u component of wind v component of wind and specific humidity at 850 hpa were used in this study typhoons entering the impact area 15 23 n 106 114 e may have caused rainfall in the songtao reservoir watershed based on the inflow flood tables and typhoons that may affect rainfall in the watershed we selected 63 flood events caused by typhoons in the songtao reservoir watershed and further obtained typhoon rainfall events corresponding to the flood events specifically the beginning times of rainfall events are defined as 1 h rainfall exceeding a 0 5 mm occurrence at any station within the studied watershed rainfall was recorded continuously until no rainfall occurred at any station in the studied watershed finally 63 typhoon rainfall events were extracted for detailed study there were 28 typhoon events in summer june to august and 35 typhoon events in autumn september to november 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 cluster analysis of rainfall spatial patterns the k means clustering algorithm is a classic unsupervised learning algorithm that is widely used owing to its speed and simplicity in classification hartigan and wong 1979 kapoor and singhal 2017 the steps of the algorithm are as follows ① choose k initial cluster centers c c1 c2 ck at random ② calculate the euclidean distance between each sample and the k initial cluster center and then assign the sample to one of the classes whose center is closest according to the calculated distance ③ calculate the centroid of all points in each class as new cluster centers ④ steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the position of the cluster centers no longer changes the choice of the initial cluster centers has a large impact on the convergence of the k means method arthur and vassilvitskii 2007 optimized the choice of initial cluster centers i e step 1 for the k means method namely k means this method is more effective and robust in the choice of initial cluster centers lazri et al 2020 in this study the k means clustering algorithm was used to classify the spatial pattern of cumulative rainfall in an event and the spatial pattern of the hourly rainfall field cumulative rainfall clustering is in order to obtain the spatial distribution patterns caused by typhoon weather in the watershed hourly rainfall clustering is in order to obtain the hourly rainfall patterns during a typhoon because variations of hourly rainfall patterns have an impact on the flood process huang et al 2012 singh 1997 it should be noted that both rainfall sample preprocessing methods focus on the spatial distribution of rainfall and remove the difference in rainfall magnitude between samples the input data for the classification of the spatial pattern of the cumulative rainfall in the event are as follows 1 ω q 1 q 2 q n n 63 2 q i p 1 p 2 p 16 where ω is the sample set and qi is the spatial field of the ith rainfall event to remove the influence of rainfall intensity between rainfall events on the results p 1 p 2 p16 is defined as the ratio of the cumulative rainfall over the duration of a rainfall event at this station to the sum of the cumulative rainfall over the duration of a rainfall event at all stations as the randomness of the hourly rainfall field increased when the rainfall amount was smaller we excluded the hourly rainfall field with a mean areal rainfall of less than 1 mm among the 63 rainfall events then the difference between the maximum and minimum in the rainfall field at the ith hour was divided into five intensities at equal intervals that is i pmax pmin 5 the rainfall amounts of the 16 rain gauges were assigned intensity values according to groups namely 0 i 1 i 2i 2 2i 3i 3 3i 4i 4 and 4i 5i 5 the assigned values of p1 p2 p16 constitute the rainfall field at the ith hour the number of samples n obtained by preprocessing was 2 244 in this study the best k was chosen based on visualization data t sne method silhouette coefficient and calinski harabasz index after examining the number of cluster from 3 to 7 pham et al 2005 rousseeuw 1987 caliński and harabasz 1974 after clustering we obtained the centers of the clusters that is the centers of the rainfall samples of each class finally the rainfall spatial patterns were obtained from the interpolation of the centers of the rainfall samples of each class using the thiessen polygon method 2 3 2 rainfall spatial and temporal variability indexes 1 spatial coefficient of variation cv s the spatial coefficient of variation arnaud et al 2002 reflects the spatial variation of rainfall amount which is defined as 3 c v s i 1 n a i p i p m 2 p m where pm is the cumulative areal rainfall p m i 1 n a i p i ai is the thiessen polygon weight of station i pi is the cumulative rainfall at station i and n is the number of stations a larger cv s indicates that the measures of dispersion are larger whereas values of cv s close to 0 indicate that the measures of dispersion are smaller 2 rainfall location index referring to the study of smith et al 2004 we first calculated the centroid of the rainfall field for each time step i e 1 h 4 c p c p i 1 n p i a i l i i 1 n p i a i where pi is the rainfall amount at station i and li is the flow path distance from station i to the watershed outlet the flow path distances were calculated using a grid dem obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm database with a 90 m resolution the calculation of the flow path adopts the d8 method jenson and domingue 1998 ai is the thiessen polygon weight of station i and n is the number of stations the ratio of the rainfall centroid for each time step can be expressed as a dimensionless index 5 i p c p c p c p c w s n the formula for the watershed centroid c w s n is the same as that of c p c p but pi 1 i p c p is less than 1 indicating that the heavier rainfall is near the watershed outlet whereas i p c p values greater than 1 reflect heavier rainfall far away from the watershed outlet for a rainfall event of length t the location index can be defined as 6 i l t 1 t i p c p t p t t 1 t p t where i p c p t and p t are the rainfall location index and areal mean rainfall for one time step t respectively the areal mean rainfall was obtained using the thiessen polygon method 3 temporal coefficient of variation cv t 7 c v t t 1 n p t p 2 n 1 p where p t is the areal rainfall amount at the tth hour and n is the duration of the rainfall events p is the rainfall intensity of the event p t 1 n p t n a cv t value closer to 0 indicates that the temporal distribution of rainfall is more even when cv t is larger the temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven 2 3 3 flood behavior metrics five flood behavior metrics including flood peak characteristic and flow dynamics categories were used to describe the flood characteristics corresponding to different rainfall spatial patterns in this study the peak discharge qp and flood timescale ts belong to the flood peak characteristic category the mean rate of rising period rq mean rate of declining period dq and coefficient of variation of the flood process cv belong to the flow dynamics category zhai et al 2021 table 1 lists the detailed definitions and calculation formulas for the five flood behavior metrics in particular qp measures the magnitude of flood peaks whereas ts describes the concentration of flood peaks during an event through the relationship between flood volume and peak gaál et al 2012 fischer et al 2016 when the value of ts is smaller flooding is more destructive in a short time the values of rq dq and cv were larger the flood rising and declining were faster and the change in the flood process was more dramatic 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the spatial characteristics of cumulative rainfall for the studied events as described in section 2 the spatial distributions of cumulative rainfall for the 63 typhoon rainfall events over the studied watershed were classified using the k means cluster method three types of cumulative rainfall patterns were identified as shown in fig 2 to clearly depict each pattern the maximum and minimum values of colorbar in the three cumulative rainfall patterns were different there were 21 12 and 30 events presenting the spatial characteristics of patterns 1 2 and 3 respectively pattern 1 shows that the heavy rainfall region is concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed pattern 2 shows that the heavy rainfall region is concentrated in the southwestern and eastern parts of the watershed at high elevation pattern 3 presents a region of heavy rainfall along the southwest northeast direction from the southwest corner of the watershed we then revealed the monthly distribution of events within the three patterns as shown in fig 3 the rainfall events of pattern 1 occurred in autumn and accounted for as much as 95 with the highest number of events occurring in october the rainfall events of pattern 2 mainly occurred in autumn accounting for 58 with the largest occurrence in september the proportion of rainfall events in pattern 3 occurring in summer was 73 and mainly occurred in july and august we further analyzed the cumulative areal rainfall areal rainfall intensity and areal maximum hourly rainfall peak rainfall for events within the three patterns and the results are shown in fig 4 a c the cumulative areal rainfall areal rainfall intensity and areal maximum hourly rainfall of pattern 3 were generally larger than those of the other two patterns especially in terms of areal rainfall intensity and peak rainfall compared with pattern 2 the areal maximum hourly rainfall of pattern 1 was slightly larger but the areal rainfall intensity was lower in addition spatial and temporal variability indexes were used to characterize the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns as shown in fig 4 d f the average spatial coefficient of variation of the rainfall events of pattern 2 is the largest followed by those of patterns 1 and 3 in descending order which indicates that the spatial distribution of rainfall events in pattern 3 is generally more even as shown in table 2 the heavier rainfall of pattern 1 was slightly away from the watershed outlet the heavier rainfall of pattern 2 was significantly away from the watershed outlet and the rainfall of pattern 3 was concentrated near the watershed centroid the median values of patterns 1 and 3 are similar in terms of the index of the temporal coefficient of variation pattern 2 is clearly smaller than the other two patterns indicating that the temporal distribution of rainfall events of this pattern is more even than those of the other patterns we further calculated the proportion of the maximum 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h rainfall to the total rainfall as shown in table 3 the rainfall events of pattern 3 are significantly more concentrated than those of the other two patterns in terms of temporal distribution in summary pattern 2 is clearly distinguished from the other two patterns in terms of the three indexes used in this study the main distinction between pattern 1 and pattern 3 lies in the index of rainfall location and rainfall spatial coefficient of variation which indicates that the cumulative rainfall patterns obtained in this study could not only reflect the characteristics of the spatial rainfall distribution location meanwhile we find that the rainfall events of pattern 3 mostly have large rainfall amounts and strong intensities with even spatial distribution while they are concentrated in terms of temporal distribution therefore it should be the most noteworthy disaster causing rainstorm pattern in the watershed 3 2 relationship between cumulative rainfall patterns and synoptic fields to explore the causes of the three types of cumulative rainfall spatial patterns corresponding to flood events in the watershed we analyzed the relationship between cumulative rainfall patterns and synoptic fields fig 5 show that the typhoon tracks corresponding to the three types of cumulative rainfall spatial patterns and wind rose diagrams at 850 hpa for events within three types of cumulative rainfall patterns which were obtained by hourly areal average wind direction and hourly areal average wind speed the corresponding typhoon tracks of pattern 1 are further south either landing on the south of hainan island and then moving westward across hainan island into the beibu gulf or passing to the south of hainan island and moving westward until landing on vietnam the horizontal wind over the watershed of pattern 1 at 850 hpa was easterly in this pattern the songtao reservoir watershed as a whole was located on the leeward slope of wuzhi mountains influenced by the limu mountains windward slope effect the heavy rainfall was concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed zhu et al 2021 the typhoon tracks corresponding to pattern 2 were of two different types one type of typhoon makes landfall southeast of hainan island and moves northwest to the beibu gulf the other type of typhoon passes over the south of hainan island moving north from offshore of the southern hainan island into the beibu gulf the average horizontal wind over watershed at 850hpa of the two different tracks within pattern 2 were both southeasterly in this pattern the songtao reservoir watershed as a whole was located on the leeward slope of wuzhi mountains influenced by easterly and southerly winds during the typhoon events heavy rainfall was concentrated southwest and east of the watershed owing to the windward effect of terrain rainfall in the limu mountains zhu et al 2021 the corresponding typhoon tracks of pattern 3 mostly moved northwest making landfall in the area from northeast of hainan island to the leizhou peninsula and passing to the north of hainan island or qiongzhou strait into the beibu gulf the average horizontal wind over the watershed at 850 hpa was northwesterly the songtao reservoir watershed as a whole is located on the windward slope of the wuzhi mountains which explains the generally larger rainfall in this pattern than in the other two patterns moreover heavy rainfall is concentrated on the western side of the watershed owing to the windward effect of terrain rainfall of the yajiada mountains jiang et al 2018 inferred that these typhoon tracks could produce the western region rainfall type of hainan island in which topography plays a key role a steady and continuous supply of moisture is necessary conditions of extreme rainfall events we further obtained the moisture flux fields at 850 hpa for the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns by composite analysis as shown in fig 6 the rainfall events of pattern 1 generally occurred in autumn and their moisture mainly was brought by the easterly wind on the north side of the typhoon the moisture of the rainfall events of pattern 2 was brought by the southeastly on the northeast side of the typhoon the moisture of the rainfall events of pattern 3 was brought by the westerly on the south side of the typhoon 3 3 variation of hourly rainfall field under the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns to explore the variation of the hourly rainfall field under the three types of cumulative rainfall patterns we had to obtain the hourly rainfall patterns in the watershed four types of hourly rainfall patterns were identified as shown in fig 7 specifically 520 684 418 and 622 samples presented spatial characteristics of hourly rainfall patterns 1 2 3 and 4 respectively pattern 1 shows that heavy rainfall was concentrated on the western side of the watershed pattern 2 shows that heavy rainfall was concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed pattern 3 shows that heavy rainfall was concentrated in the reservoir near the watershed outlet pattern 4 shows that heavy rainfall was distributed at high altitudes in the upstream watershed then we selected four rainfall events with peak discharge higher than 5 000 m3 s 15th percentile of the peak discharge of 63 events in the watershed caused by typhoon damrey in 2005 typhoon nesat in 2011 typhoon rammasum and typhoon kalmaegi in 2014 the variations of the hourly rainfall patterns for the four rainfall events are plotted in fig 8 the total rainfall in the watershed caused by damrey showed a cumulative rainfall pattern 2 hourly rainfall usually varies between hourly rainfall pattern 2 and hourly rainfall pattern 4 when the areal rainfall is higher than 10 mm for the hourly rainfall field its spatial characteristics mainly belong to hourly rainfall pattern 4 with a proportion of 86 the total rainfall in the watershed caused by nesat rammasum and kalmaegi displayed a cumulative rainfall pattern 3 hourly rainfall usually varies between hourly rainfall patterns 1 and 4 when the areal rainfall is higher than 10 mm for the hourly rainfall field its spatial characteristics mainly belong to hourly rainfall pattern 1 with proportions of 71 67 and 80 respectively these results indicate that the variation of hourly rainfall patterns for events in each cumulative rainfall pattern is mostly within one or two hourly rainfall patterns we further analyzed the spatial characteristics of the hourly rainfall field under three types of cumulative rainfall patterns as shown in fig 9 when the spatial characteristics of the total rainfall of events showed cumulative rainfall pattern 1 the frequency of hourly rainfall pattern 2 was significantly higher than that of the other three hourly rainfall patterns when the spatial characteristics of the total rainfall of events showed cumulative rainfall pattern 2 the frequencies of hourly rainfall patterns 2 and 4 were significantly higher than those of the other two hourly rainfall patterns when the spatial characteristics of the total rainfall of events showed cumulative rainfall pattern 3 the frequency and mean rainfall amount of hourly rainfall pattern 1 were highest 3 4 flood characteristics corresponding to three types of cumulative rainfall patterns in this section we study flood characteristics under different types of cumulative rainfall patterns fig 10 shows the flood behavior metrics of flood events corresponding to the three rainfall patterns flood events resulting from cumulative rainfall patterns 1 and 2 have similar flood behavior metrics especially in terms of peak discharge and a larger peak discharge is prone to occur in september for the flood events caused by cumulative rainfall pattern 3 the average value of peak discharge mean rate of rising period mean rate of declining period and coefficient of variation of flood process were significantly higher than those of the other two patterns and the average value of the flood timescale was smaller than that of the other two patterns meanwhile a larger peak discharge mainly occurred in august and september under this rainfall pattern in summary we conclude that the flood control pressure in the songtao reservoir watershed is mainly emphasized after august cumulative rainfall pattern 3 is the dominant pattern of rainfall that causes a peak discharge greater than 5 000 m3 s in the watershed we further used the least squares method to fit the peak rainfall and peak discharge maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h runoff of the rainfall events under the three patterns as shown in fig 11 the correlation coefficient between the peak rainfall and peak discharge for rainfall events under the three cumulative rainfall patterns was above 0 6 among them the correlation coefficients between the peak rainfall and peak discharge for the rainfall events of cumulative rainfall pattern 1 and cumulative rainfall pattern 2 are close to 0 8 indicating that the peak rainfall has a significant impact on the flood peak discharge in these two cumulative rainfall patterns the correlation coefficient between the peak rainfall and peak discharge for the rainfall events of cumulative rainfall pattern 3 was the lowest among the three patterns indicating that the peak discharge of cumulative rainfall pattern 3 is prone to be also affected by other factors except rainfall than the other two cumulative rainfall patterns in addition the linear correlation coefficient between the maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h runoff for events under the three patterns was above 0 8 the above results support the view of mcintyre et al 2007 that the rainfall amount is the main control of the flow volume and peak the maximum 24 h runoff regression formulae fit better than those of the peak discharge regression equations for events under the three patterns in summary we conclude that to a certain extent a linear regression formula can show the rainfall runoff relationship for typhoon events in the songtao reservoir watershed 4 conclusions the aim of this study was to quantitatively characterize the spatial characteristics of rainfall events in a mountainous watershed on a tropical island based on 63 rainfall events we used the k means clustering algorithm to classify the spatial characteristics of rainfall for typhoon events in the mountainous watershed of the central hainan island the degree of unevenness of the rainfall spatial distribution and rainfall distribution location in the watershed were considered we further analyzed variation of hourly rainfall fields under each type of cumulative rainfall pattern in detail and explored the relationship between the weather field spatial patterns of rainfall and flood characteristics in the watershed the results are summarized as follows 1 there were three types of cumulative rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed the heavy rainfall of pattern 1 was concentrated in the eastern part of the watershed the heavy rainfall of pattern 2 was mainly concentrated in the high altitude region of the watershed the heavy rainfall of pattern 3 was located in the western part of the watershed with a southwest northeast orientation the existing common rainfall spatial and temporal variability indexes can distinguish between three types of cumulative rainfall patterns the collocation of the topography and moisture flux fields can explain the formation of three cumulative rainfall patterns at the watershed scale 2 there were four types of hourly rainfall patterns in the songtao reservoir watershed hourly rainfall pattern 2 was the dominant pattern of the hourly rainfall field under the events of cumulative rainfall pattern 1 hourly rainfall patterns 2 and 4 were the dominant patterns of the hourly rainfall field under cumulative rainfall pattern 2 hourly rainfall pattern 1 was the dominant pattern of the hourly rainfall field under cumulative rainfall pattern 3 3 cumulative rainfall pattern 3 is the main rainfall spatial pattern when typhoons cause large floods in the songtao reservoir watershed which mostly occurs in august and september to a certain extent a linear regression formula can reflect the relationship between peak rainfall and peak discharge maximum 24 h rainfall and maximum 24 h runoff in different spatial patterns of the songtao reservoir watershed in this study we only considered the flood characteristics corresponding to events under three types of cumulative rainfall patterns without considering how spatial variation in rainfall affects the flood processes of each pattern we will explore this link in detail using

2943,the anomalous behaviour of the karakoram glaciers has been a decade long discussion while a lot of effort has been given to understanding this phenomenon little has been explored with respect to the factors that govern glacier accumulation rates we performed a time series analysis of 17 himalayan glaciers to evaluate the accumulation index ai examine the ice accumulation ablation balance of each glacier and investigate the natural periodicities in regional climatic behaviour based on the ai the himalayan glaciers have been characterised as glacier positive and glacier negative glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram is favoured by global meteorological and local topographical factors analysis of 120 years of meteorological data shows a significant positive trend in winter and annual precipitation in the northwestern himalayas linked to surfacial warming and the indian ocean dipole while local factors such as slope aspect and supraglacial debris constrain summer ablation additionally the karakoram precipitation is periodic in nature demonstrating anti correlation with decadal scale precipitation records from the remaining himalayan glaciers both local and global factors explain the anomaly in the karakoram or the lack of it in other himalayan glaciers in a potentially warming planet glacial accumulation rates are becoming increasingly sensitive to ambient temperatures where glacier mass budget turns sharply negative at temperatures above 263 k due to accelerated summer ablation which overcompensates wintertime accumulation this makes the karakoram more sensitive to global meteorology than local factors therefore it is important to address whether the karakoram anomaly is an isolated climatic event or will it succumb to global climate change like the remainder of the himalayan glaciers keywords glacier mass balance wavelet analysis climate change indian summer monsoon mid latitude westerlies indian ocean dipole data availability all the data used is freely available in online servers the description links to which are provided in the manuscript 1 introduction anthropocene warming has affected the global climate extensively resulting in unpredictable precipitation regimes and accelerated cryospheric melt summerhayes and zalasiewicz 2018 under these circumstances the glaciers of the himalayan region are becoming increasingly vulnerable to maintain a balance between net ice accumulation and ablation bolch et al 2012 the glacial fed rivers originating across the himalayan mountain belt support close to 1 billion people residing in southeast asia with increasing awareness of climate change it is imperative for scientists and policymakers alike to assess the future of freshwater availability in this region modelling of snow and ice melting rates has gained large practical and scientific interest over the last few decades addressing the issues of freshwater security glacier dynamics and climate change change 2014 in this regard tracking the health of the himalayan glaciers becomes a tumultuous job for two reasons firstly the sheer number of glaciers from the region and the varying degree of information available on them from remote sensing or station data secondly calculating a glacier mass budget is fairly uncertain the earlier approach included changes in the glacier terminus and or moraine deposits from aerial photographs to track movement with time the accuracy of methods improved to include changes in surface elevation digital elevation models of the glacier and gps tracking to assist glacier mass budget other avenues of glacier mass budget estimation include remote sensing of snow products e g snow cover extent snow albedo snow depth and surface energy distribution in any assessment of glacier mass budget the change in shape size surface elevation and or the terminus position of the glacier is measured given the complex geometry of a glacier with its numerous projections debris covered surface moraine dammed edges and relief shaded zones it becomes virtually impossible to track its growth further an increase in glacier termini position or area may not always be synonymous with mass gain since ice accumulation may occur along any of the numerous projections of a glacier or simply increase the density of the existing ice strata in a similar vein glacier activity may not be synonymous with mass gain loss for example several studies have suggested that glacier activity such as surging need not be a consequence of mass gain loss bhambri et al 2017 glacier morphology represents net ice melt mass balance which in turn is a function of the contemporaneous hydrometeorological factors benn and evans 2014 given that there is a significant time lag between hydrometeorological and morphological change mehta et al 2014 it would be erroneous to interpret short term changes in glacier geometry as established climatologically induced irrevocable modification of glacier health besides barandun et al 2020 reported that a number of snow glacier monitoring techniques based on satellite reanalysis data and modelling are inadequate as they underestimate snow water equivalent and solid precipitation at higher altitudes both of which are absolutely essential parameters in glacier mass budget calculation palazzi et al 2013 and kanda et al 2020 noted the discrepancy in gridded satellite data that is used in climate modelling and prediction highlighting the biases associated with each remotely sensed dataset especially the interpolation uncertainty of the precipitation estimated by the gridded datasets cannot be totally overlooked in the sachen glacier of the western himalayas shroder et al 2000 observed negligible change in the position of the terminus despite up to 10 m thinning in numerous places in the glacier thus absolute measurements of a glacier inventory may not be the most accurate way to establish growth rather the temporal hydrometeorological change that is change in the net moisture input e g snowfall snowmelt along with temperature trends in a glacier catchment is more likely to represent the glacial mass budget accurately than the actual change in the dimension of glaciers for example the temporal variation in snowfall rates is directly linked to the glacier mass gain and therefore serves as a comprehensive and quantitative metric to classify glacier mass changes therefore a distinction needs to be made regarding the parameters which record the absolute health of a glacier in terms of mass gain and loss the karakoram glaciers have recorded a neutral to positive glacial mass budget over the recent decades farinotti et al 2020 dasgupta and sanyal 2019 forsythe et al 2017 gardelle et al 2012 hewitt 2005 when the majority of the himalayan glaciers are receding the stability advance of the karakoram glaciers has been established by measuring the surging activity in the glacier front quincey et al 2015 bhambri et al 2017 or by monitoring the glacial mass gain over time dehecq et al 2019 such glacier response has been attributed to the regional atmospheric circulation in the context of the relative positioning and intensity of the westerly jet forsythe et al 2017 and or due to the presence of local supraglacial debris scherler et al 2011 which inhibit the ablation rates in this region the bulk of the precipitation in the karakoram region comes from the mid latitude westerlies mlw in the winter and spring months which also happens to be the accumulation period for its glaciers kapnick et al 2014 in addition to an increasing precipitation trend over the last century treydte et al 2006 both accumulation and ablation rates in the karakoram are sustained due to the regional hydroclimatic pattern the winter precipitation is influenced by the western tibetan vortex li et al 2018 propelled by an increasing moisture flux from the irrigated fields of western india lee et al 2011 at the same time supraglacial debris scherler et al 2011 and cooler mid lower stratosphere and surface air temperatures during the summer months li et al 2018 have insulated the accumulated snowpack through the melting season kapnick et al 2014 several decades of positive feedback of the above processes are thought to have resulted in the karakoram glaciers gaining mass or remaining stable the studies listed above have proceeded to theorize and justify the expansion of the karakoram glaciers based on the assumption that the expansion is indeed a long term and statistically significant phenomenon and rightly so given that higher accumulation lower ablation rates summer cooling and strengthening of atmospheric circulation favour the anomaly in the karakoram however these hydrometeorological drivers are often dynamic changing several folds from season to season and decade to decade therefore an independent estimation of the glacier s health is required which integrates the hydrometeorological drivers and their temporal variations especially because recent trends of mass loss have already been reported in certain western karakoram glaciers muhammad and tian 2016 muhammad et al 2019 in this study a meteorological mass budget termed accumulation index ai has been formulated as a function of moisture budget and surface temperature trend to characterise the relative mass gain loss of 17 himalayan glaciers including the glaciers in the karakoram unlike absolute glacier measurements ai balances the incoming snowfall and outgoing snowmelt as a function of temperature during the growing and ablation period respectively in this process the annual potential for accumulation or melt for each of these glaciated sites is being estimated the meteorological model developed in this study provides a first hand analysis of the temporal variations in the moisture budget and temperature trend in 17 glaciated regions fig 1 across the himalayas mapped over 41 years the 17 sites have been selected to represent the following parts of the mountain range northwestern himalaya shigar boltoro siachen durinar and durung drong western himalaya chota shigri gangotri pindari and milam central himalaya annapurna kyimoshung ngozumba lhotse and khangchengyao and eastern himalaya kangphu bhumthang and bome based on the index the 17 regions have been categorised as glacier positive and glacier negative describing the rate of glacier growth investigation of the causes responsible for glacier positive behaviour has been carried out using long term meteorological datasets by applying wavelet periodicity analysis on precipitation and temperature records at each of the 17 sites harmonic fitting using the wavelet transformation of monthly continuous cru precipitation data 1901 2019 has revealed multiple periodicities in the precipitation records the advantage of this form of signal decomposition over others e g fourier transformation is that in wavelet analysis both the mode and domain of the frequencies are identifiable the occurrence of domain specific periodicities helps us decipher the temporal behaviour of precipitation in the 17 himalayan sites the natural periods observed in the cru precipitation dataset is further substantiated with tree ring δ18o precipitation reconstruction for the region additionally the precipitation pattern in the karakoram shows correlation and anti correlation with precipitation records from the other parts of the himalayas at various times scales suggesting the impact of ocean atmospheric teleconnections that influence the mlw and indian summer monsoon ism this pattern is synonymous with the long term changes in the intensity of both the ism and mlw and their centennial scale migration across the intertropical convergence zone itcz however the lack of long term in situ and spatially resolute meteorological records from the higher himalayas add uncertainty to any assessment of future climatic trends whether simulated or experimentally established glacial accumulation is not a direct outcome of mass and or dimensional change but a complex interplay between meteorological and topographical parameters in lieu of a warming planet anthropogenic or otherwise a departure from periodic behaviour in the natural variables is expected which raises the question of the karakoram predicament 2 materials and methods recent advancements in the mass budget estimation of glacier ice thickness include aerial photogrammetry using lidar and sondar waves emitted and received by specially designed sensors on manned unmanned flying vehicles sondar sensors are calibrated to measure the acoustics of longitudinal waves within an ice column the acquired images must be of sufficient scale to discern glacier margins from the surrounding terrain and should be taken late in the ablation season riedel and burrows 2005 however these methods are expensive time and labour intensive and survey only a small fraction of the mountain terrain at a time in this study we have simplified the mass budget of a glacier in terms of its meteorological parameters which are easily accessible from satellite agencies and can be error constrained with in situ data or other contemporary datasets a glacier will gain mass if it receives more moisture than it loses with environmental conditions to sustain its growth bolch et al 2012 hence we propose a meteorological mass budget of moisture gain and loss in a glaciated region to assess a glacier s health during the growth season snowfall sfg received within the topographic limits of a glacier is likely to be incorporated into its mass similarly snowmelt smlta in the ablation season results in glacier mass loss both sfg and smlta have been obtained from era5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present copernicus eu for each site at a monthly resolution the values have been georeferenced to cover each of the glaciated sites resampled onto a grid of 0 25 0 25 and averaged over their respective seasons in mm of water equivalent instead of m of water equivalent to reduce long form decimals see dasgupta et al 2021a dasgupta et al 2021b the temporal variation of both parameters is primarily affected by changes in the temperature snowfall and snowmelt have been compiled and averaged for the growth and ablation months here it is important to note that the growth ablation season is not uniform across the himalayas hence to obtain peak snowmelt and snowfall seasons the snowfall and snowmelt maxima periods months were identified for each year in each station long term temperature trend has been considered as the third parameter instead of seasonal variation in temperature as seasonal variations are incorporated in sfg and smlta values instead the long term trend allows us to evaluate the season to season hydrological flux balance in response to long term warming or cooling seasonal information would over amplify the effect of temperature change temperature trends were calculated across the entire dataset i e 41 12 months by performing mann kendall test for each station which yields the sen slope estimator of temperature 41 years all 3 parameters have been compiled from the copernicus climate change service climate data store cds repository using era5 hersbach et al 2020 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 thus the accumulation index is defined as the difference in snowfall and snowmelt for an annual precipitation cycle multiplied by the relative warming cooling witnessed by the glacier observed over 41 years ai sfg smlta ts mm year aggregated for 41 years 1 where ai accumulation index sfg growing season snowfall mm of water equivalent year smlta ablation season snowmelt mm of water equivalent year ts temperature trend calculated using sen slope estimator year the uncertainty in ai has been estimated individually for all 17 glaciers supplementary i the maximum uncertainty is within 15 in addition to the calculation of ai for the 17 himalayan glaciers based on 41 years of satellite reanalysis data from cds we compiled 118 years of meteorological station data from the climatic research unit cru ts 4 02 the meteorological time series data for individual locations have been extracted from the cru grids resampled at 0 25 x0 25 spatial resolution the reason behind choosing this resolution is that none of the glaciated zones exceeds that spatial range of 0 25 x0 25 grid averaged data for each of the 17 locations across 118 12 month slices were extracted from cru netcdf files on arcgis pro statistical analyses were performed thereafter on individual time series we examined the accuracy of both the gridded datasets era5 land reanalysis and cru era5 ensemble means were calculated for each of the study area grids giving an error range of 16 supplementary i additionally era5 monthly precipitation data show a good correlation with station observed data in the himalayan region capturing elevation and seasonal dependencies chen et al 2021 cru gauged and gridded data for all the sites have been validated against gpcc modelled and imd gauged and modelled does not cover sites falling in nepal and china the correlation scores between cru gpcc and cru imd that are significant r2 0 5 p 0 01 have been tabulated in supplementary i station data is mostly absent in the higher himalayas and all the sites are situated above 5 km altitude additionally there is a host of peer reviewed publications that have utilised cru gpcc data to analyse climate roxy et al 2015 basu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 monthly precipitation and temperature data in all 17 locations have been compiled to generate correlation matrices as monthly records are strongly influenced by seasonal oscillation a 12 point and 120 point moving average filter was applied through the data to absolve the seasonal perturbations the resultant data shows annual and decadal perturbations respectively within the karakoram region meteorological parameters have been analysed to reveal the natural periodicities of the variables which may be responsible for the increasing snowfall in the region as calculated by the accumulation index in this regard wavelet analysis has been performed on long term precipitation and temperature data the morlet continuous wavelet transform is evaluated to describe the dominant scale of periodicity to identify the major periodicities the wavelet power spectrum analysis for karakoram precipitation was carried out using a matlab wavelet script torrence and compo 1998 multiple periods were observed at multiple significance levels for monthly continuously cru data annual 12 point moving average monthly precipitation and winter precipitation data djfm months only wavelet spectra of precipitation records outside the karakoram region have been compiled in the supplementary section the occurrence and cause behind these periods have been discussed later 3 results and discussion ai for the 17 glaciated regions 0 25 x0 25 grids across the mountain belt is shown in fig 2 of the 17 locations 6 show positive values for ai and are hence categorised as glacier positive while the remaining 11 are termed glacier negative please note that positive ai may also arise from a negative mass flux sfg smlta and cooling temperature trend sen slope 0 and negative ai may also arise from positive mass flux sfg smlta and a cooling temperature trend sen slope 0 both scenarios are improbable in the himalayan region given the pan himalayan warming temperature trends and have been addressed in detail in supplementary i among the 6 glacier positive areas 3 lie within the karakoram belt shigar boltoro and siachen with significant accumulation indices and one each in sonmarg durinar kishtwar durung drong and lahaul chota shigri with lower values of ai it is important to note that ai does not reflect glacier mass budget it quantifies whether a given area has the hydrometeorological conditions favourable for glacier growth in the 6 glacier positive areas 40 3 11 8 and 45 5 15 0 of the annual precipitation is received during winter december march djfm and spring march may mam respectively sourced from the mlw 118 year average supplementary table 1 summer june september jjas precipitation sourced from the ism accounts for 75 5 6 4 of annual precipitation in the glacier negative areas but 6 of the annual precipitation in the northwestern himalayas 118 year average supplementary table 1 both seasonal and annual cru precipitation show increasing trends in the glacier positive regions while decreasing trends dominate in the rest of the study area surface temperatures have increased in all 17 locations from 1901 with steeper trends in central himalaya r 0 64 p 0 01 followed by the northwest r 0 52 p 0 13 east r 0 48 p 0 08 and west r 0 40 p 0 23 across all the glaciated regions the average winter temperature is negative whereas the average summer temperature is positive with the exception of lhotse compared to the west central and east himalayan glaciers mean winter and summer temperatures in the karakoram regions are approximately 10 k and 5 k lower respectively with the exception of boltoro and siachen in the karakoram and ngozumba in eastern himalaya all the glaciated regions have recorded an average positive spring and mean annual temperature in the 20th century 3 1 glacier positive behaviour a positive ai signifies that snow accumulation is greater than ablation and the rate of warming cooling is relatively less more among the 6 glacier positive regions snowfall in the growth period ranges 3 8 1 0 mm month whereas snowmelt in the ablation period ranges 2 0 1 5 mm month with a mean annual surface temperature of 263 1 6 4 k supplementary table 1 persistent higher snowfall rates and a negligible warming trend has ensured a positive meteorological mass budget over the last few decades as a result glaciers in these regions are prone to gain mass or remain stable the glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram region is supported by 3 independent testimonials 3 1 1 hydrometeorological evidence strengthening of mlw and weakening of ism northwestern himalaya receives the majority of the precipitation in the winter and spring months from the mlw dimri et al 2015 dasgupta et al 2022 which also happens to be the growing season for the glaciers thus the accumulated snowpack is buttressed by winter temperatures whereas for the remainder of the himalayan glaciers which are primarily fed by the ism the accumulation and ablation period overlap during the summer months as a result a significant portion of the accumulated snow does not sustain the warmer summer temperatures furthermore the precipitation snowfall in the karakoram himalaya is elevation independent and is being protected by lower energy conditions decreasing trend of surface upwelling shortwave and outgoing longwave to ensure a steady accumulation of the glacier mass dimri et al 2016 dimri 2021 in the northwestern parts summer cooling in the indo tibetan plateau farinotti et al 2020 impedes snowmelt in the ablation period intact snowfields further lower the surface temperatures due to higher snow ice albedo feedback the summer cooling mechanism is further accentuated by the weakening of the ism due to a decrease in the sensible heat flux cooler surface and tropospheric temperatures li et al 2018 from an increase in irrigation practices in the neighbouring region lee et al 2011 a combination of the above factors has driven a balanced glacier budget in the karakoram in recent decades however the hydrometeorological trends advocated by the aforementioned studies summarise decadal scale precipitation and temperature records which may not apply to glacier cycles which take centuries to occur therefore long term climatic patterns must be analysed from paleo proxy records to differentiate anomalies from natural phenomena 3 1 2 water isotope evidence tree ring and meteoric water δ18o values several independent studies on himalayan paleoclimate from tree ring δ18o precipitation reconstruction have reported centennial scale rainfall variability accompanied by contrasting hydroclimatic behaviour between the karakoram and western himalayas borgaonkar et al 1994 treydte et al 2006 managave et al 2020 treydte et al 2006 reported stronger hydrological conditions i e increasing seasonal and annual precipitation from lower δ18o values of tree rings in the karakoram region post 1850 ce warming of the planet and an increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere could be responsible for such an intensification of the hydrological cycle long term 1901 2018 precipitation records compiled from cru station data show a positive trend for the karakoram glaciers r 0 3 p 0 0001 if there is a greater moisture input the glaciers of northwestern himalayas are likely to receive it in the form of snowfall average elevation 5 km average temperature 263 k this should in principle lead to higher accumulation and or reduced ablation rates in the region the stable isotope composition of river water can be used to trace the relative contribution of glacier snowmelt in mountain hydrology kumar et al 2019 with increased accumulation reduced ablation the glacier melt contribution in the corresponding river network must decrease or remain constant manifested in the form of higher δ18o values of the river water the upper indus drainage basin surrounding the karakoram range showed an increase in the mean δ18o values of its stream water sampled between 1994 95 karim and veizer 2002 and 2007 08 rai et al 2016 however the stable isotope variation in glacier fed tributaries cannot be regarded as an absolute metric to gauge the temporal variation in glacier melt fraction as an increased melt is not synonymous with lower accumulation rates 3 1 3 geomorphic evidence elevation slope aspect and debris cover apart from regional meteorology there are local geomorphic factors that promote glacial health slope and aspect of glaciers debris cover and the elevation of the snow accretion zone actively control snow accumulation in a glaciated catchment the karakoram glaciers are larger than their central east and west himalayan counterparts nie et al 2021 and are located in high relief areas 5 km supplementary table 1 precipitation at this altitude is trapped due to the orographic confinement of the incoming moisture further a relatively higher geopotential height of condensation ensures that the entire moisture influx occurs as snowfall the mean slope of the karakoram glaciers 10 supplementary table 1 is considerably lower compared to the remaining areas of high mountain asia a gentle slope favours snow and ice accumulation over steeper slopes which intersect with the angle of repose and often lead to avalanching of the snow cover scherler et al 2011 additionally the mean direction of descent for the karakoram glaciers is sw supplementary table 1 which allows limited sunlight exposure in the summer months when the angle of zenith is 158 sse shorter daylight hours due to relief shading reduce the diurnal solar influx thereby impeding the rate of ablation debris cover and thickness on the glacier surface has been known to provide thermal insulation and reduce ablation mayer et al 2006 by returning most of the absorbed heat back to the atmosphere in the form of longwave and turbulent heat fluxes fugger et al 2021 several himalayan glaciers have a blanket of supraglacial debris ranging in size from dust to boulders eroded away from mountain slopes or from subglacial erosion at the ice bedrock interface nagai et al 2013 although the occurrence of the debris field is not limited to the karakoram region landslides and avalanches hewitt 2005 in this tectonically active terrain have invoked a steady supply of erosional detritus 3 2 glacier positive behaviour outside the karakoram region glacier positive behaviour has been observed outside the karakoram region as mentioned a positive ai only establishes the meteorological potential for glacial aggradation therefore it is difficult to ascertain the absolute glacier budget or accumulation unless local factors are understood durinar and durung drong glaciers lie in southwestern jammu and kashmir j k they receive winter precipitation primarily from mlw in the form of snowfall which contributes between 29 and 66 of the annual streamflow jeelani et al 2013 the glaciers in this region are marked by debris cover in the ablation zone the average winter and annual temperatures are 266 k and 275 k respectively supplementary table 1 a combination of the above factors could facilitate glacier growth in a similar fashion to that of the karakoram glaciers in eastern j k however studies have reported a negative mass budget in western j k 0 50 0 28 m yr vijay and braun 2018 unlike the karakoram glaciers surging behaviour is absent in durinar and durung drong although there is no theory to suggest that surging in glaciers results in a positive budget it can be logically deduced from the karakoram example several karakoram glaciers depict short to long term surging activity observed in recent years redistribution of ice and snow allows for a larger accumulation zone with the branching of the central glacier tongue into finger like projections within narrow valleys and or moraine dams as a result the glacier grows in mass however if glacier movement is limited the glaciers are more prone to thinning thawing and breakage additionally studies have measured a fluctuating mass balance trend from the region in spite of the net loss in the total glaciated area since 1962 pandey et al 2011 ghosh and pandey 2013 as it is difficult to conclude the state of a glacier s health from absolute measurements a meteorological mass budget provides a more reliable and simplistic estimate of the durinar and durung drong glaciers the chhota shigri glacier in lahaul is subjected to alternate precipitation regimes from ism and mlw winter precipitation is the primary source of snow accumulation with an average temperature of 257 k summer precipitation at higher reaches above the equilibrium line altitude is in the form of snowfall with a mean temperature of 275 k azam et al 2014 reported that the intensity of summer monsoon snowfall changes the albedo rates thereby impeding the snowmelt in ablation zones additionally there is shading and a partial debris cover in the ablation zones of this glacier conceding to lower terminus retreat srivastava et al 2022 despite the above factors chhota shigri has lost mass over the last few decades 0 30 0 36 m yr azam et al 2014 the absence of relief shading and a mean aspect of 270 west facilitates snow ablation in this region as a result the glaciers in the lahaul and spiti region have recorded a negative mass budget in spite of the meteorological conditions conducive for accumulation ai 0 gangotri glacier in uttarkashi has a complex mass budget with dichotomous interpretations on one hand a steep accumulation zone slope 10 the abundance of small sized glaciers 1 km2 summer time precipitation and warming over the last few decades all favour glacier retreat as reported in several studies bhambri et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2016 on the other hand the pre monsoon isotopic composition of the alaknanda and bhagirathi river water from this basin shows no 18o or 2h depletion trend to support glacier melting rates and increasing cryospheric contribution kumar et al 2019 boral et al 2019 suggested that the lowering of pre ism glacier melt contribution in both headwaters between 2014 and 2016 is caused by rain induced snowmelt time lag between glacier meltwater production and transport and seasonal snow cover variation furthermore the terminus region of gangotri is debris covered making it difficult to delineate the net glacier covered area and calculate areal changes from satellite imagery it is important to note that glacier positive behaviour has been observed north of the karakoram region in pamir and tien shan mountain ranges by several studies kääb et al 2015 kotlyakov et al 2020 lambrecht et al 2020 among the many reasons reported atmospheric circulation and local topography seem to be the common factor behind positive accumulation rates in both karakoram and pamir given the geographical proximity of the two regions a comprehensive report on glacier accumulation rates would be invaluable nonetheless falls outside the purview of the present study 3 3 glacier negative behaviour a negative ai signifies greater snow ablation than growth alongside warming trends in surface temperature among the 11 glacier negative regions snowfall in the growth period ranges 2 4 1 0 mm month whereas snowmelt in the ablation period ranges 3 5 1 5 mm month supplementary table 1 the surface temperature for the sample period ranges 270 6 6 6 k with a mean anomaly of 0 5 0 2 supplementary table 1 persistent lower snowfall and higher snowmelt rates accompanied by warmer temperatures have resulted in a negative meteorological mass budget over the last few decades as a result glaciers in these regions are prone to mass loss 3 4 central east and west himalayan glaciers the 11 glacier negative regions from this study spanning from the west to east himalaya witness higher ablation rates compared to accumulation this behaviour is partly the function of location and partly caused by global meteorology climate projections carried out for the early and late holocene by kumar et al 2020 suggest that the mlw dominated the precipitation in the northwestern himalayas with the ism dominating during the mid holocene summer precipitation sourced from the ism feeds these 11 glaciers as mentioned the overlap of the accumulation and ablation period prevents a higher accumulation of snow ice further the mean annual precipitation has reduced over the last century whereas the surface temperatures have increased particularly in the central himalayas fig 3 the eastward location of these glaciers allows only one moisture source i e the ism compared to the western glaciers which have a steady moisture input from both the mlw and the ism the more significant aspect of the ism which affects the glaciers in this region is the precipitation anomaly fig 4 the precipitation anomaly calculated for the peak season in the glacier negative parts of the himalayas is significantly higher jjas std dev 38 4 mm compared to the glacier positive parts mam std dev 15 5 mm djfm 12 2 mm in other words summer precipitation sourced from the ism is highly variable resulting in a non steady or sporadic supply of moisture to the higher himalayas in the form of snowfall in recent years several studies have attributed this behaviour to global meteorological controls such as the enso and iod schott et al 2009 yadav et al 2013 dimri and chevuturi 2016 basu et al 2020 in the following section we have explored and investigated the potential causes behind ism mlw variability in all the 17 sites at seasonal annual and decadal time scales 3 5 periodic nature of himalayan precipitation wavelet analysis of precipitation data from the himalayan region between 1901 and 2019 has identified multiple periodicities the monthly precipitation records are strongly influenced by intra annual periodicity due to the impact of the seasonal cycles in all 17 sites fig 6a application of a 12 and 120 point moving average filter on the data allows us to smoothen the curve to check for inter annual perturbations on annual and decadal time scales respectively inter annual records display 8 to 16 year periodicity fig 6b for all the locations lastly the winter precipitation records i e precipitation received in the djfm months sourced from the mlw exhibit long term periodicities in the karakoram himalaya fig 6c long term periodicity is largely absent in the west central and east himalayan glaciers the wavelet spectra for all the sites have been attached in the supplementary file 3 5 1 decadal scale periodicity implication for increasing precipitation in the karakoram despite being two different moisture transport systems the ism and mlw affect the hydroclimate of the himalayas in conjunction this can be observed in the long term datasets as well where each of the 17 locations in this study fed by ism mlw or both have shown mutual intercorrelation of precipitation values supplementary table 2 broadly the central west and east himalayan glaciers show a positive correlation i e they all experience an increase or decrease in annual seasonal precipitation in phase the exception lies in the karakoram glaciers which show anti correlation in other words the precipitation in the karakoram trend positive while the rest of the himalayas trend negative and vice versa the anti correlation is visible at seasonal and decadal time scales but not at the annual time scale fig 5 a seasonal anti correlation is expected as the karakoram region and the rest of the himalayas receive their predominant precipitation in alternating seasons from the mlw and the ism respectively however the decadal anti correlation would require a mechanism that affects the mlw and the ism inversely with a periodicity of 10 years periodicities in karakoram surface temperatures derived from tree ring temperature reconstruction have been reported by zafar et al 2016 which also happens to be out of phase with the rest of the himalayas a number of atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections affect the intensity and duration of the rainy season in the himalayas controlled by sea surface temperature sst differential heating of the landmass of asia and the indian ocean the existence of the himalayan ranges and the tibetan plateau the occurrence of heavy light snow over the tibetan plateau the existence and circulation of upper air jet streams in the troposphere etc prell and kutzbach 1992 these controlling factors are manifested in seasonal to multi annual climatic phenomena oscillations such as iod enso walker circulation southern annular mode etc schott et al 2009 in the indian ocean as well as pdo soi and nao elsewhere here the temporal variability in himalayan precipitation is concurrent with the impacts of ocean sst cycles such as the iod and enso however the correlation scores for iod are much stronger than that of enso as observed in the himalayan dataset supplementary ii in the forthcoming section we demonstrate the linkage between iod and himalayan precipitation followed by periodicity and correlational analysis of both metrics the indian ocean dipole iod is characterised by an irregular oscillation of sst between the eastern and western indian ocean saji et al 1999 the iod affects the strength of monsoons over the indian subcontinent with a negative phase corresponding to an increase in ism precipitation krishnamurthy and kirtman 2003 the intensity of the iod is represented by an anomalous sst gradient between the western equatorial indian ocean 50e 70e and 10s 10n and the southeastern equatorial indian ocean 90e 110e and 10s 0n termed the dipole mode index dmi during the negative or neutral phase of the iod dmi 0 the pacific warm waters reach the northwestern shores of australia moisture evaporated over this part of the indian ocean travels west and precipitates the cooler waters here sink below the warm surface layer while the westerly winds continue to push the warm pool eastwards forming a version of the walker circulation like the one formed in the central pacific the onset of the positive phase dmi 0 is triggered by the weakening of the westerly winds complemented by the strengthening of the easterly trades krishnamurthy and kirtman 2003 during this period of the iod the warm pool migrates westward the positive phase of the iod corresponds with higher precipitation in the karakoram range fig 5 which occurs when the westerly winds are weak and the warm pool is placed in the western indian ocean similarly the negative iod corresponds with higher precipitation over the ism dominated west central and east himalayas fig 5 also during which the westerlies are stronger the negative phase of the iod is driven by cooler than normal ssts in the western indian ocean arabian sea and warmer than normal ssts to the west of indonesia this configuration of sst gives the normal circulation a boost the negative phase of iod results in stronger ism observed as higher rainfall in ism dominated areas of the east central west himalayan arc the stronger circulation brings more consistent westerly winds southwards and a stronger convection of moisture in its path this pattern is consistent with la niña negative phase of enso the impact of iod on himalayan precipitation can be can be understood at the seasonal scale during the positive phase of iod the warm pool migrates to the western indian ocean this phenomenon can have two implications first the establishment of a warm pool in the western indian ocean and the subsequent transport of moisture evaporated from this region on account of a stronger trade winds during positive iod b low pressure over northwestern tibet due to the karakoram vortex forsythe et al 2017 and c establishment of moisture convergence due to a zonal dipole formed between the western and eastern part of the subcontinent behera and ratnam 2018 second studies have shown the southward migration of the itcz over the last several thousand years fallah et al 2017 tan et al 2019 potentially resulting from the perpetual strengthening of the mlw and or weakening of the ism burdanowitz et al 2021 observed a southward shift in the itcz from mid holocene onwards suggesting that the changes in the intensity and position of the ism were influenced by latitudinal insolation gradients on a decadal to multi decadal scale the iod himalayan precipitation relationship manifests in terms of ism vs mlw strengths extent of influence across the indian subcontinent decadal scale variability in the iod has been reported by several studies nakamura et al 2009 kayanne et al 2006 ashok et al 2004 in addition we performed periodicity analysis on the dmi scores 1870 2020 using morlet transformation after the removal of seasonal and annual frequencies the wavelet transformation yields a significant decadal scale periodicity concurrent with the 8 16 year periodicity observed in our dataset for the 17 himalayan sites supplementary iii and records significant correlation with the same i e dmi vs decadal scale himalayan precipitation fig 5b legend yellow furthermore the correlation coefficients in fig 5b exhibit an alternating effect the precipitation in the mlw dominated karakoram region is anti correlated with the precipitation in the ism dominated central west and east himalaya given that iod is strongly anti correlated with ism and ism vs mlw precipitation trends are inversely related one can infer the causality behind strengthening mlw and or weakening ism from changing iod over time based on this inference the strengthening mlw over the karakoram amount and number of rainy days is most likely the cause behind the increased glacier accumulation rates observed in this region 3 5 2 centennial scale periodicity implication for increasing precipitation in the karakoram treydte et al 2006 reconstructed the precipitation trends in the karakoram from tree ring δ18o values and observed a centennial scale variation in the precipitation pattern from the region the last observed period began at 1850 ce corresponding to the rising precipitation trend in the northwestern himalayas a closer look into this reconstructed normalised precipitation pattern shows a 200 year periodicity fig 6 d winter precipitation records in the karakoram region fed by the mlw exhibit long term periodicities of 128 256 years fig 6c the cru precipitation archive provides 120 years of data identifying periodicities 120 years from this sample may not be statistically significant thus the corresponding amplitudes of the global wavelet spectra at 128 and 256 lie outside the cone of influence unlike the continuous seasonal djfm precipitation records provided by cru the normalised precipitation scores provided by paleo reconstruction are expected to show a composite signal encapsulating seasonal annual and centennial scale climatic phenomena as a result the precipitation z score curve calculated by treydte et al 2006 departs from a regular periodic curve observed in this study which would have been the case if the tree rings were only nourished with wintertime moisture from the mlw together the tree ring precipitation reconstruction and the wavelet analysis of wintertime precipitation in the karakoram strongly suggest that a the precipitation in this region sourced from the mlw is periodic in nature and b there is an increasing trend in the precipitation post 1850 ce 3 6 the fate of himalayan glaciers oerlemans 1991 studied the ice energy budget in the climatic system and the response of glaciers to positive negative feedback mechanisms powered by solar insolation and suggested that glacier health is controlled by a complex interplay of climatic forcing such as topographical influences temperature fluctuations at the base of ice sheets and ice albedo feedback for greenland ice sheets and mountain glaciers surface temperatures act as the primary controller of mass balance it determines whether ice sheets are in a regime of net ablation or accumulation however the relationship between the two parameters is not linear ice accumulates initially as snow at mean annual temperatures of 263 k but rates of accumulation remain below 0 5 m of ice per year regardless of the temperature the mass balance turns sharply negative at temperatures above 263 k because ablation accelerates and overwhelms net accumulation the boundary between positive and negative mass balance is called the equilibrium line fig 7 a low latitude cryospheric regions such as the karakoram himalayas experience mean winter temperatures below 263 k relative warming observed in the last century has favoured an increase in moisture carrying capacity of the atmosphere wet snow precipitation which is denser than the much colder dry snow and melting refreezing of the snowpack all of which promote higher accumulation rates therefore the glaciers show a positive mass budget even though the ambient temperatures have risen as per oerlemans mass balance curve snow ice accumulation is optimal around 263 k soon after which the mass balance turns sharply negative and melting pursues here the increase in snow accumulation is not large enough to compensate for stronger melting the karakoram glaciers lie in the accumulation range of oerlemans ice mass balance curve tmean 256 2 k tmax 267 9 k while most of the himalayan glaciers are crossing over to the ablation range fig 7b temperature fluctuations of a few degrees would be sufficient to push the karakoram cryosphere into the ablation range and once ablation succeeds the accumulation rates it is unlikely that the glacier will revert back to the accumulation range over the last century the average summertime ablation period temperatures of boltoro and siachen have remained fairly constant therefore it is challenging to forecast the temperature trend in the current century especially because the climate of this region is affected by global atmospheric and ocean circulation paleoreconstruction studies from a wide range of proxies have reported relative warming across the himalayas meteorological modelling carried out by kapnick et al 2014 reported that warmer temperatures in the 21st century will not affect snowfall rates given the winter season dominant precipitation in the region and the geographic placement and height of these mountains although these studies have reported increased precipitation trends it is important to remember that precipitation at higher altitudes in a warmer climate will shift from snowfall to rainfall or a mix of both barandun et al 2020 observed that warming trends will increase the total annual precipitation in tian shen north of the karakoram range but decrease the fraction of solid precipitation high mountain hydrologies are usually sensitive to any perturbation in the temperature and precipitation patterns singh et al 2018 but whether this applies to the karakoram region is still a matter of debate therefore the glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram may not be an anomalous event in other words the karakoram cryosphere is yet to yield to the global climatic trends as it is being protected by its hydrometeorological benefactors namely a winter accumulation cycle b steady moisture supply from the mlw and c nugatory summer warming if and when the warming is sufficient to affect the snowfall snowmelt balance or winter precipitation is inadequate to sustain the accumulation rates the karakoram glaciers will become as vulnerable as their central east west himalayan counterparts in such a scenario local factors such as debris cover slope atmospheric vortices etc will concede to global climatic trends therefore it would be naive to consider that the karakoram phenomenon can exist outside the influence of global climate forcings 4 concluding remarks hydrometeorological variability directly impacts the ice mass balance in the himalayan glaciers in our study we have quantified the spatiotemporal change in hydrometeorological drivers namely growing season snowfall ablation season snowmelt and long term temperature trend to formulate the accumulation index the ai parameter measures the meteorological mass balance for a glaciated region and reports its potential for glacier growth 17 himalayan glaciers extending across the mountain range were classified as glacier positive or glacier negative based on this classification we explained the potential factors that enable such behaviour glacier positive behaviour has been further explored as a function of temperature and precipitation in the karakoram himalayas at seasonal annual and decadal time scales to examine the significant trends that are responsible for its anomalous behaviour glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram has been compared with the rest of the region to examine a pan himalayan status quo of glacier accumulation ablation rates we submit that the karakoram anomaly does not exist in an isolated climatic bubble given the contemporary global climate and future projections it is not unlikely that the karakoram cryosphere may show a glacier negative pattern like the central or west himalayan glaciers if the current trends in warming ensue lastly as the iod affects the precipitation pattern for both glacier positive and glacier negative sites it would be unjust to treat the karakoram phenomenon as an isolated event i e an anomaly currently there is a substantial gap in knowledge of the hydroclimatic behaviour of the karakoram in spite of having over 100 years of climatic records from the region addressing this gap involves a multidisciplinary approach combining in situ measurements alongside remotely sensed environmental parameters and numerical and statistical modelling of existing records to evaluate a comprehensive profile of the karakoram systematics credit authorship contribution statement

2943,the anomalous behaviour of the karakoram glaciers has been a decade long discussion while a lot of effort has been given to understanding this phenomenon little has been explored with respect to the factors that govern glacier accumulation rates we performed a time series analysis of 17 himalayan glaciers to evaluate the accumulation index ai examine the ice accumulation ablation balance of each glacier and investigate the natural periodicities in regional climatic behaviour based on the ai the himalayan glaciers have been characterised as glacier positive and glacier negative glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram is favoured by global meteorological and local topographical factors analysis of 120 years of meteorological data shows a significant positive trend in winter and annual precipitation in the northwestern himalayas linked to surfacial warming and the indian ocean dipole while local factors such as slope aspect and supraglacial debris constrain summer ablation additionally the karakoram precipitation is periodic in nature demonstrating anti correlation with decadal scale precipitation records from the remaining himalayan glaciers both local and global factors explain the anomaly in the karakoram or the lack of it in other himalayan glaciers in a potentially warming planet glacial accumulation rates are becoming increasingly sensitive to ambient temperatures where glacier mass budget turns sharply negative at temperatures above 263 k due to accelerated summer ablation which overcompensates wintertime accumulation this makes the karakoram more sensitive to global meteorology than local factors therefore it is important to address whether the karakoram anomaly is an isolated climatic event or will it succumb to global climate change like the remainder of the himalayan glaciers keywords glacier mass balance wavelet analysis climate change indian summer monsoon mid latitude westerlies indian ocean dipole data availability all the data used is freely available in online servers the description links to which are provided in the manuscript 1 introduction anthropocene warming has affected the global climate extensively resulting in unpredictable precipitation regimes and accelerated cryospheric melt summerhayes and zalasiewicz 2018 under these circumstances the glaciers of the himalayan region are becoming increasingly vulnerable to maintain a balance between net ice accumulation and ablation bolch et al 2012 the glacial fed rivers originating across the himalayan mountain belt support close to 1 billion people residing in southeast asia with increasing awareness of climate change it is imperative for scientists and policymakers alike to assess the future of freshwater availability in this region modelling of snow and ice melting rates has gained large practical and scientific interest over the last few decades addressing the issues of freshwater security glacier dynamics and climate change change 2014 in this regard tracking the health of the himalayan glaciers becomes a tumultuous job for two reasons firstly the sheer number of glaciers from the region and the varying degree of information available on them from remote sensing or station data secondly calculating a glacier mass budget is fairly uncertain the earlier approach included changes in the glacier terminus and or moraine deposits from aerial photographs to track movement with time the accuracy of methods improved to include changes in surface elevation digital elevation models of the glacier and gps tracking to assist glacier mass budget other avenues of glacier mass budget estimation include remote sensing of snow products e g snow cover extent snow albedo snow depth and surface energy distribution in any assessment of glacier mass budget the change in shape size surface elevation and or the terminus position of the glacier is measured given the complex geometry of a glacier with its numerous projections debris covered surface moraine dammed edges and relief shaded zones it becomes virtually impossible to track its growth further an increase in glacier termini position or area may not always be synonymous with mass gain since ice accumulation may occur along any of the numerous projections of a glacier or simply increase the density of the existing ice strata in a similar vein glacier activity may not be synonymous with mass gain loss for example several studies have suggested that glacier activity such as surging need not be a consequence of mass gain loss bhambri et al 2017 glacier morphology represents net ice melt mass balance which in turn is a function of the contemporaneous hydrometeorological factors benn and evans 2014 given that there is a significant time lag between hydrometeorological and morphological change mehta et al 2014 it would be erroneous to interpret short term changes in glacier geometry as established climatologically induced irrevocable modification of glacier health besides barandun et al 2020 reported that a number of snow glacier monitoring techniques based on satellite reanalysis data and modelling are inadequate as they underestimate snow water equivalent and solid precipitation at higher altitudes both of which are absolutely essential parameters in glacier mass budget calculation palazzi et al 2013 and kanda et al 2020 noted the discrepancy in gridded satellite data that is used in climate modelling and prediction highlighting the biases associated with each remotely sensed dataset especially the interpolation uncertainty of the precipitation estimated by the gridded datasets cannot be totally overlooked in the sachen glacier of the western himalayas shroder et al 2000 observed negligible change in the position of the terminus despite up to 10 m thinning in numerous places in the glacier thus absolute measurements of a glacier inventory may not be the most accurate way to establish growth rather the temporal hydrometeorological change that is change in the net moisture input e g snowfall snowmelt along with temperature trends in a glacier catchment is more likely to represent the glacial mass budget accurately than the actual change in the dimension of glaciers for example the temporal variation in snowfall rates is directly linked to the glacier mass gain and therefore serves as a comprehensive and quantitative metric to classify glacier mass changes therefore a distinction needs to be made regarding the parameters which record the absolute health of a glacier in terms of mass gain and loss the karakoram glaciers have recorded a neutral to positive glacial mass budget over the recent decades farinotti et al 2020 dasgupta and sanyal 2019 forsythe et al 2017 gardelle et al 2012 hewitt 2005 when the majority of the himalayan glaciers are receding the stability advance of the karakoram glaciers has been established by measuring the surging activity in the glacier front quincey et al 2015 bhambri et al 2017 or by monitoring the glacial mass gain over time dehecq et al 2019 such glacier response has been attributed to the regional atmospheric circulation in the context of the relative positioning and intensity of the westerly jet forsythe et al 2017 and or due to the presence of local supraglacial debris scherler et al 2011 which inhibit the ablation rates in this region the bulk of the precipitation in the karakoram region comes from the mid latitude westerlies mlw in the winter and spring months which also happens to be the accumulation period for its glaciers kapnick et al 2014 in addition to an increasing precipitation trend over the last century treydte et al 2006 both accumulation and ablation rates in the karakoram are sustained due to the regional hydroclimatic pattern the winter precipitation is influenced by the western tibetan vortex li et al 2018 propelled by an increasing moisture flux from the irrigated fields of western india lee et al 2011 at the same time supraglacial debris scherler et al 2011 and cooler mid lower stratosphere and surface air temperatures during the summer months li et al 2018 have insulated the accumulated snowpack through the melting season kapnick et al 2014 several decades of positive feedback of the above processes are thought to have resulted in the karakoram glaciers gaining mass or remaining stable the studies listed above have proceeded to theorize and justify the expansion of the karakoram glaciers based on the assumption that the expansion is indeed a long term and statistically significant phenomenon and rightly so given that higher accumulation lower ablation rates summer cooling and strengthening of atmospheric circulation favour the anomaly in the karakoram however these hydrometeorological drivers are often dynamic changing several folds from season to season and decade to decade therefore an independent estimation of the glacier s health is required which integrates the hydrometeorological drivers and their temporal variations especially because recent trends of mass loss have already been reported in certain western karakoram glaciers muhammad and tian 2016 muhammad et al 2019 in this study a meteorological mass budget termed accumulation index ai has been formulated as a function of moisture budget and surface temperature trend to characterise the relative mass gain loss of 17 himalayan glaciers including the glaciers in the karakoram unlike absolute glacier measurements ai balances the incoming snowfall and outgoing snowmelt as a function of temperature during the growing and ablation period respectively in this process the annual potential for accumulation or melt for each of these glaciated sites is being estimated the meteorological model developed in this study provides a first hand analysis of the temporal variations in the moisture budget and temperature trend in 17 glaciated regions fig 1 across the himalayas mapped over 41 years the 17 sites have been selected to represent the following parts of the mountain range northwestern himalaya shigar boltoro siachen durinar and durung drong western himalaya chota shigri gangotri pindari and milam central himalaya annapurna kyimoshung ngozumba lhotse and khangchengyao and eastern himalaya kangphu bhumthang and bome based on the index the 17 regions have been categorised as glacier positive and glacier negative describing the rate of glacier growth investigation of the causes responsible for glacier positive behaviour has been carried out using long term meteorological datasets by applying wavelet periodicity analysis on precipitation and temperature records at each of the 17 sites harmonic fitting using the wavelet transformation of monthly continuous cru precipitation data 1901 2019 has revealed multiple periodicities in the precipitation records the advantage of this form of signal decomposition over others e g fourier transformation is that in wavelet analysis both the mode and domain of the frequencies are identifiable the occurrence of domain specific periodicities helps us decipher the temporal behaviour of precipitation in the 17 himalayan sites the natural periods observed in the cru precipitation dataset is further substantiated with tree ring δ18o precipitation reconstruction for the region additionally the precipitation pattern in the karakoram shows correlation and anti correlation with precipitation records from the other parts of the himalayas at various times scales suggesting the impact of ocean atmospheric teleconnections that influence the mlw and indian summer monsoon ism this pattern is synonymous with the long term changes in the intensity of both the ism and mlw and their centennial scale migration across the intertropical convergence zone itcz however the lack of long term in situ and spatially resolute meteorological records from the higher himalayas add uncertainty to any assessment of future climatic trends whether simulated or experimentally established glacial accumulation is not a direct outcome of mass and or dimensional change but a complex interplay between meteorological and topographical parameters in lieu of a warming planet anthropogenic or otherwise a departure from periodic behaviour in the natural variables is expected which raises the question of the karakoram predicament 2 materials and methods recent advancements in the mass budget estimation of glacier ice thickness include aerial photogrammetry using lidar and sondar waves emitted and received by specially designed sensors on manned unmanned flying vehicles sondar sensors are calibrated to measure the acoustics of longitudinal waves within an ice column the acquired images must be of sufficient scale to discern glacier margins from the surrounding terrain and should be taken late in the ablation season riedel and burrows 2005 however these methods are expensive time and labour intensive and survey only a small fraction of the mountain terrain at a time in this study we have simplified the mass budget of a glacier in terms of its meteorological parameters which are easily accessible from satellite agencies and can be error constrained with in situ data or other contemporary datasets a glacier will gain mass if it receives more moisture than it loses with environmental conditions to sustain its growth bolch et al 2012 hence we propose a meteorological mass budget of moisture gain and loss in a glaciated region to assess a glacier s health during the growth season snowfall sfg received within the topographic limits of a glacier is likely to be incorporated into its mass similarly snowmelt smlta in the ablation season results in glacier mass loss both sfg and smlta have been obtained from era5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present copernicus eu for each site at a monthly resolution the values have been georeferenced to cover each of the glaciated sites resampled onto a grid of 0 25 0 25 and averaged over their respective seasons in mm of water equivalent instead of m of water equivalent to reduce long form decimals see dasgupta et al 2021a dasgupta et al 2021b the temporal variation of both parameters is primarily affected by changes in the temperature snowfall and snowmelt have been compiled and averaged for the growth and ablation months here it is important to note that the growth ablation season is not uniform across the himalayas hence to obtain peak snowmelt and snowfall seasons the snowfall and snowmelt maxima periods months were identified for each year in each station long term temperature trend has been considered as the third parameter instead of seasonal variation in temperature as seasonal variations are incorporated in sfg and smlta values instead the long term trend allows us to evaluate the season to season hydrological flux balance in response to long term warming or cooling seasonal information would over amplify the effect of temperature change temperature trends were calculated across the entire dataset i e 41 12 months by performing mann kendall test for each station which yields the sen slope estimator of temperature 41 years all 3 parameters have been compiled from the copernicus climate change service climate data store cds repository using era5 hersbach et al 2020 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 thus the accumulation index is defined as the difference in snowfall and snowmelt for an annual precipitation cycle multiplied by the relative warming cooling witnessed by the glacier observed over 41 years ai sfg smlta ts mm year aggregated for 41 years 1 where ai accumulation index sfg growing season snowfall mm of water equivalent year smlta ablation season snowmelt mm of water equivalent year ts temperature trend calculated using sen slope estimator year the uncertainty in ai has been estimated individually for all 17 glaciers supplementary i the maximum uncertainty is within 15 in addition to the calculation of ai for the 17 himalayan glaciers based on 41 years of satellite reanalysis data from cds we compiled 118 years of meteorological station data from the climatic research unit cru ts 4 02 the meteorological time series data for individual locations have been extracted from the cru grids resampled at 0 25 x0 25 spatial resolution the reason behind choosing this resolution is that none of the glaciated zones exceeds that spatial range of 0 25 x0 25 grid averaged data for each of the 17 locations across 118 12 month slices were extracted from cru netcdf files on arcgis pro statistical analyses were performed thereafter on individual time series we examined the accuracy of both the gridded datasets era5 land reanalysis and cru era5 ensemble means were calculated for each of the study area grids giving an error range of 16 supplementary i additionally era5 monthly precipitation data show a good correlation with station observed data in the himalayan region capturing elevation and seasonal dependencies chen et al 2021 cru gauged and gridded data for all the sites have been validated against gpcc modelled and imd gauged and modelled does not cover sites falling in nepal and china the correlation scores between cru gpcc and cru imd that are significant r2 0 5 p 0 01 have been tabulated in supplementary i station data is mostly absent in the higher himalayas and all the sites are situated above 5 km altitude additionally there is a host of peer reviewed publications that have utilised cru gpcc data to analyse climate roxy et al 2015 basu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 monthly precipitation and temperature data in all 17 locations have been compiled to generate correlation matrices as monthly records are strongly influenced by seasonal oscillation a 12 point and 120 point moving average filter was applied through the data to absolve the seasonal perturbations the resultant data shows annual and decadal perturbations respectively within the karakoram region meteorological parameters have been analysed to reveal the natural periodicities of the variables which may be responsible for the increasing snowfall in the region as calculated by the accumulation index in this regard wavelet analysis has been performed on long term precipitation and temperature data the morlet continuous wavelet transform is evaluated to describe the dominant scale of periodicity to identify the major periodicities the wavelet power spectrum analysis for karakoram precipitation was carried out using a matlab wavelet script torrence and compo 1998 multiple periods were observed at multiple significance levels for monthly continuously cru data annual 12 point moving average monthly precipitation and winter precipitation data djfm months only wavelet spectra of precipitation records outside the karakoram region have been compiled in the supplementary section the occurrence and cause behind these periods have been discussed later 3 results and discussion ai for the 17 glaciated regions 0 25 x0 25 grids across the mountain belt is shown in fig 2 of the 17 locations 6 show positive values for ai and are hence categorised as glacier positive while the remaining 11 are termed glacier negative please note that positive ai may also arise from a negative mass flux sfg smlta and cooling temperature trend sen slope 0 and negative ai may also arise from positive mass flux sfg smlta and a cooling temperature trend sen slope 0 both scenarios are improbable in the himalayan region given the pan himalayan warming temperature trends and have been addressed in detail in supplementary i among the 6 glacier positive areas 3 lie within the karakoram belt shigar boltoro and siachen with significant accumulation indices and one each in sonmarg durinar kishtwar durung drong and lahaul chota shigri with lower values of ai it is important to note that ai does not reflect glacier mass budget it quantifies whether a given area has the hydrometeorological conditions favourable for glacier growth in the 6 glacier positive areas 40 3 11 8 and 45 5 15 0 of the annual precipitation is received during winter december march djfm and spring march may mam respectively sourced from the mlw 118 year average supplementary table 1 summer june september jjas precipitation sourced from the ism accounts for 75 5 6 4 of annual precipitation in the glacier negative areas but 6 of the annual precipitation in the northwestern himalayas 118 year average supplementary table 1 both seasonal and annual cru precipitation show increasing trends in the glacier positive regions while decreasing trends dominate in the rest of the study area surface temperatures have increased in all 17 locations from 1901 with steeper trends in central himalaya r 0 64 p 0 01 followed by the northwest r 0 52 p 0 13 east r 0 48 p 0 08 and west r 0 40 p 0 23 across all the glaciated regions the average winter temperature is negative whereas the average summer temperature is positive with the exception of lhotse compared to the west central and east himalayan glaciers mean winter and summer temperatures in the karakoram regions are approximately 10 k and 5 k lower respectively with the exception of boltoro and siachen in the karakoram and ngozumba in eastern himalaya all the glaciated regions have recorded an average positive spring and mean annual temperature in the 20th century 3 1 glacier positive behaviour a positive ai signifies that snow accumulation is greater than ablation and the rate of warming cooling is relatively less more among the 6 glacier positive regions snowfall in the growth period ranges 3 8 1 0 mm month whereas snowmelt in the ablation period ranges 2 0 1 5 mm month with a mean annual surface temperature of 263 1 6 4 k supplementary table 1 persistent higher snowfall rates and a negligible warming trend has ensured a positive meteorological mass budget over the last few decades as a result glaciers in these regions are prone to gain mass or remain stable the glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram region is supported by 3 independent testimonials 3 1 1 hydrometeorological evidence strengthening of mlw and weakening of ism northwestern himalaya receives the majority of the precipitation in the winter and spring months from the mlw dimri et al 2015 dasgupta et al 2022 which also happens to be the growing season for the glaciers thus the accumulated snowpack is buttressed by winter temperatures whereas for the remainder of the himalayan glaciers which are primarily fed by the ism the accumulation and ablation period overlap during the summer months as a result a significant portion of the accumulated snow does not sustain the warmer summer temperatures furthermore the precipitation snowfall in the karakoram himalaya is elevation independent and is being protected by lower energy conditions decreasing trend of surface upwelling shortwave and outgoing longwave to ensure a steady accumulation of the glacier mass dimri et al 2016 dimri 2021 in the northwestern parts summer cooling in the indo tibetan plateau farinotti et al 2020 impedes snowmelt in the ablation period intact snowfields further lower the surface temperatures due to higher snow ice albedo feedback the summer cooling mechanism is further accentuated by the weakening of the ism due to a decrease in the sensible heat flux cooler surface and tropospheric temperatures li et al 2018 from an increase in irrigation practices in the neighbouring region lee et al 2011 a combination of the above factors has driven a balanced glacier budget in the karakoram in recent decades however the hydrometeorological trends advocated by the aforementioned studies summarise decadal scale precipitation and temperature records which may not apply to glacier cycles which take centuries to occur therefore long term climatic patterns must be analysed from paleo proxy records to differentiate anomalies from natural phenomena 3 1 2 water isotope evidence tree ring and meteoric water δ18o values several independent studies on himalayan paleoclimate from tree ring δ18o precipitation reconstruction have reported centennial scale rainfall variability accompanied by contrasting hydroclimatic behaviour between the karakoram and western himalayas borgaonkar et al 1994 treydte et al 2006 managave et al 2020 treydte et al 2006 reported stronger hydrological conditions i e increasing seasonal and annual precipitation from lower δ18o values of tree rings in the karakoram region post 1850 ce warming of the planet and an increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere could be responsible for such an intensification of the hydrological cycle long term 1901 2018 precipitation records compiled from cru station data show a positive trend for the karakoram glaciers r 0 3 p 0 0001 if there is a greater moisture input the glaciers of northwestern himalayas are likely to receive it in the form of snowfall average elevation 5 km average temperature 263 k this should in principle lead to higher accumulation and or reduced ablation rates in the region the stable isotope composition of river water can be used to trace the relative contribution of glacier snowmelt in mountain hydrology kumar et al 2019 with increased accumulation reduced ablation the glacier melt contribution in the corresponding river network must decrease or remain constant manifested in the form of higher δ18o values of the river water the upper indus drainage basin surrounding the karakoram range showed an increase in the mean δ18o values of its stream water sampled between 1994 95 karim and veizer 2002 and 2007 08 rai et al 2016 however the stable isotope variation in glacier fed tributaries cannot be regarded as an absolute metric to gauge the temporal variation in glacier melt fraction as an increased melt is not synonymous with lower accumulation rates 3 1 3 geomorphic evidence elevation slope aspect and debris cover apart from regional meteorology there are local geomorphic factors that promote glacial health slope and aspect of glaciers debris cover and the elevation of the snow accretion zone actively control snow accumulation in a glaciated catchment the karakoram glaciers are larger than their central east and west himalayan counterparts nie et al 2021 and are located in high relief areas 5 km supplementary table 1 precipitation at this altitude is trapped due to the orographic confinement of the incoming moisture further a relatively higher geopotential height of condensation ensures that the entire moisture influx occurs as snowfall the mean slope of the karakoram glaciers 10 supplementary table 1 is considerably lower compared to the remaining areas of high mountain asia a gentle slope favours snow and ice accumulation over steeper slopes which intersect with the angle of repose and often lead to avalanching of the snow cover scherler et al 2011 additionally the mean direction of descent for the karakoram glaciers is sw supplementary table 1 which allows limited sunlight exposure in the summer months when the angle of zenith is 158 sse shorter daylight hours due to relief shading reduce the diurnal solar influx thereby impeding the rate of ablation debris cover and thickness on the glacier surface has been known to provide thermal insulation and reduce ablation mayer et al 2006 by returning most of the absorbed heat back to the atmosphere in the form of longwave and turbulent heat fluxes fugger et al 2021 several himalayan glaciers have a blanket of supraglacial debris ranging in size from dust to boulders eroded away from mountain slopes or from subglacial erosion at the ice bedrock interface nagai et al 2013 although the occurrence of the debris field is not limited to the karakoram region landslides and avalanches hewitt 2005 in this tectonically active terrain have invoked a steady supply of erosional detritus 3 2 glacier positive behaviour outside the karakoram region glacier positive behaviour has been observed outside the karakoram region as mentioned a positive ai only establishes the meteorological potential for glacial aggradation therefore it is difficult to ascertain the absolute glacier budget or accumulation unless local factors are understood durinar and durung drong glaciers lie in southwestern jammu and kashmir j k they receive winter precipitation primarily from mlw in the form of snowfall which contributes between 29 and 66 of the annual streamflow jeelani et al 2013 the glaciers in this region are marked by debris cover in the ablation zone the average winter and annual temperatures are 266 k and 275 k respectively supplementary table 1 a combination of the above factors could facilitate glacier growth in a similar fashion to that of the karakoram glaciers in eastern j k however studies have reported a negative mass budget in western j k 0 50 0 28 m yr vijay and braun 2018 unlike the karakoram glaciers surging behaviour is absent in durinar and durung drong although there is no theory to suggest that surging in glaciers results in a positive budget it can be logically deduced from the karakoram example several karakoram glaciers depict short to long term surging activity observed in recent years redistribution of ice and snow allows for a larger accumulation zone with the branching of the central glacier tongue into finger like projections within narrow valleys and or moraine dams as a result the glacier grows in mass however if glacier movement is limited the glaciers are more prone to thinning thawing and breakage additionally studies have measured a fluctuating mass balance trend from the region in spite of the net loss in the total glaciated area since 1962 pandey et al 2011 ghosh and pandey 2013 as it is difficult to conclude the state of a glacier s health from absolute measurements a meteorological mass budget provides a more reliable and simplistic estimate of the durinar and durung drong glaciers the chhota shigri glacier in lahaul is subjected to alternate precipitation regimes from ism and mlw winter precipitation is the primary source of snow accumulation with an average temperature of 257 k summer precipitation at higher reaches above the equilibrium line altitude is in the form of snowfall with a mean temperature of 275 k azam et al 2014 reported that the intensity of summer monsoon snowfall changes the albedo rates thereby impeding the snowmelt in ablation zones additionally there is shading and a partial debris cover in the ablation zones of this glacier conceding to lower terminus retreat srivastava et al 2022 despite the above factors chhota shigri has lost mass over the last few decades 0 30 0 36 m yr azam et al 2014 the absence of relief shading and a mean aspect of 270 west facilitates snow ablation in this region as a result the glaciers in the lahaul and spiti region have recorded a negative mass budget in spite of the meteorological conditions conducive for accumulation ai 0 gangotri glacier in uttarkashi has a complex mass budget with dichotomous interpretations on one hand a steep accumulation zone slope 10 the abundance of small sized glaciers 1 km2 summer time precipitation and warming over the last few decades all favour glacier retreat as reported in several studies bhambri et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2016 on the other hand the pre monsoon isotopic composition of the alaknanda and bhagirathi river water from this basin shows no 18o or 2h depletion trend to support glacier melting rates and increasing cryospheric contribution kumar et al 2019 boral et al 2019 suggested that the lowering of pre ism glacier melt contribution in both headwaters between 2014 and 2016 is caused by rain induced snowmelt time lag between glacier meltwater production and transport and seasonal snow cover variation furthermore the terminus region of gangotri is debris covered making it difficult to delineate the net glacier covered area and calculate areal changes from satellite imagery it is important to note that glacier positive behaviour has been observed north of the karakoram region in pamir and tien shan mountain ranges by several studies kääb et al 2015 kotlyakov et al 2020 lambrecht et al 2020 among the many reasons reported atmospheric circulation and local topography seem to be the common factor behind positive accumulation rates in both karakoram and pamir given the geographical proximity of the two regions a comprehensive report on glacier accumulation rates would be invaluable nonetheless falls outside the purview of the present study 3 3 glacier negative behaviour a negative ai signifies greater snow ablation than growth alongside warming trends in surface temperature among the 11 glacier negative regions snowfall in the growth period ranges 2 4 1 0 mm month whereas snowmelt in the ablation period ranges 3 5 1 5 mm month supplementary table 1 the surface temperature for the sample period ranges 270 6 6 6 k with a mean anomaly of 0 5 0 2 supplementary table 1 persistent lower snowfall and higher snowmelt rates accompanied by warmer temperatures have resulted in a negative meteorological mass budget over the last few decades as a result glaciers in these regions are prone to mass loss 3 4 central east and west himalayan glaciers the 11 glacier negative regions from this study spanning from the west to east himalaya witness higher ablation rates compared to accumulation this behaviour is partly the function of location and partly caused by global meteorology climate projections carried out for the early and late holocene by kumar et al 2020 suggest that the mlw dominated the precipitation in the northwestern himalayas with the ism dominating during the mid holocene summer precipitation sourced from the ism feeds these 11 glaciers as mentioned the overlap of the accumulation and ablation period prevents a higher accumulation of snow ice further the mean annual precipitation has reduced over the last century whereas the surface temperatures have increased particularly in the central himalayas fig 3 the eastward location of these glaciers allows only one moisture source i e the ism compared to the western glaciers which have a steady moisture input from both the mlw and the ism the more significant aspect of the ism which affects the glaciers in this region is the precipitation anomaly fig 4 the precipitation anomaly calculated for the peak season in the glacier negative parts of the himalayas is significantly higher jjas std dev 38 4 mm compared to the glacier positive parts mam std dev 15 5 mm djfm 12 2 mm in other words summer precipitation sourced from the ism is highly variable resulting in a non steady or sporadic supply of moisture to the higher himalayas in the form of snowfall in recent years several studies have attributed this behaviour to global meteorological controls such as the enso and iod schott et al 2009 yadav et al 2013 dimri and chevuturi 2016 basu et al 2020 in the following section we have explored and investigated the potential causes behind ism mlw variability in all the 17 sites at seasonal annual and decadal time scales 3 5 periodic nature of himalayan precipitation wavelet analysis of precipitation data from the himalayan region between 1901 and 2019 has identified multiple periodicities the monthly precipitation records are strongly influenced by intra annual periodicity due to the impact of the seasonal cycles in all 17 sites fig 6a application of a 12 and 120 point moving average filter on the data allows us to smoothen the curve to check for inter annual perturbations on annual and decadal time scales respectively inter annual records display 8 to 16 year periodicity fig 6b for all the locations lastly the winter precipitation records i e precipitation received in the djfm months sourced from the mlw exhibit long term periodicities in the karakoram himalaya fig 6c long term periodicity is largely absent in the west central and east himalayan glaciers the wavelet spectra for all the sites have been attached in the supplementary file 3 5 1 decadal scale periodicity implication for increasing precipitation in the karakoram despite being two different moisture transport systems the ism and mlw affect the hydroclimate of the himalayas in conjunction this can be observed in the long term datasets as well where each of the 17 locations in this study fed by ism mlw or both have shown mutual intercorrelation of precipitation values supplementary table 2 broadly the central west and east himalayan glaciers show a positive correlation i e they all experience an increase or decrease in annual seasonal precipitation in phase the exception lies in the karakoram glaciers which show anti correlation in other words the precipitation in the karakoram trend positive while the rest of the himalayas trend negative and vice versa the anti correlation is visible at seasonal and decadal time scales but not at the annual time scale fig 5 a seasonal anti correlation is expected as the karakoram region and the rest of the himalayas receive their predominant precipitation in alternating seasons from the mlw and the ism respectively however the decadal anti correlation would require a mechanism that affects the mlw and the ism inversely with a periodicity of 10 years periodicities in karakoram surface temperatures derived from tree ring temperature reconstruction have been reported by zafar et al 2016 which also happens to be out of phase with the rest of the himalayas a number of atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections affect the intensity and duration of the rainy season in the himalayas controlled by sea surface temperature sst differential heating of the landmass of asia and the indian ocean the existence of the himalayan ranges and the tibetan plateau the occurrence of heavy light snow over the tibetan plateau the existence and circulation of upper air jet streams in the troposphere etc prell and kutzbach 1992 these controlling factors are manifested in seasonal to multi annual climatic phenomena oscillations such as iod enso walker circulation southern annular mode etc schott et al 2009 in the indian ocean as well as pdo soi and nao elsewhere here the temporal variability in himalayan precipitation is concurrent with the impacts of ocean sst cycles such as the iod and enso however the correlation scores for iod are much stronger than that of enso as observed in the himalayan dataset supplementary ii in the forthcoming section we demonstrate the linkage between iod and himalayan precipitation followed by periodicity and correlational analysis of both metrics the indian ocean dipole iod is characterised by an irregular oscillation of sst between the eastern and western indian ocean saji et al 1999 the iod affects the strength of monsoons over the indian subcontinent with a negative phase corresponding to an increase in ism precipitation krishnamurthy and kirtman 2003 the intensity of the iod is represented by an anomalous sst gradient between the western equatorial indian ocean 50e 70e and 10s 10n and the southeastern equatorial indian ocean 90e 110e and 10s 0n termed the dipole mode index dmi during the negative or neutral phase of the iod dmi 0 the pacific warm waters reach the northwestern shores of australia moisture evaporated over this part of the indian ocean travels west and precipitates the cooler waters here sink below the warm surface layer while the westerly winds continue to push the warm pool eastwards forming a version of the walker circulation like the one formed in the central pacific the onset of the positive phase dmi 0 is triggered by the weakening of the westerly winds complemented by the strengthening of the easterly trades krishnamurthy and kirtman 2003 during this period of the iod the warm pool migrates westward the positive phase of the iod corresponds with higher precipitation in the karakoram range fig 5 which occurs when the westerly winds are weak and the warm pool is placed in the western indian ocean similarly the negative iod corresponds with higher precipitation over the ism dominated west central and east himalayas fig 5 also during which the westerlies are stronger the negative phase of the iod is driven by cooler than normal ssts in the western indian ocean arabian sea and warmer than normal ssts to the west of indonesia this configuration of sst gives the normal circulation a boost the negative phase of iod results in stronger ism observed as higher rainfall in ism dominated areas of the east central west himalayan arc the stronger circulation brings more consistent westerly winds southwards and a stronger convection of moisture in its path this pattern is consistent with la niña negative phase of enso the impact of iod on himalayan precipitation can be can be understood at the seasonal scale during the positive phase of iod the warm pool migrates to the western indian ocean this phenomenon can have two implications first the establishment of a warm pool in the western indian ocean and the subsequent transport of moisture evaporated from this region on account of a stronger trade winds during positive iod b low pressure over northwestern tibet due to the karakoram vortex forsythe et al 2017 and c establishment of moisture convergence due to a zonal dipole formed between the western and eastern part of the subcontinent behera and ratnam 2018 second studies have shown the southward migration of the itcz over the last several thousand years fallah et al 2017 tan et al 2019 potentially resulting from the perpetual strengthening of the mlw and or weakening of the ism burdanowitz et al 2021 observed a southward shift in the itcz from mid holocene onwards suggesting that the changes in the intensity and position of the ism were influenced by latitudinal insolation gradients on a decadal to multi decadal scale the iod himalayan precipitation relationship manifests in terms of ism vs mlw strengths extent of influence across the indian subcontinent decadal scale variability in the iod has been reported by several studies nakamura et al 2009 kayanne et al 2006 ashok et al 2004 in addition we performed periodicity analysis on the dmi scores 1870 2020 using morlet transformation after the removal of seasonal and annual frequencies the wavelet transformation yields a significant decadal scale periodicity concurrent with the 8 16 year periodicity observed in our dataset for the 17 himalayan sites supplementary iii and records significant correlation with the same i e dmi vs decadal scale himalayan precipitation fig 5b legend yellow furthermore the correlation coefficients in fig 5b exhibit an alternating effect the precipitation in the mlw dominated karakoram region is anti correlated with the precipitation in the ism dominated central west and east himalaya given that iod is strongly anti correlated with ism and ism vs mlw precipitation trends are inversely related one can infer the causality behind strengthening mlw and or weakening ism from changing iod over time based on this inference the strengthening mlw over the karakoram amount and number of rainy days is most likely the cause behind the increased glacier accumulation rates observed in this region 3 5 2 centennial scale periodicity implication for increasing precipitation in the karakoram treydte et al 2006 reconstructed the precipitation trends in the karakoram from tree ring δ18o values and observed a centennial scale variation in the precipitation pattern from the region the last observed period began at 1850 ce corresponding to the rising precipitation trend in the northwestern himalayas a closer look into this reconstructed normalised precipitation pattern shows a 200 year periodicity fig 6 d winter precipitation records in the karakoram region fed by the mlw exhibit long term periodicities of 128 256 years fig 6c the cru precipitation archive provides 120 years of data identifying periodicities 120 years from this sample may not be statistically significant thus the corresponding amplitudes of the global wavelet spectra at 128 and 256 lie outside the cone of influence unlike the continuous seasonal djfm precipitation records provided by cru the normalised precipitation scores provided by paleo reconstruction are expected to show a composite signal encapsulating seasonal annual and centennial scale climatic phenomena as a result the precipitation z score curve calculated by treydte et al 2006 departs from a regular periodic curve observed in this study which would have been the case if the tree rings were only nourished with wintertime moisture from the mlw together the tree ring precipitation reconstruction and the wavelet analysis of wintertime precipitation in the karakoram strongly suggest that a the precipitation in this region sourced from the mlw is periodic in nature and b there is an increasing trend in the precipitation post 1850 ce 3 6 the fate of himalayan glaciers oerlemans 1991 studied the ice energy budget in the climatic system and the response of glaciers to positive negative feedback mechanisms powered by solar insolation and suggested that glacier health is controlled by a complex interplay of climatic forcing such as topographical influences temperature fluctuations at the base of ice sheets and ice albedo feedback for greenland ice sheets and mountain glaciers surface temperatures act as the primary controller of mass balance it determines whether ice sheets are in a regime of net ablation or accumulation however the relationship between the two parameters is not linear ice accumulates initially as snow at mean annual temperatures of 263 k but rates of accumulation remain below 0 5 m of ice per year regardless of the temperature the mass balance turns sharply negative at temperatures above 263 k because ablation accelerates and overwhelms net accumulation the boundary between positive and negative mass balance is called the equilibrium line fig 7 a low latitude cryospheric regions such as the karakoram himalayas experience mean winter temperatures below 263 k relative warming observed in the last century has favoured an increase in moisture carrying capacity of the atmosphere wet snow precipitation which is denser than the much colder dry snow and melting refreezing of the snowpack all of which promote higher accumulation rates therefore the glaciers show a positive mass budget even though the ambient temperatures have risen as per oerlemans mass balance curve snow ice accumulation is optimal around 263 k soon after which the mass balance turns sharply negative and melting pursues here the increase in snow accumulation is not large enough to compensate for stronger melting the karakoram glaciers lie in the accumulation range of oerlemans ice mass balance curve tmean 256 2 k tmax 267 9 k while most of the himalayan glaciers are crossing over to the ablation range fig 7b temperature fluctuations of a few degrees would be sufficient to push the karakoram cryosphere into the ablation range and once ablation succeeds the accumulation rates it is unlikely that the glacier will revert back to the accumulation range over the last century the average summertime ablation period temperatures of boltoro and siachen have remained fairly constant therefore it is challenging to forecast the temperature trend in the current century especially because the climate of this region is affected by global atmospheric and ocean circulation paleoreconstruction studies from a wide range of proxies have reported relative warming across the himalayas meteorological modelling carried out by kapnick et al 2014 reported that warmer temperatures in the 21st century will not affect snowfall rates given the winter season dominant precipitation in the region and the geographic placement and height of these mountains although these studies have reported increased precipitation trends it is important to remember that precipitation at higher altitudes in a warmer climate will shift from snowfall to rainfall or a mix of both barandun et al 2020 observed that warming trends will increase the total annual precipitation in tian shen north of the karakoram range but decrease the fraction of solid precipitation high mountain hydrologies are usually sensitive to any perturbation in the temperature and precipitation patterns singh et al 2018 but whether this applies to the karakoram region is still a matter of debate therefore the glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram may not be an anomalous event in other words the karakoram cryosphere is yet to yield to the global climatic trends as it is being protected by its hydrometeorological benefactors namely a winter accumulation cycle b steady moisture supply from the mlw and c nugatory summer warming if and when the warming is sufficient to affect the snowfall snowmelt balance or winter precipitation is inadequate to sustain the accumulation rates the karakoram glaciers will become as vulnerable as their central east west himalayan counterparts in such a scenario local factors such as debris cover slope atmospheric vortices etc will concede to global climatic trends therefore it would be naive to consider that the karakoram phenomenon can exist outside the influence of global climate forcings 4 concluding remarks hydrometeorological variability directly impacts the ice mass balance in the himalayan glaciers in our study we have quantified the spatiotemporal change in hydrometeorological drivers namely growing season snowfall ablation season snowmelt and long term temperature trend to formulate the accumulation index the ai parameter measures the meteorological mass balance for a glaciated region and reports its potential for glacier growth 17 himalayan glaciers extending across the mountain range were classified as glacier positive or glacier negative based on this classification we explained the potential factors that enable such behaviour glacier positive behaviour has been further explored as a function of temperature and precipitation in the karakoram himalayas at seasonal annual and decadal time scales to examine the significant trends that are responsible for its anomalous behaviour glacier positive behaviour in the karakoram has been compared with the rest of the region to examine a pan himalayan status quo of glacier accumulation ablation rates we submit that the karakoram anomaly does not exist in an isolated climatic bubble given the contemporary global climate and future projections it is not unlikely that the karakoram cryosphere may show a glacier negative pattern like the central or west himalayan glaciers if the current trends in warming ensue lastly as the iod affects the precipitation pattern for both glacier positive and glacier negative sites it would be unjust to treat the karakoram phenomenon as an isolated event i e an anomaly currently there is a substantial gap in knowledge of the hydroclimatic behaviour of the karakoram in spite of having over 100 years of climatic records from the region addressing this gap involves a multidisciplinary approach combining in situ measurements alongside remotely sensed environmental parameters and numerical and statistical modelling of existing records to evaluate a comprehensive profile of the karakoram systematics credit authorship contribution statement

2944,green roofs grs are a type of blue green infrastructure growing in popularity due to their ability to provide numerous benefits designers and modelers of grs typically make the assumption that grs are homogeneous which means that for different roof areas and the same structural factors such as substrate depth and composition they have the same runoff per unit area based on this assumption the measured data from small scale grs in the laboratory can be applied to large grs in the field however this assumption of homogeneity has not been sufficiently verified to investigate this gap an outdoor experiment was carried out from april 25 to december 1 2021 thirty six grs were constructed following an orthogonal experimental design with four primary structural factors investigated i e substrate type st substrate depth sd plant richness pr and roof area ra rain and runoff data were recorded and n way anova was used to evaluate the impact of the structural factors results showed that there were no statistically significant interactions between the structural factors that affected the gr runoff the order of influence of the individual parameters determined by the f value statistical metric was sd ra st pr however substrate depth was the only structural factor which significantly affected the runoff per unit area of gr plant richness and substrate types showed no statistically significant effect on the gr runoff the results of this study indicate that the implicit assumption grs are homogeneous is acceptable keywords green roof field monitoring n way anova roof area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction green roofs grs have drawn growing global interest due to their multiple social as well as environmental benefits in the past decade shafique et al 2019 they provide a number of ecosystem services e g biodiversity support extension of hard roof life time reduction in stormwater runoff and noise improved building insulation and lowering of air temperatures however the extent of these benefits depends on the local context and design specifics getter and rowe 2006 oberndorfer et al 2007 lepp 2008 kolokotsa et al 2013 berardi et al 2014 francis and jensen 2017 important hydrological benefits of grs are the reduction in runoff and the shifting of the urban water balance to approach that of nature palla et al 2009 to estimate the costs and benefits of investment in grs a feasibility study report fsr should be completed before the project starts wideman 1990 farris 1996 david et al 2002 flanagan and jewell 2008 potts and ankrah 2008 mcleod 2021 the costs and benefits of grs investment items include but are not limited to the stormwater management capacity of a planned gr and the corresponding irrigation scheme amos et al 2018 shafique et al 2018 sabater et al 2003 in order to determine the feasibility of a gr we need to be able to accurately describe the hydrologic properties of grs there are two acceptable approaches based the measured data or based on a model measured data is expensive to collect due to the required time and equipment in addition for many buildings the feasibility of a gr needs to be completed before gr construction meaning no measured data can be referenced as a result in order to confirm the feasibility of a gr accurate modelling of the hydrological performance of grs is needed an accurate simulation of the hydrological processes of a gr requires not only a suitable model but also the structural factors and sufficient measured data for model calibration and validation many gr structural factors are used in modelling such as roof area substrate depth substrate materials and vegetation type these parameters help to provide an accurate representation of grs in the model however even careful assignment of parameters is not typically sufficient for accurate gr representation calibration and validation procedures are also necessary for accurate modelling and measured data are needed for these procedures the critical measured data are the runoff from the gr and the corresponding rainfall li et al 2014 zirkelbach and stoeckl 2015 cascone et al 2019 however there are rarely measured data from similarly designed grs that can be used for modelling furthermore there is always an implicit assumption grs are homogeneous i e the runoff per unit area of green roof will not be affected by the roof area more specifically grs which have different roof area and the same structural factors such as substrate depth substrate materials and vegetation type will have the same runoff per unit area this assumption that total runoff is equal with the runoff per unit area multiplied by the roof area underpins many physically based gr models simunek et al 1999 palla et al 2009 she and pang 2010 sun et al 2013 li et al 2015 xie and liu 2020 however to the authors knowledge there are no studies that have tested the common assumption of gr homogeneity numerous studies have focused on the other structural factors on stormwater runoff retention of grs these are listed in table 1 in this paper gr test plots were designed following an orthogonal experimental design with four primary factors being considered i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and roof area we applied a statistical approach based on n way analysis of variance anova to answer the following questions 1 is the runoff per unit area of green roof affected by the roof area ra 2 do different plant richness pr substrate type st and substrate depth sd have an effect on the runoff from grs 3 is there any interaction between the four factors that affects the runoff from grs 2 methods 2 1 field study sites and measurements the study period was 221 days in total from april 25 to december 1 2021 the grs were placed on a concrete or pvc base at the experiment grounds of the modern water conservancy demonstration area in zhejiang province china 30 31 48 n 119 58 11 99 e this region is located in a humid subtropical monsoon climate zone and is dominated by the hot rainy summers and warm humid winters the mean annual precipitation in the region was 1379 mm gr experimental groups were set on top of the management building of the demonstration area see fig 2 1 each gr experimental plot met the local requirements i e the china technical specification for roof greening db31 t 493 2010 the layers of the gr experimental plots from bottom to top are the following see fig 2 1 impermeable layer 4 mm thick asphalt waterproof roll 2 drainage layer 20 mm thick 5 mm diameter gravel the gr outlet is built in the middle of the drainage layer and connected by pipes with a diameter of 25 mm 3 filter layer t permeable geotextile density 250 g m3 4 substrate layer two substrate types and three substrate depths were selected for this experiment 5 vegetation layer two vegetation groups with different plant richness were selected for this experiment plant spacing is 5 10 cm weeds were removed regularly to prevent any form of competition with experimental plants the soil moisture and runoff were separately monitored and recorded in each experimental area each experimental group only set up an independent drain a tipping bucket runoff meter was set under drainage outlet the experimental group was set up on the experimental platform combined with metal support and pvc soil tray the drainage outlet was connected with pvc pipes and was connected directly to the upper part of the tipping bucket runoff meter see fig 3 the runoff volume of each gr was collected by a tipping bucket runoff gauge hobo rg3 m with an accuracy of 0 2 mm min there was a soil moisture monitor tzs gprs i sampled the soil moisture rainfall and temperature wind speed solar radiation were recorded using a hobo u30 weather station the study included thirty seven different gr plot configuration fig 1 due to site constraints a00 a12 were placed on pvc base while b01 c12 were placed on concrete base a00 with no vegetation and no substrate with only the pvc base was thus considered as a control plot the grs were designed following an orthogonal experimental design cabezas and comin 2010 sadeghi et al 2012 liu et al 2019 with four primary structural factors being varied i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and roof area table 2 considering the growth environment of plants and bearing capacity of the roof two mixture types of light weight media were used as the growing substrate sandy clay loam s1 loam s2 a small shovel was used to measure the proportions and blend the soil the soil thickness of extensive vegetated roofs can range from 50 to 150 mm kosareo and ries 2007 berndtsson 2010 intensive grs are normally used only on the most sturdy structures as this kind of gr is deep more than 15 cm thickness and can support deeper root vegetation ladani et al 2019 the soil thickness of intensive vegetated roofs defined 150 300 mm razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 according to the construction criterion of grs and the above references the substrate depth treatments were set to 5 cm 15 cm and 30 cm the vegetation layers were planted with two different vegetation groups the vegetation type in each group were as follows sedum alfredii hance emarginate stonecrop and imperata cylindrical in vegetation group v1 sedum alfredii hance emarginate stonecrop imperata cylindrical and chrysanthemum indicum in vegetation group v2 these species were selected according to their varying heights and they have been widely incorporated in local landscapes and green roof designs jim and peng 2012 plants of v1 and v2 were positioned in the substrate with same averaged density in this study the outer edge of each plot was designed 10 20 cm higher than the substrate surface and the plots were placed about 15 cm apart to prevent rainfall splashing and edge effects splashing from the grs was considered to be negligible because of the soft absorptive nature of the plant cover and spongy substrate material shen 2007 weeds were removed regularly to prevent any sort of competition with the plants 2 2 data analysis based on the measured data from orthogonal designs the five way anova was performed in spss 17 0 to statistically assess the influence and significance of four structural factors and one climate factor rainfall intensity ri on runoff discharge from the gr plots it should be noted that this study is an outdoor experiment and the rainfall intensity is uncontrollable in order to eliminate the influence of different rainfall intensities on the results it is necessary to test whether the intensity will affect the influence process of the four factors on runoff therefore it is necessary to test there is any interaction between the structural factors and intensity in statistics the five way anova is an extension of the one way anova using the f distribution that examines the influence of five different categorical independent variables on one continuous dependent variable the five way anova not only aims at assessing the main effect of each independent variable but also if there is any interaction between them fisher 1992 chung and zhong 2001 morrison 2005 warne 2014 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff quantity characteristic of green roofs in total 56 rainfall runoff events i e from april 25 to december 1 2021 were selected for analysis some of the equipment failed to work properly from may 23 to june 1 and from september 2 to september 9 2021 so all the data from that time period was omitted each event corresponds to a period of cumulative rainfall depths more than 2 mm separated by a dry interval of at least 6 h versini 2019 the characteristics of the rainfall events are presented in fig 4 the average event rainfall was 18 5 mm and the maximum event rainfall was 150 5 mm the minimum event rainfall was 2 9 mm and the median event rainfall was 10 9 mm the average rainfall duration was 13 8 h the maximum was 113 8 h the minimum was 1 8 h and the median was 10 3 h the average ri was 0 029 mm min and the maximum ri was 0 137 mm min the minimum ri was 0 005 mm min and the median ri was 0 022 mm min in order to test there is any interaction between the structural factors and ri the rainfall intensities were divided into two groups the low intensity lri and high intensity hri i e low and high intensity rainfall accounting for half of the total rainfall events the runoff ratio runoff divided by the amount of rainfall for the corresponding event statistics of all groups are shown in table 3 overall the observed runoff ratio for these grs ranged between 0 09 and 0 89 with an average value of 0 5 median value of 0 49 the observed runoff ratio for the conventional rooftop a00 ranged between 0 57 and 0 91 with an average value of 0 77 median value of 0 73 these results of grs are noticeably different from a00 due to different vegetation substrate depth and types the observed runoff ratio of a00 have a smaller range of variation 0 57 0 91 and the maximum minimum median and mean values are larger than grs 3 2 assumptions test of the anova following gelman and hill the assumptions of the anova and more generally the general linear model are in decreasing order of importance gelman and hill 2006 1 the data points are relevant with respect to the scientific question under investigation 2 the errors are independent that is there are independent observations 3 the dependent variable must be approximately normally distributed in any classification of independent variables 4 the errors have the same variance that is the dependent variable has equal variance in any classification of independent variables assumption 1 is a hypothesis for experimental design requiring researchers to make judgments based on the research design it is self evident that this study conforms to assumption 1 as for assumption 2 there is only one observed parameter in this paper that is the continuous dependent variable runoff or continuous variable and the rest are independent variables or discrete variables i e roof area substrate depth substrate types and plant types therefore the data in this study meets this second assumption to test assumption 3 the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk test were applied in the results in table 4 the p value shows that the unit area runoff doesn t fit the normal distribution the normal scores method applied using spss was used to achieve a normal transformation the test results after transformation are shown in table 4 according to the output tests of normality table kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk test p values were 0 200 and 1 000 respectively both greater than 0 05 indicating that unit area runoff obeyed normal distribution after transformation as for assumption 4 the levene variance homogeneity test provided by spss was used for testing in the results in table 5 the p value of levene s homogeneity of variance test is 0 999 greater than 0 05 that is the dependent variables in any classification of independent variables are equivariant which satisfies assumption 4 to summarize the data used in this study can meet the four assumptions of using anova after testing and transformation 3 3 five way anova of unit area runoff discharge for green roofs the statistical results of the five way anova of unit area runoff are shown in table 6 firstly the influence of interaction of the five factors on unit area runoff is judged f 4 1908 0 006 p 1 000 greater than 0 05 which means that the interaction of the five factors has no effect on unit area runoff or the effect was not statistically significant in addition the judgment of the interaction influence of free combination of ri and structural factors on unit area runoff determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value but the p value are all greater than 0 05 table 6 which means that the effect was not statistically significant the ri will not affect the influence process of the four factors on runoff however the p value of single ri is 0 000 which less than 0 05 which means that the effect of ri was statistically significant according to table 6 the influence of interaction of the four structural factors on unit area runoff is judged f 4 1908 0 201 p 0 938 greater than 0 05 which means that the interaction of the four factors has no effect on unit area runoff or the effect was not statistically significant secondly the judgment of the influence of free combination of three of the four factors on unit area runoff the order of influence of the influence of three factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was ra sd pr ra st pr sd st pr ra sd st but the p value are 0 642 0 408 0 971 and 0 907 and all of them are greater than 0 05 which means that the effect was not statistically significant thirdly the judgment of the influence of free combination of two of the four factors on unit area runoff the order of influence of the influence of two factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was ra st ra pr ra sd sd st st pr sd pr the p value are 0 517 0 528 0 768 0 715 0 577 and 0 916 and all of them are greater than 0 05 which means that the interaction was not statistically significant finally and most importantly the influence analysis of the four structural factors on unit area runoff alone the order of influence of the influence of single factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was sd ra pr st the p value are 0 000 0 722 0 729 and 0 861 the p value of sd is less than 0 05 which means that the effect of sd was statistically significant the p value of st and pr are greater than 0 05 which means that the effect was not statistically significant most importantly the p value of ra is 0 722 which is greater than 0 05 which means that ra has an effect on unit area runoff but this effect is not statistically significant this means that the implicit assumption the runoff per unit area of gr will be affected by the ra is acceptable statistically 3 4 runoff affected by roof area in this study a major focus was to investigate whether the runoff per unit area of gr will be affected by the ra the results found that unit area runoff will be affected by the ra however this effect is not statistically significant as shown in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 5 a where the mean runoff ratio of three ra are 0 50 0 49 and 0 48 the median value are 0 55 0 48 and 0 48 it can be seen from fig 5 that runoff ratio decreases slightly with the increase of area which means that when large scale grs is built the actual runoff ratio may be slightly smaller than the runoff ratio predicted by the model that is the rainwater retention capacity of large scale grs will be slightly larger than the model result this subtle difference can influence the choice of plants and the design of irrigation schemes affecting investment and returns 3 5 runoff affected by vegetation in this study two different vegetation richness used to design the experiments the results found that there were no statistically significant differences between the vegetation types of v1 and v2 in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 5 b the fig 5 b shows that the boxplots of v1 and v2 are very close the reason why is only difference being that v2 adds vegetation chrysanthemum indicum and the other three are the same while the number and spacing of plants is the same the mean runoff ratios of v1 is 0 49 and 0 48 of v2 while the median value of v1 is 0 52 0 50 of v2 3 6 runoff affected by substrate types in this study two different substrate types were used to design the experiments the results found that there were no statistically significant differences between the st of s1 and s2 in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 5 c the fig 5 c shows that the boxplots of s1 and s2 are very close the only difference between s1 and s2 is that they lie in a different ratio of turfy soil in rural soil so it is reasonable that the boxplots are very close the mean runoff ratio of s1 is 0 490 and 0 495 of s2 the median value of s1 is 0 483 and 0 526 of s2 3 7 runoff affected by substrate depth in this study three different substrate depths used to design the experiments the results showed that the substrate depths is the only factor which not only affected the runoff per unit area of gr and were statistically significant in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 5 d the fig 5 d shows that the boxplots of three depths are very different the mean runoff ratio of three depths are 0 64 0 50 and 0 33 the median value of three depths are 0 65 0 52 and 0 34 3 8 runoff affected by rainfall intensity in this study two different rainfall intensities used to design the experiments the results showed that the rainfall intensities not only affected the runoff per unit area of gr and were statistically significant in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 6 the fig 6 shows that the boxplots of three depths are very different the mean runoff ratio of two intensities are 0 493 and 0 487 the median value of two intensities are 0 489 and 0 488 4 discussion 4 1 overall runoff retention performance the runoff ratio of conventional roof a00 in this study was between 0 57 and 0 91 the average runoff ratio grs groups was between 0 27 and 0 71 table 3 in these results grs were shown to effectively retain stormwater runoff the range of runoff ratio in this study is much wider than some previous studies have shown for example stovin et al 2013 reported a total retention performance of 30 for significant rain events speak et al 2013 reported 39 4 retention 22 1 of 56 1 mm while monitoring a intensive roof carter and rasmussen 2006 and vanwoert et al 2005 have reported gr runoff retention of more than 50 a possible reason for these discrepancies is the fact that our outdoor experiments experienced a wider range of rainfall events where the average rainfall was 18 5 mm the maximum rainfall was 150 5 mm the minimum rainfall was 2 9 mm and the median rainfall is 10 9 mm the wider range of runoff ratio in this study concurs with the results of mentens et al 2006 who analyzed the original measurements reported in 18 publications and found that the runoff ratio is mainly determined by the roof type and may be as high as 0 8 for an extensive roof and as low as 0 15 for an intensive green roof 4 2 structural factors affecting retention capacity of green roofs based on the experiment results this study indicated that among the studied structural factors the substrate depth exerts a major influence on gr stormwater retention this result concurs with a number of studies that agree that it is the substrate depth that has a major influence on green roof water retention capacity vanwoert et al 2005 dunnett and kingsbury 2008 berndtsson 2010 however it contradicts their other conclusion that substrate composition also has a major influence on green roof water retention capacity vanwoert et al 2005 dunnett and kingsbury 2008 berndtsson 2010 stovin et al 2012 a possible reason for this is the fact that this study was not specifically designed to study the influence of substrate components on gr hydrological process although two substrates were designed in this study they were only designed to increase the experimental group and reduce the influence of other structural factors on verifying the implicit assumption grs are homogeneous the only difference between s1 and s2 is that they contain a different mixing ratio in addition none of the current studies

be noted that this paper deals with the question of plant richness rather than with the question of different plant species two plant combinations v1 and v2 were considered in this paper the difference between them is that the richness of v2 is one more than v1 i e it adds chrysanthemum indicum however the plant density was the same the result of this paper that plant richness has no significant influences on the runoff retention of green roofs is same as the conclusion of nagase and dunnett 2012 unfortunately there are almost no grs experimental studies considering the roof area

2944,green roofs grs are a type of blue green infrastructure growing in popularity due to their ability to provide numerous benefits designers and modelers of grs typically make the assumption that grs are homogeneous which means that for different roof areas and the same structural factors such as substrate depth and composition they have the same runoff per unit area based on this assumption the measured data from small scale grs in the laboratory can be applied to large grs in the field however this assumption of homogeneity has not been sufficiently verified to investigate this gap an outdoor experiment was carried out from april 25 to december 1 2021 thirty six grs were constructed following an orthogonal experimental design with four primary structural factors investigated i e substrate type st substrate depth sd plant richness pr and roof area ra rain and runoff data were recorded and n way anova was used to evaluate the impact of the structural factors results showed that there were no statistically significant interactions between the structural factors that affected the gr runoff the order of influence of the individual parameters determined by the f value statistical metric was sd ra st pr however substrate depth was the only structural factor which significantly affected the runoff per unit area of gr plant richness and substrate types showed no statistically significant effect on the gr runoff the results of this study indicate that the implicit assumption grs are homogeneous is acceptable keywords green roof field monitoring n way anova roof area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction green roofs grs have drawn growing global interest due to their multiple social as well as environmental benefits in the past decade shafique et al 2019 they provide a number of ecosystem services e g biodiversity support extension of hard roof life time reduction in stormwater runoff and noise improved building insulation and lowering of air temperatures however the extent of these benefits depends on the local context and design specifics getter and rowe 2006 oberndorfer et al 2007 lepp 2008 kolokotsa et al 2013 berardi et al 2014 francis and jensen 2017 important hydrological benefits of grs are the reduction in runoff and the shifting of the urban water balance to approach that of nature palla et al 2009 to estimate the costs and benefits of investment in grs a feasibility study report fsr should be completed before the project starts wideman 1990 farris 1996 david et al 2002 flanagan and jewell 2008 potts and ankrah 2008 mcleod 2021 the costs and benefits of grs investment items include but are not limited to the stormwater management capacity of a planned gr and the corresponding irrigation scheme amos et al 2018 shafique et al 2018 sabater et al 2003 in order to determine the feasibility of a gr we need to be able to accurately describe the hydrologic properties of grs there are two acceptable approaches based the measured data or based on a model measured data is expensive to collect due to the required time and equipment in addition for many buildings the feasibility of a gr needs to be completed before gr construction meaning no measured data can be referenced as a result in order to confirm the feasibility of a gr accurate modelling of the hydrological performance of grs is needed an accurate simulation of the hydrological processes of a gr requires not only a suitable model but also the structural factors and sufficient measured data for model calibration and validation many gr structural factors are used in modelling such as roof area substrate depth substrate materials and vegetation type these parameters help to provide an accurate representation of grs in the model however even careful assignment of parameters is not typically sufficient for accurate gr representation calibration and validation procedures are also necessary for accurate modelling and measured data are needed for these procedures the critical measured data are the runoff from the gr and the corresponding rainfall li et al 2014 zirkelbach and stoeckl 2015 cascone et al 2019 however there are rarely measured data from similarly designed grs that can be used for modelling furthermore there is always an implicit assumption grs are homogeneous i e the runoff per unit area of green roof will not be affected by the roof area more specifically grs which have different roof area and the same structural factors such as substrate depth substrate materials and vegetation type will have the same runoff per unit area this assumption that total runoff is equal with the runoff per unit area multiplied by the roof area underpins many physically based gr models simunek et al 1999 palla et al 2009 she and pang 2010 sun et al 2013 li et al 2015 xie and liu 2020 however to the authors knowledge there are no studies that have tested the common assumption of gr homogeneity numerous studies have focused on the other structural factors on stormwater runoff retention of grs these are listed in table 1 in this paper gr test plots were designed following an orthogonal experimental design with four primary factors being considered i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and roof area we applied a statistical approach based on n way analysis of variance anova to answer the following questions 1 is the runoff per unit area of green roof affected by the roof area ra 2 do different plant richness pr substrate type st and substrate depth sd have an effect on the runoff from grs 3 is there any interaction between the four factors that affects the runoff from grs 2 methods 2 1 field study sites and measurements the study period was 221 days in total from april 25 to december 1 2021 the grs were placed on a concrete or pvc base at the experiment grounds of the modern water conservancy demonstration area in zhejiang province china 30 31 48 n 119 58 11 99 e this region is located in a humid subtropical monsoon climate zone and is dominated by the hot rainy summers and warm humid winters the mean annual precipitation in the region was 1379 mm gr experimental groups were set on top of the management building of the demonstration area see fig 2 1 each gr experimental plot met the local requirements i e the china technical specification for roof greening db31 t 493 2010 the layers of the gr experimental plots from bottom to top are the following see fig 2 1 impermeable layer 4 mm thick asphalt waterproof roll 2 drainage layer 20 mm thick 5 mm diameter gravel the gr outlet is built in the middle of the drainage layer and connected by pipes with a diameter of 25 mm 3 filter layer t permeable geotextile density 250 g m3 4 substrate layer two substrate types and three substrate depths were selected for this experiment 5 vegetation layer two vegetation groups with different plant richness were selected for this experiment plant spacing is 5 10 cm weeds were removed regularly to prevent any form of competition with experimental plants the soil moisture and runoff were separately monitored and recorded in each experimental area each experimental group only set up an independent drain a tipping bucket runoff meter was set under drainage outlet the experimental group was set up on the experimental platform combined with metal support and pvc soil tray the drainage outlet was connected with pvc pipes and was connected directly to the upper part of the tipping bucket runoff meter see fig 3 the runoff volume of each gr was collected by a tipping bucket runoff gauge hobo rg3 m with an accuracy of 0 2 mm min there was a soil moisture monitor tzs gprs i sampled the soil moisture rainfall and temperature wind speed solar radiation were recorded using a hobo u30 weather station the study included thirty seven different gr plot configuration fig 1 due to site constraints a00 a12 were placed on pvc base while b01 c12 were placed on concrete base a00 with no vegetation and no substrate with only the pvc base was thus considered as a control plot the grs were designed following an orthogonal experimental design cabezas and comin 2010 sadeghi et al 2012 liu et al 2019 with four primary structural factors being varied i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and roof area table 2 considering the growth environment of plants and bearing capacity of the roof two mixture types of light weight media were used as the growing substrate sandy clay loam s1 loam s2 a small shovel was used to measure the proportions and blend the soil the soil thickness of extensive vegetated roofs can range from 50 to 150 mm kosareo and ries 2007 berndtsson 2010 intensive grs are normally used only on the most sturdy structures as this kind of gr is deep more than 15 cm thickness and can support deeper root vegetation ladani et al 2019 the soil thickness of intensive vegetated roofs defined 150 300 mm razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 according to the construction criterion of grs and the above references the substrate depth treatments were set to 5 cm 15 cm and 30 cm the vegetation layers were planted with two different vegetation groups the vegetation type in each group were as follows sedum alfredii hance emarginate stonecrop and imperata cylindrical in vegetation group v1 sedum alfredii hance emarginate stonecrop imperata cylindrical and chrysanthemum indicum in vegetation group v2 these species were selected according to their varying heights and they have been widely incorporated in local landscapes and green roof designs jim and peng 2012 plants of v1 and v2 were positioned in the substrate with same averaged density in this study the outer edge of each plot was designed 10 20 cm higher than the substrate surface and the plots were placed about 15 cm apart to prevent rainfall splashing and edge effects splashing from the grs was considered to be negligible because of the soft absorptive nature of the plant cover and spongy substrate material shen 2007 weeds were removed regularly to prevent any sort of competition with the plants 2 2 data analysis based on the measured data from orthogonal designs the five way anova was performed in spss 17 0 to statistically assess the influence and significance of four structural factors and one climate factor rainfall intensity ri on runoff discharge from the gr plots it should be noted that this study is an outdoor experiment and the rainfall intensity is uncontrollable in order to eliminate the influence of different rainfall intensities on the results it is necessary to test whether the intensity will affect the influence process of the four factors on runoff therefore it is necessary to test there is any interaction between the structural factors and intensity in statistics the five way anova is an extension of the one way anova using the f distribution that examines the influence of five different categorical independent variables on one continuous dependent variable the five way anova not only aims at assessing the main effect of each independent variable but also if there is any interaction between them fisher 1992 chung and zhong 2001 morrison 2005 warne 2014 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff quantity characteristic of green roofs in total 56 rainfall runoff events i e from april 25 to december 1 2021 were selected for analysis some of the equipment failed to work properly from may 23 to june 1 and from september 2 to september 9 2021 so all the data from that time period was omitted each event corresponds to a period of cumulative rainfall depths more than 2 mm separated by a dry interval of at least 6 h versini 2019 the characteristics of the rainfall events are presented in fig 4 the average event rainfall was 18 5 mm and the maximum event rainfall was 150 5 mm the minimum event rainfall was 2 9 mm and the median event rainfall was 10 9 mm the average rainfall duration was 13 8 h the maximum was 113 8 h the minimum was 1 8 h and the median was 10 3 h the average ri was 0 029 mm min and the maximum ri was 0 137 mm min the minimum ri was 0 005 mm min and the median ri was 0 022 mm min in order to test there is any interaction between the structural factors and ri the rainfall intensities were divided into two groups the low intensity lri and high intensity hri i e low and high intensity rainfall accounting for half of the total rainfall events the runoff ratio runoff divided by the amount of rainfall for the corresponding event statistics of all groups are shown in table 3 overall the observed runoff ratio for these grs ranged between 0 09 and 0 89 with an average value of 0 5 median value of 0 49 the observed runoff ratio for the conventional rooftop a00 ranged between 0 57 and 0 91 with an average value of 0 77 median value of 0 73 these results of grs are noticeably different from a00 due to different vegetation substrate depth and types the observed runoff ratio of a00 have a smaller range of variation 0 57 0 91 and the maximum minimum median and mean values are larger than grs 3 2 assumptions test of the anova following gelman and hill the assumptions of the anova and more generally the general linear model are in decreasing order of importance gelman and hill 2006 1 the data points are relevant with respect to the scientific question under investigation 2 the errors are independent that is there are independent observations 3 the dependent variable must be approximately normally distributed in any classification of independent variables 4 the errors have the same variance that is the dependent variable has equal variance in any classification of independent variables assumption 1 is a hypothesis for experimental design requiring researchers to make judgments based on the research design it is self evident that this study conforms to assumption 1 as for assumption 2 there is only one observed parameter in this paper that is the continuous dependent variable runoff or continuous variable and the rest are independent variables or discrete variables i e roof area substrate depth substrate types and plant types therefore the data in this study meets this second assumption to test assumption 3 the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk test were applied in the results in table 4 the p value shows that the unit area runoff doesn t fit the normal distribution the normal scores method applied using spss was used to achieve a normal transformation the test results after transformation are shown in table 4 according to the output tests of normality table kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk test p values were 0 200 and 1 000 respectively both greater than 0 05 indicating that unit area runoff obeyed normal distribution after transformation as for assumption 4 the levene variance homogeneity test provided by spss was used for testing in the results in table 5 the p value of levene s homogeneity of variance test is 0 999 greater than 0 05 that is the dependent variables in any classification of independent variables are equivariant which satisfies assumption 4 to summarize the data used in this study can meet the four assumptions of using anova after testing and transformation 3 3 five way anova of unit area runoff discharge for green roofs the statistical results of the five way anova of unit area runoff are shown in table 6 firstly the influence of interaction of the five factors on unit area runoff is judged f 4 1908 0 006 p 1 000 greater than 0 05 which means that the interaction of the five factors has no effect on unit area runoff or the effect was not statistically significant in addition the judgment of the interaction influence of free combination of ri and structural factors on unit area runoff determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value but the p value are all greater than 0 05 table 6 which means that the effect was not statistically significant the ri will not affect the influence process of the four factors on runoff however the p value of single ri is 0 000 which less than 0 05 which means that the effect of ri was statistically significant according to table 6 the influence of interaction of the four structural factors on unit area runoff is judged f 4 1908 0 201 p 0 938 greater than 0 05 which means that the interaction of the four factors has no effect on unit area runoff or the effect was not statistically significant secondly the judgment of the influence of free combination of three of the four factors on unit area runoff the order of influence of the influence of three factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was ra sd pr ra st pr sd st pr ra sd st but the p value are 0 642 0 408 0 971 and 0 907 and all of them are greater than 0 05 which means that the effect was not statistically significant thirdly the judgment of the influence of free combination of two of the four factors on unit area runoff the order of influence of the influence of two factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was ra st ra pr ra sd sd st st pr sd pr the p value are 0 517 0 528 0 768 0 715 0 577 and 0 916 and all of them are greater than 0 05 which means that the interaction was not statistically significant finally and most importantly the influence analysis of the four structural factors on unit area runoff alone the order of influence of the influence of single factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was sd ra pr st the p value are 0 000 0 722 0 729 and 0 861 the p value of sd is less than 0 05 which means that the effect of sd was statistically significant the p value of st and pr are greater than 0 05 which means that the effect was not statistically significant most importantly the p value of ra is 0 722 which is greater than 0 05 which means that ra has an effect on unit area runoff but this effect is not statistically significant this means that the implicit assumption the runoff per unit area of gr will be affected by the ra is acceptable statistically 3 4 runoff affected by roof area in this study a major focus was to investigate whether the runoff per unit area of gr will be affected by the ra the results found that unit area runoff will be affected by the ra however this effect is not statistically significant as shown in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 5 a where the mean runoff ratio of three ra are 0 50 0 49 and 0 48 the median value are 0 55 0 48 and 0 48 it can be seen from fig 5 that runoff ratio decreases slightly with the increase of area which means that when large scale grs is built the actual runoff ratio may be slightly smaller than the runoff ratio predicted by the model that is the rainwater retention capacity of large scale grs will be slightly larger than the model result this subtle difference can influence the choice of plants and the design of irrigation schemes affecting investment and returns 3 5 runoff affected by vegetation in this study two different vegetation richness used to design the experiments the results found that there were no statistically significant differences between the vegetation types of v1 and v2 in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 5 b the fig 5 b shows that the boxplots of v1 and v2 are very close the reason why is only difference being that v2 adds vegetation chrysanthemum indicum and the other three are the same while the number and spacing of plants is the same the mean runoff ratios of v1 is 0 49 and 0 48 of v2 while the median value of v1 is 0 52 0 50 of v2 3 6 runoff affected by substrate types in this study two different substrate types were used to design the experiments the results found that there were no statistically significant differences between the st of s1 and s2 in table 6 this result is also supported by the fig 5 c the fig 5
