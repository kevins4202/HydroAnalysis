8415,study focus future climate impacts on streamflow are of critical concern due to its importance for water and energy supplies however rigorous studies of such impacts involve complicated modeling chains that can be time consuming and costly to implement we examine an alternative approach by developing a method to predict the 21st century peak march may mam streamflow response to warming from historical data alone specifically past observations of the snow to precipitation ratio divided by basin area spa study region using the colorado river basin crb as a proving ground we test this empirical relationship over 23 basins ranging in size from 9728 to 639 806 km2 within the crb data was derived from hydrology model simulations forced by a suite of climate models run under two

snow rain 1 4 10 3 to 3 10 3 km 2 and snow dominant 3 10 3 km 2 the most dramatic changes occurred in snow dominant basins where streamflow increased up to 320 in mam but decreased by up to 60 in the critical high demand months of july september jas by quantifying the relationship between historical data and future streamflow projections our findings suggest this empirical relationship is useful to quickly and cheaply determine where and when large changes in hydrology will occur from future warming keywords streamflow forecasting snow climate variability modeling water resources management 1 introduction stationarity in 21st century terrestrial hydrology is believed obsolete due to the multitude of climate induced changes expected to occur in the coming decades milly et al 2008 diffenbaugh et al 2019 best 2019 as a general rule for streamflow under 2 c warming low latitude areas are anticipated to get wetter by up to 50 annually whereas regions residing in more moderate latitudes are anticipated to get drier by up to 50 annually schewe et al 2014 areas expecting to undergo the greatest change include northern and southern africa southern north and south america and southern europe and asia as well as southwest australia in these regions reductions of renewable water resources by over 20 are particularly widespread these changes are also anticipated to impact energy supplies through shifts in water availability for hydropower generation or thermoelectric power needs e g van vliet et al 2016 the snow and ice of continental water towers such as the himalayas andes rockies and alps are a crucial water and energy resource and may be particularly susceptible to climate changes also climate change will likely induce geographically heterogeneous shifts in energy demand for example in western canada wintertime heating demands are expected to decrease whereas in the us southwest summer cooling demands will likely increase further magnifying the impacts of potential changes in hydroelectric power availability bureau of reclamation 2011 fleming and weber 2012 within the colorado river basin crb increasingly severe energy shortages may be experienced by the end of the 21st century reflecting decreases in annual streamflow by up to 21 due to climate change and climate induced vegetation disturbances christensen and lettenmaier 2007 bennett et al 2017 there is also evidence that that warmer temperatures are playing an increasingly large role in streamflow decreases through enhanced levels of evapotranspiration udall et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 however the magnitude and even direction of change is not the same among climate models due to uncertainties related to the internal variability of the climate system future emissions scenarios and climate model physics deser et al 2012 steinschneider et al 2012 in addition these changes are not expected to be spatially or temporally uniform for all basins or seasons harding et al 2012 given the prognosis of and variability in such changes it is imperative that a region specific understanding is developed on the magnitude and direction of streamflow changes over different temporal scales this understanding is essential to determine the impacts on the energy water nexus and corresponding effects on local regional and even international economies associated with water and energy transfers across seven us states and mexico that depend on water from the colorado river basin crb christensen et al 2004 anticipated changes of streamflow at the annual scale are strongly linked to projected shifts in precipitation across large scale river basins harding et al 2012 however uncertainties in precipitation driven streamflow changes are apparent particularly for mountainous regions and smaller basins often resulting in decreased confidence in future estimates for these areas biemans et al 2009 bennett et al 2012 seasonally although changes in the volume of precipitation remain a contributing factor to streamflow shifts changes in streamflow have also been strongly linked to other phenomena for example in regions where snow accounts for a major component of the annual water budget temperature driven changes including precipitation phase changes shifts in snowmelt and increased frequency of rain on snow events have all been identified as major contributors of seasonal or monthly streamflow changes adam et al 2009 hidalgo et al 2009 clow 2010 das et al 2011 berghuijs et al 2014 klos et al 2014 vano et al 2015 solander et al 2017 thus changes in the timing and magnitude of seasonal streamflow patterns are closely linked to the expected changes in snowpack moreover given the magnitude of these seasonal shifts combined with the sensitivity of resource management and planning to seasonal cycles and changes in those patterns barnett et al 2005 increased emphasis should be made on the nature of seasonal streamflow changes both in terms of the magnitude of change and associated causes as well as the ability to predict them whitfield et al 2002 fleming et al 2016 within the western united states snow to precipitation ratios have been discussed in the context of future streamflow changes elsner et al 2010 fritze et al 2011 tohver et al 2014 vano et al 2014 but never before have historical snow data been used to predict these shifts anticipated changes in future seasonal streamflow and their relation to changes in snow are generally understood rasmussen et al 2014 koptykovskiy et al 2015 but the exclusive use of historical snow data to predict future streamflow variability across space and time is not obvious and warrants future study the prediction of future streamflow directly from historical snow data would be a useful additional technique for water managers to quickly and inexpensively assess and identify areas that are likely to undergo large changes in hydrology we address this important knowledge gap using basin scale historical snow fractions to predict future seasonal climate impacts on streamflow over 23 basins of the crb given the total elevation range of up to 4365 m where yearly snowfall is typical in the high elevation areas of these 23 basins the crb serves as an ideal study area for this investigation though it is an interesting addition to the extensive literature on climate change in the crb we hope given the computational requirements and expertise needed to develop comprehensive assessment of future climate impacts on streamflow using numerical climate and hydrology models that the simple predictive relationships we develop here using the crb as a proving ground are also usable as the basis of rapid assessment techniques to prioritize areas for improved resource management in regions that have limited resources and or technical capacities 2 materials and methods our overall approach began with results from the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrology model liang et al 1994 forced by a large number of climate model simulations to compare future mean 21st century streamflow to a historical baseline 1970 1999 the peak march to may mam streamflow change from this baseline over five consecutive 20 year periods from 2000 to 2100 is related to basin size and historical snow to precipitation ratios this also leads to the identification of three distinct streamflow response hydroclimatic basin types which are used to assess the maximum percent change in july to august jas streamflow given the high demand for water during this time to support agriculture or generate hydropower barnett et al 2005 vic was run in full energy balance mode at a 1 h timestep and 1 16th degree spatial resolution described in bennett et al 2017 snow in vic is calculated using a two layer snow model that simulates subgrid vegetation energy balance fluxes in the vegetation canopy and snowpack separately and includes a calculation of snow on top of lake ice processes in the snow model include canopy and within snow radiation transfer vegetation interception time varying snow density and albedo water transfer between snow layers liquid water freezing and frozen soil andreadis et al 2009 chen et al 2014 in complex and mountainous terrain snow elevation bands can be used to improve the estimates of snow accumulation and snowmelt timing in vic andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 gao et al 2009 bennett et al 2018 within each snow elevation band the mean band elevation is used to lapse the average grid cell air temperature at the rate of 0 0065 c km 1 which is also used in the calculation of pressure and precipitation the snow model is then run for each elevation band and each vegetation tile using the improved estimates we use monthly streamflow results 1950 2099 from the vic hydrology model forced by temperature and precipitation from 25 gcms esms table 1 temperature and precipitation from the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios were used as input to vic representing the moderate and most extreme levels of future greenhouse emissions respectively downscaled gcm and esm data was obtained from the multivariate adaptive constructed analogue maca database abatzoglou and brown 2012 which is based on the coupled model intercomparison project version 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 vic was calibrated at a monthly timestep for each of the 23 basins shown in fig 1 using the automated multi objective complex evolution algorithm mocom ua yapo et al 1998 applied over three objective functions streamflow peak matching nash sutcliffe efficiency streamflow low flow matching log nash sutcliffe efficiency and streamflow volume bias normalized root mean square error nrmse streamflow was calibrated while modifying six soil parameters the thicknesses of the 2nd and 3rd soil layers the infiltration capacity curve shape parameter and three non linear baseflow parameters we additionally calibrated the albedo of newly fallen snow after mendoza et al 2015 in all cases the calibration was run to its optimum or stopping point the 23 basins and the calibration period were selected based on data availability from the monthly naturalized streamflow data set developed by the us bureau of reclamation usbr which was used to perform the calibration model calibration using daily precipitation and temperature forcing data resulted in a nrmse of 0 22 1 42 mean 0 49 and nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 13 0 95 mean 0 77 for the different basins streamflow was routed to the downstream grid cell using a linearized st venant equation lohman et al 1996 1998 calibration statistics for the vic model simulations for the 23 crb sub basins are shown in table 2 plots of observed and simulated streamflow for the 23 sub basins are provided in the supplemental information further details on the model setup are found in bennett et al 2017 model performance in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency for the little snake river basin was much lower 0 23 than the other basins mean 0 77 interestingly when the model was run for this basin without any elevation bands a much better calibration was obtained however for all other basins the model performance was superior when run with the elevation bands to weight precipitation forcing data based on this finding we conclude that the elevation bands are generating too much weight on higher elevation precipitation for this low yield headwater river system we note that the calibration statistics shown in table 2 were all derived from model simulations where elevation bands to weight precipitation was used to maintain consistency in the methods that were used for all basins thus the model tends to over predict high and moderate streamflow in the little snake river basin the 1950 2099 monthly streamflow model ensemble means were calculated for the 12 vic simulations using rcp 4 5 emissions scenario and 13 simulations using rcp 8 5 emissions scenario projected changes in streamflow climatology anomalies were assessed for the two emission scenarios ensemble means by calculating the percent difference of future streamflow climatology relative to the historical baseline 1970 1999 for each of the 23 basins deviations from the baseline were assessed over five 20 year periods 2000 2019 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 uncertainty in these estimates was calculated using the standard deviation of the individual model runs for the rcp 4 5 and the rcp 8 5 emission scenarios the percent change in mean 2080 2099 mam streamflow for each basin was then related to the baseline snow to precipitation ratio obtained from vic for each basin by fitting an exponential function using the relation described in eq 1 1 δ q m a m β 0 ln s p a β 1 w h e r e s p a 0 where δq mam is the 2080 2099 mean march to may mam streamflow anomaly expressed as a percent change relative to the historical baseline for the 23 basins used in the study spa is the mean annual historical baseline snow to rain ratio normalized by basin area and β 0 and β 1 are dimensionless regression coefficients estimated to be 14 19 and 149 80 for the rcp 4 5 emission scenario models and 26 54 and 289 74 for rcp 8 5 emission scenario models respectively based on a least squares linear regression of δq mam on ln spa p 0 01 adjusted r 2 0 56 each of the basins used in the analysis are colored according to spa in fig 1 we distinguish the basins by spa rather than a classification of headwater versus downstream catchments because spa was used in the empirical relationship that was developed and applied in this study we note that with a couple of exceptions in basin 20 and 22 spa turns out to be a fairly good approximation of distinguishing between headwater and downstream catchments because headwater catchments tended to have a higher spa basins 20 and 22 are located further south where snowfall is less significant so despite comprising headwater regions these basins had a lower spa than headwater basins located further north δqmam was used in this analysis as this period included the months when the streamflow difference from the baseline was highest for each of the basins eq 1 was developed empirically but motivated by physical considerations that indicate a likely relationship between spa and the δqmam martinec 1975 corresponding r 2 values ranged between 0 5 and 0 6 for alternate 20 year periods beyond 2020 but because the strongest δqmam occurred for 2080 2099 we focused our analysis on results from this period for clarity spa has not been used before as a predictive tool of late 21st century streamflow we describe later in the results and discussions sections our reasoning behind using spa and why it turns out to be a reasonable measure of the type and degree of hydroclimatic change experienced by a given basin while the parametric model of eq 1 appears reasonable one might question whether alternative functional forms could be admissible this question was explored in two ways first 95 prediction bounds were generated as e δqmam 1 96 seloocv where the first term represents the expectation value of δq mam estimated as the prediction value from the regression model and seloocv is the standard error of residuals determined using k fold cross validation with k 1 i e leave one out cross validation the use of out of sample predictions as the basis for uncertainty bounds was motivated by the intention of applying the derived relationship between δq mam and ln spa as a predictive tool second a feed forward error backpropagation artificial neural network ann was fitted directly to the 23 spa δq mam data pairs using no input data transformations ann is a machine learning technique that is nonparametric in the sense that no assumptions are required regarding the form of the input output relationship and indeed that is well known to be a universal approximator cybenko 1989 hornik 1991 graphical analysis of the input output map determined using the ann then provides a valuable point of comparison for the parametric regression though sometimes viewed as a black box prediction technique neural networks have a strong record of being used in this way for inferring underlying physical relationships and informing the development of parametric statistical and process simulation models in the hydrologic and climate sciences e g cannon and mckendry 2002 fleming 2007 in principle an ann can reproduce any continuous relationship without a priori assumptions regarding form thus our confidence in the parametric statistical model eq 1 would be reinforced if such an agnostic ann independently generates a functional form similar to that of eq 1 to test this a monotone multilayer perceptron zhang and zhang 1999 cannon 2017 was employed using a single neuron input layer consisting of spa data a single neuron output layer consisting of δq mam data a hyperbolic tangent activation function a broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno local gradient search based training algorithm and one hidden layer bootstrap aggregation bagging and stopped training were used to avoid overfitting the monotonicity constraint contributes an additional regularization function zhang and zhang 1999 unlike the parametric fit prediction bounds were not explored for the neural network as its purpose is solely to provide an additional methodologically independent check on the overall form of eq 1 in light of the higher demands on summer streamflow for water and energy supplies in the crb the 2080 2099 mean jas streamflow anomaly relative to the baseline δqjas was calculated for the ensemble means of two emission scenario projections of streamflow these results are compared to δqjas generated exclusively from the ipsl cm5a lr model given that this model had the largest decrease in future precipitation of the gcms esms used in the study and thus is representative of a plausible extreme dry outcome of future precipitation change as shown in the results section this comparison was done for one basin in each of the spa based hydroclimatological regime types defined in this study 3 results the 20 year model ensemble streamflow anomalies expressed in mean percent for each basin are presented in fig 2 a and b arranged in decreasing order according to basin spa in general the results show increases in streamflow for most months with the largest monthly increases of up to 320 that occurred in mam and decreases of up to 60 that occurred in jas basins with the smallest spa represent an exception to these patterns as three of the four basins with the smallest spa experienced cool season august to february increases and warm season march to july decreases basins with larger spas experienced the greatest δqmam whereas those with smaller spas experienced the least amount of change in streamflow overall annually all basins experienced an overall increase in streamflow by 2080 the rcp 8 5 results displayed similar patterns to the rcp 4 5 results but the increase in δqmam for the larger spas was typically higher by a factor of two fig 3 a and b show the uncertainty in the estimated monthly streamflow changes relative to the 1970 1999 baseline for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 model runs respectively uncertainty in the δqmam estimates was based on the standard deviation 1 σ of individual model simulations for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in each of the 23 basins only the uncertainty results for the 2080 2099 period are shown because the overall patterns in uncertainty were similar among the five periods both sets of figures demonstrate a temporal and spatial component to the uncertainty in general predictions of larger changes in monthly streamflow which typically occurred during mam had a higher degree of uncertainty predictions for larger basins or those with a smaller overall spa also tended to have a higher degree of uncertainty in monthly estimates relative to smaller basins with a larger overall spa the relation of basin snow to rain ratios and area to mean 2080 2099 δq mam for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios are presented in fig 4 a and b respectively error bars were derived from the standard deviation 1 σ of the best model estimates derived for each of the emission scenarios errors ranged from less than 50 for basins with a smaller spa spa 1 10 3 km 2 to less than 100 for basins with a larger spa spa 1 10 3 km 2 values predicted using eq 1 and the neural network are also shown the parametric regression provides a good match to the observations within 95 prediction intervals but this does not necessarily guarantee its superiority over another parametric equation using a somewhat different functional form such as a slightly different nonlinear transformation or regression coefficients determined by some method other than ordinary least squares ols we find that the optimal functional form obtained by the nonparametric ann trained by nonlinear optimization is a close match to that of the ols parametric regression the similarity between the optimal ann and the regression curve provide additional confidence in the suitability of the parametric regression model shown in eq 1 residuals of the linear regression of δqmam on ln spa shown in fig 4a and b were normally distributed shapiro wilks p 0 10 regression coefficients corresponding to a wide range of quantiles obtained from a separate quantile regression koenker 2011 of δqmam on log transformed spa did not provide strong evidence for departures from homoscedasticity these outcomes validate statistical assumptions underlying the regression of eq 1 and fig 4a and b but imply the relationship between δqmam and untransformed spa is heteroscedastic and uncertainty increases with spa this is consistent with visual interpretation of the data cloud shown in figs 4a and 4b fig 4a and 4b also illustrates how basin responses can be stratified by spa basins are grouped according to hydroclimatic basin response type given the resulting patterns in streamflow response relative to spa that are shown in fig 2 and on the left side of fig 4a and b based on the patterns identified in the results of these simulations the different basin responses and corresponding spa threshold values were defined as follows 1 rain spa 1 2 10 3 km 2 2 snow rain 1 4 10 3 to 3 10 3 km 2 and 3 snow 3 10 3 km 2 fig 5 shows the 2080 2099 ensemble mean percent δqjas compared to the same results when the ipsl cm5a lr esm was used for one representative basin in each of the three hydroclimatic basin response types results from the ipsl cm5a lr model displayed a consistently larger δqjas which was nearly double the results from the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios for both the snow and snow rain basin response types and even higher for the rain basin response type the decrease in δqjas for the rcp 8 5 was consistently higher than the rcp 4 5 emission scenario results for each of the three basin response types 4 discussion using the well studied crb as a proving ground for our method we find that simply knowing the historic snow to precipitation ratios of a basin enables prediction of late 21st century streamflow changes generally to within 50 100 the results and technique we applied can be used by resource managers to rapidly identify areas that are likely to undergo the greatest hydrologic change so that these areas can be prioritized for improved water and energy resource management this will be particularly important in regions where funds are lacking to conduct a more sophisticated vulnerability assessment using fully coupled climate land surface hydrology models with appropriate downscaling over the entire region of interest such a practice could be used as a critical first step toward generation of a multi tiered physically based assessment protocol for water resource vulnerabilities to climate change the accuracy of the newly developed empirical relationship to predict streamflow was strongly related to the basin response type as shown in fig 4 the empirical relationship used to predict streamflow for snow dominant basins spa 3 10 3 km 2 typically deviated further from the coupled climate hydrology model streamflow predictions than snow rain or rain dominant basins spa 3 10 3 km 2 moreover the uncertainty in the climate hydrology model predictions denoted by the error bars was also generally higher for snow dominant basins larger errors observed in snow dominant basins are likely due to the difficulty in accurate modeling of snow and snowmelt processes described in other studies dozier et al 2016 bennett et al 2018 streamflow modeling skill is heavily dependent on the accuracy of snow initialization shukla and lettenmaier 2011 mo and lettenmaier 2014 islam et al 2017 especially during peak snowmelt during the spring mahanama et al 2012 thus the accuracy of snow initialization should be considered as the spring was the focus for predictions made in this study more detailed information on the sensitivity of vic streamflow estimates to snowmelt and other parameters where a similar model set up and calibration was used for simulations over the crb in bennett et al 2018 the incorporation of swe into model simulations and calibration will likely result in better prediction of streamflow in models this is particularly true for mountainous areas within the crb where the relative influence of factors such as vegetation topography temperature and wind on snow accumulation and ablation is more variable fontaine et al 2002 although there are approximately 240 snotel stations providing in situ observed swe estimates in the crb fassnacht et al 2003 this number still falls well short of the desired quantity for an adequate comparison or calibration to the 1 16th degree resolution swe that was modeled in this study slater and clark 2006 islam and déry 2017 sexston et al 2018 however we include a comparison of swe estimates from the vic model simulations to a select number of snotel stations within the crb in the supplemental information other paths forward for calibrating swe estimates include the use of temperature index models martinec and rango 1981 remote sensing berezowski et al 2015 interpolation approaches fassnacht et al 2003 and data assimilation griessinger et al 2016 recent studies have indicated that the error in such models and data products ranges from 18 to 107 over basins that are one tenth the size of the smallest crb sub basin used in our study bair et al 2016 the high error in historical spatially distributed swe data products illustrates the difficulty in justifying its usage here for calibration of vic swe we thus avoid attempting this here and note that a number of other studies that have simulated swe estimates in vic while calibrating to streamflow christensen et al 2004 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 elsner et al 2010 das et al 2011 vano et al 2016 bennett et al 2018 the results of this study also underscore the importance of recognizing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in future climate impacts on hydrology the model ensemble means show increasing mam streamflow for 21 of 24 basins which includes all basins upstream of lakes mead and powell basins 14 and 18 in fig 1 this finding indicates water and energy users of these reservoirs will benefit if changes in operations are implemented to account for changes in flow timing given that these reservoirs combined comprise four years of storage from the colorado river vano et al 2012 however users of water supplies upstream of these reservoirs might not be as fortunate because headwater watersheds are located where more dramatic changes are likely to occur and there is often not enough storage within these basins for water managers to adapt and avoid losses in water and energy supplies for example our results in fig 2 show the δq mam increase of up to 320 is shifting monthly peak runoff one month earlier which could force managers with smaller reservoir capacities to release water much earlier than normal solander et al 2016 as a result of this shift less water will be available in the warmer months when demands are highest for agriculture thermoelectric power effluent cooling and hydropower generation for air conditioning requirements which is also when streamflow is expected to decrease e g fig 5 further compounding the seasonal water scarcity problem similar findings of higher spring and lower summer flows were noted using a snowmelt runoff model for the upper rio grande basin located southeast of the crb elias et al 2015 observations of declining spring streamflow from reductions in snowpack due to warmer temperatures also confirm these model predictions for the upper rio grande basin chavarria and gutzler 2018 thus these snow dominated basins will increasingly be more prone to localized seasonal shortages in water and energy supplies particularly in areas where less storage is available to offset these changes snowmelt residence times within a basin are a function of multiple fine scale watershed processes and characteristics including travel time through the snowpack length of stream channels and velocity of streamflow lundquist 2005 the snow to precipitation ratio was divided by basin area rather than using the ratio alone to relate historic data to future streamflow due to the heterogeneity of residence times for precipitation originating as snow within a basin larger basins are more likely to have more heterogeneous residence times as these regions include a greater percentage of rain fed runoff or regions with differential rates of snowmelt and a wider range of flow paths e g mudelsee 2007 resulting in a more damped response of δqmam from warming within the headwater basins less than 115 000 km2 in size and snow to precipitation ratios greater than 35 this did not appear to be an issue in these cases δqmam within each basin generally increased by 100 or more however within basins larger than 300 000 km2 and with snow to precipitation ratios of 60 80 the δqmam was damped and generally less than 50 relative to historical hence future streamflow changes are a function of both the historical fraction of snow as well as basin size fig 4 demonstrates how heterogeneity in model outcomes is another important feature that must be considered in selection of gcm esm although the ensemble mean results indicate the 2080 2099 mean δqjas will decline by up to 25 where the variability is dependent on basin response type use of the single model ipsl cm5a lr run under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario to generate streamflow indicates that declines could exceed 80 for some basins even though the model ensemble mean results are generally assumed to represent the most likely future tebaldi and knutti 2007 islam et al 2017 the composition of models included in an ensemble mean can heavily influence the results for example other studies have indicated close to one third of 112 future cmip3 gcm climate projections suggest no change or increases in annual colorado river streamflow while two thirds indicate decreases the direction of which generally depends on the selection of models favoring precipitation increases or decreases harding et al 2012 vano et al 2014 given the strong variation between gcms and the consequent uncertainty in future conditions more extreme outcomes like those presented in fig 5 should also be included in planning efforts to stimulate thought around potential response strategies to the highest impact scenarios this will help to avoid basing such strategies on mean outcomes where the more extreme outcomes although still plausible are likely to be washed out shepard et al 2018 based on the success of relating future impacts on hydrology to historical snow to precipitation ratios within the crb application of this rapid assessment technique is most promising in other regions where snowmelt accounts for a significant portion of the annual hydrograph in particular its implementation is ideal for locations where snow season temperatures tend to be closer to the melting point such as within mountainous areas of northern california and the pacific northwest in these regions changes in future streamflow from warming are likely to be amplified due to higher rates of snowmelt per unit increase in temperature clow 2010 further tests of the methods applied in this study over different regions will be useful for understanding the utility of the technique for prediction of climate impacts on hydrology given key spatial differences after further testing the method might prove useful for practical climate change impact sensitivity mapping in other regions such as alaska south america and the tibetan plateau where comparatively less work has been done on making detailed quantitative model projections 5 conclusion we demonstrate the ability to predict basin scale future climate change impacts on streamflow using historical snow to precipitation ratios r2 0 58 the results highlight the importance of snow when examining future climate impacts on hydrology as well as the heterogeneity of basin responses at sub regional scales investigating future changes in streamflow at sub annual scales reveals a high degree of variability in both the magnitude and direction of change that we show can be predicted by hydroclimatic basin type and area snow dominant basins spa 3 10 3 km 2 were found to have the largest δqmam increase up to 320 and the largest δqjas decrease up to 60 given that these decreases are predicted to occur when the demand for water and energy is highest our results have implications for water and energy resource management moreover the empirical relationship we developed can be used to readily identify areas likely to undergo the greatest change this is useful for quickly and cheaply identifying areas to prioritize for resource management implementation of our relatively simple technique may in some contexts be preferred over the use of physically based process simulation models which although are more sophisticated are also more costly and time intensive for prediction of climate change impacts on hydrology our intent with this research was to develop a new empirical relationship that could be used to readily calculate climate change impacts on hydrology we test the performance of this relationship in this proof of concept study over 23 sub basins within the colorado river basin prior to application elsewhere further testing of the newly developed empirically based predictive technique presented herein is required to understand the scalability of the basin response types to other regions or possibly the globe at different spatial and temporal scales such an effort could result in the development of a basin scale index of water energy nexus

diffenbaugh et al 2019 best 2019 as a general rule for streamflow under 2 c warming low latitude areas are anticipated to get wetter by up to 50 annually whereas regions residing in more moderate latitudes are anticipated to get drier by up to 50 annually schewe et al 2014 areas expecting to undergo the greatest change include northern and southern africa southern north and south america and southern europe and asia as well as southwest australia in these regions reductions of renewable water resources by over 20 are particularly widespread these changes are also anticipated to impact energy supplies through shifts in water availability for hydropower generation or thermoelectric power needs e g van vliet et al 2016 the snow and ice of continental water towers such as the himalayas andes rockies and alps are a crucial water and energy resource and may be particularly susceptible to climate changes also climate change will likely induce geographically heterogeneous shifts in energy demand for example in western canada wintertime heating demands are expected to decrease whereas in the us southwest summer cooling demands will likely increase further magnifying the impacts of potential changes in hydroelectric power availability bureau of reclamation 2011 fleming and weber 2012 within the colorado river basin crb increasingly severe energy shortages may be experienced by the end of the 21st century reflecting decreases in annual streamflow by up to 21 due to climate change and climate induced vegetation disturbances christensen and lettenmaier 2007 bennett et al 2017 there is also evidence that that warmer temperatures are playing an increasingly large role in streamflow decreases through enhanced levels of evapotranspiration udall et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 however the magnitude and even direction of change is not the same among climate models due to uncertainties related to the internal variability of the climate system future emissions scenarios and climate model physics deser et al 2012 steinschneider et al 2012 in addition these changes are not expected to be spatially or temporally uniform for all basins or seasons harding et al 2012 given the prognosis of and variability in such changes it is imperative that a region specific understanding is developed on the magnitude and direction of streamflow changes over different temporal scales this understanding is essential to determine the impacts on the energy water nexus and corresponding effects on local regional and even international economies associated with water and energy transfers across seven us states and mexico that depend on water from the colorado river basin crb christensen et al 2004 anticipated changes of streamflow at the annual scale are strongly linked to projected shifts in precipitation across large scale river basins harding et al 2012 however uncertainties in precipitation driven streamflow changes are apparent particularly for mountainous regions and smaller basins often resulting in decreased confidence in future estimates for these areas biemans et al 2009 bennett et al 2012 seasonally although changes in the volume of precipitation remain a contributing factor to streamflow shifts changes in streamflow have also been strongly linked to other phenomena for example in regions where snow accounts for a major component of the annual water budget temperature driven changes including precipitation phase changes shifts in snowmelt and increased frequency of rain on snow events have all been identified as major contributors of seasonal or monthly streamflow changes adam et al 2009 hidalgo et al 2009 clow 2010 das et al 2011 berghuijs et al 2014 klos et al 2014 vano et al 2015 solander et al 2017 thus changes in the timing and magnitude of seasonal streamflow patterns are closely linked to the expected changes in snowpack moreover given the magnitude of these seasonal shifts combined with the sensitivity of resource management and planning to seasonal cycles and changes in those patterns barnett et al 2005 increased emphasis should be made on the nature of seasonal streamflow changes both in terms of the magnitude of change and associated causes as well as the ability to predict them whitfield et al 2002 fleming et al 2016 within the western united states snow to precipitation ratios have been discussed in the context of future streamflow changes elsner et al 2010 fritze et al 2011 tohver et al 2014 vano et al 2014 but never before have historical snow data been used to predict these shifts anticipated changes in future seasonal streamflow and their relation to changes in snow are generally understood rasmussen et al 2014 koptykovskiy et al 2015 but the exclusive use of historical snow data to predict future streamflow variability across space and time is not obvious and warrants future study the prediction of future streamflow directly from historical snow data would be a useful additional technique for water managers to quickly and inexpensively assess and identify areas that are likely to undergo large changes in hydrology we address this important knowledge gap using basin scale historical snow fractions to predict future seasonal climate impacts on streamflow over 23 basins of the crb given the total elevation range of up to 4365 m where yearly snowfall is typical in the high elevation areas of these 23 basins the crb serves as an ideal study area for this investigation though it is an interesting addition to the extensive literature on climate change in the crb we hope given the computational requirements and expertise needed to develop comprehensive assessment of future climate impacts on streamflow using numerical climate and hydrology models that the simple predictive relationships we develop here using the crb as a proving ground are also usable as the basis of rapid assessment techniques to prioritize areas for improved resource management in regions that have limited resources and or technical capacities 2 materials and methods our overall approach began with results from the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrology model liang et al 1994 forced by a large number of climate model simulations to compare future mean 21st century streamflow to a historical baseline 1970 1999 the peak march to may mam streamflow change from this baseline over five consecutive 20 year periods from 2000 to 2100 is related to basin size and historical snow to precipitation ratios this also leads to the identification of three distinct streamflow response hydroclimatic basin types which are used to assess the maximum percent change in july to august jas streamflow given the high demand for water during this time to support agriculture or generate hydropower barnett et al 2005 vic was run in full energy balance mode at a 1 h timestep and 1 16th degree spatial resolution described in bennett et al 2017 snow in vic is calculated using a two layer snow model that simulates subgrid vegetation energy balance fluxes in the vegetation canopy and snowpack separately and includes a calculation of snow on top of lake ice processes in the snow model include canopy and within snow radiation transfer vegetation interception time varying snow density and albedo water transfer between snow layers liquid water freezing and frozen soil andreadis et al 2009 chen et al 2014 in complex and mountainous terrain snow elevation bands can be used to improve the estimates of snow accumulation and snowmelt timing in vic andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 gao et al 2009 bennett et al 2018 within each snow elevation band the mean band elevation is used to lapse the average grid cell air temperature at the rate of 0 0065 c km 1 which is also used in the calculation of pressure and precipitation the snow model is then run for each elevation band and each vegetation tile using the improved estimates we use monthly streamflow results 1950 2099 from the vic hydrology model forced by temperature and precipitation from 25 gcms esms table 1 temperature and precipitation from the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios were used as input to vic representing the moderate and most extreme levels of future greenhouse emissions respectively downscaled gcm and esm data was obtained from the multivariate adaptive constructed analogue maca database abatzoglou and brown 2012 which is based on the coupled model intercomparison project version 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 vic was calibrated at a monthly timestep for each of the 23 basins shown in fig 1 using the automated multi objective complex evolution algorithm mocom ua yapo et al 1998 applied over three objective functions streamflow peak matching nash sutcliffe efficiency streamflow low flow matching log nash sutcliffe efficiency and streamflow volume bias normalized root mean square error nrmse streamflow was calibrated while modifying six soil parameters the thicknesses of the 2nd and 3rd soil layers the infiltration capacity curve shape parameter and three non linear baseflow parameters we additionally calibrated the albedo of newly fallen snow after mendoza et al 2015 in all cases the calibration was run to its optimum or stopping point the 23 basins and the calibration period were selected based on data availability from the monthly naturalized streamflow data set developed by the us bureau of reclamation usbr which was used to perform the calibration model calibration using daily precipitation and temperature forcing data resulted in a nrmse of 0 22 1 42 mean 0 49 and nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 13 0 95 mean 0 77 for the different basins streamflow was routed to the downstream grid cell using a linearized st venant equation lohman et al 1996 1998 calibration statistics for the vic model simulations for the 23 crb sub basins are shown in table 2 plots of observed and simulated streamflow for the 23 sub basins are provided in the supplemental information further details on the model setup are found in bennett et al 2017 model performance in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency for the little snake river basin was much lower 0 23 than the other basins mean 0 77 interestingly when the model was run for this basin without any elevation bands a much better calibration was obtained however for all other basins the model performance was superior when run with the elevation bands to weight precipitation forcing data based on this finding we conclude that the elevation bands are generating too much weight on higher elevation precipitation for this low yield headwater river system we note that the calibration statistics shown in table 2 were all derived from model simulations where elevation bands to weight precipitation was used to maintain consistency in the methods that were used for all basins thus the model tends to over predict high and moderate streamflow in the little snake river basin the 1950 2099 monthly streamflow model ensemble means were calculated for the 12 vic simulations using rcp 4 5 emissions scenario and 13 simulations using rcp 8 5 emissions scenario projected changes in streamflow climatology anomalies were assessed for the two emission scenarios ensemble means by calculating the percent difference of future streamflow climatology relative to the historical baseline 1970 1999 for each of the 23 basins deviations from the baseline were assessed over five 20 year periods 2000 2019 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 uncertainty in these estimates was calculated using the standard deviation of the individual model runs for the rcp 4 5 and the rcp 8 5 emission scenarios the percent change in mean 2080 2099 mam streamflow for each basin was then related to the baseline snow to precipitation ratio obtained from vic for each basin by fitting an exponential function using the relation described in eq 1 1 δ q m a m β 0 ln s p a β 1 w h e r e s p a 0 where δq mam is the 2080 2099 mean march to may mam streamflow anomaly expressed as a percent change relative to the historical baseline for the 23 basins used in the study spa is the mean annual historical baseline snow to rain ratio normalized by basin area and β 0 and β 1 are dimensionless regression coefficients estimated to be 14 19 and 149 80 for the rcp 4 5 emission scenario models and 26 54 and 289 74 for rcp 8 5 emission scenario models respectively based on a least squares linear regression of δq mam on ln spa p 0 01 adjusted r 2 0 56 each of the basins used in the analysis are colored according to spa in fig 1 we distinguish the basins by spa rather than a classification of headwater versus downstream catchments because spa was used in the empirical relationship that was developed and applied in this study we note that with a couple of exceptions in basin 20 and 22 spa turns out to be a fairly good approximation of distinguishing between headwater and downstream catchments because headwater catchments tended to have a higher spa basins 20 and 22 are located further south where snowfall is less significant so despite comprising headwater regions these basins had a lower spa than headwater basins located further north δqmam was used in this analysis as this period included the months when the streamflow difference from the baseline was highest for each of the basins eq 1 was developed empirically but motivated by physical considerations that indicate a likely relationship between spa and the δqmam martinec 1975 corresponding r 2 values ranged between 0 5 and 0 6 for alternate 20 year periods beyond 2020 but because the strongest δqmam occurred for 2080 2099 we focused our analysis on results from this period for clarity spa has not been used before as a predictive tool of late 21st century streamflow we describe later in the results and discussions sections our reasoning behind using spa and why it turns out to be a reasonable measure of the type and degree of hydroclimatic change experienced by a given basin while the parametric model of eq 1 appears reasonable one might question whether alternative functional forms could be admissible this question was explored in two ways first 95 prediction bounds were generated as e δqmam 1 96 seloocv where the first term represents the expectation value of δq mam estimated as the prediction value from the regression model and seloocv is the standard error of residuals determined using k fold cross validation with k 1 i e leave one out cross validation the use of out of sample predictions as the basis for uncertainty bounds was motivated by the intention of applying the derived relationship between δq mam and ln spa as a predictive tool second a feed forward error backpropagation artificial neural network ann was fitted directly to the 23 spa δq mam data pairs using no input data transformations ann is a machine learning technique that is nonparametric in the sense that no assumptions are required regarding the form of the input output relationship and indeed that is well known to be a universal approximator cybenko 1989 hornik 1991 graphical analysis of the input output map determined using the ann then provides a valuable point of comparison for the parametric regression though sometimes viewed as a black box prediction technique neural networks have a strong record of being used in this way for inferring underlying physical relationships and informing the development of parametric statistical and process simulation models in the hydrologic and climate sciences e g cannon and mckendry 2002 fleming 2007 in principle an ann can reproduce any continuous relationship without a priori assumptions regarding form thus our confidence in the parametric statistical model eq 1 would be reinforced if such an agnostic ann independently generates a functional form similar to that of eq 1 to test this a monotone multilayer perceptron zhang and zhang 1999 cannon 2017 was employed using a single neuron input layer consisting of spa data a single neuron output layer consisting of δq mam data a hyperbolic tangent activation function a broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno local gradient search based training algorithm and one hidden layer bootstrap aggregation bagging and stopped training were used to avoid overfitting the monotonicity constraint contributes an additional regularization function zhang and zhang 1999 unlike the parametric fit prediction bounds were not explored for the neural network as its purpose is solely to provide an additional methodologically independent check on the overall form of eq 1 in light of the higher demands on summer streamflow for water and energy supplies in the crb the 2080 2099 mean jas streamflow anomaly relative to the baseline δqjas was calculated for the ensemble means of two emission scenario projections of streamflow these results are compared to δqjas generated exclusively from the ipsl cm5a lr model given that this model had the largest decrease in future precipitation of the gcms esms used in the study and thus is representative of a plausible extreme dry outcome of future precipitation change as shown in the results section this comparison was done for one basin in each of the spa based hydroclimatological regime types defined in this study 3 results the 20 year model ensemble streamflow anomalies expressed in mean percent for each basin are presented in fig 2 a and b arranged in decreasing order according to basin spa in general the results show increases in streamflow for most months with the largest monthly increases of up to 320 that occurred in mam and decreases of up to 60 that occurred in jas basins with the smallest spa represent an exception to these patterns as three of the four basins with the smallest spa experienced cool season august to february increases and warm season march to july decreases basins with larger spas experienced the greatest δqmam whereas those with smaller spas experienced the least amount of change in streamflow overall annually all basins experienced an overall increase in streamflow by 2080 the rcp 8 5 results displayed similar patterns to the rcp 4 5 results but the increase in δqmam for the larger spas was typically higher by a factor of two fig 3 a and b show the uncertainty in the estimated monthly streamflow changes relative to the 1970 1999 baseline for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 model runs respectively uncertainty in the δqmam estimates was based on the standard deviation 1 σ of individual model simulations for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in each of the 23 basins only the uncertainty results for the 2080 2099 period are shown because the overall patterns in uncertainty were similar among the five periods both sets of figures demonstrate a temporal and spatial component to the uncertainty in general predictions of larger changes in monthly streamflow which typically occurred during mam had a higher degree of uncertainty predictions for larger basins or those with a smaller overall spa also tended to have a higher degree of uncertainty in monthly estimates relative to smaller basins with a larger overall spa the relation of basin snow to rain ratios and area to mean 2080 2099 δq mam for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios are presented in fig 4 a and b respectively error bars were derived from the standard deviation 1 σ of the best model estimates derived for each of the emission scenarios errors ranged from less than 50 for basins with a smaller spa spa 1 10 3 km 2 to less than 100 for basins with a larger spa spa 1 10 3 km 2 values predicted using eq 1 and the neural network are also shown the parametric regression provides a good match to the observations within 95 prediction intervals but this does not necessarily guarantee its superiority over another parametric equation using a somewhat different functional form such as a slightly different nonlinear transformation or regression coefficients determined by some method other than ordinary least squares ols we find that the optimal functional form obtained by the nonparametric ann trained by nonlinear optimization is a close match to that of the ols parametric regression the similarity between the optimal ann and the regression curve provide additional confidence in the suitability of the parametric regression model shown in eq 1 residuals of the linear regression of δqmam on ln spa shown in fig 4a and b were normally distributed shapiro wilks p 0 10 regression coefficients corresponding to a wide range of quantiles obtained from a separate quantile regression koenker 2011 of δqmam on log transformed spa did not provide strong evidence for departures from homoscedasticity these outcomes validate statistical assumptions underlying the regression of eq 1 and fig 4a and b but imply the relationship between δqmam and untransformed spa is heteroscedastic and uncertainty increases with spa this is consistent with visual interpretation of the data cloud shown in figs 4a and 4b fig 4a and 4b also illustrates how basin responses can be stratified by spa basins are grouped according to hydroclimatic basin response type given the resulting patterns in streamflow response relative to spa that are shown in fig 2 and on the left side of fig 4a and b based on the patterns identified in the results of these simulations the different basin responses and corresponding spa threshold values were defined as follows 1 rain spa 1 2 10 3 km 2 2 snow rain 1 4 10 3 to 3 10 3 km 2 and 3 snow 3 10 3 km 2 fig 5 shows the 2080 2099 ensemble mean percent δqjas compared to the same results when the ipsl cm5a lr esm was used for one representative basin in each of the three hydroclimatic basin response types results from the ipsl cm5a lr model displayed a consistently larger δqjas which was nearly double the results from the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios for both the snow and snow rain basin response types and even higher for the rain basin response type the decrease in δqjas for the rcp 8 5 was consistently higher than the rcp 4 5 emission scenario results for each of the three basin response types 4 discussion using the well studied crb as a proving ground for our method we find that simply knowing the historic snow to precipitation ratios of a basin enables prediction of late 21st century streamflow changes generally to within 50 100 the results and technique we applied can be used by resource managers to rapidly identify areas that are likely to undergo the greatest hydrologic change so that these areas can be prioritized for improved water and energy resource management this will be particularly important in regions where funds are lacking to conduct a more sophisticated vulnerability assessment using fully coupled climate land surface hydrology models with appropriate downscaling over the entire region of interest such a practice could be used as a critical first step toward generation of a multi tiered physically based assessment protocol for water resource vulnerabilities to climate change the accuracy of the newly developed empirical relationship to predict streamflow was strongly related to the basin response type as shown in fig 4 the empirical relationship used to predict streamflow for snow dominant basins spa 3 10 3 km 2 typically deviated further from the coupled climate hydrology model streamflow predictions than snow rain or rain dominant basins spa 3 10 3 km 2 moreover the uncertainty in the climate hydrology model predictions denoted by the error bars was also generally higher for snow dominant basins larger errors observed in snow dominant basins are likely due to the difficulty in accurate modeling of snow and snowmelt processes described in other studies dozier et al 2016 bennett et al 2018 streamflow modeling skill is heavily dependent on the accuracy of snow initialization shukla and lettenmaier 2011 mo and lettenmaier 2014 islam et al 2017 especially during peak snowmelt during the spring mahanama et al 2012 thus the accuracy of snow initialization should be considered as the spring was the focus for predictions made in this study more detailed information on the sensitivity of vic streamflow estimates to snowmelt and other parameters where a similar model set up and calibration was used for simulations over the crb in bennett et al 2018 the incorporation of swe into model simulations and calibration will likely result in better prediction of streamflow in models this is particularly true for mountainous areas within the crb where the relative influence of factors such as vegetation topography temperature and wind on snow accumulation and ablation is more variable fontaine et al 2002 although there are approximately 240 snotel stations providing in situ observed swe estimates in the crb fassnacht et al 2003 this number still falls well short of the desired quantity for an adequate comparison or calibration to the 1 16th degree resolution swe that was modeled in this study slater and clark 2006 islam and déry 2017 sexston et al 2018 however we include a comparison of swe estimates from the vic model simulations to a select number of snotel stations within the crb in the supplemental information other paths forward for calibrating swe estimates include the use of temperature index models martinec and rango 1981 remote sensing berezowski et al 2015 interpolation approaches fassnacht et al 2003 and data assimilation griessinger et al 2016 recent studies have indicated that the error in such models and data products ranges from 18 to 107 over basins that are one tenth the size of the smallest crb sub basin used in our study bair et al 2016 the high error in historical spatially distributed swe data products illustrates the difficulty in justifying its usage here for calibration of vic swe we thus avoid attempting this here and note that a number of other studies that have simulated swe estimates in vic while calibrating to streamflow christensen et al 2004 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 elsner et al 2010 das et al 2011 vano et al 2016 bennett et al 2018 the results of this study also underscore the importance of recognizing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in future climate impacts on hydrology the model ensemble means show increasing mam streamflow for 21 of 24 basins which includes all basins upstream of lakes mead and powell basins 14 and 18 in fig 1 this finding indicates water and energy users of these reservoirs will benefit if changes in operations are implemented to account for changes in flow timing given that these reservoirs combined comprise four years of storage from the colorado river vano et al 2012 however users of water supplies upstream of these reservoirs might not be as fortunate because headwater watersheds are located where more dramatic changes are likely to occur and there is often not enough storage within these basins for water managers to adapt and avoid losses in water and energy supplies for example our results in fig 2 show the δq mam increase of up to 320 is shifting monthly peak runoff one month earlier which could force managers with smaller reservoir capacities to release water much earlier than normal solander et al 2016 as a result of this shift less water will be available in the warmer months when demands are highest for agriculture thermoelectric power effluent cooling and hydropower generation for air conditioning requirements which is also when streamflow is expected to decrease e g fig 5 further compounding the seasonal water scarcity problem similar findings of higher spring and lower summer flows were noted using a snowmelt runoff model for the upper rio grande basin located southeast of the crb elias et al 2015 observations of declining spring streamflow from reductions in snowpack due to warmer temperatures also confirm these model predictions for the upper rio grande basin chavarria and gutzler 2018 thus these snow dominated basins will increasingly be more prone to localized seasonal shortages in water and energy supplies particularly in areas where less storage is available to offset these changes snowmelt residence times within a basin are a function of multiple fine scale watershed processes and characteristics including travel time through the snowpack length of stream channels and velocity of streamflow lundquist 2005 the snow to precipitation ratio was divided by basin area rather than using the ratio alone to relate historic data to future streamflow due to the heterogeneity of residence times for precipitation originating as snow within a basin larger basins are more likely to have more heterogeneous residence times as these regions include a greater percentage of rain fed runoff or regions with differential rates of snowmelt and a wider range of flow paths e g mudelsee 2007 resulting in a more damped response of δqmam from warming within the headwater basins less than 115 000 km2 in size and snow to precipitation ratios greater than 35 this did not appear to be an issue in these cases δqmam within each basin generally increased by 100 or more however within basins larger than 300 000 km2 and with snow to precipitation ratios of 60 80 the δqmam was damped and generally less than 50 relative to historical hence future streamflow changes are a function of both the historical fraction of snow as well as basin size fig 4 demonstrates how heterogeneity in model outcomes is another important feature that must be considered in selection of gcm esm although the ensemble mean results indicate the 2080 2099 mean δqjas will decline by up to 25 where the variability is dependent on basin response type use of the single model ipsl cm5a lr run under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario to generate streamflow indicates that declines could exceed 80 for some basins even though the model ensemble mean results are generally assumed to represent the most likely future tebaldi and knutti 2007 islam et al 2017 the composition of models included in an ensemble mean can heavily influence the results for example other studies have indicated close to one third of 112 future cmip3 gcm climate projections suggest no change or increases in annual colorado river streamflow while two thirds indicate decreases the direction of which generally depends on the selection of models favoring precipitation increases or decreases harding et al 2012 vano et al 2014 given the strong variation between gcms and the consequent uncertainty in future conditions more extreme outcomes like those presented in fig 5 should also be included in planning efforts to stimulate thought around potential response strategies to the highest impact scenarios this will help to avoid basing such strategies on mean outcomes where the more extreme outcomes although still plausible are likely to be washed out shepard et al 2018 based on the success of relating future impacts on hydrology to historical snow to precipitation ratios within the crb application of this rapid assessment technique is most promising in other regions where snowmelt accounts for a significant portion of the annual hydrograph in particular its implementation is ideal for locations where snow season temperatures tend to be closer to the melting point such as within mountainous areas of northern california and the pacific northwest in these regions changes in future streamflow from warming are likely to be amplified due to higher rates of snowmelt per unit increase in temperature clow 2010 further tests of the methods applied in this study over different regions will be useful for understanding the utility of the technique for prediction of climate impacts on hydrology given key spatial differences after further testing the method might prove useful for practical climate change impact sensitivity mapping in other regions such as alaska south america and the tibetan plateau where comparatively less work has been done on making detailed quantitative model projections 5 conclusion we demonstrate the ability to predict basin scale future climate change impacts on streamflow using historical snow to precipitation ratios r2 0 58 the results highlight the importance of snow when examining future climate impacts on hydrology as well as the heterogeneity of basin responses at sub regional scales investigating future changes in streamflow at sub annual scales reveals a high degree of variability in both the magnitude and direction of change that we show can be predicted by hydroclimatic basin type and area snow dominant basins spa 3 10 3 km 2 were found to have the largest δqmam increase up to 320 and the largest δqjas decrease up to 60 given that these decreases are predicted to occur when the demand for water and energy is highest our results have implications for water and energy resource management moreover the empirical relationship we developed can be used to readily identify areas likely to undergo the greatest change this is useful for quickly and cheaply identifying areas to prioritize for resource management implementation of our relatively simple technique may in some contexts be preferred over the use of physically based process simulation models which although are more sophisticated are also more costly and time intensive for prediction of climate change impacts on hydrology our intent with this research was to develop a new empirical relationship that could be used to readily calculate climate change impacts on hydrology we test the performance of this relationship in this proof of concept study over 23 sub basins within the colorado river basin prior to application elsewhere further testing of the newly developed empirically based predictive technique presented herein is required to understand the scalability of the basin response types to other regions or possibly the globe at different spatial and temporal scales such an effort could result in the development of a basin scale index of water energy nexus

8416,study region surveys of stable isotopes of water in 50 boreal lakes were conducted during 2002 2017 as a component of alberta s oil sands acid sensitivity program in northeastern alberta study focus using an isotope mass balance approach watershed climatic and isotopic data were applied to estimate evaporation losses and residence time of lakes as well as to estimate water yield from watersheds new hydrological insights for the region site specific differences in water yield to 50 lakes over 16 years were found to be controlled by latitudinal gradients in climate wetland type lake watershed configuration and permafrost 19 plateau watersheds located northeast of fort mcmurray and in the birch and caribou mountains which contained significant permafrost were found to have similar water yield to permafrost poor watersheds if fen dominated 159 mm yr n 5 vs 166 mm yr n 31 and enhanced water yield 405 mm yr n 14 if bog dominated water yield was found to be systematically dependent on permafrost extent yielding up to several hundred millimetres of additional runoff in bog dominated systems temporal trend analysis indicates systemic momentum of change in hydrologic drivers over the 16 year period although few are statistically significant a new conceptual framework is proposed for classification of site to site permafrost thaw stage to improve water yield prediction which is

risk and to serve as an early warning indicator of potential deposition impacts from oil sands emissions including ph decrease in lakes and ecosystems cathart et al 2016 this and other major health and environmental concerns related to oil sands development have captured widening public interest in canada and worldwide gosselin et al 2010 from 1998 2017 a regional network of 50 representative lakes have been sampled and analyzed annually in the oil sands region under various programs including the regional aquatic monitoring program ramp joint oil sands monitoring josm and oil sands monitoring osm as a means to ascertain potential for lake acidification given relative proximity to oil sands mining operations fig 1 stable isotopes of water oxygen 18 and deuterium have been routinely incorporated within the monitoring program since 2002 to provide water balance control as the lakes are remote and impractical to gauge using conventional methods while the lakes were carefully monitored to detect potential for ph decrease many of the lakes have in fact undergone a significant increase in ph over the past two decades gibson et al 2019c several hypotheses possibly triggered by climate changes including lake eutrophication changes in permafrost status and or alteration of surface groundwater flowpaths in the lake watershed systems can be postulated as potential causes although as yet no clear evidence of a specific cause has been established the objectives of this paper are i to provide a water balance assessment of the 50 lakes over a 16 year period 2002 2017 including evaporation loss and water yield ii to spatially evaluate the major hydrologic drivers i e climate land cover permafrost across the region including differences between various lake sub groups iii to assess temporal changes in water balance indicators and to identify major drivers of these hydrologic changes and iv to evaluate potential water balance water quality linkages including ph increase in lakes our study assists in developing a better understanding of the relationship between runoff permafrost thaw and potential causes of ph increase in large numbers of lakes across northeastern alberta this study leverages insight gained from a previous nine year imb assessment of the ramp lakes 2002 2010 gibson et al 2015a and significant previous investigations of boreal plains hydrology and hydrogeology e g prepas et al 2001 gibson et al 2002 devito et al 2005 smerdon et al 2005 while characteristics such as bog cover permafrost extent and presence absence of thaw scars in bogs were previously assessed by gibson et al 2015a and found to be important hydrologic drivers morphometric properties such as lake elevation lake area and drainage basin area were also found to be hydrologically influential although permafrost and permafrost meltwater were found to be indistinguishable from modern precipitation based on oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition imb calculations suggested that thaw contributions of up to several hundred millimetres of runoff per year were occurring in 14 of the 50 lake watersheds gibson et al 2015a this observation was further supported by measurement of higher tritium content in such lakes deemed thaw lakes compared to a subset of other lakes in the area which was attributed to water sources derived from thawing of post 1950s permafrost gibson et al 2016b imb has also been used to interpret and map evaporation loss and water yield in a survey of 121 lakes across 28 000 km2 in the south athabasca oil sands saos area comparable to stony mountains sm area used in this study and demonstrated consistent spatial patterns overprinted by slight interannual variability in 3 consecutive years 2007 2009 importantly that assessment demonstrated spatial autocorrelation of derived water balance characteristics and reasonable agreement between isotope based and gauged estimates of water yield gibson et al 2019b higher water yields were generally found for lakes on peat plateaus such as the stony mountains sm birch mountains bm and caribou mountains cm due to presence of impermeable colorado group shale substrates and extensive bog cover 2 study sites as summarized in gibson et al 2015a the study lakes are situated in boreal plains and boreal shield regions of northeastern alberta fig 1 forty of the study watersheds are located within 200 km of fort mcmurray which lies close to the centre of current alberta oil sands operations ten sites are situated in the stony mountains sm eight west of fort mcmurray wf eleven northeast of fort mcmurray ne and eleven in the birch moun tains bm an additional ten lakes are located north of oil sands operations five in the caribou mountains cm and five north of lake athabasca s the sites in each sub region span a typical range in elevation land cover and hydrogeologic setting and are broadly representative of each area lakes range in size from small shallow lakes 1 m depth 0 5km2 to large lakes 30 m depth 0 43 km2 gibson et al 2015a watersheds draining to the study lakes typically contain less than 3 open water and so are considered to be headwater catchments watersheds are also wetland dominated prepas et al 2001 with bogs and fens often being most abundant in plateaus and lowlands respectively upland forests are mostly restricted to banks of well drained incised stream channels permanent streams rarely occur upstream of lakes but rather tend to form as drainage channels from lake outlets gibson et al 2015a while shield lakes north of lake athabasca s are underlain by relatively impermeable canadian shield rocks mantled by thin discontinuous quaternary deposits comparably impervious colorado group shale substrates underlie plateaus sm bm cm forming a shallow relatively impervious barrier to vertical groundwater movement more permeable substrates are typically found in lowland areas where bedrock consists of sandstone siltstone shale and carbonates of cretaceous to devonian age buried quaternary channels are a common feature of the region and as with stream channels are locally influential as sources and or sinks of water in some area lakes gibson et al 2019b while buried channels may be regionally influential none of the study lakes are known to be in direct communication with buried channels permafrost terrain which is currently unstable and in disequilibrium with the current climate plays an influential role in hydrologic conditions across the region vitt et al 1999 many bogs in northeastern alberta contain small isolated internal wet depressions collapse scars or internal lawns usually interpreted as thaw features while permafrost is mainly confined to treed bogs situated on plateaus six fen dominated plateau watersheds also contained both open and treed fens with significant permafrost 5 9 a summary of the study lake watershed characteristics by lake sub regions is provided in fig 2 additional statistics and site descriptions are provided in the accompanying data in brief article gibson et al 2019d additional discussion of the study sites was provided by gibson et al 2015a 3 method 3 1 water sampling and analysis water samples were collected from float plane or helicopter in 30 ml to 1 l high density polyethylene bottles with tightly sealed polypropylene lids which have been shown to be very effective at preventing evaporative isotopic fractionation for periods in excess of one year spangenberg 2012 procedures for sampling groundwater permafrost and permafrost meltwater for isotopic analysis followed standard field methods as described previously by gibson et al 2015a water sampling procedures for lakes have been described in detail previously gibson et al 2010a b gibson et al 2015a gibson et al 2015b b in general grab samples of water were collected at 1 m depth from lake centre locations during late august to early october when lakes are typically well mixed and vertically unstratified which has been shown in previous alberta lake surveys to provide representative samples for isotope mass balance analysis gibson et al 2002 stratification if present is expected to have led to enrichment of the epilimnion compared to the hypolimnion due to direct exposure to evaporation the latter of which also potentially has higher rates of groundwater exchange given the sampling strategy we would expect bias in stratified systems to favour sampling of the epilimnion thus leading to more enriched isotopic values being used in our analysis as compared to a representative average based on whole lake sampling in this case the imb analysis would predict lower water yields and so is likely to be conservative in terms of evaluating the magnitude of runoff including permafrost meltwater impacts a previous analysis of stratification effects on imb applied in the turkey lakes watershed ontario canada illustrated that near surface grab sampling of a deep lake turkey lake 32 m and a shallower lake little turkey lake 13 m led to underestimation of water yield by 18 and 6 respectively as compared to whole lake sampling gibson et al 2017 which we regard as a useful upper limit for uncertainty in applying the method to deep lakes stable isotope results for 18o and 2h are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow on a normalized smow slap scale analytical uncertainty over the course of the study 2002 to present is estimated to be less than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h further details regarding protocols and instrumentation are provided in gibson et al 2019d 3 2 isotope mass balance isotope mass balance imb methodology applied in this study uses the craig gordon model craig and gordon 19651965 as described in several previous publications gibson et al 2015a b with key indicators described here three principle water balance indicators derived from the imb are fraction of inflowing water lost by evaporation e i water yield wy and water residence time τ as noted by gibson et al 2015a b fraction of water loss by evaporation x is estimated based on the degree of evaporative isotopic enrichment of lake water relative to inflow 1 x e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dim e n s i o n l e s s where i and e are lake inflow and evaporation m 3 y r 1 respectively δ i and δ l are isotopic composition of inflow and lakewater respectively m is the enrichment slope which is mainly a function of humidity temperature and boundary layer conditions and δ which is the limiting isotopic enrichment under local atmospheric conditions controlled mainly by m and the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture see gibson et al 2015b several basic assumptions we make include that the lake is well mixed and that the isotopic composition of precipitation is representative of inflow to the lakes recommended equilibrium and kinetic fractionation factors for small lakes described by horita et al 2008 were used to characterize liquid vapour isotopic partitioning and a partial liquid vapour equilibrium model was used to estimate isotopic composition from atmospheric moisture from isotopic data defining the local meteoric water line and local evaporation line see gibson et al 2015b water yield wy is estimated using 2 w y e x p w a 1000 m m y r 1 where wa is the watershed area m 2 e e l a and p p l a e and p representing the annual depth equivalent of evaporation and precipitation m y r 1 respectively l a is the lake area m 2 and p is the precipitation on the lake area m 3 y r 1 conceptually water yield can be viewed as the depth of runoff from the watershed required to maintain the calculated lake inflow and e i that cannot be accounted for by direct precipitation on the lake lake water volume v was estimated from bathymetric surveys and then used to estimate residence time of water from 3 τ v i o r τ x v e y r climatological parameters required to calculate the isotope mass balance i e precipitation temperature relative humidity evaporation and precipitation rates were obtained by interpolation from the north american regional reanalysis dataset narr mesinger et al 2006 as discussed previously in gibson et al 2010a b 2015a calculation of lake area l a and watershed area w a was based on arcgis and archydro delineations wetland site types bog fen open water and uplands as well as sub classes which indicated permafrost cover were delimited using 1 20 000 black and white photography see gibson et al 2015a consistent with the method of halsey et al 2003 3 3 statistical analysis principle component analysis pca was used to assess potential relationships between site specific hydrologic indices and climate and landscape controls as demonstrated in gibson et al 2016a pca is a commonly used multivariate statistical technique that transforms and extracts meaningful information from large datasets with multiple variables in this study we use biplots which are overlays of the scores of individual lakes with loadings of variables such as water yield wy fen and bog to provide a statistical overview of key drivers proximity in the biplot is an indicator of similarity between lakes as well as an indicator of the importance of driving variables pca was carried out using sigmastat for windows 4 0 systat software inc the mann kendall mk non parametric test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was also used to identify trends in time series of isotopic and climate data as well as water balance outputs application of the method in hydrologic trend detection has been discussed in detail by hamed 2008 we use the mk tau values to indicate the presence of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend i e positive versus negative values and p values to gauge significance of trends trends are considered to be confirmed in cases where p 0 05 although the strength and direction of tau values and significance of the correlations are also considered as qualitative indicators in the assessment and following discussion mk statistics were computed using r r core team 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotope characteristics of lake water and input sources isotope analytical data for lakes and input sources sampled from 2002 2017 are provided in gibson et al 2019d and are plotted in δ 18o δ 2h space in fig 3 lake isotope data fig 3a are shown to plot below the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl established at mildred lake baer et al 2016 which is comparable to but likely more representative as a regional locus of hydrologic inputs than the edmonton lmwl which is based on canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip data from several decades ago gibson et al 2015a lakes are found to be grouped in tight linear clusters defining local evaporation lines lels fig 3a b the multi lake lel established for the period 2002 2010 is found to be only slightly different than for 2011 2017 with consistent ranges in both time periods evaporation line lel slopes fall within a narrow range between 5 20 and 5 41 averaging 5 29 with similar y axis intercepts δ2h ranges from 47 29 to 50 61 averaging 49 21 for individual lakes offset along the lel from the lmwl is the isotopic enrichment signal applied as the basis for calculating fraction of water loss by evaporation e i for each lake isotopic composition of input sources including snowpack groundwater soilwater and permafrost are shown to plot close to the lmwl for both edmonton and mildred lake largely reflecting modern meteoric water origins fig 3b snowpack is revealed to be systematically depleted in heavy isotopes relative to groundwater the latter sampled in industrial wells from a range of local aquifers and bedrock formations gibson et al 2015a presence of glaciogenic waters in some groundwaters is indicated by depleted isotopic compositions birks et al 2018 2019 soilwater obtained through azeotrophic distillation of soil samples collected in sealed double ziplock bags from shallow pits is shown to span the range from groundwaters to wetland surface waters the latter being evaporatively enriched in some locations as noted by gibson et al 2015a permafrost samples have isotopic signatures indistinguishable from modern precipitation such that direct labelling of permafrost source waters is not possible however meltwater contributions augment precipitation driven runoff and are thereby quantitatively recorded in the imb analysis of the lake mean isotopic composition of precipitation δ p for each watershed is estimated based on empirically derived relationships between latitude elevation and isotope composition across north america bowen and wilkinson 2002 interpolations were performed using the annual narr climatology mesinger et al 2006 and the δ 2h of monthly precipitation was calculated assuming that precipitation would follow the relationship defined by the amount weighted mildred lake lmwl baer et al 2016 4 2 temporal variations and trends in lake water isotopic composition time series of 18o isotopic composition of lakes as grouped by lake sub regions fig 4 a illustrate regular fluctuations associated with interannual hydroclimatic variability as well as a high degree of temporal and spatial autocorrelation i e year to year shifts for individual lakes are systematic and regular not random and geographically clustered lake groups display similar responses positive mk tau values see gibson et al 2019d suggest upward trends in δ18o in 30 of 50 lakes although only 2 lakes ne2 and bm7 show significant p 0 05 upward trends in δ18o similar results are obtained for δ2h positive mk tau values are found in 32 of 50 lakes although only 3 lakes s1 s5 and bm7 show significant p 0 05 upward trends in δ2h time series isotopic data are further interpreted in the context of the imb assessment in section 4 4 4 3 temporal trends in climate parameters time series of site specific narr climate parameters including 2 m air temperature 2 m relative humidity and precipitation and evaporation at the surface are summarized by lake sub group fig 5 in general the plots illustrate regular fluctuations associated with interannual hydroclimatic variability as well as a high degree of temporal and spatial autocorrelation climate parameters appear to be similar in nearby lakes and interannual variability appears to be more pronounced than lake to lake variations for the climate parameters than for δ18o or δ2h see fig 4 this is characteristic of wetland dominated landscape where spatial differences in watershed lake hydrologic response are more dependent on watershed characteristics than on spatial climate variability as noted in previous assessments gibson et al 2010b 2015a importantly narr climate data allows for spatial variations across the lake network to be approximated improving the overall comparative strength of imb across the network mann kendall trend tests gibson et al 2019d reveal positive mk tau values for most climate parameters at most sites 260 300 although statistically significant trends are limited to only a few lakes notably temperature and evaporation flux weighted temperature was significantly upward trending for bm6 cm1 cm3 s3 and s4 evaporation was significantly upward trending for most wf bm and cm lakes although precipitation and humidity trends were largely insignificant time series climate data are further interpreted in the context of the imb assessment in section 4 4 4 4 water balance indicators using isotopic composition of the lakes on a site by site year by year basis modelled values for isotopic composition of precipitation at each site narr climatological data and site specific lake watershed characteristics we estimate evaporation inflow x from eq 1 water yield from eq 2 and water residence time from eq 3 complete results and trend statistics are provided in gibson et al 2019d and summarized by lake group in table 1 and figs 4b and 6 note that runoff ratio was estimated as water yield depth divided by precipitation depth on the watershed area and isotopic compositions of precipitation and atmospheric moisture were estimated in a consistent way with a previous 9 year assessment for the ramp lakes see gibson et al 2015a wide ranging evaporation inflow conditions were noted for lakes across the network with values ranging from 4 to 66 of inflow which also confirms that lakes had a reciprocal range in outflows of between 33 96 of inflow while low flow or zero flow periods are commonly observed in summer and winter in outflow streams in the region no such annual or interannual no flow periods for the study lakes are indicated by the isotope balance results we emphasize that while these results indicate that outflow likely occurred from all lakes in all monitoring years it does not imply that the outflow was continuous nor does it preclude that lake outflow may have become intermittent or that it may have been related mainly to spring freshet as previously noted in the region ramp 2015 evaporation inflow for the various lake groups was found to be less than the variability across the network with values decreasing with increasing latitude low permafrost systems i e less than 2 permafrost were found to have more evaporative water balances than lakes in watersheds with significant permafrost table 1 suggesting higher throughputs in the latter water yield was found to range from 22 to 618 mm year with average values in the various lake sub regions spanning from 112 to 343 mm year table 1 in general the highest water yields were found for the northern plateau lakes ne bm cm although water yield from sm lakes was fairly high as well and exceeded that in low lying boreal plains and shield areas wf s fen dominated plateau lakes with permafrost were found to have similar water yields 159 mm yr to fen dominated non permafrost lakes 166 mm yr situated mainly in lowlands whereas bog dominated plateau lakes with permafrost were found to have characteristically higher water yields on average 405 mm yr table 1 gibson et al 2019b demonstrated good agreement between imb and gauged estimates of water yield for the saos area which is consistent with the sm lakes area in our analysis although this region does not appear to be significantly affected by active permafrost thaw runoff ratios display similar patterns to water yield owing to low precipitation gradients across the region classification of bog dominated permafrost lakes deemed thaw lakes by gibson et al 2015a was previously described and was based on their occurrence in areas with abundant bog collapse scaring as well as anomalously high tritium content which was inferred to reflect recent thawing of modern permafrost gibson et al 2016b a similar finding of high tritium in thaw lakes has been recorded in other areas of northern canada and elsewhere e g bond and carr 2018 wan et al 2019a b a most notable feature of the runoff ratio estimates is that bog dominated thaw lakes had average runoff ratios of close to 80 with values as high as 120 in some cases in contrast average runoff ratio is found to be 31 for non permafrost lakes and 33 for fen dominated plateaus this is in close agreement with values for the runoff coefficient of 20 30 for boreal wetlands reported by devito and mendoza 2010 here we ascertain based on a 78 longer observation period than gibson et al 2015a 2016b that there is a significant detectable enhancement of runoff due to permafrost meltwater contributions in bog dominated watersheds in the ramp network table 1 temporal trends in water yields are shown by sub group in fig 4b and in particular capture interannual fluctuations corresponding to wet and dry years box plots illustrate ranges of annual water yield and precipitation across each lake sub region over time fig 6 with one exception precipitation is found to exceed water yield in non permafrost sub regions in all years sm wf s but water yield often exceeded precipitation in dry years within many permafrost affected sub regions ne bm cm water residence times were found to range from 0 22 to 10 81 years for individual lakes the main determinant being the depth rather than the area of the lake residence time is also found to increase along a latitudinal gradient with sub region average values ranging from a low of 0 84 years in ne lakes to a high of 3 02 years in s lakes bog dominated thaw lakes typically had longer residence times than non permafrost lakes 1 36 versus 2 44 years respectively while residence time does not appear to be factor in determining thaw lake status longer residence times would presumably serve to attenuate the isotopic signature of higher thaw source throughputs than would shorter residence times it is important to note that permafrost degradation has likely occurred over the past century in this region possibly since the little ice age zhang et al 2006 significantly longer than the residence time of the lakes similarity of fen dominated plateau lakes and non permafrost lakes is noted which may reflect that frozen ground in fens may be less influential on runoff processes than for bogs mann kendall trend tests gibson et al 2019d reveal a combination of both positive mk tau values for e i wy and wy p 97 150 and negative values 53 150 although only a few lakes have significant trends 4 150 all positive residence time was found to be mostly negative trending 33 50 lakes although only sm7 and bm8 had significant negative trends 4 5 hydrological drivers and indicators pca was conducted to further explore relationships between the derived site specific water balance outputs evaporation inflow runoff ratio water yield and residence time and the underlying hydrologic drivers of the system including location climate parameters lake watershed characteristics land cover characteristics and permafrost results are summarized in a pca biplot fig 7 as noted variations along the pc1 axis accounted for 37 39 of variability in the dataset and variations along pc2 accounted for 16 51 of variability in the dataset combined these factors explain 53 90 of variability variations along the pc1 axis correspond mainly to the influence of land cover bog versus fen and permafrost which occurs mainly in the plateau bogs note that one landscape sub type bog forest collapse scar bfxc which was shown by gibson et al 2015a to be the most influential water yield driver is indistinguishable from bog and permafrost reflecting nearly ubiquitous occurrence of collapse features in all regional plateau bogs weaker influences on pc1 include dba and ow the most influential factors for pc2 are upland elevation and la plotting in the lower left quadrant fig 7 climate drivers p e t and elevation are apparently influential for both axes and for isotopic composition of lake water and e i plotting in the lower right quadrant la v dba bog and permafrost appear to be most influential for wy wy p and τ it is important to note that vectors for these water balance parameters are roughly perpendicular to the climatic drivers p e and t as they are with the isotopic composition of lakes and e i and so are apparently providing unique information beyond the isotope based metrics such as e i used in some previous assessments turner et al 2014 macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 precipitation appears to be more influential with respect to hydrologic conditions in the southern sub groups sm wf than it is in the remaining groups which is consistent with reduced influence of permafrost wy and wy p are also normal to elevation which does not support use of elevation alone to predict runoff or runoff ratio suggested by previous analyses western resource solutions 2004 overall the pca also reveals distinct clustering of sub region groups fig 7 confirming similarity of drivers and water balance parameters among nearby lakes latitude is also an underlying driver of the regional climate gradients but was removed from the pca to confirm that sub group similarity is based on site characteristics rather than simply due to locational differences as we have shown as reported by gibson et al 2015a very distinct clusters are noted for cm and s lakes whereby cm lakes are distinguished by greater extent of bog cover and permafrost in their catchment areas and shield lakes which lack significant bog area are predominantly influenced by higher uplands which ranges between 31 and 56 note that s1 is somewhat of an outlier among the s sub group plotting among the cm cluster but due to its much larger volume v rather than due to bog cover or permafrost bm ne and sm wf are also significantly clustered importantly bog plateau thaw lakes in bm and ne as identified by star symbols are shown to be shifted towards the upper right quadrant revealing systematically larger la v τ wy and wy p for these lake watershed systems 4 6 influence of thawing permafrost correlation between permafrost bog area and collapse scar area and wy or wy p for the study watersheds was first noted by gibson et al 2015a and is reaffirmed here based on a longer observational time series systematic links between thawing permafrost and runoff are clear with direct evidence of permafrost collapse being an important constraint on this interpretation and the causal linkage of these processes gibson et al 2015a another important observation that emerges after 16 years of monitoring is that water yield varies systematically although non linearly with permafrost fig 8 whereby bog dominated plateau watersheds with intermediate permafrost extent appear to have the highest calculated water yields as compared to those with both more extensive permafrost cover and less extensive permafrost cover given that permafrost extent is closely tied to permafrost degradation across the region and presuming that bog dominated plateau watersheds represent sites at different stages along a permafrost thaw trajectory we postulate that water yield appears to increase in bog dominated systems as permafrost degrades until roughly half the permafrost is thawed and then it reduces again as the watersheds completely thaw other drivers in addition to permafrost extent appear to be uninfluential in bog dominated areas however less systematic permafrost vs water yield response at fen dominated sites may reflect more complex runoff processes controls at these locations fig 8 based on a similar isotopic perspective comparable trajectories of water balance changes have been reported in other regions experiencing widespread permafrost thaw see wan et al 2019a we hereby propose a new conceptual framework for water balance characterization and prediction for lakes in thawing permafrost terrain conceptually permafrost thaw can be considered an event hydrograph with a rising limb and falling limb controlled by the strength of the permafrost meltwater pulse fig 9 a we anticipate that permafrost degradation will initially lead to increased runoff or water yield as noted in fig 8 and in previous studies wan et al 2019a b these additional contributions will eventually peak and then recede as permafrost degrades and eventually as it may no longer form permafrost degradation as it proceeds may lead to enhanced recharge below the pre existing active layer enhancement of subsurface hydraulic connectivity formation and alteration of subsurface runoff pathways development of taliks strengthening of hydraulic exchange with features such as buried channels capture of drainage from outside topographic divides that previously governed runoff and or formation of new open water bodies collapse scars or internal lawns moreover early thawing of extensive permafrost may be less effective at generating water yield due to contributions being limited to supra permafrost meltwater whereas formation of taliks and greater sub permafrost interaction is expected to provide conduits for meltwater as thawing progresses eventually thaw sources are expected to decline as ground ice storage slowly dwindles the ground surface subsides and collapse scars are formed although the shape and duration of the meltwater pulse will vary depending on initial permafrost conditions climate change effects and other site specific controlling factors we suggest that this basic framework can be applied to describe the stages of permafrost thaw response at individual sites across various sub regions and or at the regional scale the shape of the meltwater pulse for northern alberta is undoubtedly influenced by prevalence of permafrost bearing plateau bogs including factors such as whether or not collapse features occur within or on the periphery of bogs the later expectedly generating greater runoff runoff sources are likewise expected to transition both spatially and temporally from predominantly permafrost meltwater sources to precipitation dominated sources along such permafrost degradation trajectories gradients wan et al 2019a using water yield and water yield trends wytau vs wy from the 16 year lakes dataset we illustrate classification of meltwater intensity and rate of change across the study region fig 9b we use average water yield based on our 16 year dataset and calculate wytau which is a normalized index of the strength and direction of change in wy over the study period similar to a spearman rank order tau value significance of trends is similarly evaluated with p values in this site specific assessment wytau is applied to identify increasing and decreasing trends in runoff and average wy is used to separate high versus low wy systems this allows for differentiation of sites into four categories that correspond to progressive stages along the meltwater hydrograph fig 9a overall it is evident that bog dominated thaw lakes fall mainly within the upper right quadrant category 1 signifying high increasing wy this accounts for 8 of 14 bog plateau thaw lakes and likely reflects conditions at these sites typical of the rising limb of the meltwater hydrograph as such it is expected that these watersheds will likely undergo increases in runoff at least in the short term additional thaw lakes 4 of 14 thaw lakes fall within the lower right quadrant category 2 signifying high decreasing wy these sites appear to have already crested but still have high wy and so conceptually can be considered as being on the falling limb of the meltwater hydrograph the remainder of bog dominated thaw lakes 2 of 14 thaw lakes fall within the bottom left quadrant category 3 signifying low decreasing wy we postulate that these sites are on the recession limb of the meltwater hydrograph and complete the meltwater hydrograph cycle it is interesting to note that that the most northerly subgroup the cm lakes appear to be on the rising limb whereas bm lakes situated in the heart of the region appear to straddle peak meltwater conditions and ne lakes situated to the south are clearly on the falling limb or recession we can also infer from field observations and based on previous studies of wetlands in the region that the southern parts of the study area including the stony mountains sm and likely west of fort mcmurray wf have only localized occurrences of permafrost peatland as well as more abundant peatland with internal lawns signifying permafrost degradation e g vitt et al 1994 1999 beilman et al 2000 halsey et al 2003 we interpret these areas to be predominantly post thaw systems responsive mainly to precipitation and therefore can also be described in the hydrograph model as post recession plotting in the upper left quadrant fig 9 these lakes include many fen dominated plateau lakes category 4 and can mostly be classified as post thaw systems with low wy although as we note 5 fen dominated permafrost bearing 5 9 watersheds are also included these five systems appear to be producing some increased runoff but may be less productive than bog dominated systems although for unknown reasons due to lack of bog cover and minor permafrost influence we expect that increases in wy recorded for the majority of lakes falling in quadrant 4 is likely attributable to increased precipitation and or storage changes as noted by gibson et al 2015a thawing of permafrost in the more northerly subregions ne bm and cm is currently the main driver of hydrologic conditions in these areas as compared to more southerly subregions sm and wf where precipitation dominates while it is not clear how long permafrost thaw will continue to augment discharge in these systems it is expected that future patterns in the post thaw phase will likely mimic hydrology in the more southerly subregions based on the range of wy observed in this study we estimate that permafrost thaw may account for up to 300 to 400 mm year of additional runoff in the region particularly on the bog dominated plateaus considering that some watersheds in the cm bm and ne areas are still evidently subject to increases in wy peak conditions in these areas may be somewhat higher in general potential runoff enhancement due to permafrost thaw is in broad agreement with enhancement in wy attributed to permafrost thaw in discontinuous permafrost terrain in the yellow river headwaters of the qinghai tibet plateau wan et al 2019 which may account for up to 500 mm of additional runoff to thaw lakes in extensive discontinuous permafrost versus seasonally frozen ground watersheds located nearby given the large number of isotopic surveys of thaw lakes that have now been conducted in north america e g macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 wolfe et al 2011 turner et al 2014 siberia ala aho et al 2018 and qinghai tibet cui et al 2018 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2018 we suggest that these studies should be re examined applying the wy metric in addition to enrichment or e i metrics to gain a better understanding of the net impact of permafrost thaw across a range of cold regions settings importantly application of this approach to time series survey data will allow for clearer assessment of the stage and likely future trends in runoff related to permafrost thaw it is interesting to consider whether or not the permafrost thaw contribution estimates of up to 300 400 mm year 4 8 6 4 m per 16 years are realistic considering current knowledge of soil and permafrost characteristics including thickness and distribution in the area one important characteristic of permafrost in the region is a lack of massive ground ice as noted by o neill et al 2018 peat soils have been shown typically to have a porosity ranging from 80 90 when frozen zoltai and tarnocai 1975 in a simple vertical system generation of the estimated 4 8 6 4 m of runoff would require a minimum thawing of 5 3 8 0 m over the 16 year study period given that this level of augmentation to produce peak water yields is noted for watersheds with close to 50 permafrost cover we suggest that degradation in the zones with permafrost would need to be roughly twice that or the equivalent of thawing of 10 16 m of frozen soil while direct measurements of permafrost thickness are not available for comparison across the study region the veracity of our estimate can be compared to at least one canada wide study that used a process based model of northern ecosystem soil temperature nest to simulate changes in permafrost conditions including depth to the permafrost table and depth to the permafrost base since the little ice age zhang et al 2006 in this analysis the permafrost region was subdivided into permanent and ephemeral zones the latter being the the unstable permafrost zone subject to active melting for the ephemeral permafrost zone which accounts for 11 of canada s land mass situated near the southern limits of discontinuous permafrost and also includes our study area zhang et al 2006 estimated that the permafrost base had been reduced on average by 17 m with a maximum reduction of 50 m in some areas while these estimates are a first approximation they suggest that our own calculations and understanding of the permafrost thaw processes in the study region are plausible it is important to note that peat deposits where permafrost has tended to form are mostly limited to less than 10 m thickness although underlying drift thicknesses may range from 0 to 200 m while bogs are likely the main source of meltwater the strength of the water yield response suggests that alteration of the fundamental subsurface hydrology and flowpaths may be occurring due to the observed ph increase occurring in many lakes within the study network gibson et al 2019d it is also imperative that the role of permafrost thaw on runoff water chemistry be considered as well as the timing peak and eventual decline in such contributions permafrost degradation in bogs is expected to lead to collapse and release of dissolved solids including inorganic carbon and may lead to significant enhancements in surface groundwater interactions as ombrotrophic bogs potentially will collapse and transition to minerotrophic fens one important finding in this study is the clear identification of unique hydrologic responses in bog and fen dominated watersheds and secondarily differences noted between response of lakes in fen dominated plateaus and fen dominated lowlands mechanistic differences in ph and geochemistry of these watershed types are expected to be important in developing a better understanding of the significance and trajectory of climate change and development impacts across the region 5 conclusions and implications hydrology of 50 wetland dominated watersheds in northeastern alberta is found to be driven by a combination of factors including land cover watershed morphometry and climate changes in the boreal hydrologic system are attributed mainly to permafrost thaw which can account for several hundred millimetres of sustained runoff to lakes and presumably to rivers for decades or longer one important determinant of hydrologic changes in the watersheds is presence of bogs and fens the bog fen ratio and permafrost while relatively short term studies have characterized hydrology of wetland dominated watersheds in alberta prepas et al 2001 gibson et al 2002 this study builds upon a 9 year imb assessment by gibson et al 2015a to provide a valuable 16 year imb assessment of hydrologic indicators for 50 lakes and their respective watersheds that represents an improved long term quantitative characterization of important hydrological processes in a largely ungauged region significantly this study demonstrates a refined approach for assessing permafrost thaw status allowing for sites to be classified as being on the rising limb peak falling limb or recession limb of the permafrost meltwater runoff pulse it is anticipated that this framework may be used to better understand quantify and map permafrost impacts from regional surveys in active permafrost degradation zones importantly the existence of a permafrost thaw cycle helps to explain why hydrologic impacts due to monotonic regional changes in climate drivers especially temperature precipitation and or evaporation may not result in monotonic changes to water balance of lakes or their watersheds as noted by gibson et al 2015a understanding of the permafrost degradation process in the region would benefit from additional monitoring and field work to directly characterize the processes operating in areas with degrading permafrost and to better understand the likely impacts of eventual decline in meltwater sources possible impacts may include lower water levels reduced runoff ph and chemical changes and potentially might lead to lake

8416,study region surveys of stable isotopes of water in 50 boreal lakes were conducted during 2002 2017 as a component of alberta s oil sands acid sensitivity program in northeastern alberta study focus using an isotope mass balance approach watershed climatic and isotopic data were applied to estimate evaporation losses and residence time of lakes as well as to estimate water yield from watersheds new hydrological insights for the region site specific differences in water yield to 50 lakes over 16 years were found to be controlled by latitudinal gradients in climate wetland type lake watershed configuration and permafrost 19 plateau watersheds located northeast of fort mcmurray and in the birch and caribou mountains which contained significant permafrost were found to have similar water yield to permafrost poor watersheds if fen dominated 159 mm yr n 5 vs 166 mm yr n 31 and enhanced water yield 405 mm yr n 14 if bog dominated water yield was found to be systematically dependent on permafrost extent yielding up to several hundred millimetres of additional runoff in bog dominated systems temporal trend analysis indicates systemic momentum of change in hydrologic drivers over the 16 year period although few are statistically significant a new conceptual framework is proposed for classification of site to site permafrost thaw stage to improve water yield prediction which is expected to influence lake water quality including observed ph increases noted previously for many lakes in the region keywords isotopes lakes water balance evaporation boreal bog fen permafrost thaw 1 introduction isotope mass balance imb methods have been widely applied to characterize water balance in surveys across canada arnoux et al 2017a b arnoux et al 2017cc brock et al 2009 wolfe et al 2011 turner et al 2014 yi et al 2008 gibson and reid 2010 2014 gibson et al 1993 2016a 2017 across the contiguous united states brooks et al 2014 along joint international waterways such as the great lakes jasechko et al 2014 and worldwide e g petermann et al 2018 vystavna et al 2018 wan et al 2019a regional assessments have been carried out periodically in the oil sands region northeastern alberta prepas et al 2001 bennett et al 2008 gibson et al 2002 2010a 2015a 2019a b and across western canada in support of assessments of acidifying sulfur and nitrogen deposition in ungauged or under monitored regions scott et al 2010 jeffries et al 2010 gibson et al 2010b 2018 the critical loads approach applied to map sensitivity of lakes and watersheds to deposition of acidifying sulfur and nitrogen is based on the hypothesis that lake acidification is buffered by base cation weathering in the catchment and therefore predicts that acidification should be be dependent upon both the water yield to lakes a k a watershed runoff and the runoff lake water chemistry see henriksen et al 1992 importantly critical loads mapping and monitoring in the oil sands region has been applied to assess risk and to serve as an early warning indicator of potential deposition impacts from oil sands emissions including ph decrease in lakes and ecosystems cathart et al 2016 this and other major health and environmental concerns related to oil sands development have captured widening public interest in canada and worldwide gosselin et al 2010 from 1998 2017 a regional network of 50 representative lakes have been sampled and analyzed annually in the oil sands region under various programs including the regional aquatic monitoring program ramp joint oil sands monitoring josm and oil sands monitoring osm as a means to ascertain potential for lake acidification given relative proximity to oil sands mining operations fig 1 stable isotopes of water oxygen 18 and deuterium have been routinely incorporated within the monitoring program since 2002 to provide water balance control as the lakes are remote and impractical to gauge using conventional methods while the lakes were carefully monitored to detect potential for ph decrease many of the lakes have in fact undergone a significant increase in ph over the past two decades gibson et al 2019c several hypotheses possibly triggered by climate changes including lake eutrophication changes in permafrost status and or alteration of surface groundwater flowpaths in the lake watershed systems can be postulated as potential causes although as yet no clear evidence of a specific cause has been established the objectives of this paper are i to provide a water balance assessment of the 50 lakes over a 16 year period 2002 2017 including evaporation loss and water yield ii to spatially evaluate the major hydrologic drivers i e climate land cover permafrost across the region including differences between various lake sub groups iii to assess temporal changes in water balance indicators and to identify major drivers of these hydrologic changes and iv to evaluate potential water balance water quality linkages including ph increase in lakes our study assists in developing a better understanding of the relationship between runoff permafrost thaw and potential causes of ph increase in large numbers of lakes across northeastern alberta this study leverages insight gained from a previous nine year imb assessment of the ramp lakes 2002 2010 gibson et al 2015a and significant previous investigations of boreal plains hydrology and hydrogeology e g prepas et al 2001 gibson et al 2002 devito et al 2005 smerdon et al 2005 while characteristics such as bog cover permafrost extent and presence absence of thaw scars in bogs were previously assessed by gibson et al 2015a and found to be important hydrologic drivers morphometric properties such as lake elevation lake area and drainage basin area were also found to be hydrologically influential although permafrost and permafrost meltwater were found to be indistinguishable from modern precipitation based on oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition imb calculations suggested that thaw contributions of up to several hundred millimetres of runoff per year were occurring in 14 of the 50 lake watersheds gibson et al 2015a this observation was further supported by measurement of higher tritium content in such lakes deemed thaw lakes compared to a subset of other lakes in the area which was attributed to water sources derived from thawing of post 1950s permafrost gibson et al 2016b imb has also been used to interpret and map evaporation loss and water yield in a survey of 121 lakes across 28 000 km2 in the south athabasca oil sands saos area comparable to stony mountains sm area used in this study and demonstrated consistent spatial patterns overprinted by slight interannual variability in 3 consecutive years 2007 2009 importantly that assessment demonstrated spatial autocorrelation of derived water balance characteristics and reasonable agreement between isotope based and gauged estimates of water yield gibson et al 2019b higher water yields were generally found for lakes on peat plateaus such as the stony mountains sm birch mountains bm and caribou mountains cm due to presence of impermeable colorado group shale substrates and extensive bog cover 2 study sites as summarized in gibson et al 2015a the study lakes are situated in boreal plains and boreal shield regions of northeastern alberta fig 1 forty of the study watersheds are located within 200 km of fort mcmurray which lies close to the centre of current alberta oil sands operations ten sites are situated in the stony mountains sm eight west of fort mcmurray wf eleven northeast of fort mcmurray ne and eleven in the birch moun tains bm an additional ten lakes are located north of oil sands operations five in the caribou mountains cm and five north of lake athabasca s the sites in each sub region span a typical range in elevation land cover and hydrogeologic setting and are broadly representative of each area lakes range in size from small shallow lakes 1 m depth 0 5km2 to large lakes 30 m depth 0 43 km2 gibson et al 2015a watersheds draining to the study lakes typically contain less than 3 open water and so are considered to be headwater catchments watersheds are also wetland dominated prepas et al 2001 with bogs and fens often being most abundant in plateaus and lowlands respectively upland forests are mostly restricted to banks of well drained incised stream channels permanent streams rarely occur upstream of lakes but rather tend to form as drainage channels from lake outlets gibson et al 2015a while shield lakes north of lake athabasca s are underlain by relatively impermeable canadian shield rocks mantled by thin discontinuous quaternary deposits comparably impervious colorado group shale substrates underlie plateaus sm bm cm forming a shallow relatively impervious barrier to vertical groundwater movement more permeable substrates are typically found in lowland areas where bedrock consists of sandstone siltstone shale and carbonates of cretaceous to devonian age buried quaternary channels are a common feature of the region and as with stream channels are locally influential as sources and or sinks of water in some area lakes gibson et al 2019b while buried channels may be regionally influential none of the study lakes are known to be in direct communication with buried channels permafrost terrain which is currently unstable and in disequilibrium with the current climate plays an influential role in hydrologic conditions across the region vitt et al 1999 many bogs in northeastern alberta contain small isolated internal wet depressions collapse scars or internal lawns usually interpreted as thaw features while permafrost is mainly confined to treed bogs situated on plateaus six fen dominated plateau watersheds also contained both open and treed fens with significant permafrost 5 9 a summary of the study lake watershed characteristics by lake sub regions is provided in fig 2 additional statistics and site descriptions are provided in the accompanying data in brief article gibson et al 2019d additional discussion of the study sites was provided by gibson et al 2015a 3 method 3 1 water sampling and analysis water samples were collected from float plane or helicopter in 30 ml to 1 l high density polyethylene bottles with tightly sealed polypropylene lids which have been shown to be very effective at preventing evaporative isotopic fractionation for periods in excess of one year spangenberg 2012 procedures for sampling groundwater permafrost and permafrost meltwater for isotopic analysis followed standard field methods as described previously by gibson et al 2015a water sampling procedures for lakes have been described in detail previously gibson et al 2010a b gibson et al 2015a gibson et al 2015b b in general grab samples of water were collected at 1 m depth from lake centre locations during late august to early october when lakes are typically well mixed and vertically unstratified which has been shown in previous alberta lake surveys to provide representative samples for isotope mass balance analysis gibson et al 2002 stratification if present is expected to have led to enrichment of the epilimnion compared to the hypolimnion due to direct exposure to evaporation the latter of which also potentially has higher rates of groundwater exchange given the sampling strategy we would expect bias in stratified systems to favour sampling of the epilimnion thus leading to more enriched isotopic values being used in our analysis as compared to a representative average based on whole lake sampling in this case the imb analysis would predict lower water yields and so is likely to be conservative in terms of evaluating the magnitude of runoff including permafrost meltwater impacts a previous analysis of stratification effects on imb applied in the turkey lakes watershed ontario canada illustrated that near surface grab sampling of a deep lake turkey lake 32 m and a shallower lake little turkey lake 13 m led to underestimation of water yield by 18 and 6 respectively as compared to whole lake sampling gibson et al 2017 which we regard as a useful upper limit for uncertainty in applying the method to deep lakes stable isotope results for 18o and 2h are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow on a normalized smow slap scale analytical uncertainty over the course of the study 2002 to present is estimated to be less than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h further details regarding protocols and instrumentation are provided in gibson et al 2019d 3 2 isotope mass balance isotope mass balance imb methodology applied in this study uses the craig gordon model craig and gordon 19651965 as described in several previous publications gibson et al 2015a b with key indicators described here three principle water balance indicators derived from the imb are fraction of inflowing water lost by evaporation e i water yield wy and water residence time τ as noted by gibson et al 2015a b fraction of water loss by evaporation x is estimated based on the degree of evaporative isotopic enrichment of lake water relative to inflow 1 x e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dim e n s i o n l e s s where i and e are lake inflow and evaporation m 3 y r 1 respectively δ i and δ l are isotopic composition of inflow and lakewater respectively m is the enrichment slope which is mainly a function of humidity temperature and boundary layer conditions and δ which is the limiting isotopic enrichment under local atmospheric conditions controlled mainly by m and the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture see gibson et al 2015b several basic assumptions we make include that the lake is well mixed and that the isotopic composition of precipitation is representative of inflow to the lakes recommended equilibrium and kinetic fractionation factors for small lakes described by horita et al 2008 were used to characterize liquid vapour isotopic partitioning and a partial liquid vapour equilibrium model was used to estimate isotopic composition from atmospheric moisture from isotopic data defining the local meteoric water line and local evaporation line see gibson et al 2015b water yield wy is estimated using 2 w y e x p w a 1000 m m y r 1 where wa is the watershed area m 2 e e l a and p p l a e and p representing the annual depth equivalent of evaporation and precipitation m y r 1 respectively l a is the lake area m 2 and p is the precipitation on the lake area m 3 y r 1 conceptually water yield can be viewed as the depth of runoff from the watershed required to maintain the calculated lake inflow and e i that cannot be accounted for by direct precipitation on the lake lake water volume v was estimated from bathymetric surveys and then used to estimate residence time of water from 3 τ v i o r τ x v e y r climatological parameters required to calculate the isotope mass balance i e precipitation temperature relative humidity evaporation and precipitation rates were obtained by interpolation from the north american regional reanalysis dataset narr mesinger et al 2006 as discussed previously in gibson et al 2010a b 2015a calculation of lake area l a and watershed area w a was based on arcgis and archydro delineations wetland site types bog fen open water and uplands as well as sub classes which indicated permafrost cover were delimited using 1 20 000 black and white photography see gibson et al 2015a consistent with the method of halsey et al 2003 3 3 statistical analysis principle component analysis pca was used to assess potential relationships between site specific hydrologic indices and climate and landscape controls as demonstrated in gibson et al 2016a pca is a commonly used multivariate statistical technique that transforms and extracts meaningful information from large datasets with multiple variables in this study we use biplots which are overlays of the scores of individual lakes with loadings of variables such as water yield wy fen and bog to provide a statistical overview of key drivers proximity in the biplot is an indicator of similarity between lakes as well as an indicator of the importance of driving variables pca was carried out using sigmastat for windows 4 0 systat software inc the mann kendall mk non parametric test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was also used to identify trends in time series of isotopic and climate data as well as water balance outputs application of the method in hydrologic trend detection has been discussed in detail by hamed 2008 we use the mk tau values to indicate the presence of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend i e positive versus negative values and p values to gauge significance of trends trends are considered to be confirmed in cases where p 0 05 although the strength and direction of tau values and significance of the correlations are also considered as qualitative indicators in the assessment and following discussion mk statistics were computed using r r core team 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotope characteristics of lake water and input sources isotope analytical data for lakes and input sources sampled from 2002 2017 are provided in gibson et al 2019d and are plotted in δ 18o δ 2h space in fig 3 lake isotope data fig 3a are shown to plot below the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl established at mildred lake baer et al 2016 which is comparable to but likely more representative as a regional locus of hydrologic inputs than the edmonton lmwl which is based on canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip data from several decades ago gibson et al 2015a lakes are found to be grouped in tight linear clusters defining local evaporation lines lels fig 3a b the multi lake lel established for the period 2002 2010 is found to be only slightly different than for 2011 2017 with consistent ranges in both time periods evaporation line lel slopes fall within a narrow range between 5 20 and 5 41 averaging 5 29 with similar y axis intercepts δ2h ranges from 47 29 to 50 61 averaging 49 21 for individual lakes offset along the lel from the lmwl is the isotopic enrichment signal applied as the basis for calculating fraction of water loss by evaporation e i for each lake isotopic composition of input sources including snowpack groundwater soilwater and permafrost are shown to plot close to the lmwl for both edmonton and mildred lake largely reflecting modern meteoric water origins fig 3b snowpack is revealed to be systematically depleted in heavy isotopes relative to groundwater the latter sampled in industrial wells from a range of local aquifers and bedrock formations gibson et al 2015a presence of glaciogenic waters in some groundwaters is indicated by depleted isotopic compositions birks et al 2018 2019 soilwater obtained through azeotrophic distillation of soil samples collected in sealed double ziplock bags from shallow pits is shown to span the range from groundwaters to wetland surface waters the latter being evaporatively enriched in some locations as noted by gibson et al 2015a permafrost samples have isotopic signatures indistinguishable from modern precipitation such that direct labelling of permafrost source waters is not possible however meltwater contributions augment precipitation driven runoff and are thereby quantitatively recorded in the imb analysis of the lake mean isotopic composition of precipitation δ p for each watershed is estimated based on empirically derived relationships between latitude elevation and isotope composition across north america bowen and wilkinson 2002 interpolations were performed using the annual narr climatology mesinger et al 2006 and the δ 2h of monthly precipitation was calculated assuming that precipitation would follow the relationship defined by the amount weighted mildred lake lmwl baer et al 2016 4 2 temporal variations and trends in lake water isotopic composition time series of 18o isotopic composition of lakes as grouped by lake sub regions fig 4 a illustrate regular fluctuations associated with interannual hydroclimatic variability as well as a high degree of temporal and spatial autocorrelation i e year to year shifts for individual lakes are systematic and regular not random and geographically clustered lake groups display similar responses positive mk tau values see gibson et al 2019d suggest upward trends in δ18o in 30 of 50 lakes although only 2 lakes ne2 and bm7 show significant p 0 05 upward trends in δ18o similar results are obtained for δ2h positive mk tau values are found in 32 of 50 lakes although only 3 lakes s1 s5 and bm7 show significant p 0 05 upward trends in δ2h time series isotopic data are further interpreted in the context of the imb assessment in section 4 4 4 3 temporal trends in climate parameters time series of site specific narr climate parameters including 2 m air temperature 2 m relative humidity and precipitation and evaporation at the surface are summarized by lake sub group fig 5 in general the plots illustrate regular fluctuations associated with interannual hydroclimatic variability as well as a high degree of temporal and spatial autocorrelation climate parameters appear to be similar in nearby lakes and interannual variability appears to be more pronounced than lake to lake variations for the climate parameters than for δ18o or δ2h see fig 4 this is characteristic of wetland dominated landscape where spatial differences in watershed lake hydrologic response are more dependent on watershed characteristics than on spatial climate variability as noted in previous assessments gibson et al 2010b 2015a importantly narr climate data allows for spatial variations across the lake network to be approximated improving the overall comparative strength of imb across the network mann kendall trend tests gibson et al 2019d reveal positive mk tau values for most climate parameters at most sites 260 300 although statistically significant trends are limited to only a few lakes notably temperature and evaporation flux weighted temperature was significantly upward trending for bm6 cm1 cm3 s3 and s4 evaporation was significantly upward trending for most wf bm and cm lakes although precipitation and humidity trends were largely insignificant time series climate data are further interpreted in the context of the imb assessment in section 4 4 4 4 water balance indicators using isotopic composition of the lakes on a site by site year by year basis modelled values for isotopic composition of precipitation at each site narr climatological data and site specific lake watershed characteristics we estimate evaporation inflow x from eq 1 water yield from eq 2 and water residence time from eq 3 complete results and trend statistics are provided in gibson et al 2019d and summarized by lake group in table 1 and figs 4b and 6 note that runoff ratio was estimated as water yield depth divided by precipitation depth on the watershed area and isotopic compositions of precipitation and atmospheric moisture were estimated in a consistent way with a previous 9 year assessment for the ramp lakes see gibson et al 2015a wide ranging evaporation inflow conditions were noted for lakes across the network with values ranging from 4 to 66 of inflow which also confirms that lakes had a reciprocal range in outflows of between 33 96 of inflow while low flow or zero flow periods are commonly observed in summer and winter in outflow streams in the region no such annual or interannual no flow periods for the study lakes are indicated by the isotope balance results we emphasize that while these results indicate that outflow likely occurred from all lakes in all monitoring years it does not imply that the outflow was continuous nor does it preclude that lake outflow may have become intermittent or that it may have been related mainly to spring freshet as previously noted in the region ramp 2015 evaporation inflow for the various lake groups was found to be less than the variability across the network with values decreasing with increasing latitude low permafrost systems i e less than 2 permafrost were found to have more evaporative water balances than lakes in watersheds with significant permafrost table 1 suggesting higher throughputs in the latter water yield was found to range from 22 to 618 mm year with average values in the various lake sub regions spanning from 112 to 343 mm year table 1 in general the highest water yields were found for the northern plateau lakes ne bm cm although water yield from sm lakes was fairly high as well and exceeded that in low lying boreal plains and shield areas wf s fen dominated plateau lakes with permafrost were found to have similar water yields 159 mm yr to fen dominated non permafrost lakes 166 mm yr situated mainly in lowlands whereas bog dominated plateau lakes with permafrost were found to have characteristically higher water yields on average 405 mm yr table 1 gibson et al 2019b demonstrated good agreement between imb and gauged estimates of water yield for the saos area which is consistent with the sm lakes area in our analysis although this region does not appear to be significantly affected by active permafrost thaw runoff ratios display similar patterns to water yield owing to low precipitation gradients across the region classification of bog dominated permafrost lakes deemed thaw lakes by gibson et al 2015a was previously described and was based on their occurrence in areas with abundant bog collapse scaring as well as anomalously high tritium content which was inferred to reflect recent thawing of modern permafrost gibson et al 2016b a similar finding of high tritium in thaw lakes has been recorded in other areas of northern canada and elsewhere e g bond and carr 2018 wan et al 2019a b a most notable feature of the runoff ratio estimates is that bog dominated thaw lakes had average runoff ratios of close to 80 with values as high as 120 in some cases in contrast average runoff ratio is found to be 31 for non permafrost lakes and 33 for fen dominated plateaus this is in close agreement with values for the runoff coefficient of 20 30 for boreal wetlands reported by devito and mendoza 2010 here we ascertain based on a 78 longer observation period than gibson et al 2015a 2016b that there is a significant detectable enhancement of runoff due to permafrost meltwater contributions in bog dominated watersheds in the ramp network table 1 temporal trends in water yields are shown by sub group in fig 4b and in particular capture interannual fluctuations corresponding to wet and dry years box plots illustrate ranges of annual water yield and precipitation across each lake sub region over time fig 6 with one exception precipitation is found to exceed water yield in non permafrost sub regions in all years sm wf s but water yield often exceeded precipitation in dry years within many permafrost affected sub regions ne bm cm water residence times were found to range from 0 22 to 10 81 years for individual lakes the main determinant being the depth rather than the area of the lake residence time is also found to increase along a latitudinal gradient with sub region average values ranging from a low of 0 84 years in ne lakes to a high of 3 02 years in s lakes bog dominated thaw lakes typically had longer residence times than non permafrost lakes 1 36 versus 2 44 years respectively while residence time does not appear to be factor in determining thaw lake status longer residence times would presumably serve to attenuate the isotopic signature of higher thaw source throughputs than would shorter residence times it is important to note that permafrost degradation has likely occurred over the past century in this region possibly since the little ice age zhang et al 2006 significantly longer than the residence time of the lakes similarity of fen dominated plateau lakes and non permafrost lakes is noted which may reflect that frozen ground in fens may be less influential on runoff processes than for bogs mann kendall trend tests gibson et al 2019d reveal a combination of both positive mk tau values for e i wy and wy p 97 150 and negative values 53 150 although only a few lakes have significant trends 4 150 all positive residence time was found to be mostly negative trending 33 50 lakes although only sm7 and bm8 had significant negative trends 4 5 hydrological drivers and indicators pca was conducted to further explore relationships between the derived site specific water balance outputs evaporation inflow runoff ratio water yield and residence time and the underlying hydrologic drivers of the system including location climate parameters lake watershed characteristics land cover characteristics and permafrost results are summarized in a pca biplot fig 7 as noted variations along the pc1 axis accounted for 37 39 of variability in the dataset and variations along pc2 accounted for 16 51 of variability in the dataset combined these factors explain 53 90 of variability variations along the pc1 axis correspond mainly to the influence of land cover bog versus fen and permafrost which occurs mainly in the plateau bogs note that one landscape sub type bog forest collapse scar bfxc which was shown by gibson et al 2015a to be the most influential water yield driver is indistinguishable from bog and permafrost reflecting nearly ubiquitous occurrence of collapse features in all regional plateau bogs weaker influences on pc1 include dba and ow the most influential factors for pc2 are upland elevation and la plotting in the lower left quadrant fig 7 climate drivers p e t and elevation are apparently influential for both axes and for isotopic composition of lake water and e i plotting in the lower right quadrant la v dba bog and permafrost appear to be most influential for wy wy p and τ it is important to note that vectors for these water balance parameters are roughly perpendicular to the climatic drivers p e and t as they are with the isotopic composition of lakes and e i and so are apparently providing unique information beyond the isotope based metrics such as e i used in some previous assessments turner et al 2014 macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 precipitation appears to be more influential with respect to hydrologic conditions in the southern sub groups sm wf than it is in the remaining groups which is consistent with reduced influence of permafrost wy and wy p are also normal to elevation which does not support use of elevation alone to predict runoff or runoff ratio suggested by previous analyses western resource solutions 2004 overall the pca also reveals distinct clustering of sub region groups fig 7 confirming similarity of drivers and water balance parameters among nearby lakes latitude is also an underlying driver of the regional climate gradients but was removed from the pca to confirm that sub group similarity is based on site characteristics rather than simply due to locational differences as we have shown as reported by gibson et al 2015a very distinct clusters are noted for cm and s lakes whereby cm lakes are distinguished by greater extent of bog cover and permafrost in their catchment areas and shield lakes which lack significant bog area are predominantly influenced by higher uplands which ranges between 31 and 56 note that s1 is somewhat of an outlier among the s sub group plotting among the cm cluster but due to its much larger volume v rather than due to bog cover or permafrost bm ne and sm wf are also significantly clustered importantly bog plateau thaw lakes in bm and ne as identified by star symbols are shown to be shifted towards the upper right quadrant revealing systematically larger la v τ wy and wy p for these lake watershed systems 4 6 influence of thawing permafrost correlation between permafrost bog area and collapse scar area and wy or wy p for the study watersheds was first noted by gibson et al 2015a and is reaffirmed here based on a longer observational time series systematic links between thawing permafrost and runoff are clear with direct evidence of permafrost collapse being an important constraint on this interpretation and the causal linkage of these processes gibson et al 2015a another important observation that emerges after 16 years of monitoring is that water yield varies systematically although non linearly with permafrost fig 8 whereby bog dominated plateau watersheds with intermediate permafrost extent appear to have the highest calculated water yields as compared to those with both more extensive permafrost cover and less extensive permafrost cover given that permafrost extent is closely tied to permafrost degradation across the region and presuming that bog dominated plateau watersheds represent sites at different stages along a permafrost thaw trajectory we postulate that water yield appears to increase in bog dominated systems as permafrost degrades until roughly half the permafrost is thawed and then it reduces again as the watersheds completely thaw other drivers in addition to permafrost extent appear to be uninfluential in bog dominated areas however less systematic permafrost vs water yield response at fen dominated sites may reflect more complex runoff processes controls at these locations fig 8 based on a similar isotopic perspective comparable trajectories of water balance changes have been reported in other regions experiencing widespread permafrost thaw see wan et al 2019a we hereby propose a new conceptual framework for water balance characterization and prediction for lakes in thawing permafrost terrain conceptually permafrost thaw can be considered an event hydrograph with a rising limb and falling limb controlled by the strength of the permafrost meltwater pulse fig 9 a we anticipate that permafrost degradation will initially lead to increased runoff or water yield as noted in fig 8 and in previous studies wan et al 2019a b these additional contributions will eventually peak and then recede as permafrost degrades and eventually as it may no longer form permafrost degradation as it proceeds may lead to enhanced recharge below the pre existing active layer enhancement of subsurface hydraulic connectivity formation and alteration of subsurface runoff pathways development of taliks strengthening of hydraulic exchange with features such as buried channels capture of drainage from outside topographic divides that previously governed runoff and or formation of new open water bodies collapse scars or internal lawns moreover early thawing of extensive permafrost may be less effective at generating water yield due to contributions being limited to supra permafrost meltwater whereas formation of taliks and greater sub permafrost interaction is expected to provide conduits for meltwater as thawing progresses eventually thaw sources are expected to decline as ground ice storage slowly dwindles the ground surface subsides and collapse scars are formed although the shape and duration of the meltwater pulse will vary depending on initial permafrost conditions climate change effects and other site specific controlling factors we suggest that this basic framework can be applied to describe the stages of permafrost thaw response at individual sites across various sub regions and or at the regional scale the shape of the meltwater pulse for northern alberta is undoubtedly influenced by prevalence of permafrost bearing plateau bogs including factors such as whether or not collapse features occur within or on the periphery of bogs the later expectedly generating greater runoff runoff sources are likewise expected to transition both spatially and temporally from predominantly permafrost meltwater sources to precipitation dominated sources along such permafrost degradation trajectories gradients wan et al 2019a using water yield and water yield trends wytau vs wy from the 16 year lakes dataset we illustrate classification of meltwater intensity and rate of change across the study region fig 9b we use average water yield based on our 16 year dataset and calculate wytau which is a normalized index of the strength and direction of change in wy over the study period similar to a spearman rank order tau value significance of trends is similarly evaluated with p values in this site specific assessment wytau is applied to identify increasing and decreasing trends in runoff and average wy is used to separate high versus low wy systems this allows for differentiation of sites into four categories that correspond to progressive stages along the meltwater hydrograph fig 9a overall it is evident that bog dominated thaw lakes fall mainly within the upper right quadrant category 1 signifying high increasing wy this accounts for 8 of 14 bog plateau thaw lakes and likely reflects conditions at these sites typical of the rising limb of the meltwater hydrograph as such it is expected that these watersheds will likely undergo increases in runoff at least in the short term additional thaw lakes 4 of 14 thaw lakes fall within the lower right quadrant category 2 signifying high decreasing wy these sites appear to have already crested but still have high wy and so conceptually can be considered as being on the falling limb of the meltwater hydrograph the remainder of bog dominated thaw lakes 2 of 14 thaw lakes fall within the bottom left quadrant category 3 signifying low decreasing wy we postulate that these sites are on the recession limb of the meltwater hydrograph and complete the meltwater hydrograph cycle it is interesting to note that that the most northerly subgroup the cm lakes appear to be on the rising limb whereas bm lakes situated in the heart of the region appear to straddle peak meltwater conditions and ne lakes situated to the south are clearly on the falling limb or recession we can also infer from field observations and based on previous studies of wetlands in the region that the southern parts of the study area including the stony mountains sm and likely west of fort mcmurray wf have only localized occurrences of permafrost peatland as well as more abundant peatland with internal lawns signifying permafrost degradation e g vitt et al 1994 1999 beilman et al 2000 halsey et al 2003 we interpret these areas to be predominantly post thaw systems responsive mainly to precipitation and therefore can also be described in the hydrograph model as post recession plotting in the upper left quadrant fig 9 these lakes include many fen dominated plateau lakes category 4 and can mostly be classified as post thaw systems with low wy although as we note 5 fen dominated permafrost bearing 5 9 watersheds are also included these five systems appear to be producing some increased runoff but may be less productive than bog dominated systems although for unknown reasons due to lack of bog cover and minor permafrost influence we expect that increases in wy recorded for the majority of lakes falling in quadrant 4 is likely attributable to increased precipitation and or storage changes as noted by gibson et al 2015a thawing of permafrost in the more northerly subregions ne bm and cm is currently the main driver of hydrologic conditions in these areas as compared to more southerly subregions sm and wf where precipitation dominates while it is not clear how long permafrost thaw will continue to augment discharge in these systems it is expected that future patterns in the post thaw phase will likely mimic hydrology in the more southerly subregions based on the range of wy observed in this study we estimate that permafrost thaw may account for up to 300 to 400 mm year of additional runoff in the region particularly on the bog dominated plateaus considering that some watersheds in the cm bm and ne areas are still evidently subject to increases in wy peak conditions in these areas may be somewhat higher in general potential runoff enhancement due to permafrost thaw is in broad agreement with enhancement in wy attributed to permafrost thaw in discontinuous permafrost terrain in the yellow river headwaters of the qinghai tibet plateau wan et al 2019 which may account for up to 500 mm of additional runoff to thaw lakes in extensive discontinuous permafrost versus seasonally frozen ground watersheds located nearby given the large number of isotopic surveys of thaw lakes that have now been conducted in north america e g macdonald et al 2016 narancic et al 2017 wolfe et al 2011 turner et al 2014 siberia ala aho et al 2018 and qinghai tibet cui et al 2018 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2018 we suggest that these studies should be re examined applying the wy metric in addition to enrichment or e i metrics to gain a better understanding of the net impact of permafrost thaw across a range of cold regions settings importantly application of this approach to time series survey data will allow for clearer assessment of the stage and likely future trends in runoff related to permafrost thaw it is interesting to consider whether or not the permafrost thaw contribution estimates of up to 300 400 mm year 4 8 6 4 m per 16 years are realistic considering current knowledge of soil and permafrost characteristics including thickness and distribution in the area one important characteristic of permafrost in the region is a lack of massive ground ice as noted by o neill et al 2018 peat soils have been shown typically to have a porosity ranging from 80 90 when frozen zoltai and tarnocai 1975 in a simple vertical system generation of the estimated 4 8 6 4 m of runoff would require a minimum thawing of 5 3 8 0 m over the 16 year study period given that this level of augmentation to produce peak water yields is noted for watersheds with close to 50 permafrost cover we suggest that degradation in the zones with permafrost would need to be roughly twice that or the equivalent of thawing of 10 16 m of frozen soil while direct measurements of permafrost thickness are not available for comparison across the study region the veracity of our estimate can be compared to at least one canada wide study that used a process based model of northern ecosystem soil temperature nest to simulate changes in permafrost conditions including depth to the permafrost table and depth to the permafrost base since the little ice age zhang et al 2006 in this analysis the permafrost region was subdivided into permanent and ephemeral zones the latter being the the unstable permafrost zone subject to active melting for the ephemeral permafrost zone which accounts for 11 of canada s land mass situated near the southern limits of discontinuous permafrost and also includes our study area zhang et al 2006 estimated that the permafrost base had been reduced on average by 17 m with a maximum reduction of 50 m in some areas while these estimates are a first approximation they suggest that our own calculations and understanding of the permafrost thaw processes in the study region are plausible it is important to note that peat deposits where permafrost has tended to form are mostly limited to less than 10 m thickness although underlying drift thicknesses may range from 0 to 200 m while bogs are likely the main source of meltwater the strength of the water yield response suggests that alteration of the fundamental subsurface hydrology and flowpaths may be occurring due to the observed ph increase occurring in many lakes within the study network gibson et al 2019d it is also imperative that the role of permafrost thaw on runoff water chemistry be considered as well as the timing peak and eventual decline in such contributions permafrost degradation in bogs is expected to lead to collapse and release of dissolved solids including inorganic carbon and may lead to significant enhancements in surface groundwater interactions as ombrotrophic bogs potentially will collapse and transition to minerotrophic fens one important finding in this study is the clear identification of unique hydrologic responses in bog and fen dominated watersheds and secondarily differences noted between response of lakes in fen dominated plateaus and fen dominated lowlands mechanistic differences in ph and geochemistry of these watershed types are expected to be important in developing a better understanding of the significance and trajectory of climate change and development impacts across the region 5 conclusions and implications hydrology of 50 wetland dominated watersheds in northeastern alberta is found to be driven by a combination of factors including land cover watershed morphometry and climate changes in the boreal hydrologic system are attributed mainly to permafrost thaw which can account for several hundred millimetres of sustained runoff to lakes and presumably to rivers for decades or longer one important determinant of hydrologic changes in the watersheds is presence of bogs and fens the bog fen ratio and permafrost while relatively short term studies have characterized hydrology of wetland dominated watersheds in alberta prepas et al 2001 gibson et al 2002 this study builds upon a 9 year imb assessment by gibson et al 2015a to provide a valuable 16 year imb assessment of hydrologic indicators for 50 lakes and their respective watersheds that represents an improved long term quantitative characterization of important hydrological processes in a largely ungauged region significantly this study demonstrates a refined approach for assessing permafrost thaw status allowing for sites to be classified as being on the rising limb peak falling limb or recession limb of the permafrost meltwater runoff pulse it is anticipated that this framework may be used to better understand quantify and map permafrost impacts from regional surveys in active permafrost degradation zones importantly the existence of a permafrost thaw cycle helps to explain why hydrologic impacts due to monotonic regional changes in climate drivers especially temperature precipitation and or evaporation may not result in monotonic changes to water balance of lakes or their watersheds as noted by gibson et al 2015a understanding of the permafrost degradation process in the region would benefit from additional monitoring and field work to directly characterize the processes operating in areas with degrading permafrost and to better understand the likely impacts of eventual decline in meltwater sources possible impacts may include lower water levels reduced runoff ph and chemical changes and potentially might lead to lake

8417,study region south africa lesotho and swaziland study focus the focus of this study is on the development of simple transmission loss functions that can account for channel evaporation and alluvial storage losses from upstream flows in the downstream sub basins of large river systems new hydrological insights for this region the importance of channel evaporation and hence the relevance of the proposed model is quite variable depending on the climate variations within the basins while the model is validated using a site in the usa it is difficult to fully assess the importance of alluvial losses in the southern africa region as there are almost no appropriate observed data and few studies that quantify alluvial material extent or properties where existing information on transmission losses is available for south africa the model generated results that are in broad agreement keywords transmission losses large basins hydrological modelling uncertainty data scarcity 1 introduction many of the major river basins of south africa as well as other countries of southern africa have their headwaters in relatively high rainfall areas but pass through areas with lower rainfall and high evaporation rates in the middle to lower reaches the consequence is that during some seasons runoff generated in the headwaters is subject to losses in the lower parts of the basins transmission loss processes in various parts of the world have been frequently documented lange 2005 morin et al 2009 costa et al 2012 shanafield and cook 2014 while jarihani et al 2015 provide a comprehensive review of methods that have been used to estimate losses in different systems one of the clear messages is that the dominant transmission loss processes are very dependent upon the site specific characteristics of the channel and adjacent or underlying alluvial and hard rock aquifers as well as the climate similarly the methods used to estimate losses are equally diverse many of the field studies and model approaches have focused on estimating losses during individual flood events in ephemeral rivers and have assumed that the channels are disconnected from the underlying aquifer costa et al 2012 in general terms losses are considered to be caused by a combination of i evaporation from the wetted channel surface ii evapotranspiration from the substrate of the total channel and the alluvial material of the riparian margins and iii recharge through the channel bed to the underlying alluvial and rock aquifers shanafield and cook 2014 jarihani et al 2015 the importance of the 2nd process is based on the premise that any evapotranspiration from the alluvial riparian margins or dry parts of the main river bed will be replenished by water flowing in the wetted part of the channel hydrological model simulations that ignore these transmission loss effects will inevitably over simulate the flow volumes in the downstream reaches of these rivers mvandaba et al 2018 unfortunately it is very difficult to analyse these effects using observed flow data partly because of the lack of enough streamflow gauges to quantify flow differences along the main river as well as the tributary inflows and partly because many of the gauging station records in relatively large river basins are highly impacted by upstream water resources developments reservoir storage abstractions or return flows the gauging records no longer represent natural flow conditions and it is therefore difficult to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic impacts on stream flow differences observed at upstream and downstream stations in the few cases where these exist south africa lesotho and swaziland are fortunate enough to have simulations of monthly streamflow that cover the period 1920 to 2010 for 1 946 so called quaternary catchments varying in size from less than 100 km2 to over 10 000 km2 these are the product of several national water resources assessments wr90 midgley et al 1994 wr2005 middleton and bailey 2009 wr2012 http waterresourceswr2012 co za and are based on simulations of naturalized flows i e excluding any water resources development impacts using the pitman monthly time step rainfall runoff model pitman 1973 hughes 2013 however the published simulated flows only represent the incremental runoff response for each quaternary catchment and the cumulative flows are not included in the database these time series of monthly river flows have become the de facto standard for rapid water resources assessments where naturalized flow data are required and where the resources human and financial are not immediately available to re run the model or any alternative model to update the simulations a typical example is rapid level environmental flow requirement efr assessments that are normally based on the natural flow in the river hughes and louw 2010 and are a prerequisite to the issue of water use licenses under the terms of the south african national water act no 36 of 1998 clearly if channel losses are expected to be an important issue simply adding up all of the time series of incremental flow volumes will not necessarily provide an adequate estimate of cumulative flow volumes in downstream quaternary catchments a similar problem would occur if one of the available global runoff estimate datasets schellekens et al 2017 that are typically based on gridded estimates of runoff were to be used summing the runoff estimates for all upstream grids would also potentially over estimate the cumulative flows in the downstream parts of relatively large river basins this problem was previously recognised by hughes and münster 2000 and a relatively simple loss function was applied to the wr90 incremental flow data 1920 to 1989 based on estimates of channel length using the incremental catchment area and channel width using the total upstream area together with a mean annual estimate of net evaporation i e after subtracting rainfall the approach was based on a mean annual loss volume which was then distributed equally over all months of the year there was therefore no attempt to account for seasonal or inter annual variations in upstream inflow or net evaporation although the resulting cumulative flow estimates have been frequently used within efr studies in south africa the method was never properly assessed apart from a comparison with some loss estimates made by mckenzie and craig 1997 for the lower parts of the orange river the study reported here was prompted by the need to apply an updated approach to the longer 1920 to 2010 simulations of the wr2012 database as well as to examine the potential uncertainties in the results due to the inevitable simplifying assumptions that are made it was also recognised that the method could be applicable to estimating channel losses and calculating cumulative downstream flows from gridded global runoff datasets that are becoming increasingly available schellekens et al 2017 almeida et al 2018 https earthwatch org uk get involved projects activities catchx 2 methods the loss model is divided into two components the first represents the evaporation losses from the wetted channel surface while the second represents evapotranspiration losses from adjacent and underlying alluvium which is replenished by seepage losses from the channel the model is based on inputs of continuous monthly time series of flow volumes rather than shorter time step single events that have been used in many other studies of transmission losses lange 2005 costa et al 2012 shanafield and cook 2014 2 1 evaporation from the wetted channel the wetted channel evaporation approach simply consists of subtracting the estimated losses lq ijk from the sum of the incremental flow iqijk for the current sub catchment and the upstream inflow upqijk to determine the downstream flow downqijk which in turn contributes to the upstream flow for the next sub catchment upqijk 1 all the flow volumes are in m3 106 1 downqijk iqijk upqijk lqijk where i is the year counter j the calendar month counter and k the sub catchment counter the losses are calculated from the product of estimates of the effective channel width cw in m the channel length cl in km and the net evaporation demand e p in mm subject to the condition that lqijk 0 if ejk pijk 0 i e no water can be added 2 lqijk cwijk clk ejk pijk 106 this approach is based on the premise that monthly rainfall data time series are available for the same period as the flow data but that evaporation demand potential evaporation data are only available as mean monthly values as is the case for the wr2012 database the channel width is assumed to vary with the upstream inflow while the maximum channel width is estimated from 3 cwmaxk wsk careak wpk where cwmaxk is the maximum estimated channel width and wsk and wpk are the scale and power parameters in an assumed relationship between width and cumulative catchment area careak in km2 the channel width during any month in the time series cwijk is based on the upstream monthly inflow volume upqijk to the sub basin during year i and month j and qmaxk the median fdc50 the 50th percentile on the flow duration curve upstream inflow volume for the whole time series for the sub basin 4 cwijk 0 2 0 8 upqijk qmaxk 0 5 cwmaxk for flow values above qmaxk the width is set to cwmaxk the fixed values of the parameters in eq 4 and the choice of fdc50 for estimating qmax are very roughly based on the observations made by mckenzie and craig 1997 about wetted channel area variations with flow in the orange river as well as some analyses not included in detail here of the variation of wetted river width with discharge in other large rivers where surveyed cross sections and hydraulic calibrations are available mostly from previous unpublished environmental flow requirement studies while this relationship appears to be appropriate for sub rectangular channels it is likely that the real relationship will be highly variable however the estimate of cwmax eq 3 is uncertain and fixing the parameters of eq 4 is not expected to add to the overall uncertainty in the width estimate the key issue is that the model assumes that the width will reduce during low flows to prevent over estimating losses when the wetted channel width is expected to be small the channel length is estimated from 5 clk lsk ltk lek iareak 0 5 0 886 where lsk ltk and lek represent channel sinuosity lsk 1 0 tributary number and catchment shape elongation factors used to calculate the channel length from the incremental sub basin area iareak in km2 for a circular catchment shape with a straight channel the length would be represented by the circle diameter iarea0 5 0 886 lek will be greater than 1 0 if the sub basin is elongated in the same direction as the main channel while it will be less than 1 0 if elongated in a direction orthogonal to the main channel direction ltk is 1 0 for a single upstream sub basin while 0 25 is added for each additional tributary contribution and the total contribution divided by the elongation factor lek this is a pragmatic solution to estimating the extra channel length when there is no way of automatically knowing how much extra length additional tributaries add which will depend on the channel configuration the division by the elongation ratio is designed to account for shorter tributary lengths in long and narrow catchments a further issue is that the channel width estimate eq 3 should not strictly speaking be independent of the tributary factor ltk however it is difficult to account for this in any generic manner that can allow for all possible configurations of the main and tributary channels within a downstream sub basin in the implementation of the method it is necessary to decide if the channel width and length parameters should be fixed i e ignoring any local effects regionally varying based on some geomorphological classification perhaps or locally estimated for each and every sub basin clearly if the fixed option is chosen an lsk value representing typical sinuosity would need to be assumed and the lek value would necessarily be 1 0 because elongation can be greater or less than 1 0 if square gridded data are to be used the lek value would need to account for whether the channel crosses the grid orthogonally or diagonally and this would probably have to be determined manually the tributary factor ltk can be readily determined from the sub basin or grid layout and the identification of links to the next downstream sub basin which is needed to set up the model calculating or directly measuring the sinuosity and elongation factors for all sub basins is clearly possible but not a trivial task to achieve automatically and therefore could be quite time consuming for a large number of sub basins similarly it is possible but time consuming to use google earth to estimate the channel width directly and bypass the need for eq 3 however it will always be quite difficult to quantify the effective channel width in the context of channel losses and therefore even locally measured widths will still contribute to the overall uncertainty of the approach during this study a number of channel widths were measured from google earth see results section and it became evident that there are likely to be regional differences that are related to the channel substrate type rock or alluvial material as well as other less well defined geomorphological or geological influences and some that could be linked to agricultural practices in the valley bottoms making it difficult to define likely natural riparian margins in general terms it is evident that there are a great many variations in channel width in most sub basin channel reaches such that even if a measured sample is used the uncertainty in the estimate of an appropriate value is likely to be substantial 2 2 alluvial losses the input parameters for the alluvial losses part of the model consist of the total width of the valley bottom including the channel twk in m the maximum channel depth cdk in m the storativity ask infiltration rate kk in m d 1 and depth below the channel bed adk in m of the alluvial material and an evapotranspiration power parameter epk if twk is set to a value less than or equal to cwmaxk then the sub basin is assumed to have no alluvium similarly if the alluvial depth below the channel adk is zero the channel bed is assumed to be at the bedrock level and no losses are expected through the channel bed if the input channel depth parameter is set to zero or less the depth will be calculated from default hydraulic geometry relationships park 1977 between bankfull discharge qb and channel width and depth where 6 width a qbb 7 depth c qbf the depth is derived by eliminating qb from eq s 6 and 7 and using fixed values for a b c and f of

channel cannot lose more water than is available that return flows from the alluvium cannot exceed the available storage and that the channel cannot add more water to the alluvium than the available storage the known uncertainties in the approach include the premise that the alluvial width is equally distributed on both sides of the channel and that there are no significant exchanges between the alluvium or channel bed and the underlying rock aquifer 3 study sites the first site has been chosen from the united states as there are no sites within south africa that have sufficient and reliable enough data to properly test the modelling approach the usa site is a 17 5 km reach of the san pedro river between usgs 2019 gauging stations 09471000 charleston 31 63 n 110 17 w 3 196 km2 and

gauge a further 149 3 km2 lane et al 1980 continuous daily stream flow data are available from the usgs and southwest watershed research center websites for all 4 stations for the period 2000 to the present day five south african basins table 1 and fig 2 were chosen to further evaluate the revised approach and to assess the sensitivity and uncertainties in the adoption of different approaches to the use of the model the first sites are on the orange river upstream of the confluence with the fish river in namibia total area of 524 091 km2 and 477 sub basins chosen because of the availability of independent estimates of channel losses mckenzie and craig 1997 and the main objective for this basin was to compare the results with the previous method hughes and münster 2000 at various points in the basin as well as with some observed data at the vioolsdrift d8h003 gauging station located in the lower reaches of the orange river 28 758os 17 722oe one sub basin d81a in the orange river was also used to explore the sensitivity of some parameters of the alluvial losses component an additional site on the limpopo river was included to further evaluate the alluvial losses component largely because some prior estimates are available boroto and görgens 2003 howard et al 2013 the third site is the sabie river total area of 6 321 km2 and 25 sub basins chosen because the headwaters are in a topographically steep and wet area while the downstream sub basins are relatively flat and more arid the sabie was also used to test the loss model using flow volumes simulated for a 0 25o grid 14 grids in total the fourth and fifth sites are respectively the olifants doring river total area of 46 200 km2 and 75 sub basins and the crocodile east river total area of 10 446 km2 and 36 sub basins basins both of these basins are being used as part of a current study of the impacts of climate change on the determination of environmental flow requirements the olifants doring basin is located along the western seaboard of south africa with a winter rainfall regime and some arid headwater areas the crocodile east basin is in the summer rainfall region and has similar upstream downstream climate and runoff characteristics to the sabie river the channel evaporation model using default parameters with the tributary factor included was run for an additional 13 sites table 1 and fig 2 to determine how many south african large river basins are expected to be subject to important levels of losses no attempts were made to determine local values of the width and length parameters for the orange and sabie sites while elongation factors lek and measured channel lengths clk were determined for the olifants doring and crocodile east sites in addition the likely range of appropriate channel widths for a sample of 56 channels mostly on quite large rivers throughout south africa were estimated from google earth to assist in quantifying wsk and wpk in eq 3 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation fig 3 illustrates the results of trying to establish default parameters wsk and wpk for the channel width estimation the estimated width line is manually fitted using fixed ws and wp values of 3 5 and 0 35 respectively the measurements were based on google earth images and for each channel reach an upper and lower estimate was made to represent local variations in width it is apparent that there is a great deal of scatter in the measured points as well as quite large ranges between the upper and lower measurements no attempts have been made in the study to regionalize the width estimation parameters but the degree of scatter and some subjective observations noted during the sample measurements suggest that such an approach might be worthwhile to improve the estimates however it was also noted that it is very difficult to decide what representative widths should be chosen and there will remain a great deal of uncertainty even if a number of sample widths are measured for a single sub basin fig 4 illustrates the results of applying different methods for estimating the channel length varying parameters ltk and lek compared with lengths based on digital channel data derived from 1 50 000 scale topographic maps for both the olifants doring and crocodile east sub basins the sinuosity parameter ls was fixed at a value of 1 2 and all the regression lines were forced to pass through the origin at 0 0 the first assessment involved a default le value of 1 0 assumption of a circular sub basin shape and no allowance for additional channel length due to multiple tributaries lt 1 the result is clearly very poor r2 1 3 and a slope of 0 82 adding the tributary effects improves the relationship slightly but the regression coefficient remains negative adding the effects of elongation improves the regression coefficient to greater than 0 4 and gives a slope of close to 1 0 i e little systematic bias changing the sinuosity parameter to a higher 1 4 or lower 1 1 value did not make any substantial difference some of the outliers that have a substantial impact on the regression coefficient are related to quite short measured channel lengths that are a consequence of the way in which sub basin boundaries have been drawn this is illustrated in fig 5 using an example from the olifants doring basin in fig 5a sub basin e24 j flows into e24 k which then joins e40d to flow into e24 l which then flows into e24 m however both e24 k and e24 l have very short channel lengths receiving upstream flows and these represent extreme outliers in any relationship with sub basin area eq 5 if the sub basin boundaries close to the confluences were to be re drawn similar to fig 5b although their exact positions would be determined by the local topography e24 k and e24 l would become headwater sub basins that flow into e24 m whose measured length is well predicted by the model estimates both the area and the channel lengths of e24 m would be increased by this change and the predictions would remain very good this result suggests that the way in which sub basins are delineated could have an impact on the loss model 4 2 san pedro river channel and alluvial losses the rainfall inputs to the model were obtained from the cru 2019 global dataset mean annual total of 352 mm while the seasonal distribution of potential evaporation was obtained from the fao 2016 website mean annual depth of 1 800 mm approximately 72 of the incremental flows between the upstream and downstream sites on the main river are gauged the incremental flow time series were therefore initially estimated by subtracting the upstream flow from the downstream flow and only taking the positive differences where the gauged tributary flows were greater than these initial estimates they were used instead the results therefore represent the minimum possible incremental flows however the babocomari river is the major tributary and the walnut gulch inflows did not affect the estimation of incremental flows at all it is therefore likely that most of the other smaller ungauged tributaries will also have little influence on the estimations google earth imagery was used to estimate the channel length 17 5 km and width average of 40 m as well to estimate the alluvial width without site specific knowledge it was found to be difficult to estimate the extent of the alluvium which appears to be quite variable in width and the values used in the model are between 200 and 400 m similarly no information could be found about the nature of the alluvium nor the likely depth there are therefore a number of uncertainties in the setup of the model despite this being a data rich environment the model was run with no losses i e annual evaporation set to zero no alluvium below the channel for total alluvial widths of 200 and 400 m and for 2 m and 5 m of effective alluvial depth below the channel for the two widths i e a total of 7 basic model setups table 2 the storativity infiltration rate and evaporation loss parameters were adjusted to obtain good visual correspondence between the observed and simulated flow duration curves at the downstream site and some objective statistical functions calculated to illustrate the performance of the model the statistics used are the percentage bias between observed and simulated mean monthly values and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency for both normal values bias and nse and natural log transformed values bias ln and nse ln the nse representing the correspondence of the two flow duration curves nse fdc as well as the percentage time of zero flows are also given in table 2 the no losses model clearly demonstrates the importance of transmission losses particularly for moderate to low flows all of the other models show a substantial improvement in the statistics but the models with no alluvium below the channel are unable to generate a result that contains zero flows there is little to choose between the other models they all have approximately 20 zero flows compared to the observed of 13 they all have bias values of less than 10 slightly improved nse values as well as much improved nse ln and bias ln values compared to the no losses model fig 6 further illustrates the differences between a no losses model and one based on 5 m of alluvium below the channel based on flow duration curve comparisons the overall conclusion is that despite the uncertainties in the climate input data rainfall and evaporation based on global gridded data and the possible under estimate of incremental flows as well as the real physical layout of the river and alluvial system the model has performed reasonably well 4 3 orange river basin channel evaporation losses table 3 summarises the results of the previous losses method and the revised approach with and without the inclusion of the lt parameter the sinuosity and elongation parameters are set to their default values of 1 2 and 1 0 respectively the results table 2 are assessed at the start d71a middle d81a and close to the end d82 h of the reach considered by mckenzie and craig 1997 the inclusion of the tributary effects parameter lt makes a relatively small difference to the loss estimates despite the fact that including the tributary effects for the orange river could be over estimating the appropriate channel lengths to use in the model due to the quite large number of very arid sub basins that join the main river in the lower reaches of the basin the most important difference between the old and new methods is that the old method suggests much lower losses at high flows but greater losses at low flows and generates zero flows for approximately 20 of the time while zero flows using the revised method occur for less than 5 of the time fig 7 compares the flow duration curves fdcs of the cumulative flows with and without losses at site d82h with observed flow data from the nearest gauging station d8h003 located just upstream for the period 1935 to 1968 the observed flow data for this period are expected to represent close to natural conditions as this is prior to the construction of most of the major dams in the orange river basin although there were some major dams on the vaal river tributary even before this time the range of percentage bias values simulated observed 100 observed for the upper parts of the fdcs 5 to 20 are between 2 and 20 well within any uncertainties expected from the upstream simulations however for the lower part of the fdcs 80 to 95 the bias values without accounting for losses range from 170 to over 20 000 while after accounting for losses they are mostly reduced to less than 50 this result cannot be attributed to gross over simulation of the upstream sub basins as a large number of them particularly in the wetter headwaters are known to be perennial despite the large number of uncertainties in the comparison including the validity of the simulations of incremental flow for the 477 sub basins possible errors in the gauging data and the effects of early water resources developments on the flow regime the results for the new loss model are encouraging it is also clear that the old loss model substantially over estimated the losses during low flow conditions mckenzie and craig 1997 estimated the monthly loss volumes for the upper reach d71a to d81a to be between 24 and 35 106 m3 month 1 and between 17 and 28 106 m3 month 1 for the lower reach d81a to d82 h the lower values being applicable at lower flows and vice versa the mean monthly losses using the new model are 33 7 106 m3 month 1 for the upper reach and 32 6 106 m3 month 1 for the lower reach using the results with no tributary effects included mckenzie and craig 1997 based their initial estimates on an approach similar to the one used here i e wetted channel area multiplied by net evaporation demand but they used field measured channel areas and also ran a detailed hydraulic model that included an evapotranspiration loss function to validate the initial estimates 4 4 orange and limpopo river basins alluvial losses sub basin d81h has been used to run the alluvial losses part of the model using measured values for channel length 48 km and width 280 m the alluvial width is quite variable within the sub basin but the average is about 700 m there is no available information about the alluvial material characteristics nor are there any data to validate any model estimates the model evaluation is therefore based on a simple sensitivity assessment using variations in the as k and ep parameters table 4 the channel bed is mostly bedrock little alluvial material below the channel bed however the model has also been run with 10 m of alluvial below the channel bed to illustrate this part of the model the results for the situation where there is no alluvium below the channel are summarized in fig 8 a which indicates that the alluvial losses vary from approximately 3 106 m3 to less than 20 106 m3 the majority being substantially less than the volume of 28 3 106 m3 estimated for the channel evaporation losses as expected the losses increase with increasing values of the infiltration rate and storativity parameters and decrease with increasing evaporation parameter values resulting in less effective evaporative losses from the alluvium return flows are only significant for higher values of the evaporation parameter due to the alluvial material remaining wet into the dry seasons figs 8b and c summarise the results of the sensitivity analysis when the additional 10 m of alluvium below the channel bed is included fig 8b illustrates the variability of the volume of losses and return flows which are negligible as most of the storage is now below the channel while fig 8c illustrates the variability of the percentage time that the alluvial storage level is below the channel bed i e a losing river in both figures it is clear that the most sensitive parameter is now the evaporation power parameter while storativity is also a sensitive parameter in terms of the time that the alluvial storage is below the river bed the differences between figs 8a and b are mainly a reflection of the difference between losses occurring only through the channel banks fig 8a and those occurring through the channel bed when alluvial storage is assumed to exist below the channel bed fig 8b with alluvial storage losses being substantially greater than the estimated channel evaporation losses while it is unknown but unlikely that the orange river site really does have alluvial material below the channel the limpopo river site has been previously documented to have between 5 and 7 m of alluvium below the channel bed howard et al 2013 and therefore represents a better test of the alluvial losses part of the model the 25 7 km long reach lies between the confluences of the limpopo river with the bubye river from zimbabwe to the north and the luvuvhu river from south africa to the south the upstream inflows have been estimated from gauged records 1955 to 1980 at beit bridge some 130 km upstream with simulated estimates of inflows for all of the tributaries joining the limpopo downstream to the bubye river confluence most of which only flow during the wet season or have very low dry season flows table 4 indicates that the low flow regime of the limpopo river is very different to that of the orange river with lower relative dry season flows the upstream flow data suggest zero flow conditions for only 1 of the time but the monthly flow volumes are less than 2 106 m3 for about 30 of the time howard et al 2013 report total mean annual losses in this reach of approximately 51 106 m3 an analysis of google earth imagery suggests that the channel and total floodplain widths are highly variable with mean values of approximately 770 m and 2 290 m respectively the model was run with the same range of parameters used for the orange river and the closest result to the howard et al 2013 estimates were achieved with values of 0 2 0 1 and 1 0 for parameters k as and ep respectively the mean annual channel evaporation losses were 18 8 106 m3 while the alluvial losses were 29 3 106 m3 while the alluvial storage was below the channel bed for 48 of the time and the simulated downstream flow regime has zero flows for 30 of the time the orange and limpopo examples are also used to assess the sensitivity of using different approaches to varying the channel width with discharge volume eq 4 a part of the model already identified as being highly empirical and uncertain changing the shape of the discharge width relationship to force the width to decrease more rapidly and drop to a minimum of zero made almost no difference to the mean annual results at both sites for either the channel evaporation or the loss to alluvial storage however if the qmax term in eq 4 is based on fdc25 i e higher flows then the channel evaporation losses are reduced by about 10 15 while the alluvial losses remain largely unchanged a further source of uncertainty in the alluvial losses component is the estimation of channel depth either from field observations at sample cross sections or using eq 8 as might be expected if the depth is reduced for the orange river example with no alluvial storage below the channel bed the losses are also reduced a 35 reduction in channel depth leads to a 25 reduction in alluvial losses however when alluvial storage below the channel bed is included the reverse effect occurs i e losses reduce as the channel depth is increased for a 35 change in channel depth there is a 10 change in the opposite direction in simulated alluvial losses this rather surprising result at first sight is related to the dominance of the evaporation losses that create available storage in the alluvium as the channel depth is reduced the below channel alluvial storage plays a greater role than the adjacent alluvial storage and losses through the channel bed rather than the much smaller channel banks become relatively more important this result further emphasises the importance of the evaporation loss parameter and of understanding the evapotranspiration characteristics of alluvial material that will be closely associated with the cover and rooting depth characteristics of the floodplain vegetation 4 5 sabie river basin the original intention of including the sabie river was to compare the loss results using the wr2012 simulations based on sub basins with gridded simulations from a global runoff model based on some previous comparisons between the wr2012 data and the outputs from global models that formed part of the catchx project almeida et al 2018 the outputs from a water resources reanalysis model performed by the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts land surface scheme http wci earth2observe eu thredds dodsc ecmwf wrr2 monthly agg nc html accessed on 17 october 2018 appeared to generate runoff estimates that were closer to the wr2012 data than the other models available through the earth2observe project schellekens et al 2017 however closer examination revealed that even these were unable to capture the high baseflow hughes 2010 contributions from the headwaters see also https earthwatch org uk images catchx catchxdatatestingreport pdf accessed on 14 february 2019 the wr2012 streamflow data were therefore converted to runoff depths and further converted to gridded depths using a 0 25o grid size based on weighted averages of the sub basin areas that fall within each grid the gridded depth time series were then converted back to volumes based on the area of each grid that falls within the total basin area a similar approach was used to determine the rainfall time series and the annual evaporation depths table 5 indicates that the losses for all of the possible basin configurations are relatively small and probably well within any of the uncertainties associated with simulating the incremental flows the grid results suggest lower losses but the differences are not significant compared to the overall uncertainties part of the reason for lower losses in the gridded approach is likely to be related to the fact that 80 of the total area 14 sub basins experience losses in the sub basin model while only 64 of the area 7 grids experience losses in the grid model 4 6 crocodile east and olifants doring river basins the main purpose of including these sites was to assess the value of the direct measurements of both the sub basin elongation factor lek and channel length the crocodile east river is close and similar to the sabie river while the olifants doring river is located in the arid west coast area of south africa but also has some tributaries rising in the wetter cederberg mountain range it is a winter rainfall region such that any headwater low flows during the dry season will be subject to much greater net evaporation volumes than the basins in the summer rainfall regions in the east of the country for the crocodile east site there are negligible differences between the different loss estimates the losses and differences between models are greater for the olifants doring site but they remain relatively small and all within the bounds of overall uncertainty both results suggest that efforts spent on quantifying channel characteristics for individual sub basins are not likely to be rewarded by more precise estimates 4 7 additional sites table 6 lists the mean annual runoff with and without the estimated channel evaporation losses for all the basins fig 2 using the wr90 1920 1990 naturalized flows rainfall and evaporation data there are 6 basins where channel losses are unlikely to have any major effects losses 2 and these are mostly basins with relatively high rainfall in the downstream areas the middle group 2 losses 10 represent a range of different upstream downstream conditions and include the sabie and olifants doring examples already discussed the higher losses group 10 are made up mostly of rivers that have quite arid conditions throughout their basins but also includes the orange and two rivers in the north of the country that have wetter headwaters and flow through very arid areas towards the limpopo river crocodile west and mogalakwena the final column of table 6 offers some suggestions about which basins are expected to experience additional transmission losses due to either alluvial areas or wetlands unfortunately there is insufficient information available to properly identify which basins are likely to experience these additional losses and to quantify the parameters of the alluvial losses component of the model 5 discussion and conclusions this paper presents a relatively simple model that is designed to be used with semi distributed using sub basins or grids simulated time series of incremental monthly stream flow to account for channel transmission losses when the incremental flows are accumulated to generate total downstream flow volume time series the model consists of two components evaporative losses from the wetted channel surface and losses through exchanges between the channel and adjacent and underlying alluvial material the approach is based on coarse time and spatial scales and the model algorithms are almost certainly inappropriate for detailed assessments during individual storm events in arid ephemeral rivers e g lange 2005 the model was initially tested on a usa site with good upstream and downstream observed streamflow information but without detailed information on channel geometry and alluvial storage while the results are satisfactory there inevitably remains uncertainty in the estimation of the parameter values an assessment of the channel evaporation model results for the lower orange river suggests that the model generates outputs that are in general agreement with both the results of a previous study mckenzie and craig 1997 and some observed stream flow data the relative differences in evaporation losses table 6 for 17 large river basins throughout the country are at least intuitively sensible given the climate variations between their headwater and downstream areas the application of both components of the model channel evaporation and alluvial losses to a reach of the limpopo river simulated losses that are consistent with previous estimates boroto and görgens 2003 howard et al 2013 some of the uncertainties are inevitably associated with the simulations of all the sub basin incremental monthly stream flow time series in the south african example basins used in this study these are based on a regional application of a rainfall runoff model that has been previously validated for sub basins where there are some historical observed flow data midgley et al 1994 middleton and bailey 2009 hughes 2013 while uncertainties therefore do exist these data represent the de facto standard for water resources estimation in the region in the channel evaporation component of the model the major uncertainties are associated with the estimation of channel width and length as well as how the wetted width varies with upstream inflows fig 3 suggests that channel widths can be highly variable even within relatively short reaches and that a simple relationship with cumulative catchment area eq 3 might not be very reliable yamazaki et al 2014 reported a global database of channel widths but these estimates are quite generalised and have been found to be inaccurate for many southern african rivers a similar degree of uncertainty exists in the estimation of channel length using the incremental catchment area eq 5 and fig 4 while adding some limited measurements to account for catchment shape the elongation factor in eq 5 improves the estimates both the width and length values can be based on direct measurements but this increases the time resources required to set up the model and the two examples of the crocodile east and olifants doring suggest that the differences in the overall result might be quite small it would also be difficult to apply direct measurements to gridded data as the grids do not represent physically real sub basin areas the uncertainties in the alluvial losses component of the model include similar problems of defining the alluvial surface area but additional uncertainties are associated with some of the model assumptions and with quantifying the depth hydraulic properties and evapotranspiration regime of the alluvial material some previous studies of transmission losses in the southern africa region have focused on very arid namibian rivers lange 2005 morin et al 2009 and on single flood events and have not included long time series of flow volumes in the publications it is therefore very difficult to compare these previously published results with those of the monthly time step model used in this study the model was applied to the orange river with an assumption that the active alluvial storage is above the channel bed and that the primary exchange process is through the channel banks this assumption was based on some un reported observations from several sources that suggest that regional groundwater tables in the valley bottoms of many large south african rivers remain close to the channel bottom under natural conditions or that the channel beds are underlain by bedrock costa et al 2013 reached a similar conclusion for a semi arid river in brazil this is clearly not the case for the more arid namibian rivers morin et al 2009 nor for the limpopo river example included in this study fig 8 illustrates that the dynamics of losses are quite different when alluvial material is assumed to exist below the channel the limpopo river example was included as there is at least some evidence suggesting deeper alluvium as well as some estimates of likely losses the limiting factors that determine alluvial loss volumes are very different between the three examples the orange river with and without alluvium below the bed and the limpopo river in the first orange river example fig 8a the key limiting factor is the value of the infiltration rate parameter in the second orange river example the main limiting factor is the available alluvial storage in any model time step and how this is depleted through evapotranspiration fig 8b the estimated upstream flow regime for the orange river has sufficient low flows to fill the alluvial storage for most months of the time series table 4 however this is not the case with the limpopo river and one of the limiting factors is the amount of upstream inflow available to increase the alluvial storage while the most sensitive parameter is the evaporation power these are quite important observations given that all of the parameters can only be estimated with a high degree of uncertainty jarihani et al 2015 in most situations i e without detailed field observations the main intention of this paper was to present the model and illustrate its application in several different situations while a secondary intention was to highlight those areas of south africa where transmission losses are potentially important and where resources should be directed at a better understanding of the processes and their estimation while all of the south african applications referred to in the present study have used simulations of natural stream flow conditions the model could also be useful to examine the impacts of losses on managed flow regimes examples might include an assessment of transmission loss impacts on managed releases from an upstream reservoir to provide for either downstream irrigation abstractions or environmental flow requirements in river systems where transmission losses are likely to be important a larger release would be required than just the downstream requirements however there remains uncertainty in the application of the model and further work needs to focus on obtaining additional data that can be used to assess the model and methods

8417,study region south africa lesotho and swaziland study focus the focus of this study is on the development of simple transmission loss functions that can account for channel evaporation and alluvial storage losses from upstream flows in the downstream sub basins of large river systems new hydrological insights for this region the importance of channel evaporation and hence the relevance of the proposed model is quite variable depending on the climate variations within the basins while the model is validated using a site in the usa it is difficult to fully assess the importance of alluvial losses in the southern africa region as there are almost no appropriate observed data and few studies that quantify alluvial material extent or properties where existing information on transmission losses is available for south africa the model generated results that are in broad agreement keywords transmission losses large basins hydrological modelling uncertainty data scarcity 1 introduction many of the major river basins of south africa as well as other countries of southern africa have their headwaters in relatively high rainfall areas but pass through areas with lower rainfall and high evaporation rates in the middle to lower reaches the consequence is that during some seasons runoff generated in the headwaters is subject to losses in the lower parts of the basins transmission loss processes in various parts of the world have been frequently documented lange 2005 morin et al 2009 costa et al 2012 shanafield and cook 2014 while jarihani et al 2015 provide a comprehensive review of methods that have been used to estimate losses in different systems one of the clear messages is that the dominant transmission loss processes are very dependent upon the site specific characteristics of the channel and adjacent or underlying alluvial and hard rock aquifers as well as the climate similarly the methods used to estimate losses are equally diverse many of the field studies and model approaches have focused on estimating losses during individual flood events in ephemeral rivers and have assumed that the channels are disconnected from the underlying aquifer costa et al 2012 in general terms losses are considered to be caused by a combination of i evaporation from the wetted channel surface ii evapotranspiration from the substrate of the total channel and the alluvial material of the riparian margins and iii recharge through the channel bed to the underlying alluvial and rock aquifers shanafield and cook 2014 jarihani et al 2015 the importance of the 2nd process is based on the premise that any evapotranspiration from the alluvial riparian margins or dry parts of the main river bed will be replenished by water flowing in the wetted part of the channel hydrological model simulations that ignore these transmission loss effects will inevitably over simulate the flow volumes in the downstream reaches of these rivers mvandaba et al 2018 unfortunately it is very difficult to analyse these effects using observed flow data partly because of the lack of enough streamflow gauges to quantify flow differences along the main river as well as the tributary inflows and partly because many of the gauging station records in relatively large river basins are highly impacted by upstream water resources developments reservoir storage abstractions or return flows the gauging records no longer represent natural flow conditions and it is therefore difficult to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic impacts on stream flow differences observed at upstream and downstream stations in the few cases where these exist south africa lesotho and swaziland are fortunate enough to have simulations of monthly streamflow that cover the period 1920 to 2010 for 1 946 so called quaternary catchments varying in size from less than 100 km2 to over 10 000 km2 these are the product of several national water resources assessments wr90 midgley et al 1994 wr2005 middleton and bailey 2009 wr2012 http waterresourceswr2012 co za and are based on simulations of naturalized flows i e excluding any water resources development impacts using the pitman monthly time step rainfall runoff model pitman 1973 hughes 2013 however the published simulated flows only represent the incremental runoff response for each quaternary catchment and the cumulative flows are not included in the database these time series of monthly river flows have become the de facto standard for rapid water resources assessments where naturalized flow data are required and where the resources human and financial are not immediately available to re run the model or any alternative model to update the simulations a typical example is rapid level environmental flow requirement efr assessments that are normally based on the natural flow in the river hughes and louw 2010 and are a prerequisite to the issue of water use licenses under the terms of the south african national water act no 36 of 1998 clearly if channel losses are expected to be an important issue simply adding up all of the time series of incremental flow volumes will not necessarily provide an adequate estimate of cumulative flow volumes in downstream quaternary catchments a similar problem would occur if one of the available global runoff estimate datasets schellekens et al 2017 that are typically based on gridded estimates of runoff were to be used summing the runoff estimates for all upstream grids would also potentially over estimate the cumulative flows in the downstream parts of relatively large river basins this problem was previously recognised by hughes and münster 2000 and a relatively simple loss function was applied to the wr90 incremental flow data 1920 to 1989 based on estimates of channel length using the incremental catchment area and channel width using the total upstream area together with a mean annual estimate of net evaporation i e after subtracting rainfall the approach was based on a mean annual loss volume which was then distributed equally over all months of the year there was therefore no attempt to account for seasonal or inter annual variations in upstream inflow or net evaporation although the resulting cumulative flow estimates have been frequently used within efr studies in south africa the method was never properly assessed apart from a comparison with some loss estimates made by mckenzie and craig 1997 for the lower parts of the orange river the study reported here was prompted by the need to apply an updated approach to the longer 1920 to 2010 simulations of the wr2012 database as well as to examine the potential uncertainties in the results due to the inevitable simplifying assumptions that are made it was also recognised that the method could be applicable to estimating channel losses and calculating cumulative downstream flows from gridded global runoff datasets that are becoming increasingly available schellekens et al 2017 almeida et al 2018 https earthwatch org uk get involved projects activities catchx 2 methods the loss model is divided into two components the first represents the evaporation losses from the wetted channel surface while the second represents evapotranspiration losses from adjacent and underlying alluvium which is replenished by seepage losses from the channel the model is based on inputs of continuous monthly time series of flow volumes rather than shorter time step single events that have been used in many other studies of transmission losses lange 2005 costa et al 2012 shanafield and cook 2014 2 1 evaporation from the wetted channel the wetted channel evaporation approach simply consists of subtracting the estimated losses lq ijk from the sum of the incremental flow iqijk for the current sub catchment and the upstream inflow upqijk to determine the downstream flow downqijk which in turn contributes to the upstream flow for the next sub catchment upqijk 1 all the flow volumes are in m3 106 1 downqijk iqijk upqijk lqijk where i is the year counter j the calendar month counter and k the sub catchment counter the losses are calculated from the product of estimates of the effective channel width cw in m the channel length cl in km and the net evaporation demand e p in mm subject to the condition that lqijk 0 if ejk pijk 0 i e no water can be added 2 lqijk cwijk clk ejk pijk 106 this approach is based on the premise that monthly rainfall data time series are available for the same period as the flow data but that evaporation demand potential evaporation data are only available as mean monthly values as is the case for the wr2012 database the channel width is assumed to vary with the upstream inflow while the maximum channel width is estimated from 3 cwmaxk wsk careak wpk where cwmaxk is the maximum estimated channel width and wsk and wpk are the scale and power parameters in an assumed relationship between width and cumulative catchment area careak in km2 the channel width during any month in the time series cwijk is based on the upstream monthly inflow volume upqijk to the sub basin during year i and month j and qmaxk the median fdc50 the 50th percentile on the flow duration curve upstream inflow volume for the whole time series for the sub basin 4 cwijk 0 2 0 8 upqijk qmaxk 0 5 cwmaxk for flow values above qmaxk the width is set to cwmaxk the fixed values of the parameters in eq 4 and the choice of fdc50 for estimating qmax are very roughly based on the observations made by mckenzie and craig 1997 about wetted channel area variations with flow in the orange river as well as some analyses not included in detail here of the variation of wetted river width with discharge in other large rivers where surveyed cross sections and hydraulic calibrations are available mostly from previous unpublished environmental flow requirement studies while this relationship appears to be appropriate for sub rectangular channels it is likely that the real relationship will be highly variable however the estimate of cwmax eq 3 is uncertain and fixing the parameters of eq 4 is not expected to add to the overall uncertainty in the width estimate the key issue is that the model assumes that the width will reduce during low flows to prevent over estimating losses when the wetted channel width is expected to be small the channel length is estimated from 5 clk lsk ltk lek iareak 0 5 0 886 where lsk ltk and lek represent channel sinuosity lsk 1 0 tributary number and catchment shape elongation factors used to calculate the channel length from the incremental sub basin area iareak in km2 for a circular catchment shape with a straight channel the length would be represented by the circle diameter iarea0 5 0 886 lek will be greater than 1 0 if the sub basin is elongated in the same direction as the main channel while it will be less than 1 0 if elongated in a direction orthogonal to the main channel direction ltk is 1 0 for a single upstream sub basin while 0 25 is added for each additional tributary contribution and the total contribution divided by the elongation factor lek this is a pragmatic solution to estimating the extra channel length when there is no way of automatically knowing how much extra length additional tributaries add which will depend on the channel configuration the division by the elongation ratio is designed to account for shorter tributary lengths in long and narrow catchments a further issue is that the channel width estimate eq 3 should not strictly speaking be independent of the tributary factor ltk however it is difficult to account for this in any generic manner that can allow for all possible configurations of the main and tributary channels within a downstream sub basin in the implementation of the method it is necessary to decide if the channel width and length parameters should be fixed i e ignoring any local effects regionally varying based on some geomorphological classification perhaps or locally estimated for each and every sub basin clearly if the fixed option is chosen an lsk value representing typical sinuosity would need to be assumed and the lek value would necessarily be 1 0 because elongation can be greater or less than 1 0 if square gridded data are to be used the lek value would need to account for whether the channel crosses the grid orthogonally or diagonally and this would probably have to be determined manually the tributary factor ltk can be readily determined from the sub basin or grid layout and the identification of links to the next downstream sub basin which is needed to set up the model calculating or directly measuring the sinuosity and elongation factors for all sub basins is clearly possible but not a trivial task to achieve automatically and therefore could be quite time consuming for a large number of sub basins similarly it is possible but time consuming to use google earth to estimate the channel width directly and bypass the need for eq 3 however it will always be quite difficult to quantify the effective channel width in the context of channel losses and therefore even locally measured widths will still contribute to the overall uncertainty of the approach during this study a number of channel widths were measured from google earth see results section and it became evident that there are likely to be regional differences that are related to the channel substrate type rock or alluvial material as well as other less well defined geomorphological or geological influences and some that could be linked to agricultural practices in the valley bottoms making it difficult to define likely natural riparian margins in general terms it is evident that there are a great many variations in channel width in most sub basin channel reaches such that even if a measured sample is used the uncertainty in the estimate of an appropriate value is likely to be substantial 2 2 alluvial losses the input parameters for the alluvial losses part of the model consist of the total width of the valley bottom including the channel twk in m the maximum channel depth cdk in m the storativity ask infiltration rate kk in m d 1 and depth below the channel bed adk in m of the alluvial material and an evapotranspiration power parameter epk if twk is set to a value less than or equal to cwmaxk then the sub basin is assumed to have no alluvium similarly if the alluvial depth below the channel adk is zero the channel bed is assumed to be at the bedrock level and no losses are expected through the channel bed if the input channel depth parameter is set to zero or less the depth will be calculated from default hydraulic geometry relationships

avoid large steps in the water balance calculations that might be substantially effected by the order in which the different loss components are applied there are also checks to ensure that the channel cannot lose more water than is available that return flows from the alluvium cannot exceed the available storage and that the channel cannot add more water to the alluvium than the available storage the known uncertainties in the approach include the premise that the alluvial width is equally distributed on both sides of the channel and that there are no significant exchanges between the alluvium or channel bed and the underlying rock aquifer 3 study sites the first site has been chosen from the united states as there are no sites within south africa that have sufficient and reliable enough data to properly test the modelling approach the usa site is a 17 5 km reach of the san pedro river between usgs 2019 gauging stations 09471000 charleston 31 63 n 110 17 w 3 196 km2 and 09471550 fairbank 31 63 n 110 20 w 4 506 km2 of the 1 310 km2 incremental area 792 km2 is gauged by station 09471400 babocomari river 31 70 n 110 23 w while the well known walnut gulch catchments gauge a further 149 3 km2 lane et al 1980 continuous daily stream flow data are available from the usgs and southwest watershed research center websites for all 4 stations for the period 2000 to the present day five south african basins table 1 and fig 2 were chosen to further evaluate the revised approach and to assess the sensitivity and uncertainties in the adoption of different approaches to the use of the model the first sites are on the orange river upstream of the confluence with the fish river in namibia total area of 524 091 km2 and 477 sub basins chosen because of the availability of independent estimates of channel losses mckenzie and craig 1997 and the main objective for this basin was to compare the results with the previous method hughes and münster 2000 at various points in the basin as well as with some observed data at the vioolsdrift d8h003 gauging station located in the lower reaches of the orange river 28 758os 17 722oe one sub basin d81a in the orange river was also used to explore the sensitivity of some parameters of the alluvial losses component an additional site on the limpopo river was included to further evaluate the alluvial losses component largely because some prior estimates are available boroto and görgens 2003 howard et al 2013 the third site is the sabie river total area of 6 321 km2 and 25 sub basins chosen because the headwaters are in a topographically steep and wet area while the downstream sub basins are relatively flat and more arid the sabie was also used to test the loss model using flow volumes simulated for a 0 25o grid 14 grids in total the fourth and fifth sites are respectively the olifants doring river total area of 46 200 km2 and 75 sub basins and the crocodile east river total area of 10 446 km2 and 36 sub basins basins both of these basins are being used as part of a current study of the impacts of climate change on the determination of environmental flow requirements the olifants doring basin is located along the western seaboard of south africa with a winter rainfall regime and some arid headwater areas the crocodile east basin is in the summer rainfall region and has similar upstream downstream climate and runoff characteristics to the sabie river the channel evaporation model using default parameters with the tributary factor included was run for an additional 13 sites table 1 and fig 2 to determine how many south african large river basins are expected to be subject to important levels of losses no attempts were made to determine local values of the width and length parameters for the orange and sabie sites while elongation factors lek and measured channel lengths clk were determined for the olifants doring and crocodile east sites in addition the likely range of appropriate channel widths for a sample of 56 channels mostly on quite large rivers throughout south africa were estimated from google earth to assist in quantifying wsk and wpk in eq 3 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation fig 3 illustrates the results of trying to establish default parameters wsk and wpk for the channel width estimation the estimated width line is manually fitted using fixed ws and wp values of 3 5 and 0 35 respectively the measurements were based on google earth images and for each channel reach an upper and lower estimate was made to represent local variations in width it is apparent that there is a great deal of scatter in the measured points as well as quite large ranges between the upper and lower measurements no attempts have been made in the study to regionalize the width estimation parameters but the degree of scatter and some subjective observations noted during the sample measurements suggest that such an approach might be worthwhile to improve the estimates however it was also noted that it is very difficult to decide what representative widths should be chosen and there will remain a great deal of uncertainty even if a number of sample widths are measured for a single sub basin fig 4 illustrates the results of applying different methods for estimating the channel length varying parameters ltk and lek compared with lengths based on digital channel data derived from 1 50 000 scale topographic maps for both the olifants doring and crocodile east sub basins the sinuosity parameter ls was fixed at a value of 1 2 and all the regression lines were forced to pass through the origin at 0 0 the first assessment involved a default le value of 1 0 assumption of a circular sub basin shape and no allowance for additional channel length due to multiple tributaries lt 1 the result is clearly very poor r2 1 3 and a slope of 0 82 adding the tributary effects improves the relationship slightly but the regression coefficient remains negative adding the effects of elongation improves the regression coefficient to greater than 0 4 and gives a slope of close to 1 0 i e little systematic bias changing the sinuosity parameter to a higher 1 4 or lower 1 1 value did not make any substantial difference some of the outliers that have a substantial impact on the regression coefficient are related to quite short measured channel lengths that are a consequence of the way in which sub basin boundaries have been drawn this is illustrated in fig 5 using an example from the olifants doring basin in fig 5a sub basin e24 j flows into e24 k which then joins e40d to flow into e24 l which then flows into e24 m however both e24 k and e24 l have very short channel lengths receiving upstream flows and these represent extreme outliers in any relationship with sub basin area eq 5 if the sub basin boundaries close to the confluences were to be re drawn similar to fig 5b although their exact positions would be determined by the local topography e24 k and e24 l would become headwater sub basins that flow into e24 m whose measured length is well predicted by the model estimates both the area and the channel lengths of e24 m would be increased by this change and the predictions would remain very good this result suggests that the way in which sub basins are delineated could have an impact on the loss model 4 2 san pedro river channel and alluvial losses the rainfall inputs to the model were obtained from the cru 2019 global dataset mean annual total of 352 mm while the seasonal distribution of potential evaporation was obtained from the fao 2016 website mean annual depth of 1 800 mm approximately 72 of the incremental flows between the upstream and downstream sites on the main river are gauged the incremental flow time series were therefore initially estimated by subtracting the upstream flow from the downstream flow and only taking the positive differences where the gauged tributary flows were greater than these initial estimates they were used instead the results therefore represent the minimum possible incremental flows however the babocomari river is the major tributary and the walnut gulch inflows did not affect the estimation of incremental flows at all it is therefore likely that most of the other smaller ungauged tributaries will also have little influence on the estimations google earth imagery was used to estimate the channel length 17 5 km and width average of 40 m as well to estimate the alluvial width without site specific knowledge it was found to be difficult to estimate the extent of the alluvium which appears to be quite variable in width and the values used in the model are between 200 and 400 m similarly no information could be found about the nature of the alluvium nor the likely depth there are therefore a number of uncertainties in the setup of the model despite this being a data rich environment the model was run with no losses i e annual evaporation set to zero no alluvium below the channel for total alluvial widths of 200 and 400 m and for 2 m and 5 m of effective alluvial depth below the channel for the two widths i e a total of 7 basic model setups table 2 the storativity infiltration rate and evaporation loss parameters were adjusted to obtain good visual correspondence between the observed and simulated flow duration curves at the downstream site and some objective statistical functions calculated to illustrate the performance of the model the statistics used are the percentage bias between observed and simulated mean monthly values and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency for both normal values bias and nse and natural log transformed values bias ln and nse ln the nse representing the correspondence of the two flow duration curves nse fdc as well as the percentage time of zero flows are also given in table 2 the no losses model clearly demonstrates the importance of transmission losses particularly for moderate to low flows all of the other models show a substantial improvement in the statistics but the models with no alluvium below the channel are unable to generate a result that contains zero flows there is little to choose between the other models they all have approximately 20 zero flows compared to the observed of 13 they all have bias values of less than 10 slightly improved nse values as well as much improved nse ln and bias ln values compared to the no losses model fig 6 further illustrates the differences between a no losses model and one based on 5 m of alluvium below the channel based on flow duration curve comparisons the overall conclusion is that despite the uncertainties in the climate input data rainfall and evaporation based on global gridded data and the possible under estimate of incremental flows as well as the real physical layout of the river and alluvial system the model has performed reasonably well 4 3 orange river basin channel evaporation losses table 3 summarises the results of the previous losses method and the revised approach with and without the inclusion of the lt parameter the sinuosity and elongation parameters are set to their default values of 1 2 and 1 0 respectively the results table 2 are assessed at the start d71a middle d81a and close to the end d82 h of the reach considered by mckenzie and craig 1997 the inclusion of the tributary effects parameter lt makes a relatively small difference to the loss estimates despite the fact that including the tributary effects for the orange river could be over estimating the appropriate channel lengths to use in the model due to the quite large number of very arid sub basins that join the main river in the lower reaches of the basin the most important difference between the old and new methods is that the old method suggests much lower losses at high flows but greater losses at low flows and generates zero flows for approximately 20 of the time while zero flows using the revised method occur for less than 5 of the time fig 7 compares the flow duration curves fdcs of the cumulative flows with and without losses at site d82h with observed flow data from the nearest gauging station d8h003 located just upstream for the period 1935 to 1968 the observed flow data for this period are expected to represent close to natural conditions as this is prior to the construction of most of the major dams in the orange river basin although there were some major dams on the vaal river tributary even before this time the range of percentage bias values simulated observed 100 observed for the upper parts of the fdcs 5 to 20 are between 2 and 20 well within any uncertainties expected from the upstream simulations however for the lower part of the fdcs 80 to 95 the bias values without accounting for losses range from 170 to over 20 000 while after accounting for losses they are mostly reduced to less than 50 this result cannot be attributed to gross over simulation of the upstream sub basins as a large number of them particularly in the wetter headwaters are known to be perennial despite the large number of uncertainties in the comparison including the validity of the simulations of incremental flow for the 477 sub basins possible errors in the gauging data and the effects of early water resources developments on the flow regime the results for the new loss model are encouraging it is also clear that the old loss model substantially over estimated the losses during low flow conditions mckenzie and craig 1997 estimated the monthly loss volumes for the upper reach d71a to d81a to be between 24 and 35 106 m3 month 1 and between 17 and 28 106 m3 month 1 for the lower reach d81a to d82 h the lower values being applicable at lower flows and vice versa the mean monthly losses using the new model are 33 7 106 m3 month 1 for the upper reach and 32 6 106 m3 month 1 for the lower reach using the results with no tributary effects included mckenzie and craig 1997 based their initial estimates on an approach similar to the one used here i e wetted channel area multiplied by net evaporation demand but they used field measured channel areas and also ran a detailed hydraulic model that included an evapotranspiration loss function to validate the initial estimates 4 4 orange and limpopo river basins alluvial losses sub basin d81h has been used to run the alluvial losses part of the model using measured values for channel length 48 km and width 280 m the alluvial width is quite variable within the sub basin but the average is about 700 m there is no available information about the alluvial material characteristics nor are there any data to validate any model estimates the model evaluation is therefore based on a simple sensitivity assessment using variations in the as k and ep parameters table 4 the channel bed is mostly bedrock little alluvial material below the channel bed however the model has also been run with 10 m of alluvial below the channel bed to illustrate this part of the model the results for the situation where there is no alluvium below the channel are summarized in fig 8 a which indicates that the alluvial losses vary from approximately 3 106 m3 to less than 20 106 m3 the majority being substantially less than the volume of 28 3 106 m3 estimated for the channel evaporation losses as expected the losses increase with increasing values of the infiltration rate and storativity parameters and decrease with increasing evaporation parameter values resulting in less effective evaporative losses from the alluvium return flows are only significant for higher values of the evaporation parameter due to the alluvial material remaining wet into the dry seasons figs 8b and c summarise the results of the sensitivity analysis when the additional 10 m of alluvium below the channel bed is included fig 8b illustrates the variability of the volume of losses and return flows which are negligible as most of the storage is now below the channel while fig 8c illustrates the variability of the percentage time that the alluvial storage level is below the channel bed i e a losing river in both figures it is clear that the most sensitive parameter is now the evaporation power parameter while storativity is also a sensitive parameter in terms of the time that the alluvial storage is below the river bed the differences between figs 8a and b are mainly a reflection of the difference between losses occurring only through the channel banks fig 8a and those occurring through the channel bed when alluvial storage is assumed to exist below the channel bed fig 8b with alluvial storage losses being substantially greater than the estimated channel evaporation losses while it is unknown but unlikely that the orange river site really does have alluvial material below the channel the limpopo river site has been previously documented to have between 5 and 7 m of alluvium below the channel bed howard et al 2013 and therefore represents a better test of the alluvial losses part of the model the 25 7 km long reach lies between the confluences of the limpopo river with the bubye river from zimbabwe to the north and the luvuvhu river from south africa to the south the upstream inflows have been estimated from gauged records 1955 to 1980 at beit bridge some 130 km upstream with simulated estimates of inflows for all of the tributaries joining the limpopo downstream to the bubye river confluence most of which only flow during the wet season or have very low dry season flows table 4 indicates that the low flow regime of the limpopo river is very different to that of the orange river with lower relative dry season flows the upstream flow data suggest zero flow conditions for only 1 of the time but the monthly flow volumes are less than 2 106 m3 for about 30 of the time howard et al 2013 report total mean annual losses in this reach of approximately 51 106 m3 an analysis of google earth imagery suggests that the channel and total floodplain widths are highly variable with mean values of approximately 770 m and 2 290 m respectively the model was run with the same range of parameters used for the orange river and the closest result to the howard et al 2013 estimates were achieved with values of 0 2 0 1 and 1 0 for parameters k as and ep respectively the mean annual channel evaporation losses were 18 8 106 m3 while the alluvial losses were 29 3 106 m3 while the alluvial storage was below the channel bed for 48 of the time and the simulated downstream flow regime has zero flows for 30 of the time the orange and limpopo examples are also used to assess the sensitivity of using different approaches to varying the channel width with discharge volume eq 4 a part of the model already identified as being highly empirical and uncertain changing the shape of the discharge width relationship to force the width to decrease more rapidly and drop to a minimum of zero made almost no difference to the mean annual results at both sites for either the channel evaporation or the loss to alluvial storage however if the qmax term in eq 4 is based on fdc25 i e higher flows then the channel evaporation losses are reduced by about 10 15 while the alluvial losses remain largely unchanged a further source of uncertainty in the alluvial losses component is the estimation of channel depth either from field observations at sample cross sections or using eq 8 as might be expected if the depth is reduced for the orange river example with no alluvial storage below the channel bed the losses are also reduced a 35 reduction in channel depth leads to a 25 reduction in alluvial losses however when alluvial storage below the channel bed is included the reverse effect occurs i e losses reduce as the channel depth is increased for a 35 change in channel depth there is a 10 change in the opposite direction in simulated alluvial losses this rather surprising result at first sight is related to the dominance of the evaporation losses that create available storage in the alluvium as the channel depth is reduced the below channel alluvial storage plays a greater role than the adjacent alluvial storage and losses through the channel bed rather than the much smaller channel banks become relatively more important this result further emphasises the importance of the evaporation loss parameter and of understanding the evapotranspiration characteristics of alluvial material that will be closely associated with the cover and rooting depth characteristics of the floodplain vegetation 4 5 sabie river basin the original intention of including the sabie river was to compare the loss results using the wr2012 simulations based on sub basins with gridded simulations from a global runoff model based on some previous comparisons between the wr2012 data and the outputs from global models that formed part of the catchx project almeida et al 2018 the outputs from a water resources reanalysis model performed by the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts land surface scheme http wci earth2observe eu thredds dodsc ecmwf wrr2 monthly agg nc html accessed on 17 october 2018 appeared to generate runoff estimates that were closer to the wr2012 data than the other models available through the earth2observe project schellekens et al 2017 however closer examination revealed that even these were unable to capture the high baseflow hughes 2010 contributions from the headwaters see also https earthwatch org uk images catchx catchxdatatestingreport pdf accessed on 14 february 2019 the wr2012 streamflow data were therefore converted to runoff depths and further converted to gridded depths using a 0 25o grid size based on weighted averages of the sub basin areas that fall within each grid the gridded depth time series were then converted back to volumes based on the area of each grid that falls within the total basin area a similar approach was used to determine the rainfall time series and the annual evaporation depths table 5 indicates that the losses for all of the possible basin configurations are relatively small and probably well within any of the uncertainties associated with simulating the incremental flows the grid results suggest lower losses but the differences are not significant compared to the overall uncertainties part of the reason for lower losses in the gridded approach is likely to be related to the fact that 80 of the total area 14 sub basins experience losses in the sub basin model while only 64 of the area 7 grids experience losses in the grid model 4 6 crocodile east and olifants doring river basins the main purpose of including these sites was to assess the value of the direct measurements of both the sub basin elongation factor lek and channel length the crocodile east river is close and similar to the sabie river while the olifants doring river is located in the arid west coast area of south africa but also has some tributaries rising in the wetter cederberg mountain range it is a winter rainfall region such that any headwater low flows during the dry season will be subject to much greater net evaporation volumes than the basins in the summer rainfall regions in the east of the country for the crocodile east site there are negligible differences between the different loss estimates the losses and differences between models are greater for the olifants doring site but they remain relatively small and all within the bounds of overall uncertainty both results suggest that efforts spent on quantifying channel characteristics for individual sub basins are not likely to be rewarded by more precise estimates 4 7 additional sites table 6 lists the mean annual runoff with and without the estimated channel evaporation losses for all the basins fig 2 using the wr90 1920 1990 naturalized flows rainfall and evaporation data there are 6 basins where channel losses are unlikely to have any major effects losses 2 and these are mostly basins with relatively high rainfall in the downstream areas the middle group 2 losses 10 represent a range of different upstream downstream conditions and include the sabie and olifants doring examples already discussed the higher losses group 10 are made up mostly of rivers that have quite arid conditions throughout their basins but also includes the orange and two rivers in the north of the country that have wetter headwaters and flow through very arid areas towards the limpopo river crocodile west and mogalakwena the final column of table 6 offers some suggestions about which basins are expected to experience additional transmission losses due to either alluvial areas or wetlands unfortunately there is insufficient information available to properly identify which basins are likely to experience these additional losses and to quantify the parameters of the alluvial losses component of the model 5 discussion and conclusions this paper presents a relatively simple model that is designed to be used with semi distributed using sub basins or grids simulated time series of incremental monthly stream flow to account for channel transmission losses when the incremental flows are accumulated to generate total downstream flow volume time series the model consists of two components evaporative losses from the wetted channel surface and losses through exchanges between the channel and adjacent and underlying alluvial material the approach is based on coarse time and spatial scales and the model algorithms are almost certainly inappropriate for detailed assessments during individual storm events in arid ephemeral rivers e g lange 2005 the model was initially tested on a usa site with good upstream and downstream observed streamflow information but without detailed information on channel geometry and alluvial storage while the results are satisfactory there inevitably remains uncertainty in the estimation of the parameter values an assessment of the channel evaporation model results for the lower orange river suggests that the model generates outputs that are in general agreement with both the results of a previous study mckenzie and craig 1997 and some observed stream flow data the relative differences in evaporation losses table 6 for 17 large river basins throughout the country are at least intuitively sensible given the climate variations between their headwater and downstream areas the application of both components of the model channel evaporation and alluvial losses to a reach of the limpopo river simulated losses that are consistent with previous estimates boroto and görgens 2003 howard et al 2013 some of the uncertainties are inevitably associated with the simulations of all the sub basin incremental monthly stream flow time series in the south african example basins used in this study these are based on a regional application of a rainfall runoff model that has been previously validated for sub basins where there are some historical observed flow data midgley et al 1994 middleton and bailey 2009 hughes 2013 while uncertainties therefore do exist these data represent the de facto standard for water resources estimation in the region in the channel evaporation component of the model the major uncertainties are associated with the estimation of channel width and length as well as how the wetted width varies with upstream inflows fig 3 suggests that channel widths can be highly variable even within relatively short reaches and that a simple relationship with cumulative catchment area eq 3 might not be very reliable yamazaki et al 2014 reported a global database of channel widths but these estimates are quite generalised and have been found to be inaccurate for many southern african rivers a similar degree of uncertainty exists in the estimation of channel length using the incremental catchment area eq 5 and fig 4 while adding some limited measurements to account for catchment shape the elongation factor in eq 5 improves the estimates both the width and length values can be based on direct measurements but this increases the time resources required to set up the model and the two examples of the crocodile east and olifants doring suggest that the differences in the overall result might be quite small it would also be difficult to apply direct measurements to gridded data as the grids do not represent physically real sub basin areas the uncertainties in the alluvial losses component of the model include similar problems of defining the alluvial surface area but additional uncertainties are associated with some of the model assumptions and with quantifying the depth hydraulic properties and evapotranspiration regime of the alluvial material some previous studies of transmission losses in the southern africa region have focused on very arid namibian rivers lange 2005 morin et al 2009 and on single flood events and have not included long time series of flow volumes in the publications it is therefore very difficult to compare these previously published results with those of the monthly time step model used in this study the model was applied to the orange river with an assumption that the active alluvial storage is above the channel bed and that the primary exchange process is through the channel banks this assumption was based on some un reported observations from several sources that suggest that regional groundwater tables in the valley bottoms of many large south african rivers remain close to the channel bottom under natural conditions or that the channel beds are underlain by bedrock costa et al 2013 reached a similar conclusion for a semi arid river in brazil this is clearly not the case for the more arid namibian rivers morin et al 2009 nor for the limpopo river example included in this study fig 8 illustrates that the dynamics of losses are quite different when alluvial material is assumed to exist below the channel the limpopo river example was included as there is at least some evidence suggesting deeper alluvium as well as some estimates of likely losses the limiting factors that determine alluvial loss volumes are very different between the three examples the orange river with and without alluvium below the bed and the limpopo river in the first orange river example fig 8a the key limiting factor is the value of the infiltration rate parameter in the second orange river example the main limiting factor is the available alluvial storage in any model time step and how this is depleted through evapotranspiration fig 8b the estimated upstream flow regime for the orange river has sufficient low flows to fill the alluvial storage for most months of the time series table 4 however this is not the case with the limpopo river and one of the limiting factors is the amount of upstream inflow available to increase the alluvial storage while the most sensitive parameter is the evaporation power these are quite important observations given that all of the parameters can only be estimated with a high degree of uncertainty jarihani et al 2015 in most situations i e without detailed field observations the main intention of this paper was to present the model and illustrate its application in several different situations while a secondary intention was to highlight those areas of south africa where transmission losses are potentially important and where resources should be directed at a better understanding of the processes and their estimation while all of the south african applications referred to in the present study have used simulations of natural stream flow conditions the model could also be useful to examine the impacts of losses on managed flow regimes examples might include an assessment of transmission loss impacts on managed releases from an upstream reservoir to provide for either downstream irrigation abstractions or environmental flow requirements in river systems where transmission losses are likely to be important a larger release would be required than just the downstream requirements however there remains uncertainty in the application of the model and further work needs to focus on obtaining additional data that can be used to assess the model and methods of parameter estimation in different river systems declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest associated with this study data and software availability statement the loss

8418,study region urban aquifer of mashhad city northeastern iran study focus measuring the ratios of the stable nitrate isotopes and hydrogeochemistry of major components in order to specify the origin of nitrate contamination and potential transformation processes in the aquifer new hydrological insights for the region this study represents the first isotopic characterization of groundwater nitrate to identify the sources of excessive nitrate in the urban aquifer and provides a reference for the potential implementation of executive programs on groundwater quality and protection nitrate concentration exceeded the limits for nitrate in drinking water in most of the wells 110 out of 261 isotopic composition of the oxygen and nitrogen of no3 in groundwater indicated sewage as the primary source of nitrate contamination denitrification was identified as a non significant process in the aquifer concentrations of anions cl so4 2 and po4 3 and no3 showed strong correlations confirming potential wastewater influence most of the groundwater was weakly acidic and the chemistry of the groundwater was rather affected by urbanization and land use than by aquifer rock interactions the absence of a reliable sewer collecting system particularly in the central and southern parts of the study area directly resulted in the poor water quality considering the lack of natural attenuation processes in the groundwater management options need to be considered for reducing nitrogen input into groundwater keywords nitrate urban groundwater nitrogen 15 oxygen 18 hydrochemistry water pollution 1 introduction groundwater in urban areas has always been an important resource which is frequently endangered by the contamination of overlay cities groundwater protection especially in the semi arid regions where groundwater is the main source of drinking water is fundamental in urban areas the rising demand for groundwater as a potential source for public water supply draws attentions to water management for maintaining a good chemical and ecological status of groundwater considering significant solubility nitrate is potentially the most globally extensive contaminant in groundwater and particularly in urban settings has become a public concern due to the associated health issues wakida and lerner 2005 due to the low groundwater recharge in semi arid areas successful management of no3 affected aquifers requires determining the origin of no3 and understanding the fate of nitrate in groundwater in urban groundwater there are two main nitrate sources 1 direct influx of nitrate from mineral fertilizer and sewage and 2 influx of nitrate from nitrification of ammonium resulting from mineral fertilizers soil organic nitrogen mineralization and sewage as well as the urea hydrolysis in human wastes identifying the sources of the nitrate several approaches were developed including e g physically transport modelling approaches mahar and datta 2000 2001 mattern et al 2009 wagner 1992 statistically based modelling approaches leterme et al 2006 masetti et al 2008 mattern et al 2012 spruill et al 2002 sun 2007 terrado et al 2006 and chemical fingerprinting mattern et al 2011 amongst the last mentioned approach nitrate origin in aquifers and the water it is solved in can be distinguished using different methods a isotopic composition of no3 b water isotopic composition c chemical and isotopic composition of major and trace elements in aquifer d the existence of nitrate co pollutants of particular origins and e aquifer mean age mingzhu et al 2014 here the isotopic ratios of no3 15n 14n and 18o 16o provide a direct means of source identification due to its advantages of employing isotopically distinct compositions of different nitrate sources different sources of no3 e g atmospheric soil fertilizer and sewage typically have distinct nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition additionally biological cycling of nitrate e g denitrification generally changes the ratios of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes distinctively therefore to identify the contamination sources as well as understanding the denitrification processes the study of dual nitrate stable isotopes is an appropriate method although a range of studies have been carried out in america and europe applying an isotopic multiple tracer techniques including dual nitrate stable isotopes n and o böhlke and denver 1995 mattern et al 2011 singleton et al 2007 vystavna et al 2017 widory et al 2005 2004 yang and toor 2016 the gathered information from these studies may not be applicable in the middle eastern cities due to different natural conditions e g hydrogeology climate and geology and cultural situations i e local community policy religion and land use in addition most of the studies were carried out in rural areas in which nitrate has typically been connected to agricultural activities due to the utilization of fertilizers there are only a few studies that are focused on the non agricultural origins of nitrate in cities using stable nitrate isotopes diédhiou et al 2012 fukada et al 2004 jin et al 2004 mingzhu et al 2014 which were mainly conducted in a humid climate of developed cities with strong water management policies and only covered certain areas of the urban aquifer with a limited number of monitoring wells however for semi arid climates it still is unclear on how the interaction of natural conditions infrastructure and water management can affect nitrate concentration in urban aquifers which would also require a unique dense network of monitoring wells to provide a strong resolution for the further executive plans therefore unplanned developments as well as economical deficiencies may cause intense pollution to the groundwater in iran still evidence by source tracking is often missing for raising public awareness and proposing proper water and wastewater management options to give this evidence and support the management options stable isotopes of dissolved nitrate can be employed contamination of nitrate is a serious problem in mashhad groundwater where the who world health organization standard of drinking water of 50 mg l as nitrate 10 mg l no3 n edition 2011 in resource wells is frequently exceeded dolati 2010 studies carried out between 1956 and 2005 showed a generation of diffuse contamination of nitrate through the alluvial deposits of quaternary aquifers of mashhad due to fast urbanization dolati 2010 they have also shown a more alarming contamination increase in certain areas mainly in the old town at the central part of the city predominantly after 1986 due to rapid growth of population the origin and the fate of nitrate in mashhad urban aquifer are not fully understood yet and the potential for natural attenuation through denitrification in the groundwater remains to be investigated denitrification is the most important process to sustainably remove no3 in the aquifer due to the microbial transformation of no3 to n2 gas proving the existence of denitrification may also confirm the validation of tracked natural attenuation for a practical remediation plan the stable n isotope of nitrate has already been widely applied to determine the origin and the nitrate fate in surface and groundwater amiri et al 2015 böhlke and denver 1995 karr et al 2003 kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 moore et al 2006 stable n isotope values 15nno3 are understood in characteristic ranges related to their nitrogen origin for instance losses and conversions of wastewater nitrogen while it moves out of a septic tank down into a groundwater leaves wastewater based no3 enriched in 15n compared to no3 from natural soils aravena et al 1993 kreitler et al 1978 kreitler and browning 1983 inorganic nitrogen departs from septic tanks mainly in the form of ammonium valiela et al 1997 with values of δ15n around 6 mcclelland et al 1997 while nh4 can be lost due to the volatilization of ammonia the residual nh4 is transformed to no3 in the presence of oxygen by autotrophic bacteria if seepage water flows through anoxic zones nitrate can be further transformed due to denitrification valiela et al 1997 ammonia volatilization and denitrification both reduce 14n preferably over 15n consequently the residual no3 from wastewater has a typical δ15n value range between 7 and 25 including animal wastes aravena et al 1993 kendall 1998 kreitler et al 1978 kreitler and browning 1983 the n isotope values for nitrate from mineralization of soil organic matter are smaller typically between 3 and 8 kendall 1998 also mineral fertilizers show a distinct different δ15n value ranging between 7 and 5 in urban settings if the nitrate δ15n value of groundwater range between 7 and 25 and sewage based microbiological tracers are found the source of nitrate might generally be caused by n in sewage barrett et al 1997 1999 however since δ15n values of no3 can be altered via isotopic fractionation due to the chemical physical and microbial procedures including volatilization nitrification as well as denitrification applying δ15n values of no3 alone might not be sufficient for recognition of the source of nitrate in groundwater bodies a number of studies have highlighted that the oxygen isotope of nitrate is a promising technique for identifying nitrate reactions kendall 1998 some confirmed that evaluation of stable 18o isotopes of nitrate is an effective approach for determining denitrification processes in an aquifer cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 2001 panno et al 2001 mayer et al 2001 successfully employed δ18o of nitrate in an investigation of nitrification silva et al 2002 implemented stable o isotope of nitrate in a study of two residential environments and came to the conclusion that isotopic analysis is specially matched to assessments of urban nitrate origins because of the characteristic isotopic signatures of fertilizers and sewage the data analysis of n and o stable isotopes δ15n and δ18o of no3 is a powerful method offering useful information on the source of groundwater nitrate contamination the impact of various origins investigating transport ranges and processes and for assessing the potential of natural attenuation however nitrate dual isotope values might be altered due to isotope fractionation during nitrogen cycle processes which can be also vary temporally and spatially this alteration may cause a deviation in source tracking of nitrate pollution in groundwater and surface water thus dual isotope studies alone cannot always present definitive information regarding origins and processes combining nitrate dual isotopes with co migrating discriminators of no3 sources like carbon c and boron b isotopes as well as the solute tracers in hydrochemistry can enhance the accuracy of the method li et al 2014 by employing the dual isotopes and δ 13c successfully determined that the sewage and manure were the main origins of nitrate in the dry season in the chaobai area boron also has already been used in several studies as a tracer for sewage contamination in groundwater fernandes et al 2019 sacchi et al 2013 verstraeten et al 2005 widory et al 2004 2005 xue et al 2013 by employing δ 15n and δ 18o combined with δ 11b determined that the primary origin of the no3 in the flanders area of belgium were domestic sewage however the aquifers that are predominantly composed of clay minerals may affect the b isotopic composition due to adsorption desorption interactions with the clay minerals xue et al 2009 additionally hydrogeological details and chemical data need to be applied for interpreting isotopic compositions to identify the origins and biogeochemical background of nitrate in aquifer systems isotopic composition of nitrate combined with nitrate concentration can provide a strong explanation for recognizing the nitrate origin mayer et al 2002 pardo et al 2004 stadler et al 2012 associating 15n isotopic values of nitrate with cations and anions concentrations of groundwater also offers useful information for nitrate origin identification since chemical components from anthropogenic origin tend to dominate the ones from natural origin spruill et al 2002 in case of existence of multiple pollution sources there is also the possibility to evaluate the contribution of each no3 source several studies implemented mathematical models like mass balance mixing model moore and semmens 2008 phillips and koch 2002 however this model is not capable of considering the incorporation of several substantial sources of uncertainty including spatial temporal change of δ15n and δ18o of no3 and also the isotopic fractionation during nitrification moore and semmens 2008 therefore the siar stable isotope analysis in r mixing model which uses a bayesian framework has been developed parnell and jackson 2008 this model calculates possible proportional source contribution and subsequently evaluates the probability distribution for the proportional contribution of each source to the mixture xue et al 2009 the model is able to quantify the contribution ratios of multiple more than three pollution sources and also to decrease the above mentioned uncertainties of the mass balance mixing model zhang et al 2018 successfully used the model to evaluate the contribution ratio of 61 69 from domestic sewage and manure in the study area this study implemented a dual isotopic method combined with hydrogeological as well as chemical data to identify origins and processes influencing nitrate in groundwater from the unconfined aquifer in an urban area suffering from severe human activities the area of study chosen is mashhad quaternary aquifer beneath the city of mashhad in the northeast of iran with samples obtained for a two objective designed study isotopic and hydrochemistry analysis a primary aim was to determine the causes for elevating nitrate contamination in the groundwater and its reliance on land use with the intention to notify upcoming management decisions targeted at safeguarding groundwater quality 2 study area given the large population density and occurring of potential nitrogen sources particularly fertilizers and sewage pollution of the aquifer has been detected in many urban areas in iran alighardashi and mehrani 2017 dadgar and payandeh 2017 jalali 2005 mashhad is the second most populous city in iran and the capital of khorasan e razavi province it is located 850 km north east of tehran between 36 15 36 20 northern latitude and 59 30 59 40 eastern longitude the area covers 280 km2 area at the elevation of 985 m above sea level mashhad is in the valley of the kashaf roud river between the two mountain ranges of binaloud and hezar masjid the city is situated close to the borders of turkmenistan and afghanistan fig 1 the population of mashhad is larger than 3 million and it is estimated that over 20 million tourists visit the city each year tandise 2013 the study area is subject to a continental climate originated from interfacing varied air masses consisting of maritime tropical polar continental and sudanian air masses characterized by dry hot summers and generally wet cold winters khalili et al 2016 the average temperature in the area is around 13 5 c by having the minimum recorded temperature as 21 c january and the maximum temperature recorded as 44 c july in the arid and semiarid climate of mashhad the majority of annual precipitation falls between february and march and the average annual precipitation is about 253 mm khalili et al 2016 2 1 geology mashhad is located on thick quaternary deposits which are derived from kashaf roud river alluvial fans descend from the northern slopes koppet dagh structural zones and alluvial fans descend from binaloud mountains in the south and southwest baghvand et al 2016 the city is surrounded by granitic metamorphic as well as ultrabasic outcrops such as schist slate and phyllite in southwestern and southern parts and diverse sedimentary rocks including limestone marl and clastic rocks in northern margins originated from koppet dagh nasseh et al 2016 the sediments under the city are a combination of metamorphic and ultramafic rocks karimi et al 2017 the clay mineral smectite which results from the weathering of mica is the main observed mineral in the alluvial fan and the foothills of the southern part of the city and the clay mineral kaolinite is the predominant mineral in the flat plain of the laid sediments under the city in the southern part of the city also limited gypsum lenses were identified and it may have an impact on the concentration of sulfate in the soil in these parts the intense weathering of the ultrabasic and metamorphic rocks and the active tectonics in southern mashhad heights have contributed to the accumulation of sulfate in the area asghari et al 2018 2 2 topography and hydrogeology the mashhad aquifer is unconfined and composed of alluvial gravel sand sediments belonging to the quaternary period the city and its urban aquifer are laid among the fan shaped area at the foot of the mountains of binaloud in the southern and western borders and kashaf roud river which crosses the northern border of mashhad city the river has flow direction from the northwest to the southeast during wet years by following from the highlands of binaloud mountains to the lowlands of kashaf roud river sw ne which is the thalweg of the mashhad plain the texture gradation of the soil gradually turns from coarse to fine which means gravel sand and silty sand respectively accordingly the potentiometric piezometric gradient of the groundwater ranges from around 1045 m above the sea level in some parts of the west and northwest to 880 m in the east and southeast ehteshami et al 2014 generally groundwater flows according to the piezometric gradient and the plain general slope from northwest to southeast by reaching the southern high elevations groundwater flow is directed to the southeast and northeast asadi et al 2017a 2017b the chemical data of groundwater from the same aquifer but outside the urban zone situated in the vicinity of the northern borders of the city 40 km showed ca hco3 water type nitrate concentration in this water is 10 06 mg l shojaei et al 2013 and the groundwater is isolated from contamination sources related to human activities and transferred to the city as a part of the drinking water resources by the water organization of mashhad thus it could possibly be inferred that natural processes including chemical weathering are the key contributor of chemical constituents of the groundwater from the non urban zone due to little precipitation in recent years and also the excessive density of extraction wells it was predicted that the aquifer drawdown will range between 1 5 5 m in eastern parts to approximately 30 m in the western parts of the city by october 2020 ehteshami et al 2014 and this decline in groundwater level could impact the quantity and quality of drinking water substantially around 220 million cubic meters of water are needed to satisfy the annual domestic demand of the city the daily average of water consumption in mashhad is about 550 000 m3 d and consequently 70 of which turned into wastewater felfelani and kerachian 2016 furthermore it is assumed that almost 75 of the consumed drinking water as an average annual rate returns to groundwater ehteshami et al 2014 groundwater is mainly recharged by municipal return flow and partly by agricultural floods and surface runoff flows from southern mountains and some direct infiltration from precipitations central and southern parts are the main old core of the city and the population density is considerably higher than in the western area which is newly constructed due to the expansion of the city 3 materials and methods samples of groundwater of mashhad city were collected from 261 deep 30 m wells for isotopic and chemical analyses in summer 2015 which coincide with the dry season even by considering the fact that the study area is generally in an arid climate the quality of groundwater related to deeper wells was intentionally investigated during dry season to evaluate long term impacts of the degradation of the quality of water and also to prevent fluctuations in quality of water caused by possible short term recharge through the wet season in mashhad prior to sampling the wells were purged several times to guarantee that samples are representative of the aquifer formation these wells supply the water to the city for drinking purposes most of these traditional drinking water wells were installed long ago and no further information is available on their actual depth and screening length all the collected samples were taken from the same aquifer the sampling locations covering large parts of the city are demonstrated in fig 1 the samples of groundwater were taken with a submersible pump about 3 to 5 m below the groundwater table the samples were filtered by using a 0 45 μm membrane filter and filled into 60 ml pet bottles 261 samples were considered for the main cation and anion analysis and 42 samples for nitrate isotope analysis the samples for cation analysis were preserved by using ultra pure nitric acid the samples for isotope analysis were stored at 0 4 c and transferred to the laboratory shortly after collection nitrate chloride sulfate phosphate calcium and magnesium were analyzed by means of the spectrophotometer hach dr 6000 potassium and sodium analyzed by flame photometry model sherwood 410 and bicarbonate analyzed applying titration technique the values of δ15n and δ18o in no3 were analyzed by applying the anion exchange technique silva et al 2000 the common method to obtain a dual isotope analysis of no3 in water is relying on the nitrate pre concentration on resin anion exchange refinement and conversion into agno3 silver nitrate in thermal conversion elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometry tc ea irms analysis silva et al 2000 values of δ15n are expressed in using delta notation in accordance with isotopic composition of atmospheric nitrogen air by having a 0 05 analytical accuracy and values of δ18o are reported with respect to vienna standard mean oceanic water v smow with a 0 5 uncertainty data processing was performed by ibm spss software v25 and modelling of spatial variability of the groundwater ions concentrations was performed by interpolation of sampling points using the algorithmic method inverse distance weighted idw integrated into arcgis 10 5 software package the groundwater type of study area is also represented using surfer v15 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater geochemistry the samples chemical compositions of groundwater attained from 261 groundwater sampling sites in october 2015 and the results are summarized in fig 2 southern and central parts of the city had increased nitrate chloride sulfate and phosphate concentrations in groundwater while the western area of the study area had a much lower concentration of no3 cl so4 2 and po4 3 in groundwater fig 2 generally mashhad groundwater has high no3 so4 2 cl po4 3 mg2 and ca2 concentrations specifically the southern and central parts of the city the nitrate content was larger than the threshold value for anthropogenic impact 3 mg l no3 n 13 mg l no3 in 97 of the sampling sites and exceeded the drinking water standard 50 mg l no3 10 mg l no3 n babiker et al 2004 in 42 of the wells with a maximum value of 166 1 mg l no3 concentrations of cl ranged from 13 5 to 653 7 mg l with an average of 192 44 mg l the study also detected excessive levels of sulfate with a maximum of 1909 8 mg l an average of 318 43 mg l phosphate with a maximum of 2 8 mg l an average of 0 9 mg l calcium with a maximum of 606 4 mg l an average of 136 2 mg l magnesium with a maximum of 196 2 mg l an average of 41 6 mg l also the maximum and average of sodium are 299 1 mg l and 89 3 mg l respectively in addition the potassium level was ranged between 0 7 and 8 2 mg l concentrations of anions cl so4 2 and po4 3 and no3 confirmed strong correlations specifying that they have arisen from the same origins fig 3 i e on manure and or sewage e g human wastes particularly urea detergents and industrial products strong correlations also obtained from no3 and cations mg2 and ca2 plots fig 3 accordingly no3 so4 2 cl po4 3 mg2 and ca2 are released in the system by anthropogenic sources however that possibly a part of the mg2 ca2 and so4 2 originates from mineral dissolution ion exchange and water rock interaction the major groundwater ions are displayed on a trilinear diagram fig 4 the groundwater in the aquifer is identified as diverse chemical types on the piper diagram piper 1944 the groundwater chemical types mostly change through flow direction nw se the samples of groundwater from the new residential districts in the western part of the city predominantly plot in the area of the ca mg hco3 water type by following the direction of groundwater flow from the western to the central and southern parts of the city groundwater mainly changes to ca mg cl no3 so4 and ca mg no3 so4 types respectively the scatter of points on the diagram and the change of water chemistry along the groundwater flow paths within the urban area suggest a distinct anthropogenic impact on groundwater chemical composition which can also be complemented by natural processes ca2 and na in groundwater may be resulting from the incongruent dissolution of plagioclase in granite saether and de caritat 1996 ca2 typically originates from carbonate minerals particularly calcite and dolomite which normally appear in veins and as secondary minerals in granite and also from the gypsum layers ca2 might even be derived from the dissolution of concrete in sidewalks and streets ca2 and na additionally originate from domestic effluents in urban areas the main origin of mg2 is from magnesium chloride and biotite of granite which can be a common mineral in shear and gneiss zone k originates from orthoclase and muscovite of granite anions including cl so4 2 as well as no3 are main inorganic components degrading the groundwater quality as drinking water given that saline water and cl minerals typically are not observed on a significant scale in the area excessive cl groundwater content appears to result from sources of pollution cl might be based on the pollution sources including domestic effluents septic tanks fertilizers and by natural sources including the dissolution of fluid inclusions and rainfall ritzi et al 1993 so4 2 sources can consist of detergents and industrial products precipitation fertilizers and as well sulfide dissolution in granite since gypsum was identified in the southern parts of the city asghari et al 2018 the so4 dense water besides the anthropogenic impacts seems to be partially influenced by the sulfide mineral dissolution in this part of the aquifer in the central and southern parts the groundwater of ca mg cl no3 so4 type is affected by anthropogenic inputs while the groundwater of ca hco3 type could be considered as moderately clean groundwater besides the groundwater resources which were generally not affected by urbanization located outside of the urban zone of the study area confirmed the water types of ca hco3 shojaei et al 2013 4 2 sources of nitrate using nitrate isotopes the isotopic composition of nitrate δ15n and δ18o in groundwater was measured to identify the source nitrate and potential transformation processes groundwater sampling locations for isotope analysis were chosen particularly in nitrate contaminated areas with concentrations ranging from 49 to 166 1 mg l n 42 the locations and the results are shown in figs 5 and 6 and table 1 the δ18ono3 was not regionalized due to the little isotopic variation of oxygen in nitrate across the study area the common limits of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 for the main origins of no3 which might impact groundwater are also presented in fig 6 kendall 1998 the measured values of δ15n of no3 in groundwater ranged between 7 97 and 17 06 with an average value of 12 75 n 42 a value which is characteristic of nitrate sources from sewage and human waste 7 and 25 kendall 1998 table 1 the conclusion that the increased values of no3 are originated from sewage and human waste agrees with the population density in the contaminated areas grouping land covers land uses reveal that central and southern parts of the study area with higher population density have the maximum value of no3 concentration 166 1 mg l with the highest δ15n value 17 06 in contrast western areas show the minimum value of obtained values with smaller variable no3 contents 8 mg l and the lowest δ15n value 7 97 fig 7 the outcomes are in line with findings of previous studies asadi et al 2017a 2017b based on the nitrate data from 26 wells in 2001 asadi et al 2017a presented a vulnerability assessment of mashhad groundwater to nitrate using drastic method the results demonstrated that the central and southern districts had the highest vulnerability to pollution while the western and northwestern districts had the lowest vulnerability they also concluded that land use was the most significant parameter for vulnerability assessment using a modified drastic model and fuzzy set theory asadi et al 2017b which is now confirmed by the nitrate isotope methods in the present study the nitrate in groundwater in the unconfined aquifer of mashhad is the result of urea hydrolysis in human sewage waste through the process of nitrification of nh4 the signature of stable n isotope associated with human urea mainly range between 5 and 8 o connell et al 2001 and is higher for human faeces 11 8 choi et al 2003 the value of δ15n increases due to the hydrolysis of urea the total unidirectional reaction leads to a partial loss of ammonia volatilization depleted in 15n relative to ammonium in solution heaton 1986 kendall 1998 the residual 15n enriched ammonium is then nitrified to 15n enriched nitrate previously reported stable n isotope of no3 in aquifer influenced by human waste and sewage 7 3 and 16 9 aravena et al 1993 fogg et al 1998 hiscock et al 1997 kreitler and jones 1975 rivers et al 1996 silva et al 2002 is in accordance with values for the mashhad groundwater in this study ranging between 7 97 and 17 06 isotopic values of dissolved no3 in groundwater δ15nno3 vs δ18ono3 are plotted in fig 6 if denitrification was important the values of n and o isotopes of dissolved nitrate must have a distinct positive trend in approximately a 2 1 isotopic ratio böttcher et al 1990 due to the absence of a sizeable o isotopic variation in groundwater no3 samples throughout the study area and the absence of any clear trend on the linear relationship on the present plat fig 6 the δ18o data provided the proof that in study area basically no considerable denitrification was occurring combination of concentration and isotopic composition of no3 provide meaningful information in the case of a single no3 concentration source and when no fractionation process occurs xue et al 2009 therefore δ15nno3 values and no3 concentration are plotted in fig 8 and positively correlated a strong positive relationship like this happens when denitrification is negligible and groundwater quality is affected largely by a single sewage source of contamination choi et al 2003 therefore fig 8 confirms the interpretation that contamination of groundwater of mashhad is derived from sewage and human waste sources the findings of sewage human waste as the main source for nitrate in groundwater is also in agreement with elevated concentration of cl so4 2 and po4 3 since concerning the geological situation of the study area these ions seem to have the anthropogenic origin e g domestic effluents septic tanks detergents etc compared to other studies in urban areas fukada et al 2004 jin et al 2004 and despite differences in geological and climatic situation and also in sewage collection systems the signatures of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate in the present study are relatively similar which show the same sewage derived sources for nitrate in all studies differences mainly can be attributed to the absence or existence of denitrification as a potential natural remediation process in different places in addition the sampling wells in this study area are mainly old traditional water wells even though sampling depth was similar for all wells 3 to 5 m below the groundwater table the actual representative depth of sampling is unknown and hence stratification of sampling cannot be excluded still nitrate isotopes indicated that denitrification is not a considerable process for the parts of the groundwater which samples were taken from nevertheless if in further downstream or deeper parts of the aquifer anaerobic processes are of importance remains unknown in this case results of isotopic composition with support of chemical analysis show that the traditional way of wastewater disposal beneath private homes is still in use particularly in the central and southern parts of the city as well as a number of other large cities in iran a high nitrogen discharge from domestic cesspools to the groundwater of tehran was also shown by joekar niasar and ataie ashtiani 2009 this old method of wastewater disposal had been designed as deep underground absorption wells as a septic system to transmit houses wastewater to the soil for the purpose of benefiting from natural remediation via denitrification these absorption wells may be the primary issue for the leaching of wastewater and sewage into the groundwater in central and southern parts while newly supplying the western part of the city with a sewage collection system resulted in minimizing the influence of anthropogenic impacts in this part additionally lack of denitrification is strong evidence on the insufficiency of this traditional disposal system in the investigated parts of the aquifer 5 conclusion this study applied a dual isotope methodology complemented by hydrogeological and chemical data for identifying sources and processes influencing nitrate concentrations in groundwater the stable n isotope data of no3 indicated sewage and human waste as the predominant nitrate contamination sources in groundwater which was confirmed by the geochemical composition with elevated chloride sulfate and phosphorous concentrations being markers of wastewater and exceeding natural threshold concentrations particularly in the central and southern regions of the urban area with an incomplete sewer collection system the direct injection of sewage through septic systems resulted in the contamination of the aquifer negligible denitrification was found emphasizing the vulnerability of the aquifer the outcomes of the study indicate that extensive nitrate contamination of the mashhad groundwater will remain to grow unless management practices are significantly improved this includes reducing the levels of residual nitrate in groundwater and particularly improve the sanitation system in areas with the absence of a reliable sewer collecting system i e in the central and southern parts of the study area even with improved management strategies it must be considered that high nitrate concentrations will remain in the aquifer for some time due to the absence of denitrification additionally time lags between any measures taken for improving the groundwater quality and the actual confirmation of improvement need to be kept in mind declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

confirming potential wastewater influence most of the groundwater was weakly acidic and the chemistry of the groundwater was rather affected by urbanization and land use than by aquifer rock interactions the absence of a reliable sewer collecting system particularly in the central and southern parts of the study area directly resulted in the poor water quality considering the lack of natural attenuation processes in the groundwater management options need to be considered for reducing nitrogen input into groundwater keywords nitrate urban groundwater nitrogen 15 oxygen 18 hydrochemistry water pollution 1 introduction groundwater in urban areas has always been an important resource which is frequently endangered by the contamination of overlay cities groundwater protection especially in the semi arid regions where groundwater is the main source of drinking water is fundamental in urban areas the rising demand for groundwater as a potential source for public water supply draws attentions to water management for maintaining a good chemical and ecological status of groundwater considering significant solubility nitrate is potentially the most globally extensive contaminant in groundwater and particularly in urban settings has become a public concern due to the associated health issues wakida and lerner 2005 due to the low groundwater recharge in semi arid areas successful management of no3 affected aquifers requires determining the origin of no3 and understanding the fate of nitrate in groundwater in urban groundwater there are two main nitrate sources 1 direct influx of nitrate from mineral fertilizer and sewage and 2 influx of nitrate from nitrification of ammonium resulting from mineral fertilizers soil organic nitrogen mineralization and sewage as well as the urea hydrolysis in human wastes identifying the sources of the nitrate several approaches were developed including e g physically transport modelling approaches mahar and datta 2000 2001 mattern et al 2009 wagner 1992 statistically based modelling approaches leterme et al 2006 masetti et al 2008 mattern et al 2012 spruill et al 2002 sun 2007 terrado et al 2006 and chemical fingerprinting mattern et al 2011 amongst the last mentioned approach nitrate origin in aquifers and the water it is solved in can be distinguished using different methods a isotopic composition of no3 b water isotopic composition c chemical and isotopic composition of major and trace elements in aquifer d the existence of nitrate co pollutants of particular origins and e aquifer mean age mingzhu et al 2014 here the isotopic ratios of no3 15n 14n and 18o 16o provide a direct means of source identification due to its advantages of employing isotopically distinct compositions of different nitrate sources different sources of no3 e g atmospheric soil fertilizer and sewage typically have distinct nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition additionally biological cycling of nitrate e g denitrification generally changes the ratios of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes distinctively therefore to identify the contamination sources as well as understanding the denitrification processes the study of dual nitrate stable isotopes is an appropriate method although a range of studies have been carried out in america and europe applying an isotopic multiple tracer techniques including dual nitrate stable isotopes n and o böhlke and denver 1995 mattern et al 2011 singleton et al 2007 vystavna et al 2017 widory et al 2005 2004 yang and toor 2016 the gathered information from these studies may not be applicable in the middle eastern cities due to different natural conditions e g hydrogeology climate and geology and cultural situations i e local community policy religion and land use in addition most of the studies were carried out in rural areas in which nitrate has typically been connected to agricultural activities due to the utilization of fertilizers there are only a few studies that are focused on the non agricultural origins of nitrate in cities using stable nitrate isotopes diédhiou et al 2012 fukada et al 2004 jin et al 2004 mingzhu et al 2014 which were mainly conducted in a humid climate of developed cities with strong water management policies and only covered certain areas of the urban aquifer with a limited number of monitoring wells however for semi arid climates it still is unclear on how the interaction of natural conditions infrastructure and water management can affect nitrate concentration in urban aquifers which would also require a unique dense network of monitoring wells to provide a strong resolution for the further executive plans therefore unplanned developments as well as economical deficiencies may cause intense pollution to the groundwater in iran still evidence by source tracking is often missing for raising public awareness and proposing proper water and wastewater management options to give this evidence and support the management options stable isotopes of dissolved nitrate can be employed contamination of nitrate is a serious problem in mashhad groundwater where the who world health organization standard of drinking water of 50 mg l as nitrate 10 mg l no3 n edition 2011 in resource wells is frequently exceeded dolati 2010 studies carried out between 1956 and 2005 showed a generation of diffuse contamination of nitrate through the alluvial deposits of quaternary aquifers of mashhad due to fast urbanization dolati 2010 they have also shown a more alarming contamination increase in certain areas mainly in the old town at the central part of the city predominantly after 1986 due to rapid growth of population the origin and the fate of nitrate in mashhad urban aquifer are not fully understood yet and the potential for natural attenuation through denitrification in the groundwater remains to be investigated denitrification is the most important process to sustainably remove no3 in the aquifer due to the microbial transformation of no3 to n2 gas proving the existence of denitrification may also confirm the validation of tracked natural attenuation for a practical remediation plan the stable n isotope of nitrate has already been widely applied to determine the origin and the nitrate fate in surface and groundwater amiri et al 2015 böhlke and denver 1995 karr et al 2003 kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 moore et al 2006 stable n isotope values 15nno3 are understood in characteristic ranges related to their nitrogen origin for instance losses and conversions of wastewater nitrogen while it moves out of a septic tank down into a groundwater leaves wastewater based no3 enriched in 15n compared to no3 from natural soils aravena et al 1993 kreitler et al 1978 kreitler and browning 1983 inorganic nitrogen departs from septic tanks mainly in the form of ammonium valiela et al 1997 with values of δ15n around 6 mcclelland et al 1997 while nh4 can be lost due to the volatilization of ammonia the residual nh4 is transformed to no3 in the presence of oxygen by autotrophic bacteria if seepage water flows through anoxic zones nitrate can be further transformed due to denitrification valiela et al 1997 ammonia volatilization and denitrification both reduce 14n preferably over 15n consequently the residual no3 from wastewater has a typical δ15n value range between 7 and 25 including animal wastes aravena et al 1993 kendall 1998 kreitler et al 1978 kreitler and browning 1983 the n isotope values for nitrate from mineralization of soil organic matter are smaller typically between 3 and 8 kendall 1998 also mineral fertilizers show a distinct different δ15n value ranging between 7 and 5 in urban settings if the nitrate δ15n value of groundwater range between 7 and 25 and sewage based microbiological tracers are found the source of nitrate might generally be caused by n in sewage barrett et al 1997 1999 however since δ15n values of no3 can be altered via isotopic fractionation due to the chemical physical and microbial procedures including volatilization nitrification as well as denitrification applying δ15n values of no3 alone might not be sufficient for recognition of the source of nitrate in groundwater bodies a number of studies have highlighted that the oxygen isotope of nitrate is a promising technique for identifying nitrate reactions kendall 1998 some confirmed that evaluation of stable 18o isotopes of nitrate is an effective approach for determining denitrification processes in an aquifer cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 2001 panno et al 2001 mayer et al 2001 successfully employed δ18o of nitrate in an investigation of nitrification silva et al 2002 implemented stable o isotope of nitrate in a study of two residential environments and came to the conclusion that isotopic analysis is specially matched to assessments of urban nitrate origins because of the characteristic isotopic signatures of fertilizers and sewage the data analysis of n and o stable isotopes δ15n and δ18o of no3 is a powerful method offering useful information on the source of groundwater nitrate contamination the impact of various origins investigating transport ranges and processes and for assessing the potential of natural attenuation however nitrate dual isotope values might be altered due to isotope fractionation during nitrogen cycle processes which can be also vary temporally and spatially this alteration may cause a deviation in source tracking of nitrate pollution in groundwater and surface water thus dual isotope studies alone cannot always present definitive information regarding origins and processes combining nitrate dual isotopes with co migrating discriminators of no3 sources like carbon c and boron b isotopes as well as the solute tracers in hydrochemistry can enhance the accuracy of the method li et al 2014 by employing the dual isotopes and δ 13c successfully determined that the sewage and manure were the main origins of nitrate in the dry season in the chaobai area boron also has already been used in several studies as a tracer for sewage contamination in groundwater fernandes et al 2019 sacchi et al 2013 verstraeten et al 2005 widory et al 2004 2005 xue et al 2013 by employing δ 15n and δ 18o combined with δ 11b determined that the primary origin of the no3 in the flanders area of belgium were domestic sewage however the aquifers that are predominantly composed of clay minerals may affect the b isotopic composition due to adsorption desorption interactions with the clay minerals xue et al 2009 additionally hydrogeological details and chemical data need to be applied for interpreting isotopic compositions to identify the origins and biogeochemical background of nitrate in aquifer systems isotopic composition of nitrate combined with nitrate concentration can provide a strong explanation for recognizing the nitrate origin mayer et al 2002 pardo et al 2004 stadler et al 2012 associating 15n isotopic values of nitrate with cations and anions concentrations of groundwater also offers useful information for nitrate origin identification since chemical components from anthropogenic origin tend to dominate the ones from natural origin spruill et al 2002 in case of existence of multiple pollution sources there is also the possibility to evaluate the contribution of each no3 source several studies implemented mathematical models like mass balance mixing model moore and semmens 2008 phillips and koch 2002 however this model is not capable of considering the incorporation of several substantial sources of uncertainty including spatial temporal change of δ15n and δ18o of no3 and also the isotopic fractionation during nitrification moore and semmens 2008 therefore the siar stable isotope analysis in r mixing model which uses a bayesian framework has been developed parnell and jackson 2008 this model calculates possible proportional source contribution and subsequently evaluates the probability distribution for the proportional contribution of each source to the mixture xue et al 2009 the model is able to quantify the contribution ratios of multiple more than three pollution sources and also to decrease the above mentioned uncertainties of the mass balance mixing model zhang et al 2018 successfully used the model to evaluate the contribution ratio of 61 69 from domestic sewage and manure in the study area this study implemented a dual isotopic method combined with hydrogeological as well as chemical data to identify origins and processes influencing nitrate in groundwater from the unconfined aquifer in an urban area suffering from severe human activities the area of study chosen is mashhad quaternary aquifer beneath the city of mashhad in the northeast of iran with samples obtained for a two objective designed study isotopic and hydrochemistry analysis a primary aim was to determine the causes for elevating nitrate contamination in the groundwater and its reliance on land use with the intention to notify upcoming management decisions targeted at safeguarding groundwater quality 2 study area given the large population density and occurring of potential nitrogen sources particularly fertilizers and sewage pollution of the aquifer has been detected in many urban areas in iran alighardashi and mehrani 2017 dadgar and payandeh 2017 jalali 2005 mashhad is the second most populous city in iran and the capital of khorasan e razavi province it is located 850 km north east of tehran between 36 15 36 20 northern latitude and 59 30 59 40 eastern longitude the area covers 280 km2 area at the elevation of 985 m above sea level mashhad is in the valley of the kashaf roud river between the two mountain ranges of binaloud and hezar masjid the city is situated close to the borders of turkmenistan and afghanistan fig 1 the population of mashhad is larger than 3 million and it is estimated that over 20 million tourists visit the city each year tandise 2013 the study area is subject to a continental climate originated from interfacing varied air masses consisting of maritime tropical polar continental and sudanian air masses characterized by dry hot summers and generally wet cold winters khalili et al 2016 the average temperature in the area is around 13 5 c by having the minimum recorded temperature as 21 c january and the maximum temperature recorded as 44 c july in the arid and semiarid climate of mashhad the majority of annual precipitation falls between february and march and the average annual precipitation is about 253 mm khalili et al 2016 2 1 geology mashhad is located on thick quaternary deposits which are derived from kashaf roud river alluvial fans descend from the northern slopes koppet dagh structural zones and alluvial fans descend from binaloud mountains in the south and southwest baghvand et al 2016 the city is surrounded by granitic metamorphic as well as ultrabasic outcrops such as schist slate and phyllite in southwestern and southern parts and diverse sedimentary rocks including limestone marl and clastic rocks in northern margins originated from koppet dagh nasseh et al 2016 the sediments under the city are a combination of metamorphic and ultramafic rocks karimi et al 2017 the clay mineral smectite which results from the weathering of mica is the main observed mineral in the alluvial fan and the foothills of the southern part of the city and the clay mineral kaolinite is the predominant mineral in the flat plain of the laid sediments under the city in the southern part of the city also limited gypsum lenses were identified and it may have an impact on the concentration of sulfate in the soil in these parts the intense weathering of the ultrabasic and metamorphic rocks and the active tectonics in southern mashhad heights have contributed to the accumulation of sulfate in the area asghari et al 2018 2 2 topography and hydrogeology the mashhad aquifer is unconfined and composed of alluvial gravel sand sediments belonging to the quaternary period the city and its urban aquifer are laid among the fan shaped area at the foot of the mountains of binaloud in the southern and western borders and kashaf roud river which crosses the northern border of mashhad city the river has flow direction from the northwest to the southeast during wet years by following from the highlands of binaloud mountains to the lowlands of kashaf roud river sw ne which is the thalweg of the mashhad plain the texture gradation of the soil gradually turns from coarse to fine which means gravel sand and silty sand respectively accordingly the potentiometric piezometric gradient of the groundwater ranges from around 1045 m above the sea level in some parts of the west and northwest to 880 m in the east and southeast ehteshami et al 2014 generally groundwater flows according to the piezometric gradient and the plain general slope from northwest to southeast by reaching the southern high elevations groundwater flow is directed to the southeast and northeast asadi et al 2017a 2017b the chemical data of groundwater from the same aquifer but outside the urban zone situated in the vicinity of the northern borders of the city 40 km showed ca hco3 water type nitrate concentration in this water is 10 06 mg l shojaei et al 2013 and the groundwater is isolated from contamination sources related to human activities and transferred to the city as a part of the drinking water resources by the water organization of mashhad thus it could possibly be inferred that natural processes including chemical weathering are the key contributor of chemical constituents of the groundwater from the non urban zone due to little precipitation in recent years and also the excessive density of extraction wells it was predicted that the aquifer drawdown will range between 1 5 5 m in eastern parts to approximately 30 m in the western parts of the city by october 2020 ehteshami et al 2014 and this decline in groundwater level could impact the quantity and quality of drinking water substantially around 220 million cubic meters of water are needed to satisfy the annual domestic demand of the city the daily average of water consumption in mashhad is about 550 000 m3 d and consequently 70 of which turned into wastewater felfelani and kerachian 2016 furthermore it is assumed that almost 75 of the consumed drinking water as an average annual rate returns to groundwater ehteshami et al 2014 groundwater is mainly recharged by municipal return flow and partly by agricultural floods and surface runoff flows from southern mountains and some direct infiltration from precipitations central and southern parts are the main old core of the city and the population density is considerably higher than in the western area which is newly constructed due to the expansion of the city 3 materials and methods samples of groundwater of mashhad city were collected from 261 deep 30 m wells for isotopic and chemical analyses in summer 2015 which coincide with the dry season even by considering the fact that the study area is generally in an arid climate the quality of groundwater related to deeper wells was intentionally investigated during dry season to evaluate long term impacts of the degradation of the quality of water and also to prevent fluctuations in quality of water caused by possible short term recharge through the wet season in mashhad prior to sampling the wells were purged several times to guarantee that samples are representative of the aquifer formation these wells supply the water to the city for drinking purposes most of these traditional drinking water wells were installed long ago and no further information is available on their actual depth and screening length all the collected samples were taken from the same aquifer the sampling locations covering large parts of the city are demonstrated in fig 1 the samples of groundwater were taken with a submersible pump about 3 to 5 m below the groundwater table the samples were filtered by using a 0 45 μm membrane filter and filled into 60 ml pet bottles 261 samples were considered for the main cation and anion analysis and 42 samples for nitrate isotope analysis the samples for cation analysis were preserved by using ultra pure nitric acid the samples for isotope analysis were stored at 0 4 c and transferred to the laboratory shortly after collection nitrate chloride sulfate phosphate calcium and magnesium were analyzed by means of the spectrophotometer hach dr 6000 potassium and sodium analyzed by flame photometry model sherwood 410 and bicarbonate analyzed applying titration technique the values of δ15n and δ18o in no3 were analyzed by applying the anion exchange technique silva et al 2000 the common method to obtain a dual isotope analysis of no3 in water is relying on the nitrate pre concentration on resin anion exchange refinement and conversion into agno3 silver nitrate in thermal conversion elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometry tc ea irms analysis silva et al 2000 values of δ15n are expressed in using delta notation in accordance with isotopic composition of atmospheric nitrogen air by having a 0 05 analytical accuracy and values of δ18o are reported with respect to vienna standard mean oceanic water v smow with a 0 5 uncertainty data processing was performed by ibm spss software v25 and modelling of spatial variability of the groundwater ions concentrations was performed by interpolation of sampling points using the algorithmic method inverse distance weighted idw integrated into arcgis 10 5 software package the groundwater type of study area is also represented using surfer v15 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater geochemistry the samples chemical compositions of groundwater attained from 261 groundwater sampling sites in october 2015 and the results are summarized in fig 2 southern and central parts of the city had increased nitrate chloride sulfate and phosphate concentrations in groundwater while the western area of the study area had a much lower concentration of no3 cl so4 2 and po4 3 in groundwater fig 2 generally mashhad groundwater has high no3 so4 2 cl po4 3 mg2 and ca2 concentrations specifically the southern and central parts of the city the nitrate content was larger than the threshold value for anthropogenic impact 3 mg l no3 n 13 mg l no3 in 97 of the sampling sites and exceeded the drinking water standard 50 mg l no3 10 mg l no3 n babiker et al 2004 in 42 of the wells with a maximum value of 166 1 mg l no3 concentrations of cl ranged from 13 5 to 653 7 mg l with an average of 192 44 mg l the study also detected excessive levels of sulfate with a maximum of 1909 8 mg l an average of 318 43 mg l phosphate with a maximum of 2 8 mg l an average of 0 9 mg l calcium with a maximum of 606 4 mg l an average of 136 2 mg l magnesium with a maximum of 196 2 mg l an average of 41 6 mg l also the maximum and average of sodium are 299 1 mg l and 89 3 mg l respectively in addition the potassium level was ranged between 0 7 and 8 2 mg l concentrations of anions cl so4 2 and po4 3 and no3 confirmed strong correlations specifying that they have arisen from the same origins fig 3 i e on manure and or sewage e g human wastes particularly urea detergents and industrial products strong correlations also obtained from no3 and cations mg2 and ca2 plots fig 3 accordingly no3 so4 2 cl po4 3 mg2 and ca2 are released in the system by anthropogenic sources however that possibly a part of the mg2 ca2 and so4 2 originates from mineral dissolution ion exchange and water rock interaction the major groundwater ions are displayed on a trilinear diagram fig 4 the groundwater in the aquifer is identified as diverse chemical types on the piper diagram piper 1944 the groundwater chemical types mostly change through flow direction nw se the samples of groundwater from the new residential districts in the western part of the city predominantly plot in the area of the ca mg hco3 water type by following the direction of groundwater flow from the western to the central and southern parts of the city groundwater mainly changes to ca mg cl no3 so4 and ca mg no3 so4 types respectively the scatter of points on the diagram and the change of water chemistry along the groundwater flow paths within the urban area suggest a distinct anthropogenic impact on groundwater chemical composition which can also be complemented by natural processes ca2 and na in groundwater may be resulting from the incongruent dissolution of plagioclase in granite saether and de caritat 1996 ca2 typically originates from carbonate minerals particularly calcite and dolomite which normally appear in veins and as secondary minerals in granite and also from the gypsum layers ca2 might even be derived from the dissolution of concrete in sidewalks and streets ca2 and na additionally originate from domestic effluents in urban areas the main origin of mg2 is from magnesium chloride and biotite of granite which can be a common mineral in shear and gneiss zone k originates from orthoclase and muscovite of granite anions including cl so4 2 as well as no3 are main inorganic components degrading the groundwater quality as drinking water given that saline water and cl minerals typically are not observed on a significant scale in the area excessive cl groundwater content appears to result from sources of pollution cl might be based on the pollution sources including domestic effluents septic tanks fertilizers and by natural sources including the dissolution of fluid inclusions and rainfall ritzi et al 1993 so4 2 sources can consist of detergents and industrial products precipitation fertilizers and as well sulfide dissolution in granite since gypsum was identified in the southern parts of the city asghari et al 2018 the so4 dense water besides the anthropogenic impacts seems to be partially influenced by the sulfide mineral dissolution in this part of the aquifer in the central and southern parts the groundwater of ca mg cl no3 so4 type is affected by anthropogenic inputs while the groundwater of ca hco3 type could be considered as moderately clean groundwater besides the groundwater resources which were generally not affected by urbanization located outside of the urban zone of the study area confirmed the water types of ca hco3 shojaei et al 2013 4 2 sources of nitrate using nitrate isotopes the isotopic composition of nitrate δ15n and δ18o in groundwater was measured to identify the source nitrate and potential transformation processes groundwater sampling locations for isotope analysis were chosen particularly in nitrate contaminated areas with concentrations ranging from 49 to 166 1 mg l n 42 the locations and the results are shown in figs 5 and 6 and table 1 the δ18ono3 was not regionalized due to the little isotopic variation of oxygen in nitrate across the study area the common limits of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 for the main origins of no3 which might impact groundwater are also presented in fig 6 kendall 1998 the measured values of δ15n of no3 in groundwater ranged between 7 97 and 17 06 with an average value of 12 75 n 42 a value which is characteristic of nitrate sources from sewage and human waste 7 and 25 kendall 1998 table 1 the conclusion that the increased values of no3 are originated from sewage and human waste agrees with the population density in the contaminated areas grouping land covers land uses reveal that central and southern parts of the study area with higher population density have the maximum value of no3 concentration 166 1 mg l with the highest δ15n value 17 06 in contrast western areas show the minimum value of obtained values with smaller variable no3 contents 8 mg l and the lowest δ15n value 7 97 fig 7 the outcomes are in line with findings of previous studies asadi et al 2017a 2017b based on the nitrate data from 26 wells in 2001 asadi et al 2017a presented a vulnerability assessment of mashhad groundwater to nitrate using drastic method the results demonstrated that the central and southern districts had the highest vulnerability to pollution while the western and northwestern districts had the lowest vulnerability they also concluded that land use was the most significant parameter for vulnerability assessment using a modified drastic model and fuzzy set theory asadi et al 2017b which is now confirmed by the nitrate isotope methods in the present study the nitrate in groundwater in the unconfined aquifer of mashhad is the result of urea hydrolysis in human sewage waste through the process of nitrification of nh4 the signature of stable n isotope associated with human urea mainly range between 5 and 8 o connell et al 2001 and is higher for human faeces 11 8 choi et al 2003 the value of δ15n increases due to the hydrolysis of urea the total unidirectional reaction leads to a partial loss of ammonia volatilization depleted in 15n relative to ammonium in solution heaton 1986 kendall 1998 the residual 15n enriched ammonium is then nitrified to 15n enriched nitrate previously reported stable n isotope of no3 in aquifer influenced by human waste and sewage 7 3 and 16 9 aravena et al 1993 fogg et al 1998 hiscock et al 1997 kreitler and jones 1975 rivers et al 1996 silva et al 2002 is in accordance with values for the mashhad groundwater in this study ranging between 7 97 and 17 06 isotopic values of dissolved no3 in groundwater δ15nno3 vs δ18ono3 are plotted in fig 6 if denitrification was important the values of n and o isotopes of dissolved nitrate must have a distinct positive trend in approximately a 2 1 isotopic ratio böttcher et al 1990 due to the absence of a sizeable o isotopic variation in groundwater no3 samples throughout the study area and the absence of any clear trend on the linear relationship on the present plat fig 6 the δ18o data provided the proof that in study area basically no considerable denitrification was occurring combination of concentration and isotopic composition of no3 provide meaningful information in the case of a single no3 concentration source and when no fractionation process occurs xue et al 2009 therefore δ15nno3 values and no3 concentration are plotted in fig 8 and positively correlated a strong positive relationship like this happens when denitrification is negligible and groundwater quality is affected largely by a single sewage source of contamination choi et al 2003 therefore fig 8 confirms the interpretation that contamination of groundwater of mashhad is derived from sewage and human waste sources the findings of sewage human waste as the main source for nitrate in groundwater is also in agreement with elevated concentration of cl so4 2 and po4 3 since concerning the geological situation of the study area these ions seem to have the anthropogenic origin e g domestic effluents septic tanks detergents etc compared to other studies in urban areas fukada et al 2004 jin et al 2004 and despite differences in geological and climatic situation and also in sewage collection systems the signatures of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate in the present study are relatively similar which show the same sewage derived sources for nitrate in all studies differences mainly can be attributed to the absence or existence of denitrification as a potential natural remediation process in different places in addition the sampling wells in this study area are mainly old traditional water wells even though sampling depth was similar for all wells 3 to 5 m below the groundwater table the actual representative depth of sampling is unknown and hence stratification of sampling cannot be excluded still nitrate isotopes indicated that denitrification is not a considerable process for the parts of the groundwater which samples were taken from nevertheless if in further downstream or deeper parts of the aquifer anaerobic processes are of importance remains unknown in this case results of isotopic composition with support of chemical analysis show that the traditional way of wastewater disposal beneath private homes is still in use particularly in the central and southern parts of the city as well as a number of other large cities in iran a high nitrogen discharge from domestic cesspools to the groundwater of tehran was also shown by joekar niasar and ataie ashtiani 2009 this old method of wastewater disposal had been designed as deep underground absorption wells as a septic system to transmit houses wastewater to the soil for the purpose of benefiting from natural remediation via denitrification these absorption wells may be the primary issue for the leaching of wastewater and sewage into the groundwater in central and southern parts while newly supplying the western part of the city with a sewage collection system resulted in minimizing the influence of anthropogenic impacts in this part additionally lack of denitrification is strong evidence on the insufficiency of this traditional disposal system in the investigated parts of the aquifer 5 conclusion this study applied a dual isotope methodology complemented by hydrogeological and chemical data for identifying sources and processes influencing nitrate concentrations in groundwater the stable n isotope data of no3 indicated sewage and human waste as the predominant nitrate contamination sources in groundwater which was confirmed by the geochemical composition with elevated chloride sulfate and phosphorous concentrations being markers of wastewater and exceeding natural threshold concentrations particularly in the central and southern regions of the urban area with an incomplete sewer collection system the direct injection of sewage through septic systems resulted in the contamination of the aquifer negligible denitrification was found emphasizing the vulnerability of the aquifer the outcomes of the study indicate that extensive nitrate contamination of the mashhad groundwater will remain to grow unless management practices are significantly improved this includes reducing the levels of residual nitrate in groundwater and particularly improve the sanitation system in areas with the absence of a reliable sewer collecting system i e in the central and southern parts of the study area even with improved management strategies it must be considered that high nitrate concentrations will remain in the aquifer for some time due to the absence of denitrification additionally time lags between any measures taken for improving the groundwater quality and the actual confirmation of improvement need to be kept in mind declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

construction contribute a lot to regional sediment load reduction wang et al 2016 yang et al 2011 in the last half a century generally runoff in the north part of china the yellow river basin showed a significant downward trend while there was minimal change of runoff in the southern part the yangtze river though it decreased significantly in the upper reaches of yangtze river basin uyrb wang et al 2013c d however for the yangtze river it is reported that the sediment flux at datong the most seaward gauging station reduced by 187 mt yr in 1993 2002 and a further 145 mt yr in 2003 2012 in comparison with 1950 1968 yang et al 2015 by and large intensified anthropogenic influences in recent decades are playing increasingly important roles in explaining the change of the water and sediment flux into the ocean from the major rivers in china especially for sediment load wang et al 2013a b c d li et al 2018a b with a length of 4300 km and altitude range of 400 to 5100 m a s l the upper reach of the yangtze river basin uyrb the region in the yrb above yichang suffers from serious soil erosion with an annual average surface erosion 1 57 billion t and high annual suspended sediment load 0 43 billion t yr where complex climate changes and intensive human activities are taking place and is now becoming a worldwide concern wei et al 2014 the jinsha river basin jrb is the mainstream of the yangtze river above yibin which is one of the main sediment sources of uyrb contributing nearly 60 and likewise for three gorges reservoir and nearly 90 of the sediment load is generated in the middle and lower reaches especially the lower reach ljrb however there is limited amount of research specializing in the jrb compared with that on the yrb though some studies have been conducted in different aspects wang et al 2013b investigated the variation of annual and seasonal precipitation in the jrb based on data from 30 meteorological stations 1961 2008 and found that 80 of the stations exhibited increasing trends for annual precipitation and this figure went up to 90 in the precipitation in spring while this trend was more significant in the yalong river than the main stream of jinsha river the largest decrease in precipitation occurred in the wet area whilst the largest increase magnitude occurred in the relatively dry area in this study the jrb was divided into 7 sub sections on the basis of hydrologic stations which is considered to be of physical rationality wei et al 2011 studied the anthropogenic impacts on the suspended sediment load in the uyrb including the jrb through a new proxy indicator introduced to reflect human activities sediment load rainfall erosivity s r important national activities e g the great leap forward the cultural revolution soil conservation in the past few decades are interestingly attached to the visible change in the pattern of s r vs time the effects of soil conservation dams reservoirs construction and land use changes were discussed separately and quantitatively but the relative contribution of different factors were not identified the relationship between total storage capacity of reservoirs and sediment load needs to be directly plotted otherwise it will confound the effect of other sediment reduction factors e g water soil conservation during the same period quite a number of large hydropower stations with dams and reservoirs have been constructed in cascade in the jrb since the first one ertan was built in 1998 and the sediment load in response to which in the background of climate change has been studied by li et al 2018a b human activities deforestation and mineral extraction in the 20th century and damming in the 21st century are governing factors of sediment change while the variation of water discharge are mainly ascribed to climate change it was calculated that in 2011 2015 operation of cascade reservoirs in the middle jrb mjrb reduced 75 9 of the sediment load at panzhihua and the construction of the xiluodu and xiangjiaba dams together with the cascade reservoirs in mjrb decreased the sediment load at xiangjiaba by 83 3 2011 2015 nevertheless in spite of their efforts to make improvements in quantitative understanding the study failed to distinguish the contribution of cascade reservoirs from other human activities that occurred concurrently in the decrease of sediment load solely based on regression analysis of the double mass curve as was done in most previous studies dai et al 2008 to summarize though important information can be accessed from existing research on various aspects related to the change of hydrological variables it is also true that a comprehensive study to identify the contribution of different drivers influencing runoff and sediment load in the jrb has hitherto not been conducted moreover growing concerns from interested residents as well as government that takes the responsibility for decision making require us to clarify the response of natural resources as the result of climate change and intensified human activities especially the cascade reservoirs in mljrb with a total capacity more than two times of the three gorges reservoir which forms the main force of china s west east electricity transmission project the present study mainly targets at mljrb in order to avoid the different climatic characteristics in the upper reach and also to be more consistent with human activities as discussed in section 2 the result of trend analysis as well as abrupt change analysis of annual variables precipitation runoff and sediment load is presented first together with inner year characterization seasonally and monthly then we shed light on the quantitative influence of several main driving factors that have been concerned of in previous studies both climatic and anthropogenic perspectives a summary of the calculation results is given in the end with additional remarks on the methodology applied the result helps to gain a quantitative sense of human nature interaction for readers and can also be used as a reference for regional policy in terms of natural resources rehabilitation and control as well especially for the downstream part of pingshan extending to the three gorges reservoir 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the jinsha river basin jrb is the upper reach of the yangtze river basin uyrb above the pingshan hydrology station with a length of 3481 km and a drainage area of 47 32 104 km2 which are about 55 3 and 26 compared with the whole yrb respectively additionally the average annual runoff of jrb about 1450 108 m3 makes up 36 5 of the inflow of the three gorges reservoir tgr the jinsha river originates from the tibetan plateau marches southeast along the hengduan mountains and turns south to meet the yunnan guizhou plateau and then winds its way to the east between its source and pingshan station two locations shigu and panzhihua where its largest tributary the yalong river merges mark the demarcation of the upstream midstream and downstream of the jinsha river the valley is usually narrow with a v shaped cross section morphology and the elevation drops steeply over 3000 m in the main stream this results in an abundance of hydropower resources and therefore the frequent construction of hydropower engineering projects in the last two decades while the jrb plays a significant role in the yrb the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river basin mljrb located between 24 30 34 n and 97 105 e share different characteristics from those of the upper reach ujrb the climate is generally stratified because of the change of elevation specifically it tends to have a plateau climate in the upstream basin while a subtropical climate is dominant in the middle and lower reaches where the elevation is approximately between 1000 m and 3000 m the average annual runoff at pingshan station is more than three times that of shigu station in accordance with the fact that the annual precipitation of mljrb 807 mm is significantly higher than the upper reach 464 mm signifying that most of the water resources are generated in the mljrb sediment flux even highlights the dominance of mljrb to a larger extent for nearly 90 of the total sediment load gauged at pingshan is generated in this area with the background that jrb contributes more than 50 of the total sediment load to tgr wang et al 2014 gravitational erosion in the ljrb especially water erosion such as debris flow in small watersheds accounts for the major contribution to the sediment load generation besides most anthropogenic activities including water project construction land exploitation as well as water soil conservation are frequently implemented in the mljrb and thus is the focus of our study 2 2 data source and data process the daily data of precipitation and temperature used in this study is downloaded from the website of the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn and processed by surface average method in the jrb 22 meteorological stations are available fig 1 with 16 of them in mljrb all of these stations have continuous data series in the period of 1960 2015 the information of runoff and suspended sediment load comes from the hydrological office of the yangtze water resources committee the 7 concerned stations zhimenda station shigu station panzhihua station huatan station and pingshan station are on the mainstream of the jinsha river while xiaodeshi station and wantan station are on the yalong river do not have the same availability of data details are list in the table 1 there is lack of records in 1969 1970 for shigu station and the annual values of these two years have been reconstructed by linear regression method with the data measured at panzhihua station additionally pingshan station moved downstream for 2 km because of the construction of xiangjiaba hydropower station in 2012 the data after 2012 were collected at the new station but we still call it pingshan station for convenience the runoff data in 2015 of huatan station were substituted by the baihetan hydropower station which is 37 4 km downstream of huatan station we likewise keep the consistency in that the same name huatan station is still used for reference to the change of vegetation coverage the satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is adopted and analyzed the gimms ndvi 3 g dataset developed by the nasa global inventory modeling and mapping studies group was used in this study which has 15 day temporal resolution and 8 km spatial resolution qu et al 2018 the data cover a range from 1982 to 2012 with 15 day temporal resolution and 8 km spatial resolution we calculated a monthly ndvi by using maximum value composite mvc of the fortnightly dataset in order to minimize the effects of cloud contamination and atmospheric variability qu et al 2018 the weighted average is then calculated based on the average monthly precipitation to get the annual ndvi 3 methodology 3 1 characterization of hydrologic variation 3 1 1 trend analysis the mann kendall m k test kendall 1975 mann 1945 which is a rank based and nonparametric method commonly used in hydrological trend detection is adopted in this study before the application of m k test it is recommended to ensure that the influence of serial correlation of the time series is eliminated hence a pre whitening pw process is suggested khaliq et al 2009 however yue et al and fleming et al fleming and clarke 2002 yue et al 2003 found that pw may affect the magnitude of the real trend and they further proposed a trend free pre whitening tfpw approach to overcome this problem as was adopted in our study then we apply m k test to the pre whitened series and obtain the trend as well as its significance the parameter β can indicate whether the trend if significant of a given series x1 x2 xn is increasing or decreasing depending on whether it is positive or negative as well as the magnitude of the trend 1 β m e d i a n x i x j i j j i 3 1 2 abrupt change analysis sequential cluster analysis wang et al 2013a is used here to estimate the transition point of a given time series basically it is an optimal method to find the critical year that separates a time series into consecutive non overlapping epochs whose sums of squared deviations ssd are of different levels consider a time series x for a potential critical point xt the ssd before and after t is 2 v τ i 1 τ x i x τ 2 v n τ i τ 1 n x i x n τ 2 where 3 x τ 1 τ i 1 τ x i x n τ 1 n τ i τ 1 n x i then the total ssd is 4 s n τ v τ v n τ and t is considered to be abrupt point if s n τ s n where 5 s n min 1 r n 1 s n τ the significance of the obtained abrupt change point can be evaluated by rank sum test 3 1 3 inner year distribution important features of hydrological variables may be concealed if attention is only paid to annual values though a daily dataset is not available in most cases in our research it is still worth looking into the monthly distribution of precipitation runoff as well as sediment load two parameters are adopted here to describe the distribution characteristics of a series of variable ai i 1 2 12 in a certain year concentration coefficient c d and concentration period d0 6 c d a x 2 a y 2 i 1 12 a i 7 d 0 arctan a y a x where 8 a x i 1 12 a i cos θ i a y i 1 12 a i sin θ i the above procedure means that the variables are treated like vectors specifically the direction of the variables from january to december is defined to correspond to 15 to 345 the interval between any two months within a year is 30 while the magnitude of the vectors is the original value the dimensionless parameter d0 is then transformed into the value of month d in this way we can obtain a compounded result which illustrates the time of a variable concentrates and the degree of the concentration 3 2 quantifying the impact of a certain factor 3 2 1 a general approach a given time series of a hydrological variable is separated into 2 epochs according to the abrupt change analysis the previous period t1 also the reference period and the current period t2 also the objective period respectively for a hydrological variable z which is influenced by x and other factors lumped into y assuming x and y are independent and influence z in a product form z f x g y the quantification of its change over the two epochs is as follows 9 δ z f x 0 δ x g y 0 δ y f x 0 g y 0 f 0 δ f g 0 δ g f 0 g 0 δ f g 0 δ g f 0 δ f δ g where δ z is the variation of z over the two epochs and subscript 0 means denotes the value in the reference epoch t1 usually the value of δ f δ g is considered to be small and thus neglected wang et al 2013c d ding et al 2013 related discussion is given in section 6 therefore the variation of z is separated into x induced change δ z x and y induced change δ z y 10 δ z δ z x δ z y z t 2 z t z t z t 1 where z t 1 z t 2 are observed values in the two epochs z t is the theoretical value of z in t2 it can be calculated based on the relationship between z and x in the reference epoch t1 further discussion is given in section 6 then the relative contribution of factor x α x and other factors α y can be obtained as 11 α x δ z x δ z 100 12 α y 1 α x last but not least to empirically describe the quantitative relationship between hydrological variables the double mass curve method gao et al 2013 lu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 is widely used as well as direct regression analysis yang et al 2015 which is adopted in this study 3 2 2 evaluation on the influence of reservoirs notwithstanding above method works well in separation of climatic and anthropogenic factors it fails to provide further details for example the contribution of the sub factors of the anthropogenic part the major contribution of which comes from the construction and operation of reservoirs a method based on empirical relations is adopted in our study the whole picture will be presented in section 5 3 only the technical part of calculation is gone through here to grossly estimate the increased evaporation caused by emergent reservoirs we first reckon the increased reservoirs inundated area via the empirical relation calibrated from the large reservoirs in the mljrb 13 s 37 59 ln v 0 88 49 81 r 0 998 where v 108 m3 is reservoir capacity and s km2 is inundated area the increased evaporation thus equals the sum of the annually increased area times the annual water surface evaporation the distributed water surface evaporation data are not available and we take the average value between the ones at shigu station and pingshan station to quantitatively evaluate the influence of reservoirs on sediment load annually the widely used empirical equation proposed by brune brune 1953 and further improvement vörösmarty et al 2003 garg and jothiprakash 2010 is applied previously the trapping efficiency of the cascade reservoirs in a basin is counted by the sum of operation volume 14 δ τ j i 1 n j v i q j 15 t e j 1 0 05 δ τ j where vi is the operational volume of reservoir i and qj is the average annual water discharge at the mouth of basin j nj denotes the number of reservoirs considered in basin j δ τ j is residence time of the basin and t e j is approximated trapping efficiency then the trapping efficiency of several basins in parallel connection tesum that contains m sub basins can be calculated by a weighting average with respect to annual discharge 16 t e s u m j 1 m t e j q j q 0 where m is the number of sub basins and q0 is the average discharge at the regulating station of the whole basin however the above procedure may encounter discrepancy when calculating the combined trapping efficiency of cascade reservoirs that are built successively due to neglecting the fact that each individual reservoir works independently rather than have the same effect as an assumed reservoir with a capacity of the summation of all in this sub basin it is neither suggested to use parameters weighted by drainage area of a reservoir as yang et al did for the whole yrb in yang and lu 2014 since a particular section in a basin may have a different strength of sediment yield that considerably influences the entire region studied to achieve a better accuracy we directly calculate the sediment trapped by each reservoir progressively in each section so that the te of each reservoir relative to the located section is weighted by actual entrapped sediment load therefore for each section the total trapping effect is 17 t e c a s c a d e i 1 n t e i s p i s m where n is the number of reservoirs in the section s m is the sediment load that is available to the section while the sediment load available to the ith reservoir s p i can be expressed as 18 s p i s i t e i 1 s p i 1 in the above equation si denotes the annual mean sediment load at the ith reservoir since no mean annual sediment data at each reservoir are available we conducted interpolation between two hydrologic stations astride a section based on the documented mean annual runoff at each reservoir with the assumption also is shown in this study that the sediment load is significantly correlated with runoff the specific calculation as well as an example is presented in section 5 3 4 the changing hydrological variables in jrb 4 1 characteristics of annual variation in this section the changing pattern of annual temperature precipitation runoff and sediment load are introduced fig 2 and analyzed both m k trend analysis and sequential cluster abrupt change analysis are conducted with regard to the datasets of the mentioned hydrological variables in the time range of 1960 2015 with the outcomes presented in table 2 and table 3 the conditions of ujrb as well as the whole jrb are also given for comparison but special attention is paid to mljrb the runoff and sediment load of mljrb are calculated following the concept of sectional values the difference between downstream station pingshan and upstream station shigu which can be considered as the net flux through a control volume the temperature in both ujrb and mljrb continuously increased during the 56 years considered with a very high significance level more than 99 as did the whole jrb the slopes obtained in m k test manifest the increasing rate which were 0 033 yr and 0 015 0 033 yr respectively it is notable that the highest temperatures in both areas can be observed in 2015 with the lowest temperature occurring 40 years ago significant abrupt changes are detected and presented in table 3 no significant trends are detected in terms of the precipitation and runoff however the result of change point analysis indicates different levels exist in the time series of both variables generally the precipitation and runoff in the mljrb show obvious transition points 2003 and 2006 respectively corresponding to the fact reflected by the trend analysis that a slight decrease of both variables is observed as for the suspended sediment load the most prominent change occurred in mljrb where a dramatic plunge of sectional sediment load can be seen and it is necessary to note that 2013 marked the year in which the sectional sediment load plunged below zero meaning the input of sediment load on the mljrb was even more than the output put another way there was net impoundment of sediment since the amount of sediment from ujrb contributes little to the whole jrb in spite of the weak increase with a rate of 18 104 t yr in the ujrb the latter value still decreased greatly the year 2002 is determined as the abrupt change point for both jrb and mljrb as an example of abrupt change analysis fig 3 shows the change of sn of the mljrb s runoff and sediment load during 1960 2015 the lowest points for the two series are 2006 and 2002 respectively marking the change points choosing the critical years to be the demarcation of two epochs the variation of runoff and sediment load in the mljrb is extracted and presented in fig 4 from an average perspective the regional runoff in the second stage 2006 2015 decreased 14 7 compared with the first stage 1960 2005 from 1029 1 to 877 8 108 m3 yr while the sediment load decreased up to 62 9 from 230 7 to 85 6 mt yr and it even maintained negative values in the last three years of the investigated period underlying that an overwhelming influence rather than an occasional incident was exerted on the local sediment discharge 4 2 change of inner year distribution the inner year distribution of precipitation runoff and sediment load are studied on a monthly and seasonally basis spring is defined as february march and april summer is defined as may june and july autumn is defined as august september and october winter is the last two months of the year and january of the next year the average distribution as well as the trend of change during 1960 2015 is summarized in table 4 among all three aspects summer and autumn contributed most of the total annual amount especially the sediment load in the two seasons accounted for about 97 of the yearly value on average while it turned out to be relatively more uniform in terms of runoff just below 80 there is no significant trend shown in the seasonal precipitation though nominal increasing trends in spring and winter and decreasing trends in summer and autumn can be presented by the slope β as for runoff only the spring value apparently changed an increase of 6 47 m³ s per year the other three seasons showing nominal decreasing trends the sediment load is detected to have significant decreasing trend in summer and autumn in accord with yearly sediment load while an increasing trend is observed in spring though it had little contribution to the yearly value as the trend analysis may not reveal all the facts of quantity change a simple comparison of the average values is made between the two time periods 1960 2000 and 2001 2015 though seasonal precipitation is observed to go through a slight reduction within 5 in the four seasons change of runoff was not very consistent in spring with around 50 s increase in contrast to summer and autumn that runoff decreased slightly more than 10 a further investigation on the monthly distribution of precipitation and runoff is carried out in which the concentration coefficient c d and concentration period d are calculated for the period of 1960 2015 fig 5 it can be seen that for concentrated month both runoff and precipitation stayed at a roughly stable level with a little oscillations but an evident decrease of concentration coefficient of runoff is notable especially in the recent two decades and the three lowest values throughout the studied period occurred in the last decades 2006 2011 2015 respectively corresponding to the period that large dams and reservoirs were intensely built and operated above results attest to the fact that runoff is considerably affected by human activities in the recent two decades as a result of reservoirs operation the inner year distribution of runoff tends to become more uniform than natural scenarios because the water discharge from a reservoir in the wet season is supposed to be limited while a certain value would be maintained in dry season the impact of reservoirs on runoff and sediment load in terms of annual values are further discussed in section 5 3 5 contribution of driving factors 5 1 precipitation the runoff response to precipitation is evidently observed in previous studies both annually yang et al 2015 and monthly piao et al 2010 in the yrb precipitation is the main explanatory variable for the water discharge and then it can further influence the sediment flux chen et al 2014 one the other hand hydraulic erosion is considered to be the main driver of the sediment yield yang et al 2004 2005 xu 2009 jiang et al 2015a b which can be directly induced by the local rainfall linear regression analysis using the data from a less perturbed period 1960 1997 is thus carried out table 5 and it shows that in the jrb sediment load is more dependent on the water discharge compared to precipitation or precipitation intensity sum of daily precipitation larger than 20 mm the outcome of regression analysis may not imply that precipitation is less correlated to sediment load in a physical sense because the limitation of the number of data acquisition points meteorological stations hides the local hydrological features and conceals the real physical process nonetheless it is still feasible to adopt the perspective of runoff sediment relation in the current stage both p r relation linear regression curve and r s relation power curve following the form of the sediment rating curve show obvious correlations and double mass curves demonstrate their physical correspondence as well as abrupt change points fig 6 and fig 7 the non existence of a visible abrupt change point in the p r double mass curve and the transition point 2002 in the r s double mass curve are in good accordance with abrupt change analysis of the runoff coefficient and suspended sediment concentration to quantify the influence of precipitation on runoff and sediment load the methodology proposed in section 3 4 is applied based on division of epochs using the relationship obtained from the aforementioned curve fittings annual runoff during 2006 2015 on average was theoretically 944 108 m3 while the observed value was 877 8 108 m3 151 2 108 m3 less than in the previous epoch so the change of precipitation caused a 56 3 of the decrease in runoff and other drivers accounting for the rest 43 8 for sediment load the variation of precipitation decrease only contributed 19 1 of the total decrease in 2002 2015 implying other driving factors which are more pivotal and need to be identified lead to 80 9 and 117 4 mt s reduction the above result is shown in table 6 in detail additionally an apparent further decrease of sectional sediment load occurred since 2013 and the average annual sediment load dropped to 21 mt despite the precipitation in these three years are roughly the same in the previous epoch this is mainly due to the effect of reservoirs as discussed in later sections 5 2 temperature an obvious upward trend both in the mljrb and the ujrb can be observed in the recent 60 years with an increase of ca 0 5 in the mljrb and 1 2 in ujrb comparisons made between 2001 2015 and 1960 2000 however no significant relation between temperature and runoff or precipitation can be found as an important thermal index temperature influences glacial melting as well as evapotranspiration et piao et al 2010 it can also change the characteristics of local rainfall and change the frequency of extreme events floods and droughts additionally increasing precipitation leads to increasing cloud coverage and hence the ground surface temperature decreases zhang et al 2008 as for sediment load it is influenced by temperature not only indirectly through changing runoff but also through the direct effect of temperature change on rock weathering anderson 2005 considering the complex mechanism between temperature and the hydrologic factors it is hard to clarify whether the increasing trend has a positive or negative contribution to the change of runoff sediment load and existing studies give inconclusive answers with respect to different watersheds arnell and reynard 1996 risbey and entekhabi 1996 tao et al 2011 tang et al 2012 in the mljrb both the positive impact caused by snow glacier melting and the negative impact caused by evapotranspiration need to be considered since the tributary the yalong river also originates from the headwaters of the yangtze river it is adopted in yang et al 2015 that the rate of melting in the headwaters of the yangtze river was 0 07 km3 yr before 2000 and became 0 99 km3 yr after 2000 assuming the increase of the melting rate was kept to be 0 9 km3 yr in 2006 2015 compared with t1 and 30 of it fed into the yalong river the increase in annual runoff in the mljrb is calculated to be 2 7 108 m3 which is small compared to the total runoff variation on the other hand the area of increase and decrease of et in different regions of mljrb roughly balance with each other bo et al 2011 moreover since there may be potential effects of temperature on precipitation and landform change that finally alter the output of water and sediment resources further research is required to disentangle the temperature induced et change from human activities as a whole at this initial stage of approximation we consider the direct impact of temperature on runoff or sediment flux in mljrb as less important compared to other factors while its iterative influences that combined with other factors can still be accounted 5 3 construction of reservoirs many hydropower stations with large reservoirs have been constructed or are under construction since the end of last century in the jrb in order to make good use of hydropower resources for electricity generation to feed the demand locally or in the eastern part of china information on the reservoirs with total capacity larger than 1 108 m3 constructed and impounded before the end of 2015 is listed in table 7 after the impoundment of ertan reservoir in 1997 most reservoirs hydropower stations e g gyy xld xjb etc started intensive operations during 2011 2015 the total capacity of these reservoirs added up to ca 230 108 m3 60 of three gorges reservoir apart from middle and uncounted small size reservoirs and they indeed caused evident influence to the amount of water discharge and sediment load in the mljrb the runoff across the mljrb is mainly influenced by these reservoirs through impoundment and increased evaporation from the water surface since these reservoirs are annually regulated and a relatively stable storage after start of normal operation is considered no extra water from upstream is further impounded based on statistics reported by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources changjiang water resources commision of the ministry of water resources 2019 the total water impoundment of middle and large size reservoirs in mljrb in 2005 was ca 80 108 m3 and this figure rose to ca 330 108 m3 by the end of 2015 therefore water impoundment caused a total runoff reduction of 250 108 m3 annually 25 108 m3 yr during 2006 2015 as for evaporation from the water surface since the information of impoundment progress for each reservoir is not available we assume the reservoirs increase their storage linearly from the year when a reservoir begins operation to the year it completes impoundment and then calculate the increased evaporation as introduced in section 3 2 2 the evaporation caused by existing reservoirs the total capacity is ca 80 108 m3 by the end of t1 is also counted in the increased loss due to the fact that these reservoirs were newly built with regard to the epochs t1 and contribute little to the overall change of evaporation in t1 finally the total increased evaporation from 2006 to 2015 is calculated to be 30 98 108 m3 and annually 3 1 108 m3 on average to sum up water reduction caused by the construction of water projects was 28 1 108 m3 yr which took up to 18 5 of the total reduction further in terms of monthly distribution it is shown that reservoir control water release and impoundment can obviously alter the water level as well as the runoff yang et al 2010 impoundment of the reservoirs can significantly influence the sediment flux as the dominant factor causing its reduction as total capacity in operation ascended so does water loss by evaporation the sectional sediment load dropped dramatically and finally had a negative value fig 4 referring to the method in section 3 2 2 three sections are considered in our study shigu panzhihua is section a the yalong river basin above xiaodeshi is section b and the remaining part of the mljrb to pingshan is section c therefore for section a and b the value s m is the annual mean sediment load at panzhihua and xiaodeshi respectively while for section c this value is the mean annual sediment load of pingshan subtracted by the amount entrapped by section a and b a schematic model with sectional trapping effect of reservoirs by the end of 2015 is shown in fig 8 by the end of 2015 the three sections a b c in fig 8 were able to trap sediment load of about 40 30 and 150 mt yr respectively based on historical mean values of runoff and sediment load the outcomes based on the sediment load of current years are presented in table 8 a striking effect of sediment deposition can be obtained with intensive increase especially since 2011 when the sediment load at panzhihua started to be less than shigu since 2013 the sediment load at pingshan started to be less than that at shigu or panzhihua which reveals the sum of sediment deposition and sediment reduction by other factors outweighed the total sediment sources in the mljrb the total te ballooned up to nearly 90 and is predicted to be even up to 93 1 after the construction of wudongde and baihetan another two huge projects in the downstream jrb which means that less than millesimal of the sediment load upstream of pingshan can be discharged downstream overall the construction and operation of large reservoirs in the mljrb contributed 44 9 65 1 mt yr of the sediment load reduction in 2002 2015 very little information about the measured sediment deposition in the jrb is known pieces of which can be found in zhu et al 2016 which are also cited in li et al 2018a b the measured sediment deposition in the four reservoirs in mjrb from ah to ldl in 2014 was 28 2 mt corresponding to a te of 69 9 while xld and xjb trapped 66 mt in the same year corresponding to a te of 96 8 comparing with the measurement the calculated result of section a 67 8 is quite closed while that of section c 82 7 is much smaller this may be because the actual volume of xld that was put into operation in 2014 was larger than its operational volume table 7 the significant reduction of sediment flux will cause considerable influence to the downstream channel as well as three gorges reservoir tgr which is only about 210 km from yibin severe scouring of the river bed downstream of xjb is irrevocable referring to the calculation by zhu et al zhu et al 2016 where a total scouring of 36 7 mt occurred in 2008 2015 from xjb to yibin only 29 8 km without doubt the whole section between yibin and yichang and downstream of three gorges dam will suffer riverbed scouring besides the reservoir induced scouring at downstream counteracts part of the sediment decline which is found to be even more serious in the middle reaches of the yangtze river compared to the upstream of the tgr yang et al 2018 on the other hand such reduction of sediment discharge releases the stress of sediment retention inside tgr 5 4 water consumption as a sparsely populated area water consumption in jrb is very small and also increases slowly data of detailed water supply in mljrb are available from 2001 to 2015 resources which generally shows an ascending trend with time on average the total water supply is 69 1 108 m3 yr consisting of agricultural water consumption 63 3 industrial water consumption 20 7 domestic water consumption 14 4 and ecological and environmental water consumption 1 6 the highest consumption 76 3 108 m3 occurred in 2012 and the lowest 65 3 108 m3 in 2003 the agricultural part stands at a relatively stable value while other three parts contribute most of the increase in the total consumption assuming the water consumption in t1 keeps at the same level as that in 2001 2005 by using the average water consumption in t2 the increased annual water consumption in 2006 2015 is ca 4 108 m3 accounting for 2 7 of the total runoff reduction and this reduction further resulted in a sediment load reduction of 1 4 mt yr 1 in total reduction in 2002 2015 5 5 water soil conservation serious rainfall erosion occurring in the yunnan guizhou plateau causes the main source of sediment yield in the upper yangtze river basin wang et al 2014 and ljrb is one of the four most severely erosive regions in china the other three are the middle and lower reaches of the jialing river the tgd region the southern gansu and shaanxi hence a series of water soil conservation projects have been carried out since 1989 named as changzhi project it mainly focuses on small basins with a combination of farming engineering and vegetation techniques which typically contain afforestation terracing and some engineering methods to change the topography xu 2007 besides another project named tianbao was also lunched since the great flood in 1998 aiming at protecting natural forest resources in both the uyrb and upper yellow river basin while these projects may not lead to instant effects and require investments in the long run according to the results of remote sensing monitoring of soil erosion conducted by ministry of water resources of people s republic of china ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2019 the area suffering water soil losses in ljrb was 4 8 104 km2 in 2004 and 1 36 104 km2 in 2015 while the total area of ljrb is 8 8 104 km2 indicating an achievement in the initial stage persistent effort needs to be devoted to water soil conservation to achieve effective control of soil erosion in the literature vegetation coverage has been widely used as an important factor indicating the effect of water soil conservation ouyang et al 2010 sun et al 2015 not only because of the strong evidence supporting the notion that water yield decreases following forest clear cutting due to reduced evapotranspiration and soil infiltration capacity bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 but vegetation can absorb the impact of raindrops reduce the velocity and scouring power of runoff reduce runoff volume by increasing percolation in to the soil bind soil with roots and protect the soil from wind erosion wang et al 2014 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained by satellites is an accessible index and is considered to be effective in sensing trends in green vegetation guo and lei 2013 tüshaus et al 2014 as the main source of sediment yield in the mljrb with an average contribution of 76 to the total sediment load while the area only makes up 34 of the mljrb also the key region of conservation projects ljrb specifically in our study it covers the basin between panzhihua xiaodeshi and pingshan is extracted the annual ndvi of this region from 1982 to 2015 shows a small fluctuation without significant change generally fig 9 a but it is interesting to note that downward and upward trends are respectively observed before and after the critical year 1992 the third year after commencement of changzhi project this suggests the negative effects of human activities such as reclamation were not redeemed until several years after rehabilitation so that human induced hydrological response is usually delayed after the implementation wang et al 2013a the value of 2012 is distinctly out of the trend dropping to a low ebb with a recovery in the following 3 years this is conjectured to be the consequence of the previous severe drought year 2011 which had the lowest precipitation 616 mm 25 lower than the mean value during the time range studied fig 2 after a time of reaction vegetation may die off in response to the lack of water resources taking more time for rehabilitation this is consistent to another more extreme case in that more than 90 of the overstory tree species died after 15 months of soil water depletion in southwestern north american woodlands breshears et al 2005 by pixel based investigation ndvi value distribution curves are presented fig 9b in which the percentage of area where the ndvi larger than a certain value is shown it is clear that the curve of post conservation period had a starts to fall from a higher value and the falling is also steeper implying that conservation projects are mainly focused on low ndvi locations besides the increase of the percentage of low and middle level ndvi shows the achievements of conservation a spatial distribution of ndvi of the mljrb is presented in fig 10 for finer detail by drawing comparison between the ndvi distribution patterns in 1989 and 2010 though the mean values of the two years are close to each other fig 9a we can easily observe the increase in the eastern part as well as north part of the ljrb furthermore the difference between pre transition years and post transition years is transparent fig 10c showing the evident improvement in vegetation coverage achieved especially in the eastern part of ljrb m k trend analysis based on each pixel is also carried out for both periods 1982 1992 and 1993 2015 fig 10 d g in the pre conservation years most of the area had a negative trend in ndvi especially in the north western part but the trend in the south western part is upward while only a part of it passes the significance test in post conservation years ndvi in most of the area except a small portion in the north western part clearly increased and was also of high significance despite the considerable drop since 2012 the above information implies a difference in the change of vegetation in different locations which may cause different influences to the local water sediment yield however unlike the loess plateau in the yellow river basin where considerable variation of the yearly ndvi and thus vegetation coverage took place and showed good correspondence to sediment yield ouyang et al 2010 liu et al 2014a b in the jrb no clear correlativity between the spatially average ndvi and sectional sediment load or runoff is found neither the sediment concentration or runoff coefficient this may be due to several reasons 1 unlike that of the loess plateau the ndvi of the mljrb throughout recent decades is relatively steady and its oscillation outweighs its real trend 2 a fusion of other causal factors could be both positively and negatively contributable to sediment yields happened simultaneously so that it is hard to separate the independent relationship between the ndvi and dependent variables when ndvi is not the dominant factor of the sediment load 3 as discussed last paragraph the regional disparity of ndvi distribution is obvious and it is reasonable to consider different strength of sediment yield for different regions these may lead to inaccuracy of an average value to reflect the strength of sediment yield in the whole mljrb 4 the effect of conservation itself is highly nonlinear for example the products of conservation can be fragile under extreme conditions for they are designed according to historical information when the local input e g precipitation reaches the threshold damage may occur to the conservation projects and the water and soil loss may be even more serious than in the pre conservation scenario xu 2009 in spite of all of these it is still possible to estimate the contribution to r swater sediment reduction following previous quantitative analysis assuming other causes not considered are minor we deem that the rest of the contribution to the reduction of runoff and sediment load 22 5 and 35 respectively can mainly be ascribed to the effects of conservation measures however the factors contained in this part could be heterogeneous while the figures only indicate the ultimate effect of the land use land cover change which is actually influenced both by positive and negative effects in terms of water soil conservation 6 discussion as is quantitatively analyzed above the main factors leading to the change of sediment load and runoff across the mljrb has been clarified and the contribution is also summarized and listed in fig 11 for runoff the influence from climate change and human activities is considered to be comparable but generally precipitation can still be regarded as the major factor and contributed 56 3 to the total runoff reduction followed by water soil conservation and construction of large reservoirs each is around 20 for sediment load dam reservoir construction was the most significant factor 44 9 and what is even more important is its potential trapping ca 90 of the sediment load since 2013 other factors mainly including conservation contributed 35 and precipitation a further 19 1 assembly human activities accounted for more than 80 of the total sediment reduction and 187 mt yr in amount while climate change contributed only ca 20 but cannot be neglected there are additional issues on the methodology despite the calculative part being completed in most studies including the current one judgement is made through the difference between measured value and predicted theoretical value of the objective variable z e g runoff by regression analysis with the independent variable x e g precipitation more precisely given x and z are significantly correlated z is also in the grip of other factors by referring to section 3 4 the quantitative relationship between x and z from which the predicted value of z in t2 zt is calculated can be based either on t1 or t2 this is because when we apply the current value of x into the previous relationship and compare the result with the observation in t1 the influence of x change can be revealed following the same logic when we apply the previous value of x into the current relationship and compare the result with the observation in t2 at present the impact brought by change of x can likewise be isolated the two methods follow different directions in searching for the path to the current point as shown schematically in fig 12 and lead to different results in contribution separation δzx 1 is not equal to δzx 2 and the difference between them approaches to δfδg in eq 10 nevertheless the choice of these ways is seldom explained or explicitly discussed though both have been used in different studies the first path seems to be more common e g for the first path please refer to miao et al 2011 ye et al 2013 gao et al 2013 liu et al 2014a b kong et al 2016 and wang et al 2008 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 for the other path in terms of the contribution of the precipitation change to the sediment reduction the result obtained following the first path is ca 3 larger than the second path in our study such discrepancy is caused by neglecting the interaction between the factor x and other factors in the time domain for example the precipitation may change synchronously with the progress of soil conservation and the latter factor will probably shift the curve of x z relationship while precipitation is decreasing by following the path 1 it is acquiesced that only human effects have interference time which is not true because climate change may occur simultaneously with land use land cover change induced by human activities as is also critically discussed in dey and mishra 2017 both paths have limitations the first one assumes the change of x occurs ahead of any other factors while the second one assumes other factors change ahead of the change of x if all the factors cause a monotonous influence to z the first way will lead to overestimation of the factor x and vice versa though both paths appear to cause limited differences for a gross estimation it is still worthwhile illuminating the assumptions we take unconsciously but lead to ambiguity the procedure can be refined by using finer data if accessible and models representing smaller time scales especially in the context of continuous human activities 7 conclusion the driving factors of runoff and suspended sediment load change in the mljrb in 1960 2015 is preliminarily analyzed and presented after the variation of several hydrological variables temperature precipitation runoff and sediment load is investigated firstly trend analysis carried out by mann kendall method manifests that significant increase in temperature both in ujrb and mljrb and overwhelming decrease in sediment load occurred both annually and in summer and autumn while the precipitation and runoff had no significant change except the increase of runoff in spring with nominal decrease additionally the monthly runoff tends to be more uniformly distributed according to the change of concentration especially after 2000 abrupt change analysis by sequential cluster method shows that there was more significant transition in the mljrb where the years 2006 and 2002 marked the transition year of runoff and sediment load respectively comparing 1960 2005 to 2006 2015 the regional runoff decreased 14 7 from 1029 1 108 m3 yr to 877 8 108 m3 yr and the regional sediment load decreased dramatically from 230 7 mt yr 1960 2001 to 85 6 mt yr 2002 2015 accounting for 62 9 and has even been below zero since 2013 the drivers behind this change are then analyzed separately with the quantification of their contribution in the mljrb runoff decreased 85 108 m3 yr in response to the reduction of precipitation accounting for 56 3 of the total runoff reduction human activities intensified in the last two decades lead to comparable impacts to runoff as climate change including the construction and operation of large reservoirs 18 6 increased water consumption 2 7 as well as water soil conservation and other potential factors 22 5 in contrast to runoff the change of sediment load was dominated by human activities which caused approximately 80 of sediment reduction impoundment and operation of reservoirs dams exerted the strongest influence to the suspended sediment load by reducing 65 1 mt yr on average in 2002 2015 accounting for 44 9 and intercepted almost 90 of the sediment load upstream of pingshan since 2015 after the two huge projects xiluodu and xiangjiaba were put into operation another 35 50 8 mt yr of the sediment reduction can be attributed to the effect of water soil conservation and other implicit factors only 19 1 of sediment reduction was caused by decrease of annual precipitation in addition precise influence of temperature change to water and sediment discharge was uncertain based on the current data sources despite various qualitative mechanics being discussed future work will attempt to incorporate the variation of evapotranspiration under the budyko framework to better understand the impact of temperature change and underlying surface change a distributed hydrological model will be adopted to improve the accuracy of this analytical framework declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

8419,study region the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river basin mljrb study focus the main objective is to evaluate the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities to the water and sediment resources of the studied region in 1960 2015 the variation of runoff and suspended sediment load is first analyzed with regard to their trends and abrupt change different factors attributable to the variation are then quantitatively separated new hydrological insights for the region the annual runoff and sediment load across the mljrb both decreased abruptly and coincidently in the recent two decades with the transitional years detected to be 2006 and 2002 respectively comparing the post transition period to the pre transition period runoff decreased 14 7 and sediment load decreased 63 climate change is the major contribution for the decrease in runoff which explains 56 3 of the reduction and impoundment of large reservoirs and water consumption contributed 18 6 and 2 7 respectively the other 22 5 was ascribed to water soil conservation and other factors in contrast to water resources human activities were dominant in sediment reduction including 44 9 caused by large reservoirs 1 from increased water consumption and 35 by conservation measures and other potential factors remarkably almost 90 of the sediment load can be trapped as the direct consequence of the construction and operation of two huge dams xiluodu and xiangjiaba since 2013 keywords climate change anthropogenic activities runoff suspended sediment load quantitative analysis 1 introduction human civilization has been always impacted by fluvial processes throughout history including floods and droughts soil erosion sedimentation and sediment transport with environmental ecological and social significance that are of great public concerns dey 2014 piao et al 2010 yu et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 in turn climate change and anthropogenic activities serve as the main drivers that exert influences on hydrologic circles allen and ingram 2002 oki and kanae 2006 piao et al 2007 syvitski et al 2005 for example the amount and frequency of precipitation directly controls river discharge milliman and farnsworth 2013 zhang et al 2008 as well as soil erosion anders et al 2008 and thus influences the sediment load global warming may result in a change in glacial melting piao et al 2010 evapotranspiration bo et al 2011 and rock weathering anderson 2005 on the other hand land use changes alter soil properties interception of surface flow and flood frequency brath et al 2006 wang et al 2013a b c d while urbanization increases the generation of surface runoff and reduces the time lag between runoff and precipitation jiang et al 2015a b additionally soil conservation projects and dam reservoir construction contribute a lot to regional sediment load reduction wang et al 2016 yang et al 2011 in the last half a century generally runoff in the north part of china the yellow river basin showed a significant downward trend while there was minimal change of runoff in the southern part the yangtze river though it decreased significantly in the upper reaches of yangtze river basin uyrb wang et al 2013c d however for the yangtze river it is reported that the sediment flux at datong the most seaward gauging station reduced by 187 mt yr in 1993 2002 and a further 145 mt yr in 2003 2012 in comparison with 1950 1968 yang et al 2015 by and large intensified anthropogenic influences in recent decades are playing increasingly important roles in explaining the change of the water and sediment flux into the ocean from the major rivers in china especially for sediment load wang et al 2013a b c d li et al 2018a b with a length of 4300 km and altitude range of 400 to 5100 m a s l the upper reach of the yangtze river basin uyrb the region in the yrb above yichang suffers from serious soil erosion with an annual average surface erosion 1 57 billion t and high annual suspended sediment load 0 43 billion t yr where complex climate changes and intensive human activities are taking place and is now becoming a worldwide concern wei et al 2014 the jinsha river basin jrb is the mainstream of the yangtze river above yibin which is one of the main sediment sources of uyrb contributing nearly 60 and likewise for three gorges reservoir and nearly 90 of the sediment load is generated in the middle and lower reaches especially the lower reach ljrb however there is limited amount of research specializing in the jrb compared with that on the yrb though some studies have been conducted in different aspects wang et al 2013b investigated the variation of annual and seasonal precipitation in the jrb based on data from 30 meteorological stations 1961 2008 and found that 80 of the stations exhibited increasing trends for annual precipitation and this figure went up to 90 in the precipitation in spring while this trend was more significant in the yalong river than the main stream of jinsha river the largest decrease in precipitation occurred in the wet area whilst the largest increase magnitude occurred in the relatively dry area in this study the jrb was divided into 7 sub sections on the basis of hydrologic stations which is considered to be of physical rationality wei et al 2011 studied the anthropogenic impacts on the suspended sediment load in the uyrb including the jrb through a new proxy indicator introduced to reflect human activities sediment load rainfall erosivity s r important national activities e g the great leap forward the cultural revolution soil conservation in the past few decades are interestingly attached to the visible change in the pattern of s r vs time the effects of soil conservation dams reservoirs construction and land use changes were discussed separately and quantitatively but the relative contribution of different factors were not identified the relationship between total storage capacity of reservoirs and sediment load needs to be directly plotted otherwise it will confound the effect of other sediment reduction factors e g water soil conservation during the same period quite a number of large hydropower stations with dams and reservoirs have been constructed in cascade in the jrb since the first one ertan was built in 1998 and the sediment load in response to which in the background of climate change has been studied by li et al 2018a b human activities deforestation and mineral extraction in the 20th century and damming in the 21st century are governing factors of sediment change while the variation of water discharge are mainly ascribed to climate change it was calculated that in 2011 2015 operation of cascade reservoirs in the middle jrb mjrb reduced 75 9 of the sediment load at panzhihua and the construction of the xiluodu and xiangjiaba dams together with the cascade reservoirs in mjrb decreased the sediment load at xiangjiaba by 83 3 2011 2015 nevertheless in spite of their efforts to make improvements in quantitative understanding the study failed to distinguish the contribution of cascade reservoirs from other human activities that occurred concurrently in the decrease of sediment load solely based on regression analysis of the double mass curve as was done in most previous studies dai et al 2008 to summarize though important information can be accessed from existing research on various aspects related to the change of hydrological variables it is also true that a comprehensive study to identify the contribution of different drivers influencing runoff and sediment load in the jrb has hitherto not been conducted moreover growing concerns from interested residents as well as government that takes the responsibility for decision making require us to clarify the response of natural resources as the result of climate change and intensified human activities especially the cascade reservoirs in mljrb with a total capacity more than two times of the three gorges reservoir which forms the main force of china s west east electricity transmission project the present study mainly targets at mljrb in order to avoid the different climatic characteristics in the upper reach and also to be more consistent with human activities as discussed in section 2 the result of trend analysis as well as abrupt change analysis of annual variables precipitation runoff and sediment load is presented first together with inner year characterization seasonally and monthly then we shed light on the quantitative influence of several main driving factors that have been concerned of in previous studies both climatic and anthropogenic perspectives a summary of the calculation results is given in the end with additional remarks on the methodology applied the result helps to gain a quantitative sense of human nature interaction for readers and can also be used as a reference for regional policy in terms of natural resources rehabilitation and control as well especially for the downstream part of pingshan extending to the three gorges reservoir 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the jinsha river basin jrb is the upper reach of the yangtze river basin uyrb above the pingshan hydrology station with a length of 3481 km and a drainage area of 47 32 104 km2 which are about 55 3 and 26 compared with the whole yrb respectively additionally the average annual runoff of jrb about 1450 108 m3 makes up 36 5 of the inflow of the three gorges reservoir tgr the jinsha river originates from the tibetan plateau marches southeast along the hengduan mountains and turns south to meet the yunnan guizhou plateau and then winds its way to the east between its source and pingshan station two locations shigu and panzhihua where its largest tributary the yalong river merges mark the demarcation of the upstream midstream and downstream of the jinsha river the valley is usually narrow with a v shaped cross section morphology and the elevation drops steeply over 3000 m in the main stream this results in an abundance of hydropower resources and therefore the frequent construction of hydropower engineering projects in the last two decades while the jrb plays a significant role in the yrb the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river basin mljrb located between 24 30 34 n and 97 105 e share different characteristics from those of the upper reach ujrb the climate is generally stratified because of the change of elevation specifically it tends to have a plateau climate in the upstream basin while a subtropical climate is dominant in the middle and lower reaches where the elevation is approximately between 1000 m and 3000 m the average annual runoff at pingshan station is more than three times that of shigu station in accordance with the fact that the annual precipitation of mljrb 807 mm is significantly higher than the upper reach 464 mm signifying that most of the water resources are generated in the mljrb sediment flux even highlights the dominance of mljrb to a larger extent for nearly 90 of the total sediment load gauged at pingshan is generated in this area with the background that jrb contributes more than 50 of the total sediment load to tgr wang et al 2014 gravitational erosion in the ljrb especially water erosion such as debris flow in small watersheds accounts for the major contribution to the sediment load generation besides most anthropogenic activities including water project construction land exploitation as well as water soil conservation are frequently implemented in the mljrb and thus is the focus of our study 2 2 data source and data process the daily data of precipitation and temperature used in this study is downloaded from the website of the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn and processed by surface average method in the jrb 22 meteorological stations are available fig 1 with 16 of them in mljrb all of these stations have continuous data series in the period of 1960 2015 the information of runoff and suspended sediment load comes from the hydrological office of the yangtze water resources committee the 7 concerned stations zhimenda station shigu station panzhihua station huatan station and pingshan station are on the mainstream of the jinsha river while xiaodeshi station and wantan station are on the yalong river do not have the same availability of data details are list in the table 1 there is lack of records in 1969 1970 for shigu station and the annual values of these two years have been reconstructed by linear regression method with the data measured at panzhihua station additionally pingshan station moved downstream for 2 km because of the construction of xiangjiaba hydropower station in 2012 the data after 2012 were collected at the new station but we still call it pingshan station for convenience the runoff data in 2015 of huatan station were substituted by the baihetan hydropower station which is 37 4 km downstream of huatan station we likewise keep the consistency in that the same name huatan station is still used for reference to the change of vegetation coverage the satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is adopted and analyzed the gimms ndvi 3 g dataset developed by the nasa global inventory modeling and mapping studies group was used in this study which has 15 day temporal resolution and 8 km spatial resolution qu et al 2018 the data cover a range from 1982 to 2012 with 15 day temporal resolution and 8 km spatial resolution we calculated a monthly ndvi by using maximum value composite mvc of the fortnightly dataset in order to minimize the effects of cloud contamination and atmospheric variability qu et al 2018 the weighted average is then calculated based on the average monthly precipitation to get the annual ndvi 3 methodology 3 1 characterization of hydrologic variation 3 1 1 trend analysis the mann kendall m k test kendall 1975 mann 1945 which is a rank based and nonparametric method commonly used in hydrological trend detection is adopted in this study before the application of m k test it is recommended to ensure that the influence of serial correlation of the time series is eliminated hence a pre whitening pw process is suggested khaliq et al 2009 however yue et al and fleming et al fleming and clarke 2002 yue et al 2003 found that pw may affect the magnitude of the real trend and they further proposed a trend free pre whitening tfpw approach to overcome this problem as was adopted in our study then we apply m k test to the pre whitened series and obtain the trend as well as its significance the parameter β can indicate whether the trend if significant of a given series x1 x2 xn is increasing or decreasing depending on whether it is positive or negative as well as the magnitude of the trend 1 β m e d i a n x i x j i j j i 3 1 2 abrupt change analysis sequential cluster analysis wang et al 2013a is used here to estimate the transition point of a given time series basically it is an optimal method to find the critical year that separates a time series into consecutive non overlapping epochs whose sums of squared deviations ssd are of different levels consider a time series x for a potential critical point xt the ssd before and after t is 2 v τ i 1 τ x i x τ 2 v n τ i τ 1 n x i x n τ 2 where 3 x τ 1 τ i 1 τ x i x n τ 1 n τ i τ 1 n x i then the total ssd is 4 s n τ v τ v n τ and t is considered to be abrupt point if s n τ s n where 5 s n min 1 r n 1 s n τ the significance of the obtained abrupt change point can be evaluated by rank sum test 3 1 3 inner year distribution important features of hydrological variables may be concealed if attention is only paid to annual values though a daily dataset is not available in most cases in our research it is still worth looking into the monthly distribution of precipitation runoff as well as sediment load two parameters are adopted here to describe the distribution characteristics of a series of variable ai i 1 2 12 in a certain year concentration coefficient c d and concentration period d0 6 c d a x 2 a y 2 i 1 12 a i 7 d 0 arctan a y a x where 8 a x i 1 12 a i cos θ i a y i 1 12 a i sin θ i the above procedure means that the variables are treated like vectors specifically the direction of the variables from january to december is defined to correspond to 15 to 345 the interval between any two months within a year is 30 while the magnitude of the vectors is the original value the dimensionless parameter d0 is then transformed into the value of month d in this way we can obtain a compounded result which illustrates the time of a variable concentrates and the degree of the concentration 3 2 quantifying the impact of a certain factor 3 2 1 a general approach a given time series of a hydrological variable is separated into 2 epochs according to the abrupt change analysis the previous period t1 also the reference period and the current period t2 also the objective period respectively for a hydrological variable z which is influenced by x and other factors lumped into y assuming x and y are independent and influence z in a product form z f x g y the quantification of its change over the two epochs is as follows 9 δ z f x 0 δ x g y 0 δ y f x 0 g y 0 f 0 δ f g 0 δ g f 0 g 0 δ f g 0 δ g f 0 δ f δ g where δ z is the variation of z over the two epochs and subscript 0 means denotes the value in the reference epoch t1 usually the value of δ f δ g is considered to be small and thus neglected wang et al 2013c d ding et al 2013 related discussion is given in section 6 therefore the variation of z is separated into x induced change δ z x and y induced change δ z y 10 δ z δ z x δ z y z t 2 z t z t z t 1 where z t 1 z t 2 are observed values in the two epochs z t is the theoretical value of z in t2 it can be calculated based on the relationship between z and x in the reference epoch t1 further discussion is given in section 6 then the relative contribution of factor x α x and other factors α y can be obtained as 11 α x δ z x δ z 100 12 α y 1 α x last but not least to empirically describe the quantitative relationship between hydrological variables the double mass curve method gao et al 2013 lu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 is widely used as well as direct regression analysis yang et al 2015 which is adopted in this study 3 2 2 evaluation on the influence of reservoirs notwithstanding above method works well in separation of climatic and anthropogenic factors it fails to provide further details for example the contribution of the sub factors of the anthropogenic part the major contribution of which comes from the construction and operation of reservoirs a method based on empirical relations is adopted in our study the whole picture will be presented in section 5 3 only the technical part of calculation is gone through here to grossly estimate the increased evaporation caused by emergent reservoirs we first reckon the increased reservoirs inundated area via the empirical relation calibrated from the large reservoirs in the mljrb 13 s 37 59 ln v 0 88 49 81 r 0 998 where v 108 m3 is reservoir capacity and s km2 is inundated area the increased evaporation thus equals the sum of the annually increased area times the annual water surface evaporation the distributed water surface evaporation data are not available and we take the average value between the ones at shigu station and pingshan station to quantitatively evaluate the influence of reservoirs on sediment load annually the widely used empirical equation proposed by brune brune 1953 and further improvement vörösmarty et al 2003 garg and jothiprakash 2010 is applied previously the trapping efficiency of the cascade reservoirs in a basin is counted by the sum of operation volume 14 δ τ j i 1 n j v i q j 15 t e j 1 0 05 δ τ j where vi is the operational volume of reservoir i and qj is the average annual water discharge at the mouth of basin j nj denotes the number of reservoirs considered in basin j δ τ j is residence time of the basin and t e j is approximated trapping efficiency then the trapping efficiency of several basins in parallel connection tesum that contains m sub basins can be calculated by a weighting average with respect to annual discharge 16 t e s u m j 1 m t e j q j q 0 where m is the number of sub basins and q0 is the average discharge at the regulating station of the whole basin however the above procedure may encounter discrepancy when calculating the combined trapping efficiency of cascade reservoirs that are built successively due to neglecting the fact that each individual reservoir works independently rather than have the same effect as an assumed reservoir with a capacity of the summation of all in this sub basin it is neither suggested to use parameters weighted by drainage area of a reservoir as yang et al did for the whole yrb in yang and lu 2014 since a particular section in a basin may have a different strength of sediment yield that considerably influences the entire region studied to achieve a better accuracy we directly calculate the sediment trapped by each reservoir progressively in each section so that the te of each reservoir relative to the located section is weighted by actual entrapped sediment load therefore for each section the total trapping effect is 17 t e c a s c a d e i 1 n t e i s p i s m where n is the number of reservoirs in the section s m is the sediment load that is available to the section while the sediment load available to the ith reservoir s p i can be expressed as 18 s p i s i t e i 1 s p i 1 in the above equation si denotes the annual mean sediment load at the ith reservoir since no mean annual sediment data at each reservoir are available we conducted interpolation between two hydrologic stations astride a section based on the documented mean annual runoff at each reservoir with the assumption also is shown in this study that the sediment load is significantly correlated with runoff the specific calculation as well as an example is presented in section 5 3 4 the changing hydrological variables in jrb 4 1 characteristics of annual variation in this section the changing pattern of annual temperature precipitation runoff and sediment load are introduced fig 2 and analyzed both m k trend analysis and sequential cluster abrupt change analysis are conducted with regard to the datasets of the mentioned hydrological variables in the time range of 1960 2015 with the outcomes presented in table 2 and table 3 the conditions of ujrb as well as the whole jrb are also given for comparison but special attention is paid to mljrb the runoff and sediment load of mljrb are calculated following the concept of sectional values the difference between downstream station pingshan and upstream station shigu which can be considered as the net flux through a control volume the temperature in both ujrb and mljrb continuously increased during the 56 years considered with a very high significance level more than 99 as did the whole jrb the slopes obtained in m k test manifest the increasing rate which were 0 033 yr and 0 015 0 033 yr respectively it is notable that the highest temperatures in both areas can be observed in 2015 with the lowest temperature occurring 40 years ago significant abrupt changes are detected and presented in table 3 no significant trends are detected in terms of the precipitation and runoff however the result of change point analysis indicates different levels exist in the time series of both variables generally the precipitation and runoff in the mljrb show obvious transition points 2003 and 2006 respectively corresponding to the fact reflected by the trend analysis that a slight decrease of both variables is observed as for the suspended sediment load the most prominent change occurred in mljrb where a dramatic plunge of sectional sediment load can be seen and it is necessary to note that 2013 marked the year in which the sectional sediment load plunged below zero meaning the input of sediment load on the mljrb was even more than the output put another way there was net impoundment of sediment since the amount of sediment from ujrb contributes little to the whole jrb in spite of the weak increase with a rate of 18 104 t yr in the ujrb the latter value still decreased greatly the year 2002 is determined as the abrupt change point for both jrb and mljrb as an example of abrupt change analysis fig 3 shows the change of sn of the mljrb s runoff and sediment load during 1960 2015 the lowest points for the two series are 2006 and 2002 respectively marking the change points choosing the critical years to be the demarcation of two epochs the variation of runoff and sediment load in the mljrb is extracted and presented in fig 4 from an average perspective the regional runoff in the second stage 2006 2015 decreased 14 7 compared with the first stage 1960 2005 from 1029 1 to 877 8 108 m3 yr while the sediment load decreased up to 62 9 from 230 7 to 85 6 mt yr and it even maintained negative values in the last three years of the investigated period underlying that an overwhelming influence rather than an occasional incident was exerted on the local sediment discharge 4 2 change of inner year distribution the inner year distribution of precipitation runoff and sediment load are studied on a monthly and seasonally basis spring is defined as february march and april summer is defined as may june and july autumn is defined as august september and october winter is the last two months of the year and january of the next year the average distribution as well as the trend of change during 1960 2015 is summarized in table 4 among all three aspects summer and autumn contributed most of the total annual amount especially the sediment load in the two seasons accounted for about 97 of the yearly value on average while it turned out to be relatively more uniform in terms of runoff just below 80 there is no significant trend shown in the seasonal precipitation though nominal increasing trends in spring and winter and decreasing trends in summer and autumn can be presented by the slope β as for runoff only the spring value apparently changed an increase of 6 47 m³ s per year the other three seasons showing nominal decreasing trends the sediment load is detected to have significant decreasing trend in summer and autumn in accord with yearly sediment load while an increasing trend is observed in spring though it had little contribution to the yearly value as the trend analysis may not reveal all the facts of quantity change a simple comparison of the average values is made between the two time periods 1960 2000 and 2001 2015 though seasonal precipitation is observed to go through a slight reduction within 5 in the four seasons change of runoff was not very consistent in spring with around 50 s increase in contrast to summer and autumn that runoff decreased slightly more than 10 a further investigation on the monthly distribution of precipitation and runoff is carried out in which the concentration coefficient c d and concentration period d are calculated for the period of 1960 2015 fig 5 it can be seen that for concentrated month both runoff and precipitation stayed at a roughly stable level with a little oscillations but an evident decrease of concentration coefficient of runoff is notable especially in the recent two decades and the three lowest values throughout the studied period occurred in the last decades 2006 2011 2015 respectively corresponding to the period that large dams and reservoirs were intensely built and operated above results attest to the fact that runoff is considerably affected by human activities in the recent two decades as a result of reservoirs operation the inner year distribution of runoff tends to become more uniform than natural scenarios because the water discharge from a reservoir in the wet season is supposed to be limited while a certain value would be maintained in dry season the impact of reservoirs on runoff and sediment load in terms of annual values are further discussed in section 5 3 5 contribution of driving factors 5 1 precipitation the runoff response to precipitation is evidently observed in previous studies both annually yang et al 2015 and monthly piao et al 2010 in the yrb precipitation is the main explanatory variable for the water discharge and then it can further influence the sediment flux chen et al 2014 one the other hand hydraulic erosion is considered to be the main driver of the sediment yield yang et al 2004 2005 xu 2009 jiang et al 2015a b which can be directly induced by the local rainfall linear regression analysis using the data from a less perturbed period 1960 1997 is thus carried out table 5 and it shows that in the jrb sediment load is more dependent on the water discharge compared to precipitation or precipitation intensity sum of daily precipitation larger than 20 mm the outcome of regression analysis may not imply that precipitation is less correlated to sediment load in a physical sense because the limitation of the number of data acquisition points meteorological stations hides the local hydrological features and conceals the real physical process nonetheless it is still feasible to adopt the perspective of runoff sediment relation in the current stage both p r relation linear regression curve and r s relation power curve following the form of the sediment rating curve show obvious correlations and double mass curves demonstrate their physical correspondence as well as abrupt change points fig 6 and fig 7 the non existence of a visible abrupt change point in the p r double mass curve and the transition point 2002 in the r s double mass curve are in good accordance with abrupt change analysis of the runoff coefficient and suspended sediment concentration to quantify the influence of precipitation on runoff and sediment load the methodology proposed in section 3 4 is applied based on division of epochs using the relationship obtained from the aforementioned curve fittings annual runoff during 2006 2015 on average was theoretically 944 108 m3 while the observed value was 877 8 108 m3 151 2 108 m3 less than in the previous epoch so the change of precipitation caused a 56 3 of the decrease in runoff and other drivers accounting for the rest 43 8 for sediment load the variation of precipitation decrease only contributed 19 1 of the total decrease in 2002 2015 implying other driving factors which are more pivotal and need to be identified lead to 80 9 and 117 4 mt s reduction the above result is shown in table 6 in detail additionally an apparent further decrease of sectional sediment load occurred since 2013 and the average annual sediment load dropped to 21 mt despite the precipitation in these three years are roughly the same in the previous epoch this is mainly due to the effect of reservoirs as discussed in later sections 5 2 temperature an obvious upward trend both in the mljrb and the ujrb can be observed in the recent 60 years with an increase of ca 0 5 in the mljrb and 1 2 in ujrb comparisons made between 2001 2015 and 1960 2000 however no significant relation between temperature and runoff or precipitation can be found as an important thermal index temperature influences glacial melting as well as evapotranspiration et piao et al 2010 it can also change the characteristics of local rainfall and change the frequency of extreme events floods and droughts additionally increasing precipitation leads to increasing cloud coverage and hence the ground surface temperature decreases zhang et al 2008 as for sediment load it is influenced by temperature not only indirectly through changing runoff but also through the direct effect of temperature change on rock weathering anderson 2005 considering the complex mechanism between temperature and the hydrologic factors it is hard to clarify whether the increasing trend has a positive or negative contribution to the change of runoff sediment load and existing studies give inconclusive answers with respect to different watersheds arnell and reynard 1996 risbey and entekhabi 1996 tao et al 2011 tang et al 2012 in the mljrb both the positive impact caused by snow glacier melting and the negative impact caused by evapotranspiration need to be considered since the tributary the yalong river also originates from the headwaters of the yangtze river it is adopted in yang et al 2015 that the rate of melting in the headwaters of the yangtze river was 0 07 km3 yr before 2000 and became 0 99 km3 yr after 2000 assuming the increase of the melting rate was kept to be 0 9 km3 yr in 2006 2015 compared with t1 and 30 of it fed into the yalong river the increase in annual runoff in the mljrb is calculated to be 2 7 108 m3 which is small compared to the total runoff variation on the other hand the area of increase and decrease of et in different regions of mljrb roughly balance with each other bo et al 2011 moreover since there may be potential effects of temperature on precipitation and landform change that finally alter the output of water and sediment resources further research is required to disentangle the temperature induced et change from human activities as a whole at this initial stage of approximation we consider the direct impact of temperature on runoff or sediment flux in mljrb as less important compared to other factors while its iterative influences that combined with other factors can still be accounted 5 3 construction of reservoirs many hydropower stations with large reservoirs have been constructed or are under construction since the end of last century in the jrb in order to make good use of hydropower resources for electricity generation to feed the demand locally or in the eastern part of china information on the reservoirs with total capacity larger than 1 108 m3 constructed and impounded before the end of 2015 is listed in table 7 after the impoundment of ertan reservoir in 1997 most reservoirs hydropower stations e g gyy xld xjb etc started intensive operations during 2011 2015 the total capacity of these reservoirs added up to ca 230 108 m3 60 of three gorges reservoir apart from middle and uncounted small size reservoirs and they indeed caused evident influence to the amount of water discharge and sediment load in the mljrb the runoff across the mljrb is mainly influenced by these reservoirs through impoundment and increased evaporation from the water surface since these reservoirs are annually regulated and a relatively stable storage after start of normal operation is considered no extra water from upstream is further impounded based on statistics reported by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources changjiang water resources commision of the ministry of water resources 2019 the total water impoundment of middle and large size reservoirs in mljrb in 2005 was ca 80 108 m3 and this figure rose to ca 330 108 m3 by the end of 2015 therefore water impoundment caused a total runoff reduction of 250 108 m3 annually 25 108 m3 yr during 2006 2015 as for evaporation from the water surface since the information of impoundment progress for each reservoir is not available we assume the reservoirs increase their storage linearly from the year when a reservoir begins operation to the year it completes impoundment and then calculate the increased evaporation as introduced in section 3 2 2 the evaporation caused by existing reservoirs the total capacity is ca 80 108 m3 by the end of t1 is also counted in the increased loss due to the fact that these reservoirs were newly built with regard to the epochs t1 and contribute little to the overall change of evaporation in t1 finally the total increased evaporation from 2006 to 2015 is calculated to be 30 98 108 m3 and annually 3 1 108 m3 on average to sum up water reduction caused by the construction of water projects was 28 1 108 m3 yr which took up to 18 5 of the total reduction further in terms of monthly distribution it is shown that reservoir control water release and impoundment can obviously alter the water level as well as the runoff yang et al 2010 impoundment of the reservoirs can significantly influence the sediment flux as the dominant factor causing its reduction as total capacity in operation ascended so does water loss by evaporation the sectional sediment load dropped dramatically and finally had a negative value fig 4 referring to the method in section 3 2 2 three sections are considered in our study shigu panzhihua is section a the yalong river basin above xiaodeshi is section b and the remaining part of the mljrb to pingshan is section c therefore for section a and b the value s m is the annual mean sediment load at panzhihua and xiaodeshi respectively while for section c this value is the mean annual sediment load of pingshan subtracted by the amount entrapped by section a and b a schematic model with sectional trapping effect of reservoirs by the end of 2015 is shown in fig 8 by the end of 2015 the three sections a b c in fig 8 were able to trap sediment load of about 40 30 and 150 mt yr respectively based on historical mean values of runoff and sediment load the outcomes based on the sediment load of current years are presented in table 8 a striking effect of sediment deposition can be obtained with intensive increase especially since 2011 when the sediment load at panzhihua started to be less than shigu since 2013 the sediment load at pingshan started to be less than that at shigu or panzhihua which reveals the sum of sediment deposition and sediment reduction by other factors outweighed the total sediment sources in the mljrb the total te ballooned up to nearly 90 and is predicted to be even up to 93 1 after the construction of wudongde and baihetan another two huge projects in the downstream jrb which means that less than millesimal of the sediment load upstream of pingshan can be discharged downstream overall the construction and operation of large reservoirs in the mljrb contributed 44 9 65 1 mt yr of the sediment load reduction in 2002 2015 very little information about the measured sediment deposition in the jrb is known pieces of which can be found in zhu et al 2016 which are also cited in li et al 2018a b the measured sediment deposition in the four reservoirs in mjrb from ah to ldl in 2014 was 28 2 mt corresponding to a te of 69 9 while xld and xjb trapped 66 mt in the same year corresponding to a te of 96 8 comparing with the measurement the calculated result of section a 67 8 is quite closed while that of section c 82 7 is much smaller this may be because the actual volume of xld that was put into operation in 2014 was larger than its operational volume table 7 the significant reduction of sediment flux will cause considerable influence to the downstream channel as well as three gorges reservoir tgr which is only about 210 km from yibin severe scouring of the river bed downstream of xjb is irrevocable referring to the calculation by zhu et al zhu et al 2016 where a total scouring of 36 7 mt occurred in 2008 2015 from xjb to yibin only 29 8 km without doubt the whole section between yibin and yichang and downstream of three gorges dam will suffer riverbed scouring besides the reservoir induced scouring at downstream counteracts part of the sediment decline which is found to be even more serious in the middle reaches of the yangtze river compared to the upstream of the tgr yang et al 2018 on the other hand such reduction of sediment discharge releases the stress of sediment retention inside tgr 5 4 water consumption as a sparsely populated area water consumption in jrb is very small and also increases slowly data of detailed water supply in mljrb are available from 2001 to 2015 resources which generally shows an ascending trend with time on average the total water supply is 69 1 108 m3 yr consisting of agricultural water consumption 63 3 industrial water consumption 20 7 domestic water consumption 14 4 and ecological and environmental water consumption 1 6 the highest consumption 76 3 108 m3 occurred in 2012 and the lowest 65 3 108 m3 in 2003 the agricultural part stands at a relatively stable value while other three parts contribute most of the increase in the total consumption assuming the water consumption in t1 keeps at the same level as that in 2001 2005 by using the average water consumption in t2 the increased annual water consumption in 2006 2015 is ca 4 108 m3 accounting for 2 7 of the total runoff reduction and this reduction further resulted in a sediment load reduction of 1 4 mt yr 1 in total reduction in 2002 2015 5 5 water soil conservation serious rainfall erosion occurring in the yunnan guizhou plateau causes the main source of sediment yield in the upper yangtze river basin wang et al 2014 and ljrb is one of the four most severely erosive regions in china the other three are the middle and lower reaches of the jialing river the tgd region the southern gansu and shaanxi hence a series of water soil conservation projects have been carried out since 1989 named as changzhi project it mainly focuses on small basins with a combination of farming engineering and vegetation techniques which typically contain afforestation terracing and some engineering methods to change the topography xu 2007 besides another project named tianbao was also lunched since the great flood in 1998 aiming at protecting natural forest resources in both the uyrb and upper yellow river basin while these projects may not lead to instant effects and require investments in the long run according to the results of remote sensing monitoring of soil erosion conducted by ministry of water resources of people s republic of china ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2019 the area suffering water soil losses in ljrb was 4 8 104 km2 in 2004 and 1 36 104 km2 in 2015 while the total area of ljrb is 8 8 104 km2 indicating an achievement in the initial stage persistent effort needs to be devoted to water soil conservation to achieve effective control of soil erosion in the literature vegetation coverage has been widely used as an important factor indicating the effect of water soil conservation ouyang et al 2010 sun et al 2015 not only because of the strong evidence supporting the notion that water yield decreases following forest clear cutting due to reduced evapotranspiration and soil infiltration capacity bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 but vegetation can absorb the impact of raindrops reduce the velocity and scouring power of runoff reduce runoff volume by increasing percolation in to the soil bind soil with roots and protect the soil from wind erosion wang et al 2014 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained by satellites is an accessible index and is considered to be effective in sensing trends in green vegetation guo and lei 2013 tüshaus et al 2014 as the main source of sediment yield in the mljrb with an average contribution of 76 to the total sediment load while the area only makes up 34 of the mljrb also the key region of conservation projects ljrb specifically in our study it covers the basin between panzhihua xiaodeshi and pingshan is extracted the annual ndvi of this region from 1982 to 2015 shows a small fluctuation without significant change generally fig 9 a but it is interesting to note that downward and upward trends are respectively observed before and after the critical year 1992 the third year after commencement of changzhi project this suggests the negative effects of human activities such as reclamation were not redeemed until several years after rehabilitation so that human induced hydrological response is usually delayed after the implementation wang et al 2013a the value of 2012 is distinctly out of the trend dropping to a low ebb with a recovery in the following 3 years this is conjectured to be the consequence of the previous severe drought year 2011 which had the lowest precipitation 616 mm 25 lower than the mean value during the time range studied fig 2 after a time of reaction vegetation may die off in response to the lack of water resources taking more time for rehabilitation this is consistent to another more extreme case in that more than 90 of the overstory tree species died after 15 months of soil water depletion in southwestern north american woodlands breshears et al 2005 by pixel based investigation ndvi value distribution curves are presented fig 9b in which the percentage of area where the ndvi larger than a certain value is shown it is clear that the curve of post conservation period had a starts to fall from a higher value and the falling is also steeper implying that conservation projects are mainly focused on low ndvi locations besides the increase of the percentage of low and middle level ndvi shows the achievements of conservation a spatial distribution of ndvi of the mljrb is presented in fig 10 for finer detail by drawing comparison between the ndvi distribution patterns in 1989 and 2010 though the mean values of the two years are close to each other fig 9a we can easily observe the increase in the eastern part as well as north part of the ljrb furthermore the difference between pre transition years and post transition years is transparent fig 10c showing the evident improvement in vegetation coverage achieved especially in the eastern part of ljrb m k trend analysis based on each pixel is also carried out for both periods 1982 1992 and 1993 2015 fig 10 d g in the pre conservation years most of the area had a negative trend in ndvi especially in the north western part but the trend in the south western part is upward while only a part of it passes the significance test in post conservation years ndvi in most of the area except a small portion in the north western part clearly increased and was also of high significance despite the considerable drop since 2012 the above information implies a difference in the change of vegetation in different locations which may cause different influences to the local water sediment yield however unlike the loess plateau in the yellow river basin where considerable variation of the yearly ndvi and thus vegetation coverage took place and showed good correspondence to sediment yield ouyang et al 2010 liu et al 2014a b in the jrb no clear correlativity between the spatially average ndvi and sectional sediment load or runoff is found neither the sediment concentration or runoff coefficient this may be due to several reasons 1 unlike that of the loess plateau the ndvi of the mljrb throughout recent decades is relatively steady and its oscillation outweighs its real trend 2 a fusion of other causal factors could be both positively and negatively contributable to sediment yields happened simultaneously so that it is hard to separate the independent relationship between the ndvi and dependent variables when ndvi is not the dominant factor of the sediment load 3 as discussed last paragraph the regional disparity of ndvi distribution is obvious and it is reasonable to consider different strength of sediment yield for different regions these may lead to inaccuracy of an average value to reflect the strength of sediment yield in the whole mljrb 4 the effect of conservation itself is highly nonlinear for example the products of conservation can be fragile under extreme conditions for they are designed according to historical information when the local input e g precipitation reaches the threshold damage may occur to the conservation projects and the water and soil loss may be even more serious than in the pre conservation scenario xu 2009 in spite of all of these it is still possible to estimate the contribution to r swater sediment reduction following previous quantitative analysis assuming other causes not considered are minor we deem that the rest of the contribution to the reduction of runoff and sediment load 22 5 and 35 respectively can mainly be ascribed to the effects of conservation measures however the factors contained in this part could be heterogeneous while the figures only indicate the ultimate effect of the land use land cover change which is actually influenced both by positive and negative effects in terms of water soil conservation 6 discussion as is quantitatively analyzed above the main factors leading to the change of sediment load and runoff across the mljrb has been clarified and the contribution is also summarized and listed in fig 11 for runoff the influence from climate change and human activities is considered to be comparable but generally precipitation can still be regarded as the major factor and contributed 56 3 to the total runoff reduction followed by water soil conservation and construction of large reservoirs each is around 20 for sediment load dam reservoir construction was the most significant factor 44 9 and what is even more important is its potential trapping ca 90 of the sediment load since 2013 other factors mainly including conservation contributed 35 and precipitation a further 19 1 assembly human activities accounted for more than 80 of the total sediment reduction and 187 mt yr in amount while climate change contributed only ca 20 but cannot be neglected there are additional issues on the methodology despite the calculative part being completed in most studies including the current one judgement is made through the difference between measured value and predicted theoretical value of the objective variable z e g runoff by regression analysis with the independent variable x e g precipitation more precisely given x and z are significantly correlated z is also in the grip of other factors by referring to section 3 4 the quantitative relationship between x and z from which the predicted value of z in t2 zt is calculated can be based either on t1 or t2 this is because when we apply the current value of x into the previous relationship and compare the result with the observation in t1 the influence of x change can be revealed following the same logic when we apply the previous value of x into the current relationship and compare the result with the observation in t2 at present the impact brought by change of x can likewise be isolated the two methods follow different directions in searching for the path to the current point as shown schematically in fig 12 and lead to different results in contribution separation δzx 1 is not equal to δzx 2 and the difference between them approaches to δfδg in eq 10 nevertheless the choice of these ways is seldom explained or explicitly discussed though both have been used in different studies the first path seems to be more common e g for the first path please refer to miao et al 2011 ye et al 2013 gao et al 2013 liu et al 2014a b kong et al 2016 and wang et al 2008 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 for the other path in terms of the contribution of the precipitation change to the sediment reduction the result obtained following the first path is ca 3 larger than the second path in our study such discrepancy is caused by neglecting the interaction between the factor x and other factors in the time domain for example the precipitation may change synchronously with the progress of soil conservation and the latter factor will probably shift the curve of x z relationship while precipitation is decreasing by following the path 1 it is acquiesced that only human effects have interference time which is not true because climate change may occur simultaneously with land use land cover change induced by human activities as is also critically discussed in dey and mishra 2017 both paths have limitations the first one assumes the change of x occurs ahead of any other factors while the second one assumes other factors change ahead of the change of x if all the factors cause a monotonous influence to z the first way will lead to overestimation of the factor x and vice versa though both paths appear to cause limited differences for a gross estimation it is still worthwhile illuminating the assumptions we take unconsciously but lead to ambiguity the procedure can be refined by using finer data if accessible and models representing smaller time scales especially in the context of continuous human activities 7 conclusion the driving factors of runoff and suspended sediment load change in the mljrb in 1960 2015 is preliminarily analyzed and presented after the variation of several hydrological variables temperature precipitation runoff and sediment load is investigated firstly trend analysis carried out by mann kendall method manifests that significant increase in temperature both in ujrb and mljrb and overwhelming decrease in sediment load occurred both annually and in summer and autumn while the precipitation and runoff had no significant change except the increase of runoff in spring with nominal decrease additionally the monthly runoff tends to be more uniformly distributed according to the change of concentration especially after 2000 abrupt change analysis by sequential cluster method shows that there was more significant transition in the mljrb where the years 2006 and 2002 marked the transition year of runoff and sediment load respectively comparing 1960 2005 to 2006 2015 the regional runoff decreased 14 7 from 1029 1 108 m3 yr to 877 8 108 m3 yr and the regional sediment load decreased dramatically from 230 7 mt yr 1960 2001 to 85 6 mt yr 2002 2015 accounting for 62 9 and has even been below zero since 2013 the drivers behind this change are then analyzed separately with the quantification of their contribution in the mljrb runoff decreased 85 108 m3 yr in response to the reduction of precipitation accounting for 56 3 of the total runoff reduction human activities intensified in the last two decades lead to comparable impacts to runoff as climate change including the construction and operation of large reservoirs 18 6 increased water consumption 2 7 as well as water soil conservation and other potential factors 22 5 in contrast to runoff the change of sediment load was dominated by human activities which caused approximately 80 of sediment reduction impoundment and operation of reservoirs dams exerted the strongest influence to the suspended sediment load by reducing 65 1 mt yr on average in 2002 2015 accounting for 44 9 and intercepted almost 90 of the sediment load upstream of pingshan since 2015 after the two huge projects xiluodu and xiangjiaba were put into operation another 35 50 8 mt yr of the sediment reduction can be attributed to the effect of water soil conservation and other implicit factors only 19 1 of sediment reduction was caused by decrease of annual precipitation in addition precise influence of temperature change to water and sediment discharge was uncertain based on the current data sources despite various qualitative mechanics being discussed future work will attempt to incorporate the variation of evapotranspiration under the budyko framework to better understand the impact of temperature change and underlying
