16510,seawater desalination specifically reverse osmosis ro has become an important water resource especially in arid and semi arid regions the desalination process generates a brine solution that is usually discharged to the nearshore environment negatively impacting the marine ecosystem a different method of disposing of the brine solution is needed to restore and maintain the marine environment one such method is injecting the desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer this study aims to investigate the hydrological and environmental impacts of such injection using groundwater flow and solute transport numerical models showing the fresh saline water interface fsi response at different injection rates depths and distances from shore moreover this study investigates the recovery evolution of the aquifer after injection stops we also analyze the hydrological response when pumping saline groundwater sgw for desalination or freshwater for water supply simultaneously with brine injection results show that brine injection creates a high salinity plume that pushes the fsi landward and salinizes the aquifer after 20 years of injecting 5 million m3 y 1 17 million m3 of freshwater are lost due to salt contamination it is also shown that by injecting further offshore and in shallower depths the impact on the fsi and the aquifer is reduced furthermore pumping sgw simultaneously with brine injection negates the brine plume effect on the fsi and results in a more stable interface it is noted that aquifer recovery is a long process and even after 100 years of recovery the aquifer is not fully rehabilitated this paper shows for the first time the hydrological implications of brine injection into the saline part of the coastal aquifer and demonstrates its potential utility for desalination plants in protecting the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords desalination brine injection coastal aquifers saline groundwater seawater intrusion 1 introduction freshwater resources worldwide are being depleted due to ongoing exploitation and contamination which is expected to worsen in the near future greve et al 2018 arid and semi arid regions will be the hardest impacted hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 reverse osmosis ro desalination is a key technology for coping with the water shortage however it holds negative environmental implications one severe negative environmental impact of seawater ro desalination is the production of hypersaline brine waste which is discharged to the nearshore environment the brine also known as concentrate or reject contains most of the dissolved solids of the feed water in concentrated form the desalination brine also includes chemicals used for water pretreatment and post treatment such as acids and bases enzymes antiscalants biocides and detergents mezher et al 2011 these chemicals are added to the process before brine disposal to the ocean and enhance the negative impact of the brine on the nearshore ecology jones et al 2019 estimated that globally there are 16 000 desalination plants that produce 95 million m3 d 1 of freshwater and 141 5 million m3 d 1 of brine the brine volume is higher than the produced water because some desalination facilities work with less than 50 recovery which produces more brine water relative to freshwater the majority of global brine production 70 3 is in the middle east and north africa with almost 100 million m3 d 1 jones et al 2019 for example in israel alone 625 million m3 y 1 of brine is discharged to the sea wood et al 2020 the environmental risk of the brine discharged to the ocean depends mainly on the density temperature and salinity of the brine solution most brines are denser than seawater so they create brine plumes on the seafloor in some places the brine is diluted with cooling water from adjacent power plants which results in warm saline and buoyant brine plumes that extend a few kilometers from the discharge zone missimer et al 2015 petersen et al 2018 maintaining this method of brine discharge to the ocean may result in detrimental effects on the nearshore ocean ecosystem the repercussions of brine discharge to the ocean on marine ecosystems and organisms are diverse zooplankton hatching patterns moscatello and belmonte 2004 and fish diversity and occurrence vega cendejas and hernández de santillana 2004 may decrease however another study showed that zooplankton diversity and abundance next to a brine discharge location is not impacted by the brine grossowicz et al 2021 brine discharge was shown to negatively affect benthic organisms invertebrates and seagrass hundreds of meters away from the seawater ro plant outfall begher nabavi et al 2013 gacia et al 2007 riera et al 2012 2011 while another study showed no effect on corals by brine discharge van der merwe et al 2014 other studies showed that brine harms benthic bacteria frank et al 2019 2017 petersen et al 2018 and foraminifera kenigsberg et al 2020 and damages food webs grossowicz et al 2020 however using a multiport diffuser system at the discharge point can control the extent and concentration of the salt plume amy et al 2017 while the scientific community is still collecting evidence on the environmental impacts of brine discharge to the ocean there is a strong need to find a creative solution to deal with the desalination brine waste with minimum environmental impact one plausible solution is to inject the brine into the saline groundwater sgw portion of a coastal aquifer there are two primary potential concerns with this strategy first the injected brine could make its way back to the ocean if it migrates out of the aquifer as submarine groundwater discharge sgd the second concern is seawater intrusion or inland movement of the interface between fresh and saline groundwater seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers is a well known and extensively studied phenomenon that can occur naturally or due to anthropogenic activities as sea level rises seawater intrusion shifts the fresh saline water interface fsi upward and landward person et al 2003 werner and simmons 2009 yechieli et al 2010 the fsi also moves daily in response to tidal effects ataie ashtiani et al 1999 seasonally in response to changes in groundwater levels andersen et al 2005 michael et al 2005 and also by ocean surge events paldor and michael 2021 however a major cause of seawater intrusion is extensive pumping of fresh groundwater from coastal aquifers houben and post 2017 jones et al 1999 zhou et al 2005 similarly injection of brine into the saline portion of the aquifer could cause seawater intrusion thereby posing a risk to already scarce freshwater resources in areas requiring ro desalination on the other hand pumping sgw from a coastal aquifer as feed for desalination shifts the fsi toward the well thus freshening and rehabilitating the aquifer in its vicinity stein et al 2020 2019 this sgw has been shown to be a better source for desalination stein et al 2021a b 2016 compared with seawater and such pumping can reduce sgd and harness the natural recharge water to freshen the aquifer stein et al 2020 however the hydrological implications of injecting the desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer are unknown either with or without concurrent extraction of sgw for ro feed water in this paper we evaluate the hydrological and environmental impacts of injecting desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer as this may be a more environmentally friendly solution than nearshore discharge we use 3d groundwater flow and solute transport numerical models to evaluate the dynamics of the coastal aquifer in response to brine injection at different locations depths and rates and while pumping sgw or freshwater this research presents the first insights on the hydrological implications of injecting the desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer on the fsi dynamics and freshwater availability 2 methods 2 1 numerical model a 3d phreatic coastal aquifer model was constructed to simulate the shape and location of the fsi at a steady state the model was then used to investigate the effect of injecting desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer the purpose of the modeling was to simulate the dynamics of the fsi under various brine injection scenarios at different rates depths and distances from shore along with simultaneous pumping of sgw for desalination or freshwater to supplement the water supply all models were developed using the feflow code diersch 2014 which employs a finite element solution of the coupled variable density flow and solute transport equations the 3d model was constructed with 15 vertical layers with dimensions of 30 8 0 2 km fig 1 wide enough so the brine plume drawdown cones would not reach the model boundary the mesh was comprised of 512 655 nodes and 898 842 triangular prisms elements fig s1 the model was constructed with homogeneous and anisotropic hydraulic properties table 1 a grid analysis was conducted to evaluate sensitivity to the grid size and the results and conclusions are in the supporting information the boundary conditions applied to the model are prescribed seawater head on the seafloor along with mass concentration boundary condition of 35 000 mg l 1 which is conditioned for inflow flux this saltwater boundary condition remains valid as long as the advective flux points into the model when there is an outflow flux the outflow concentration is calculated by the model this way sgd salinity can be calculated with the corresponding salinity the top boundary over the land has a recharge rate of 200 mm year 1 which represents a semi arid area stein et al 2019 the vertical side boundaries and the bottom boundary of the model are impervious the other initial parameters are shown in table 1 these parameters are representative of an alluvial coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 2 2 injection scenario and sensitivity analyses a systematic series of simulations were conducted to examine the environmental hydrological impact of brine injection into the saline coastal aquifer along with its fate after injection stops first brine injection into the saline part of the coastal aquifer was simulated below the shoreline x 0 m and at a depth of 180 m below sea level different injection rates 2 5 5 7 5 12 5 and 20 million cubic meters a year mcmy were simulated to mimic the different capacities of a desalination plant and its impact on the coastal aquifer next a set of simulations were performed where one injection well was placed at four different configurations based on two distances from shore 0 and 500 m and two depths 100 and 180 m while more than one well should be used in engineered injection facilities we use a single well for simplicity and the fact that well field should be designed to avoid pressure cone interference which is consistent with the model set up for each configuration 5 mcmy of brine was injected to simulate a small medium desalination plant in addition the same sets of scenarios were tested with sgw pumping simultaneously with double the rate of the injection 10 mcmy as it illustrates a desalination plant that uses the sgw as feed and works with a 50 recovery ratio moreover a different set of scenarios of pumping freshwater at 5 mcmy while injecting brine at the same rate were conducted to simulate the option of seawater ro desalination and the need to supplement the water system with fresh groundwater each scenario simulated 20 years of flow and transport to model a desalination plant with a life expectancy of 20 years table 2 shows a description of the scenarios tested in this study the sgw pumping well screen was placed 100 m inland at a depth of 130 150 m below sea level while the freshwater pumping well screen was placed 1000 m inland at a depth of 40 60 m below sea level the numerical mesh and the injection wells and pumping well locations can be seen in fig s1 the injected water had a salinity of 70 000 mg l 1 while seawater salinity was set at 35 000 mg l 1 the brine salinity is approximately double the salinity of the feed water when the plant operates with a 50 recovery ratio which is the common recovery for seawater ro desalination plants elimelech and phillip 2011 in addition in that recovery ratio the sgw pumping rate is 100 higher than the brine production rate further descriptive sensitivity analysis was carried out where hydraulic parameters were changed in the model and injection of brine was performed at 0 m distance from shore and a depth of 180 m below sea level the hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity specific storage recharge rate and anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity were changed separately and compared to the generic model table 3 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 stein et al 2019 in these simulations the injection rate was set to 5 mcmy and the results were compared quantitatively this sensitivity analysis allows us to better understand the impact of brine injection on coastal groundwater dynamics for systems with different aquifer characteristics additional simulations of the coastal aquifer recovery were carried out where the injection was stopped after 20 years and the system recovered for 100 years this test was done to learn about the dynamics of aquifer recovery and the time scale of it with different aquifer characteristics the model results were analyzed quantitatively comparing the different scenarios of injection a volumetric box was set as a domain of interest doi below the land side of the aquifer and with the model width and depth fig 1 the dissolved mass of salt in the doi box was compared among the different scenarios for each scenario the salinity ratio ɸ was calculated following eq 1 stein et al 2019 1 ϕ m t m 0 where mt is the mass of dissolved solids in the doi at any time and m0 is the initial mass of dissolved solids in the doi this salinity ratio ɸ quantitatively reflects the amount of aquifer salinization ɸ 1 or freshening ɸ 1 another parameter that was calculated and compared in this study is the freshwater loss to salt contamination 2 f r e s h w a t e r l o s s v t v 0 where vt is the volume of water in the aquifer that its salinity is higher than that of 5 seawater salinity 1750 mg l 1 and v0 is the abovementioned initial volume at a steady state this volume corresponds to the changes in the fsi location and geometry for illustrative explanations about these parameters see fig s2 in the supporting information combined these parameters characterize the salinity change in the coastal aquifer and the fsi dynamics in response to brine injection 3 results and discussion 3 1 fsi and flow dynamics with brine injection brine injection creates a high salinity high density plume that spreads vertically and laterally in all directions along the base of the aquifer the brine plume pushes the fsi upward and landward increasing the salinity of the aquifer see supplementary materials for a video demonstrating plume evolution in the environment fig 2 quantitatively shows the fsi dynamics during brine injection of 5 mcmy scenario 1 table 2 the salinity ratio ɸ which represents the change in salinity below the land side of the aquifer shows an increase i e salinization as long as injection continues and reaches a maximum value of 1 23 after 20 years of continuous injection furthermore the fresh groundwater body loses 1 7 107 m3 in 20 years due to the brine plume expansion and propagation the brine plume propagation inland causes a situation where a place in the aquifer that was fresh becomes salinized with seawater or with a mix of the seawater and the brine brine injection changes the hydrological balance of the coastal aquifer negatively impacting the fresh groundwater the flow dynamics in a steady state are characterized by saltwater inflow density driven circulation of saline water originating at the seafloor and discharging with the fsi along with freshwater flow towards the sea oz et al 2015 when desalination brine is injected into the saline part of the coastal aquifer the flow patterns change dramatically fig 3 shows the flow velocity vectors at a steady state before injection fig 3a and after 20 years of brine injection fig 3b the velocity vectors near the injection point flow in all directions with the highest velocity compared to different areas in the model furthermore the flow velocity within the brine plume is higher relative to the flow on the offshore side fig 3b that is probably due to the proximity to the injection point and the higher density in the plume zone compared with seawater density that creates density driven flow brine injection pushes the sgw in all directions creating flow towards the seafloor along the seafloor where saltwater inflow occurs during steady state the flow reverses and saline sgd occurs during the injection in a steady state the saltwater inflow area stretches a few kilometers offshore while with brine injection the saltwater inflow area decreases and stretches only 1 km offshore red lines fig 3a and b the saltwater inflow rate and the sgd rate were evaluated with time during brine injection fig 4 as the injection starts the total sgd flux increases while the saltwater inflow rate decreases a rebound effect of the saltwater inflow rate and the sgd rate occurs where a small decrease and increase are noticed for the total sgd flux and the saltwater inflow rate respectively in the first few years of brine injection fig 4 this effect occurs due to hydraulic head wave propagation that the brine injection creates close to shore the hydraulic head rises below the seafloor when injection starts which creates a head gradient towards the seafloor and increases sgd next the hydraulic head drops close to shore which reverses the flow and increases saltwater inflow later the hydraulic head wave reaches farther offshore which increases sgd a figure illustrating this analysis and the hydraulic head wave propagation is in the supporting information fig s22 after 10 years the total sgd flux increases to 44 4 mcmy from its initial value of 42 mcmy and the saltwater inflow rate decreases to 7 45 mcmy from its initial value of 10 1 mcmy it is worth mentioning that the salinity of the sgd has not increased during the injection which means that the excess sgd originated in seawater and not in the injected brine saltwater inflow and sgd rates also change rapidly during the pumping of sgw stein et al 2020 showed that near a desalination plant in almeria spain that pumps sgw as feed for the ro process the sgd rate decreased and the saltwater inflow increased when pumping had started this opposite trend of sgd and saltwater inflow rate between pumping of sgw and brine injection into the saline part of the coastal aquifer is created because the pumping of sgw creates a pressure deficit and the injection creates pressure increase therefore injecting brine while pumping sgw for desalination may balance these changes in the aquifer and could result in more stable water flow dynamics 3 2 recovery after brine injection after simulating brine injection for 20 years we simulated aquifer recovery no injection for an additional 100 years fig 2 this was done to understand system dynamics with the assumption that injection will not operate indefinitely after injection stops the salinity ratio decreases fig 2a approximated by ɸ where the recovery rate is decreased with time after 100 years of recovery the salinity ratio reaches a value of 1 02 fig 2a suggesting an incomplete recovery of the aquifer a previous study showed that recovery from sgw pumping for 12 years would take only 20 years to reach ɸ ratio of 1 stein et al 2020 however in that study the aquifer recovered just from sgw pumping and in the current study the aquifer recovers from an injection of unnatural hypersaline brine for a longer period 20 years the freshwater loss parameter is consistent with the movement of the fsi as an increase in freshwater loss indicates fsi movement landward and a decrease in freshwater loss indicates fsi movement seaward when injection stops the fsi continues to propagate landward for the next 5 years and freshwater is being contaminated by saline water fig 2b and video 2 in the supporting information that is due to the higher density brine in the vicinity of the fsi which creates density driven flow towards the freshwater body then the fsi moves seawards and the aquifer is being rehabilitated this movement only occurs when the plume is diluted enough with seawater and the freshwater driving force overcomes the density driven flow landward aquifer recovery occurs much more slowly than salinization during injection even 100 years of recovery is not enough to fully recover to pre injection conditions the groundwater flow patterns in the coastal aquifer changed dramatically with brine injection and after injection stops the flow field slowly recovers toward pre injection conditions the total sgd flux decreases immediately after injection stops and reaches a steady state value after 30 years of recovery fig 4a additionally the saltwater inflow rate increases in response to injection stop while it reaches a higher rate than it was in steady state fig 4b similar to the total sgd flux the saltwater inflow rate reaches a steady state rate after 30 years of recovery fig 4b the flow around the remaining plume is still irregular and the flow field does not go back to a steady state after 100 years of recovery fig 3d the saltwater inflow zone however does grow with recovery time but does not reach its steady state value after 100 years of recovery a video showing the salinity distribution of the aquifer during recovery for 100 years is provided in the supporting materials 3 3 aquifer response to different injection rates a series of simulations were conducted to examine the fsi response to different desalination brine injection rates 2 5 20 mcmy scenarios 1 and 15 18 in table 2 into the saline part of the coastal aquifer fig 5 these scenarios simulate different plant capacities from 5 to 40 mcmy assuming 50 recovery of the ro process our modeling results show that as the injection rate increases its influence on the fsi increases as well at relatively low injection rates the plume shape and distribution are approximately symmetrical as the injection rate increases the plume becomes asymmetrical stretches further offshore and conforms to the shape of the fsi surface on the fsi side fig 5 fig 6 quantitatively shows the aquifer response to different brine injection rates the groundwater salinity below the land increases as the injection rate increases due to the landward movement of the fsi and because hypersaline brine intrudes to this area the ɸ ratio increases from 1 13 with the lower injection rate 2 5 mcmy scenario 15 to 1 75 with the higher rate 20 mcmy scenario 18 this phenomenon of increased salinity due to a higher injection rate was also studied and showed in a recent study along the nile delta abd elaty et al 2021 the amount of freshwater loss increases linearly as the injection rate increases a linear regression of the freshwater loss data shows that for every 1 mcmy of brine injection 6 million m3 of freshwater is contaminated in the aquifer after 20 years of injection fig 6b injection rate as can be seen is a major parameter that influences the coastal aquifer hydrological dynamics and is a great contributor to fsi migration landward large desalination plants that produce vast amounts of brine for subsurface injection would have to consider different injection approaches such as injection location rates durations and volumes different approaches may include injecting far offshore which results in a lower effect on the fsi and aquifer salinization these scenarios were tested in this study and are presented below 3 4 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the dominant factors affecting the fsi and the aquifer dynamics due to brine injection hydraulic parameters values were changed from the reference model and the model was run for 20 years with brine injection table 3 the parameter with the greatest influence on the salinity distribution ɸ is the hydraulic conductivity this is largely because different conductivities result in different initial locations of the fsi which then results in changes to the fsi dynamics during the injection the only scenario where injected brine rose and seeped out through the seabed was when the hydraulic conductivity was low 10 m d 1 this happens due to the difficulty of the brine to flow landward because of the proximity of the injection point to the fresh groundwater body which pushes the fsi seaward due to its driving force therefore the brine plume propagates more offshore and upwards towards the seafloor the salinity distribution plume dimensions and fsi visualization after 20 years of injection can be seen in the supporting information another parameter that greatly influences the fsi dynamics is the freshwater recharge rate lower recharge rates result in a lower driving force of the fresh groundwater flow which results in greater brine plume intrusion below the landside of the aquifer the result of the lower recharge rate is shown by the most freshwater loss compared with the other scenarios table 3 hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate have been previously shown to be the most influential parameters at natural conditions during freshwater pumping zeng et al 2018 and during sgw pumping from the coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 2019 our current work extends this by showing similar responses over different time scales in systems with active brine injection these parameters are shown to be the most influential parameters also in the recovery stage after injection cessation for example with a low recharge rate 100 mm year 1 and constant hydraulic conductivity k 60 m d 1 ɸ and the freshwater loss increase through the 100 years of simulated recovery fig s9 furthermore for low hydraulic conductivity 10 m d 1 and constant recharge rate 200 mm year 1 ɸ and the freshwater loss are maximum at the end of 20 years of injection and decrease rapidly during recovery with higher hydraulic conductivities k 60 or 120 m d 1 and constant recharge rate 200 mm year 1 ɸ ratio is highest at the end of injection followed by a decrease however freshwater loss continues to increase after injection cessation and only after 10 20 years the freshwater loss begins to decrease we interpret that this recovery behavior is controlled by the plume shape size and proximity to the fsi at the end of the injection period the plume geometry is influenced by the hydraulic parameters injection rate and injection location which demonstrates the complex feedback in this coastal system 3 5 brine injection location optimization 3 5 1 injection scenarios a series of brine injection scenarios were performed at different depths 100 and 180 m and distances from shore 0 and 500 m to evaluate the impact of each scenario on the coastal aquifer and to understand the optimization of injection location scenarios 1 4 table 2 all these scenarios were run with an injection rate of 5 mcmy for 20 years fig 7 shows the salinity distribution in the coastal aquifer for each scenario map views of the brine plume and the fsi surface can be seen in the supporting information the extent of the aquifer salinization for each scenario was quantified fig 8 the scenario with the most impact on the coastal aquifer was the injection at 180 m depth and 0 m from shore scenario 1 table 2 in this scenario ɸ after 20 years of injection was 1 23 fig 8a and 17 million m3 of freshwater was contaminated with seawater fig 8d on the other hand the scenario with a shallower injection depth 100 m and a farther distance from shore 500 m offshore scenario 4 table 2 had the least influence on the fsi and the salinity distribution in the aquifer red dashed lines at fig 8a and d this happens due to the tendency of the brine to flow downward due to its higher density which results in occupying a larger vertical area and reducing the lateral propagation of the plume fig 7b and c in that scenario ɸ was 1 11 and only 8 million m3 of freshwater was salinized after 20 years of injection the parameter with the largest impact on the fsi is the injection distance from shore this phenomenon was also found in pumping out of sgw where pumping had a greater impact on the aquifer while applying it closer to shore stein et al 2019 it is therefore recommended to inject the desalination brine farther away offshore to have the smallest impact on the freshwater portion of the coastal aquifer injection onshore would be a cheaper decision than injecting offshore however injecting offshore does not have to be on an expensive sea platform it rather can be performed by using angled slanted wells and thus the operation of the well is onshore which reduces costs these kinds of wells were offered for pumping sgw for desalination below the ocean missimer et al 2013 it is important to mention that even if the operation of the well is onshore it will elevate the cost of the entire process as discharging the brine to the ocean is less costly than operating a well field of injection wells the price of well injection has been estimated to be ten times higher than surface discharge greenlee et al 2009 however when a diffuser system is being used for surface discharge this cost ratio may be lower due to the costly construction and maintenance of a diffuser system voutchkov 2011 nonetheless the exact increase in cost would change from site to site depending on the specific geology and brine production capacity 3 5 2 brine injection with sgw pumping to further our understanding of the system dynamics we conducted four brine injection scenarios while simultaneously pumping out sgw at double the rate of the injection 10 mcmy scenarios 5 8 table 2 these scenarios address the situation where sgw is being pumped for desalination and the resulting brine is injected back into the subsurface sgw has been shown to be a better source for desalination which can reduce the operational costs compared with seawater desalination missimer et al 2013 stein et al 2021a b 2016 fig 9 shows the salinity distribution of the different brine injection scenarios with pumping sgw in these cases the salinity distribution is different and the impact is less than in the cases of only brine injection sgw pumping shifts the fsi location towards the pumping well seawards due to the creation of a pressure deficit while the injected brine pushes the fsi landward due to pressure increase and therefore the fsi is more stable this phenomenon of fsi movement towards the sgw pumping well is consistent with previous studies using lab and field experiments shi et al 2011 stein et al 2019 and numerical models pool and carrera 2009 stein et al 2020 2019 and was observed near desalination plants that use sgw as feed otero et al 2011 stein et al 2020 the scenario that had the most impact on the fsi is where the injection depth was 180 m and the distance from shore was 0 m the salinity ratio of this scenario is 1 02 lower compared with the 1 23 value of the injection only scenario meaning almost no salinization occurred fig 8b the freshwater loss parameter shows negative values for all simulated scenarios documenting that freshwater replaced areas where saltwater use to be thus pumping sgw simultaneously with brine injection fig 8b and e negates the effect caused by brine injection fig 8a and d and results in more stable fsi and the aquifer is being freshened in all our simulated injection scenarios with sgw pumping the brine plumes were smaller than the plumes in the injection only scenarios that is due to capturing some of the injected brine through sgw pumping with time fig 10 a shows the pumped water salinity with time for each scenario the scenario where the water salinity in the pumping well is rising the highest and most rapidly is where the injection occurs at the shoreline at a depth of 100 m which is shallower than the pumping well screen scenario 5 table 2 in this case the injected brine is flowing down and being withdrawn to the pumping well fig 9c moreover the pumped water salinity reaches a steady state value of 52 000 mg l 1 after about two years it is important to mention that for this high of salinity the ro desalination process needs to have elevated pressure to desalinate enough water and thus desalinating water with this salinity may not be cost efficient the scenarios that show the least impact on the aquifer and the pumping well salinity are the ones that the injection occurs 500 m offshore scenarios 6 and 8 table 2 in these cases the first two years show a reduced salinity trend in the pumping wells like the reference scenario of pumping sgw without brine injection after about two years the brine plume reaches the pumping well and after 20 years the water salinity reaches 42 000 mg l 1 dashed lines fig 10a these salinities will most likely be higher when using higher injection rates the effect of pumping sgw while injecting brine simultaneously at different distances on the pumped water salinity has also been studied in sand tanks and numerically nassar et al 2008 but the effect on the fsi movement was neglected in that study it was shown that as the spacing between the injection and pumping well grows there is less brine contamination of the pumping well furthermore they also indicated that for reaching even lower brine contamination in the pumping well the injection well should be deeper than the pumping well our results agree with their conclusions therefore a scenario where the injection point is deeper than the pumping depth and the injection is farther offshore may result in a more stable fsi with no or little brine contamination of the pumping well 3 5 3 brine injection with freshwater pumping four additional brine injection scenarios were simulated while simultaneously pumping freshwater at a similar rate of 5 mcmy scenarios 10 13 table 2 these scenarios were conducted to test the dynamics when freshwater is being pumped to supplement a seawater ro desalination plant while the desalinated brine is being injected into the subsurface fig 11 in these scenarios the fsi moves inland even farther compared with the scenarios of just brine injection this occurs because the brine injection elevates the pressure in the vicinity of the injection and freshwater pumping reduces the pressure inland which results in a higher pressure gradient and further inland displacement of the fsi the fsi response to freshwater pumping has been observed and studied showing that the fsi is being drawn to the freshwater pumping well creating upconing below the well and eventually salinizing the well houben and post 2017 jakovovic et al 2016 werner et al 2009 zhou et al 2005 the brine injection exacerbates the freshwater pumping effect as seen in ɸ the scenario with the highest impact injection depth of 180 m and distance of 0 m from shore scenario 10 table 2 shows a value of 1 26 fig 8c compared with 1 23 fig 8a of only injection scenario 1 table 2 and 1 09 of only freshwater pumping scenario 14 table 2 on the other hand the scenarios that show the highest freshwater loss after 20 years of brine injection were the scenarios with the farther injection distance from shore scenarios 11 and 13 table 2 showing freshwater loss of 3 75 million m3 500 m as the scenarios with the injection below the shore scenarios 10 and 12 table 2 show freshwater loss of only 3 1 million m3 fig 8f further examination of the scenarios where the injection is below the shoreline reveals that after an additional 7 years of injection 27 years of injection the freshwater loss value matches that of only freshwater pumping and continues to increase after 7 years when the injection is initially closer to the freshwater pumping well the fsi experiences rapid movement in the first few years and higher dispersion occurs which increases the mixing zone width after several years the freshwater that comes from recharge overcomes the brine plume and the freshwater pumping driving forces and decreases the mixing zone dispersion and therefore its width until equilibrium is reached thus a decrease in salinized areas in the aquifer is simulated as mentioned the salinity of water near the freshwater pumping well rises due to the upconing of the fsi fig 10b black line however because of the fsi movement landward due to brine injection the freshwater well is salinized to a greater extent 3100 mg l 1 compared to when only freshwater pumping is applied 2900 mg l 1 fig 10b the scenarios where the injection is below the shoreline x 0 fig 10b colored solid lines shows the highest increase in salinity in the pumping well in the first few years followed by a decrease in water salinity reaching the salinity level of the scenario with only freshwater pumping fig 10b black line further examination of these scenarios shows that if the wells would continue to inject and pump for additional 20 years the water salinity will eventually become higher than the salinity in the reference scenario of freshwater pumping only this rebound effect of the fsi response was also noticed in a numerical study while pumping sgw on the shore of almeria spain stein et al 2020 in that study the rebound effect was noticed in the sgd and saltwater inflow rate and more significantly when the pumping had stopped and the aquifer recovered back to a steady state 4 conclusions injection of desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer was studied through groundwater flow and solute transport numerical modeling the injection salinizes the coastal aquifer and the salinization extent is influenced by the injection rate and the injection location the simulations suggest that injection in shallower depths and farther offshore will have the smallest impact on the fresh groundwater body pumping sgw for desalination along with brine injection negates the negative influence caused by the brine plume propagation and results in stabilizing of the fsi in such cases the pumping well may be salinized with the brine to mitigate this phenomenon the injection well should be placed farther offshore and below the pumping well screen this practice should be considered by desalination plants and coastal hydrogeologists when considering subsurface injection as a disposal method if desalination plant managers consider injecting the ro brine it should be noted that the natural aquifer recovery and rehabilitation timeframe would be much longer than the injection time sensitivity analysis shows that hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate are the two dominant factors controlling the propagation of the plume and the recovery of the aquifer after injection stops measuring these parameters accurately is crucial for good prediction of the system response to brine injection it is important to note however that the model used for this study was simplified and in real scenarios the brine may have a different influence on the coastal aquifer due to heterogeneity and anisotropy of specific hydraulic parameters brine injection into the saline coastal aquifer is a means to reduce the environmental load on nearshore marine ecosystems the differences in fsi dynamics with different hydraulic parameter values indicate that brine injection should be modeled and examined for each site separately to determine proper management as results are highly influenced by hydraulic properties as this practice might be more expensive than surface discharge it will mitigate environmental

16510,seawater desalination specifically reverse osmosis ro has become an important water resource especially in arid and semi arid regions the desalination process generates a brine solution that is usually discharged to the nearshore environment negatively impacting the marine ecosystem a different method of disposing of the brine solution is needed to restore and maintain the marine environment one such method is injecting the desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer this study aims to investigate the hydrological and environmental impacts of such injection using groundwater flow and solute transport numerical models showing the fresh saline water interface fsi response at different injection rates depths and distances from shore moreover this study investigates the recovery evolution of the aquifer after injection stops we also analyze the hydrological response when pumping saline groundwater sgw for desalination or freshwater for water supply simultaneously with brine injection results show that brine injection creates a high salinity plume that pushes the fsi landward and salinizes the aquifer after 20 years of injecting 5 million m3 y 1 17 million m3 of freshwater are lost due to salt contamination it is also shown that by injecting further offshore and in shallower depths the impact on the fsi and the aquifer is reduced furthermore pumping sgw simultaneously with brine injection negates the brine plume effect on the fsi and results in a more stable interface it is noted that aquifer recovery is a long process and even after 100 years of recovery the aquifer is not fully rehabilitated this paper shows for the first time the hydrological implications of brine injection into the saline part of the coastal aquifer and demonstrates its potential utility for desalination plants in protecting the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords desalination brine injection coastal aquifers saline groundwater seawater intrusion 1 introduction freshwater resources worldwide are being depleted due to ongoing exploitation and contamination which is expected to worsen in the near future greve et al 2018 arid and semi arid regions will be the hardest impacted hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 reverse osmosis ro desalination is a key technology for coping with the water shortage however it holds negative environmental implications one severe negative environmental impact of seawater ro desalination is the production of hypersaline brine waste which is discharged to the nearshore environment the brine also known as concentrate or reject contains most of the dissolved solids of the feed water in concentrated form the desalination brine also includes chemicals used for water pretreatment and post treatment such as acids and bases enzymes antiscalants biocides and detergents mezher et al 2011 these chemicals are added to the process before brine disposal to the ocean and enhance the negative impact of the brine on the nearshore ecology jones et al 2019 estimated that globally there are 16 000 desalination plants that produce 95 million m3 d 1 of freshwater and 141 5 million m3 d 1 of brine the brine volume is higher than the produced water because some desalination facilities work with less than 50 recovery which produces more brine water relative to freshwater the majority of global brine production 70 3 is in the middle east and north africa with almost 100 million m3 d 1 jones et al 2019 for example in israel alone 625 million m3 y 1 of brine is discharged to the sea wood et al 2020 the environmental risk of the brine discharged to the ocean depends mainly on the density temperature and salinity of the brine solution most brines are denser than seawater so they create brine plumes on the seafloor in some places the brine is diluted with cooling water from adjacent power plants which results in warm saline and buoyant brine plumes that extend a few kilometers from the discharge zone missimer et al 2015 petersen et al 2018 maintaining this method of brine discharge to the ocean may result in detrimental effects on the nearshore ocean ecosystem the repercussions of brine discharge to the ocean on marine ecosystems and organisms are diverse zooplankton hatching patterns moscatello and belmonte 2004 and fish diversity and occurrence vega cendejas and hernández de santillana 2004 may decrease however another study showed that zooplankton diversity and abundance next to a brine discharge location is not impacted by the brine grossowicz et al 2021 brine discharge was shown to negatively affect benthic organisms invertebrates and seagrass hundreds of meters away from the seawater ro plant outfall begher nabavi et al 2013 gacia et al 2007 riera et al 2012 2011 while another study showed no effect on corals by brine discharge van der merwe et al 2014 other studies showed that brine harms benthic bacteria frank et al 2019 2017 petersen et al 2018 and foraminifera kenigsberg et al 2020 and damages food webs grossowicz et al 2020 however using a multiport diffuser system at the discharge point can control the extent and concentration of the salt plume amy et al 2017 while the scientific community is still collecting evidence on the environmental impacts of brine discharge to the ocean there is a strong need to find a creative solution to deal with the desalination brine waste with minimum environmental impact one plausible solution is to inject the brine into the saline groundwater sgw portion of a coastal aquifer there are two primary potential concerns with this strategy first the injected brine could make its way back to the ocean if it migrates out of the aquifer as submarine groundwater discharge sgd the second concern is seawater intrusion or inland movement of the interface between fresh and saline groundwater seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers is a well known and extensively studied phenomenon that can occur naturally or due to anthropogenic activities as sea level rises seawater intrusion shifts the fresh saline water interface fsi upward and landward person et al 2003 werner and simmons 2009 yechieli et al 2010 the fsi also moves daily in response to tidal effects ataie ashtiani et al 1999 seasonally in response to changes in groundwater levels andersen et al 2005 michael et al 2005 and also by ocean surge events paldor and michael 2021 however a major cause of seawater intrusion is extensive pumping of fresh groundwater from coastal aquifers houben and post 2017 jones et al 1999 zhou et al 2005 similarly injection of brine into the saline portion of the aquifer could cause seawater intrusion thereby posing a risk to already scarce freshwater resources in areas requiring ro desalination on the other hand pumping sgw from a coastal aquifer as feed for desalination shifts the fsi toward the well thus freshening and rehabilitating the aquifer in its vicinity stein et al 2020 2019 this sgw has been shown to be a better source for desalination stein et al 2021a b 2016 compared with seawater and such pumping can reduce sgd and harness the natural recharge water to freshen the aquifer stein et al 2020 however the hydrological implications of injecting the desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer are unknown either with or without concurrent extraction of sgw for ro feed water in this paper we evaluate the hydrological and environmental impacts of injecting desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer as this may be a more environmentally friendly solution than nearshore discharge we use 3d groundwater flow and solute transport numerical models to evaluate the dynamics of the coastal aquifer in response to brine injection at different locations depths and rates and while pumping sgw or freshwater this research presents the first insights on the hydrological implications of injecting the desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer on the fsi dynamics and freshwater availability 2 methods 2 1 numerical model a 3d phreatic coastal aquifer model was constructed to simulate the shape and location of the fsi at a steady state the model was then used to investigate the effect of injecting desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer the purpose of the modeling was to simulate the dynamics of the fsi under various brine injection scenarios at different rates depths and distances from shore along with simultaneous pumping of sgw for desalination or freshwater to supplement the water supply all models were developed using the feflow code diersch 2014 which employs a finite element solution of the coupled variable density flow and solute transport equations the 3d model was constructed with 15 vertical layers with dimensions of 30 8 0 2 km fig 1 wide enough so the brine plume drawdown cones would not reach the model boundary the mesh was comprised of 512 655 nodes and 898 842 triangular prisms elements fig s1 the model was constructed with homogeneous and anisotropic hydraulic properties table 1 a grid analysis was conducted to evaluate sensitivity to the grid size and the results and conclusions are in the supporting information the boundary conditions applied to the model are prescribed seawater head on the seafloor along with mass concentration boundary condition of 35 000 mg l 1 which is conditioned for inflow flux this saltwater boundary condition remains valid as long as the advective flux points into the model when there is an outflow flux the outflow concentration is calculated by the model this way sgd salinity can be calculated with the corresponding salinity the top boundary over the land has a recharge rate of 200 mm year 1 which represents a semi arid area stein et al 2019 the vertical side boundaries and the bottom boundary of the model are impervious the other initial parameters are shown in table 1 these parameters are representative of an alluvial coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 2 2 injection scenario and sensitivity analyses a systematic series of simulations were conducted to examine the environmental hydrological impact of brine injection into the saline coastal aquifer along with its fate after injection stops first brine injection into the saline part of the coastal aquifer was simulated below the shoreline x 0 m and at a depth of 180 m below sea level different injection rates 2 5 5 7 5 12 5 and 20 million cubic meters a year mcmy were simulated to mimic the different capacities of a desalination plant and its impact on the coastal aquifer next a set of simulations were performed where one injection well was placed at four different configurations based on two distances from shore 0 and 500 m and two depths 100 and 180 m while more than one well should be used in engineered injection facilities we use a single well for simplicity and the fact that well field should be designed to avoid pressure cone interference which is consistent with the model set up for each configuration 5 mcmy of brine was injected to simulate a small medium desalination plant in addition the same sets of scenarios were tested with sgw pumping simultaneously with double the rate of the injection 10 mcmy as it illustrates a desalination plant that uses the sgw as feed and works with a 50 recovery ratio moreover a different set of scenarios of pumping freshwater at 5 mcmy while injecting brine at the same rate were conducted to simulate the option of seawater ro desalination and the need to supplement the water system with fresh groundwater each scenario simulated 20 years of flow and transport to model a desalination plant with a life expectancy of 20 years table 2 shows a description of the scenarios tested in this study the sgw pumping well screen was placed 100 m inland at a depth of 130 150 m below sea level while the freshwater pumping well screen was placed 1000 m inland at a depth of 40 60 m below sea level the numerical mesh and the injection wells and pumping well locations can be seen in fig s1 the injected water had a salinity of 70 000 mg l 1 while seawater salinity was set at 35 000 mg l 1 the brine salinity is approximately double the salinity of the feed water when the plant operates with a 50 recovery ratio which is the common recovery for seawater ro desalination plants elimelech and phillip 2011 in addition in that recovery ratio the sgw pumping rate is 100 higher than the brine production rate further descriptive sensitivity analysis was carried out where hydraulic parameters were changed in the model and injection of brine was performed at 0 m distance from shore and a depth of 180 m below sea level the hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity specific storage recharge rate and anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity were changed separately and compared to the generic model table 3 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 stein et al 2019 in these simulations the injection rate was set to 5 mcmy and the results were compared quantitatively this sensitivity analysis allows us to better understand the impact of brine injection on coastal groundwater dynamics for systems with different aquifer characteristics additional simulations of the coastal aquifer recovery were carried out where the injection was stopped after 20 years and the system recovered for 100 years this test was done to learn about the dynamics of aquifer recovery and the time scale of it with different aquifer characteristics the model results were analyzed quantitatively comparing the different scenarios of injection a volumetric box was set as a domain of interest doi below the land side of the aquifer and with the model width and depth fig 1 the dissolved mass of salt in the doi box was compared among the different scenarios for each scenario the salinity ratio ɸ was calculated following eq 1 stein et al 2019 1 ϕ m t m 0 where mt is the mass of dissolved solids in the doi at any time and m0 is the initial mass of dissolved solids in the doi this salinity ratio ɸ quantitatively reflects the amount of aquifer salinization ɸ 1 or freshening ɸ 1 another parameter that was calculated and compared in this study is the freshwater loss to salt contamination 2 f r e s h w a t e r l o s s v t v 0 where vt is the volume of water in the aquifer that its salinity is higher than that of 5 seawater salinity 1750 mg l 1 and v0 is the abovementioned initial volume at a steady state this volume corresponds to the changes in the fsi location and geometry for illustrative explanations about these parameters see fig s2 in the supporting information combined these parameters characterize the salinity change in the coastal aquifer and the fsi dynamics in response to brine injection 3 results and discussion 3 1 fsi and flow dynamics with brine injection brine injection creates a high salinity high density plume that spreads vertically and laterally in all directions along the base of the aquifer the brine plume pushes the fsi upward and landward increasing the salinity of the aquifer see supplementary materials for a video demonstrating plume evolution in the environment fig 2 quantitatively shows the fsi dynamics during brine injection of 5 mcmy scenario 1 table 2 the salinity ratio ɸ which represents the change in salinity below the land side of the aquifer shows an increase i e salinization as long as injection continues and reaches a maximum value of 1 23 after 20 years of continuous injection furthermore the fresh groundwater body loses 1 7 107 m3 in 20 years due to the brine plume expansion and propagation the brine plume propagation inland causes a situation where a place in the aquifer that was fresh becomes salinized with seawater or with a mix of the seawater and the brine brine injection changes the hydrological balance of the coastal aquifer negatively impacting the fresh groundwater the flow dynamics in a steady state are characterized by saltwater inflow density driven circulation of saline water originating at the seafloor and discharging with the fsi along with freshwater flow towards the sea oz et al 2015 when desalination brine is injected into the saline part of the coastal aquifer the flow patterns change dramatically fig 3 shows the flow velocity vectors at a steady state before injection fig 3a and after 20 years of brine injection fig 3b the velocity vectors near the injection point flow in all directions with the highest velocity compared to different areas in the model furthermore the flow velocity within the brine plume is higher relative to the flow on the offshore side fig 3b that is probably due to the proximity to the injection point and the higher density in the plume zone compared with seawater density that creates density driven flow brine injection pushes the sgw in all directions creating flow towards the seafloor along the seafloor where saltwater inflow occurs during steady state the flow reverses and saline sgd occurs during the injection in a steady state the saltwater inflow area stretches a few kilometers offshore while with brine injection the saltwater inflow area decreases and stretches only 1 km offshore red lines fig 3a and b the saltwater inflow rate and the sgd rate were evaluated with time during brine injection fig 4 as the injection starts the total sgd flux increases while the saltwater inflow rate decreases a rebound effect of the saltwater inflow rate and the sgd rate occurs where a small decrease and increase are noticed for the total sgd flux and the saltwater inflow rate respectively in the first few years of brine injection fig 4 this effect occurs due to hydraulic head wave propagation that the brine injection creates close to shore the hydraulic head rises below the seafloor when injection starts which creates a head gradient towards the seafloor and increases sgd next the hydraulic head drops close to shore which reverses the flow and increases saltwater inflow later the hydraulic head wave reaches farther offshore which increases sgd a figure illustrating this analysis and the hydraulic head wave propagation is in the supporting information fig s22 after 10 years the total sgd flux increases to 44 4 mcmy from its initial value of 42 mcmy and the saltwater inflow rate decreases to 7 45 mcmy from its initial value of 10 1 mcmy it is worth mentioning that the salinity of the sgd has not increased during the injection which means that the excess sgd originated in seawater and not in the injected brine saltwater inflow and sgd rates also change rapidly during the pumping of sgw stein et al 2020 showed that near a desalination plant in almeria spain that pumps sgw as feed for the ro process the sgd rate decreased and the saltwater inflow increased when pumping had started this opposite trend of sgd and saltwater inflow rate between pumping of sgw and brine injection into the saline part of the coastal aquifer is created because the pumping of sgw creates a pressure deficit and the injection creates pressure increase therefore injecting brine while pumping sgw for desalination may balance these changes in the aquifer and could result in more stable water flow dynamics 3 2 recovery after brine injection after simulating brine injection for 20 years we simulated aquifer recovery no injection for an additional 100 years fig 2 this was done to understand system dynamics with the assumption that injection will not operate indefinitely after injection stops the salinity ratio decreases fig 2a approximated by ɸ where the recovery rate is decreased with time after 100 years of recovery the salinity ratio reaches a value of 1 02 fig 2a suggesting an incomplete recovery of the aquifer a previous study showed that recovery from sgw pumping for 12 years would take only 20 years to reach ɸ ratio of 1 stein et al 2020 however in that study the aquifer recovered just from sgw pumping and in the current study the aquifer recovers from an injection of unnatural hypersaline brine for a longer period 20 years the freshwater loss parameter is consistent with the movement of the fsi as an increase in freshwater loss indicates fsi movement landward and a decrease in freshwater loss indicates fsi movement seaward when injection stops the fsi continues to propagate landward for the next 5 years and freshwater is being contaminated by saline water fig 2b and video 2 in the supporting information that is due to the higher density brine in the vicinity of the fsi which creates density driven flow towards the freshwater body then the fsi moves seawards and the aquifer is being rehabilitated this movement only occurs when the plume is diluted enough with seawater and the freshwater driving force overcomes the density driven flow landward aquifer recovery occurs much more slowly than salinization during injection even 100 years of recovery is not enough to fully recover to pre injection conditions the groundwater flow patterns in the coastal aquifer changed dramatically with brine injection and after injection stops the flow field slowly recovers toward pre injection conditions the total sgd flux decreases immediately after injection stops and reaches a steady state value after 30 years of recovery fig 4a additionally the saltwater inflow rate increases in response to injection stop while it reaches a higher rate than it was in steady state fig 4b similar to the total sgd flux the saltwater inflow rate reaches a steady state rate after 30 years of recovery fig 4b the flow around the remaining plume is still irregular and the flow field does not go back to a steady state after 100 years of recovery fig 3d the saltwater inflow zone however does grow with recovery time but does not reach its steady state value after 100 years of recovery a video showing the salinity distribution of the aquifer during recovery for 100 years is provided in the supporting materials 3 3 aquifer response to different injection rates a series of simulations were conducted to examine the fsi response to different desalination brine injection rates 2 5 20 mcmy scenarios 1 and 15 18 in table 2 into the saline part of the coastal aquifer fig 5 these scenarios simulate different plant capacities from 5 to 40 mcmy assuming 50 recovery of the ro process our modeling results show that as the injection rate increases its influence on the fsi increases as well at relatively low injection rates the plume shape and distribution are approximately symmetrical as the injection rate increases the plume becomes asymmetrical stretches further offshore and conforms to the shape of the fsi surface on the fsi side fig 5 fig 6 quantitatively shows the aquifer response to different brine injection rates the groundwater salinity below the land increases as the injection rate increases due to the landward movement of the fsi and because hypersaline brine intrudes to this area the ɸ ratio increases from 1 13 with the lower injection rate 2 5 mcmy scenario 15 to 1 75 with the higher rate 20 mcmy scenario 18 this phenomenon of increased salinity due to a higher injection rate was also studied and showed in a recent study along the nile delta abd elaty et al 2021 the amount of freshwater loss increases linearly as the injection rate increases a linear regression of the freshwater loss data shows that for every 1 mcmy of brine injection 6 million m3 of freshwater is contaminated in the aquifer after 20 years of injection fig 6b injection rate as can be seen is a major parameter that influences the coastal aquifer hydrological dynamics and is a great contributor to fsi migration landward large desalination plants that produce vast amounts of brine for subsurface injection would have to consider different injection approaches such as injection location rates durations and volumes different approaches may include injecting far offshore which results in a lower effect on the fsi and aquifer salinization these scenarios were tested in this study and are presented below 3 4 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the dominant factors affecting the fsi and the aquifer dynamics due to brine injection hydraulic parameters values were changed from the reference model and the model was run for 20 years with brine injection table 3 the parameter with the greatest influence on the salinity distribution ɸ is the hydraulic conductivity this is largely because different conductivities result in different initial locations of the fsi which then results in changes to the fsi dynamics during the injection the only scenario where injected brine rose and seeped out through the seabed was when the hydraulic conductivity was low 10 m d 1 this happens due to the difficulty of the brine to flow landward because of the proximity of the injection point to the fresh groundwater body which pushes the fsi seaward due to its driving force therefore the brine plume propagates more offshore and upwards towards the seafloor the salinity distribution plume dimensions and fsi visualization after 20 years of injection can be seen in the supporting information another parameter that greatly influences the fsi dynamics is the freshwater recharge rate lower recharge rates result in a lower driving force of the fresh groundwater flow which results in greater brine plume intrusion below the landside of the aquifer the result of the lower recharge rate is shown by the most freshwater loss compared with the other scenarios table 3 hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate have been previously shown to be the most influential parameters at natural conditions during freshwater pumping zeng et al 2018 and during sgw pumping from the coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 2019 our current work extends this by showing similar responses over different time scales in systems with active brine injection these parameters are shown to be the most influential parameters also in the recovery stage after injection cessation for example with a low recharge rate 100 mm year 1 and constant hydraulic conductivity k 60 m d 1 ɸ and the freshwater loss increase through the 100 years of simulated recovery fig s9 furthermore for low hydraulic conductivity 10 m d 1 and constant recharge rate 200 mm year 1 ɸ and the freshwater loss are maximum at the end of 20 years of injection and decrease rapidly during recovery with higher hydraulic conductivities k 60 or 120 m d 1 and constant recharge rate 200 mm year 1 ɸ ratio is highest at the end of injection followed by a decrease however freshwater loss continues to increase after injection cessation and only after 10 20 years the freshwater loss begins to decrease we interpret that this recovery behavior is controlled by the plume shape size and proximity to the fsi at the end of the injection period the plume geometry is influenced by the hydraulic parameters injection rate and injection location which demonstrates the complex feedback in this coastal system 3 5 brine injection location optimization 3 5 1 injection scenarios a series of brine injection scenarios were performed at different depths 100 and 180 m and distances from shore 0 and 500 m to evaluate the impact of each scenario on the coastal aquifer and to understand the optimization of injection location scenarios 1 4 table 2 all these scenarios were run with an injection rate of 5 mcmy for 20 years fig 7 shows the salinity distribution in the coastal aquifer for each scenario map views of the brine plume and the fsi surface can be seen in the supporting information the extent of the aquifer salinization for each scenario was quantified fig 8 the scenario with the most impact on the coastal aquifer was the injection at 180 m depth and 0 m from shore scenario 1 table 2 in this scenario ɸ after 20 years of injection was 1 23 fig 8a and 17 million m3 of freshwater was contaminated with seawater fig 8d on the other hand the scenario with a shallower injection depth 100 m and a farther distance from shore 500 m offshore scenario 4 table 2 had the least influence on the fsi and the salinity distribution in the aquifer red dashed lines at fig 8a and d this happens due to the tendency of the brine to flow downward due to its higher density which results in occupying a larger vertical area and reducing the lateral propagation of the plume fig 7b and c in that scenario ɸ was 1 11 and only 8 million m3 of freshwater was salinized after 20 years of injection the parameter with the largest impact on the fsi is the injection distance from shore this phenomenon was also found in pumping out of sgw where pumping had a greater impact on the aquifer while applying it closer to shore stein et al 2019 it is therefore recommended to inject the desalination brine farther away offshore to have the smallest impact on the freshwater portion of the coastal aquifer injection onshore would be a cheaper decision than injecting offshore however injecting offshore does not have to be on an expensive sea platform it rather can be performed by using angled slanted wells and thus the operation of the well is onshore which reduces costs these kinds of wells were offered for pumping sgw for desalination below the ocean missimer et al 2013 it is important to mention that even if the operation of the well is onshore it will elevate the cost of the entire process as discharging the brine to the ocean is less costly than operating a well field of injection wells the price of well injection has been estimated to be ten times higher than surface discharge greenlee et al 2009 however when a diffuser system is being used for surface discharge this cost ratio may be lower due to the costly construction and maintenance of a diffuser system voutchkov 2011 nonetheless the exact increase in cost would change from site to site depending on the specific geology and brine production capacity 3 5 2 brine injection with sgw pumping to further our understanding of the system dynamics we conducted four brine injection scenarios while simultaneously pumping out sgw at double the rate of the injection 10 mcmy scenarios 5 8 table 2 these scenarios address the situation where sgw is being pumped for desalination and the resulting brine is injected back into the subsurface sgw has been shown to be a better source for desalination which can reduce the operational costs compared with seawater desalination missimer et al 2013 stein et al 2021a b 2016 fig 9 shows the salinity distribution of the different brine injection scenarios with pumping sgw in these cases the salinity distribution is different and the impact is less than in the cases of only brine injection sgw pumping shifts the fsi location towards the pumping well seawards due to the creation of a pressure deficit while the injected brine pushes the fsi landward due to pressure increase and therefore the fsi is more stable this phenomenon of fsi movement towards the sgw pumping well is consistent with previous studies using lab and field experiments shi et al 2011 stein et al 2019 and numerical models pool and carrera 2009 stein et al 2020 2019 and was observed near desalination plants that use sgw as feed otero et al 2011 stein et al 2020 the scenario that had the most impact on the fsi is where the injection depth was 180 m and the distance from shore was 0 m the salinity ratio of this scenario is 1 02 lower compared with the 1 23 value of the injection only scenario meaning almost no salinization occurred fig 8b the freshwater loss parameter shows negative values for all simulated scenarios documenting that freshwater replaced areas where saltwater use to be thus pumping sgw simultaneously with brine injection fig 8b and e negates the effect caused by brine injection fig 8a and d and results in more stable fsi and the aquifer is being freshened in all our simulated injection scenarios with sgw pumping the brine plumes were smaller than the plumes in the injection only scenarios that is due to capturing some of the injected brine through sgw pumping with time fig 10 a shows the pumped water salinity with time for each scenario the scenario where the water salinity in the pumping well is rising the highest and most rapidly is where the injection occurs at the shoreline at a depth of 100 m which is shallower than the pumping well screen scenario 5 table 2 in this case the injected brine is flowing down and being withdrawn to the pumping well fig 9c moreover the pumped water salinity reaches a steady state value of 52 000 mg l 1 after about two years it is important to mention that for this high of salinity the ro desalination process needs to have elevated pressure to desalinate enough water and thus desalinating water with this salinity may not be cost efficient the scenarios that show the least impact on the aquifer and the pumping well salinity are the ones that the injection occurs 500 m offshore scenarios 6 and 8 table 2 in these cases the first two years show a reduced salinity trend in the pumping wells like the reference scenario of pumping sgw without brine injection after about two years the brine plume reaches the pumping well and after 20 years the water salinity reaches 42 000 mg l 1 dashed lines fig 10a these salinities will most likely be higher when using higher injection rates the effect of pumping sgw while injecting brine simultaneously at different distances on the pumped water salinity has also been studied in sand tanks and numerically nassar et al 2008 but the effect on the fsi movement was neglected in that study it was shown that as the spacing between the injection and pumping well grows there is less brine contamination of the pumping well furthermore they also indicated that for reaching even lower brine contamination in the pumping well the injection well should be deeper than the pumping well our results agree with their conclusions therefore a scenario where the injection point is deeper than the pumping depth and the injection is farther offshore may result in a more stable fsi with no or little brine contamination of the pumping well 3 5 3 brine injection with freshwater pumping four additional brine injection scenarios were simulated while simultaneously pumping freshwater at a similar rate of 5 mcmy scenarios 10 13 table 2 these scenarios were conducted to test the dynamics when freshwater is being pumped to supplement a seawater ro desalination plant while the desalinated brine is being injected into the subsurface fig 11 in these scenarios the fsi moves inland even farther compared with the scenarios of just brine injection this occurs because the brine injection elevates the pressure in the vicinity of the injection and freshwater pumping reduces the pressure inland which results in a higher pressure gradient and further inland displacement of the fsi the fsi response to freshwater pumping has been observed and studied showing that the fsi is being drawn to the freshwater pumping well creating upconing below the well and eventually salinizing the well houben and post 2017 jakovovic et al 2016 werner et al 2009 zhou et al 2005 the brine injection exacerbates the freshwater pumping effect as seen in ɸ the scenario with the highest impact injection depth of 180 m and distance of 0 m from shore scenario 10 table 2 shows a value of 1 26 fig 8c compared with 1 23 fig 8a of only injection scenario 1 table 2 and 1 09 of only freshwater pumping scenario 14 table 2 on the other hand the scenarios that show the highest freshwater loss after 20 years of brine injection were the scenarios with the farther injection distance from shore scenarios 11 and 13 table 2 showing freshwater loss of 3 75 million m3 500 m as the scenarios with the injection below the shore scenarios 10 and 12 table 2 show freshwater loss of only 3 1 million m3 fig 8f further examination of the scenarios where the injection is below the shoreline reveals that after an additional 7 years of injection 27 years of injection the freshwater loss value matches that of only freshwater pumping and continues to increase after 7 years when the injection is initially closer to the freshwater pumping well the fsi experiences rapid movement in the first few years and higher dispersion occurs which increases the mixing zone width after several years the freshwater that comes from recharge overcomes the brine plume and the freshwater pumping driving forces and decreases the mixing zone dispersion and therefore its width until equilibrium is reached thus a decrease in salinized areas in the aquifer is simulated as mentioned the salinity of water near the freshwater pumping well rises due to the upconing of the fsi fig 10b black line however because of the fsi movement landward due to brine injection the freshwater well is salinized to a greater extent 3100 mg l 1 compared to when only freshwater pumping is applied 2900 mg l 1 fig 10b the scenarios where the injection is below the shoreline x 0 fig 10b colored solid lines shows the highest increase in salinity in the pumping well in the first few years followed by a decrease in water salinity reaching the salinity level of the scenario with only freshwater pumping fig 10b black line further examination of these scenarios shows that if the wells would continue to inject and pump for additional 20 years the water salinity will eventually become higher than the salinity in the reference scenario of freshwater pumping only this rebound effect of the fsi response was also noticed in a numerical study while pumping sgw on the shore of almeria spain stein et al 2020 in that study the rebound effect was noticed in the sgd and saltwater inflow rate and more significantly when the pumping had stopped and the aquifer recovered back to a steady state 4 conclusions injection of desalination brine into the saline part of the coastal aquifer was studied through groundwater flow and solute transport numerical modeling the injection salinizes the coastal aquifer and the salinization extent is influenced by the injection rate and the injection location the simulations suggest that injection in shallower depths and farther offshore will have the smallest impact on the fresh groundwater body pumping sgw for desalination along with brine injection negates the negative influence caused by the brine plume propagation and results in stabilizing of the fsi in such cases the pumping well may be salinized with the brine to mitigate this phenomenon the injection well should be placed farther offshore and below the pumping well screen this practice should be considered by desalination plants and coastal hydrogeologists when considering subsurface injection as a disposal method if desalination plant managers consider injecting the ro brine it should be noted that the natural aquifer recovery and rehabilitation timeframe would be much longer than the injection time sensitivity analysis shows that hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate are the two dominant factors controlling the propagation of the plume and the recovery of the aquifer after injection stops measuring these parameters accurately is crucial for good prediction of the system response to brine injection it is important to note however that the model used for this study was simplified and in real scenarios the brine may have a different influence on the coastal aquifer due to heterogeneity and anisotropy of specific hydraulic parameters brine injection into the saline coastal aquifer is a means to reduce the environmental load on nearshore marine ecosystems the differences in fsi dynamics with different hydraulic parameter values indicate that brine injection should be modeled and examined for each site separately to determine proper management as results are highly influenced by hydraulic properties as this practice might be more expensive than surface discharge it will mitigate environmental degradation and may also save in future restoration of the nearshore marine eco system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16511,coral reefs one of the most productive ecosystems have been dramatically declining in recent decades while studies contend a prominent correlation between coral reef degradation and increased anthropogenic nitrogen n loads a quantitative description of the n sources and cycling processes in these ecologically important ecosystems is lacking through a comprehensive depiction of the δ15n compositions of seawaters and sediments we systematically accessed the n cycling processes in the weizhou coral reef ecosystem the correlations between the nitrate no3 concentrations and isotopic compositions δ15n δ18o no3 indicated the pelagic no3 loads were largely regulated by mixing between precipitation and sewage biological no3 turnover processes appeared to be weak in the sediments n2 fixation contributed about one third of the sedimentary organic n with the rest coming from the settlement of pelagic organic n we also uncovered significant sedimentary mineralization nitrification denitrification processes in which the n loss was greater than the input while pelagic n significantly contributed to the sedimentary n the n export from the sediments to surface seawater was potentially short circuited by the high n retention and recycling efficiencies of the organisms in the coral reef ecosystem overall this study shows that the complex n cycling processes in the ecosystem are effectively reflected in the isotopic compositions of seawater and sediment thus adding an important dimension to understanding the n cycling in coral reef ecosystems graphical abstract

shallow coral reefs support a major fraction of the total marine benthic n2 fixation on a global scale cardini et al 2014 the n cycling in turn can generate significant impacts on coral reef ecosystems for many coral reefs around the world human altered n cycling has often been cited as a primary cause of the dramatic decline in coral cover in recent decades duprey et al 2016 hughes et al 2017 lachs et al 2019 decarlo et al 2020 accordingly understanding the n cycling in coral reefs is fundamental not only for a comprehensive understanding of the marine n cycling but also for the effective management of these important ecosystems however due to the complexity of n cycling processes and their driving mechanisms understanding the n cycling in coral reef ecosystems is challenging at best except for n2 fixation our current knowledge on coral related n cycling processes relies largely on genetic and genomic studies glaze et al 2021 what has been lacking from previous studies is a quantitative description of the n sources transportations and transformations in coral reef ecosystems lamb wozniak 2007 duprey et al 2016 which undermines regional and global coral recovery efforts the isotopic compositions of n species are effective in tracing n cycling in aquatic ecosystems archana et al 2018 jiang et al 2020a 2021 first as different n sources generally have distinct isotopic signatures isotopic compositions are indicative of the n sources xue et al 2009 second biological n turnover processes e g nitrification assimilation and denitrification generate predictable isotopic signals which is known as fractionation kendall et al 2007 casciotti 2016 we hypothesized that the isotopic composition of n species in the seawater and sediments could be used as an indicator to explore n cycling processes in coral reef ecosystems however few studies have performed such an exploration in this study we conducted an isotopic survey of the weizhou island coral reef ecosystem which is suffering from severe anthropogenic disturbances we measured the isotopic compositions of the seawater pore water sedimentary organic n son and suspended particulate organic n pon collected from the region as a way of constraining the n sources we also measured the isotopic compositions of the local sewage groundwater and precipitation conventional coral reef monitoring data e g nutrient concentrations and bleaching rates were also obtained key questions addressed in this study were 1 what are the spatial distribution patterns of n in the coral reef ecosystem 2 what are the primary n sources and cycling processes in the ecosystem under severe anthropogenic disturbance we believed the isotopic compositions could shed some light on the complex n cycling processes in the coral reef ecosystem and provide implications for the restoration of coral reefs 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural and anthropogenic settings of the weizhou coral reef ecosystem weizhou island is located in the northern beibu gulf of the south china sea fig 1 a the inshore surface seawater has a temperature range of 19 0 30 4 c annual mean 24 6 c a ph of 8 0 8 2 an annual average salinity of 31 9 and a transparency of 3 0 10 0 m chen et al 2013 yu et al 2019 such natural settings provide an ideal habitat for coral growth over the past few decades the island has undergone societal shifts from a fisheries based economy to today s tourism dominated industry along with a dramatic degradation in the coral reefs studies have shown that the average live coral cover declined from 69 to 6 from 1990 to 2015 xu et al 2020 which is likely related to n enrichment and global warming yu et al 2019 agricultural practices and significant overland runoff e g rivers are absent on the island the potential n sources are precipitation sewage that is discharged directly into the coastal seawater via the beach or effluent released in pipes field observations to date the extent to which the different sources have contributed to the n loads remains unknown 2 2 field sampling the field sampling was performed in july 2020 a total of 39 surface seawater samples fig 1b were collected from the upper 1 m of the water column using 20 l polyethylene bottles at each station the coordinates were recorded by gps rino 650 garmin water quality parameters i e salinity ph water temperature dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations were recorded in situ using pre calibrated probes ysi exo3 the samples were immediately filtered through 0 7 μm pre combusted glass fiber membrane filters gf f whatman using a vacuum pump the filtered seawater samples were collected in glass bottles for the ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 and δ15n δ18o no3 analyses while the membranes containing suspended particulate matters were used for the δ15n pon analyses meanwhile surface sediments 0 to 20 cm were collected in polythene bags by scuba diving at 10 inshore stations around the island fig 1b approximately 5 kg of sediment was collected at each site with a shovel and placed in polyethylene bags porewater was collected from the sediment using rhizon samplers connected to a 50 ml syringe via 5 mm polyethylene tubing robertson and savage 2018 each sample was filtered by connecting the syringe to a glass fiber membrane filter head the filtered seawaters membranes pore waters and sediment samples were transported to the laboratory in darkness in a refrigerated box and stored at 20 c until further treatment potential end member samples i e precipitation groundwater and domestic sewage were collected to evaluate their contributions to the n pool in the seawater the sampling locations for each source are shown in fig 1b groundwater samples n 3 were collected from local artificial wells on weizhou island precipitation samples during the wet season n 10 were collected from nearby qinzhou city fig 1a during july 2019 to june 2020 using a measuring cylinder domestic sewage samples n 2 were collected from the visible sewage outlets on the island these waters were also filtered with a 50 ml syringe and frozen at 20 c in darkness until further analysis 2 3 analytical procedures the nh4 no3 and po4 3 concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using a continuous flow analyzer with uncertainties of 0 2 μmol l 1 apha 2005 the δ15n δ18o no3 compositions in the water samples were obtained through the complete reduction of no3 to nitrous oxide n2o by denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas aureofaciens and the subsequent measurement of its δ15n and δ18o with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo delta v plus weigand et al 2016 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric air air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively kendall et al 2007 standards usgs 32 34 and 35 were used to correct the data the analytical uncertainties were 0 3 the suspended particulate matters were carefully scraped from the membranes solid samples i e suspended particles and sediments were rinsed with millipore water lyophilized ground and passed through a 150 μm sieve the powdered samples were placed in 5 5 mm silver cups and introduced into an element analyzer coupled to an irms to determine the δ15n pon and δ15n son compositions jiang et al 2020a the isotopic data were reported relative to air standards usgs 32 and 34 were used to correct the data the analytical uncertainties were 0 4 for the δ15n 2 4 statistical analyses analysis of variance anova was performed to analyze differences in nutrient concentrations relationships among considered variables were analyzed using pearson correlation statistical analyses were carried out with the software spss 20 0 for windows 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of n pollution in the coral reef ecosystem water quality parameters and nutrient concentrations in the surface seawater and sedimentary pore water samples are tabulated in table s1 in the supplementary information the spatial distributions of chl a no3 and nh4 in the surface seawater are shown in fig 2 a c the chl a ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 μg l 1 with high values observed in the nearshore regions fig 2a the no3 and nh4 showed comparable concentrations ranging from 2 3 to 48 3 mean 9 9 μmol l 1 and from 0 5 to 67 0 mean 7 1 μmol l 1 respectively high no3 and nh4 concentrations on the southern shore are consistent with the concentrated distribution of residents on the southern island fig 2b c possibly reflecting the impact of anthropogenic sewage on the n loads the weizhou island coral reef ecosystem appeared to have no3 and nh4 concentrations much higher than other coral reef ecosystems such as those in the great barrier reef erler et al 2020 bahia costa et al 2008 and florida keys lamb wozniak 2007 thurber et al 2014 indicating significant anthropogenic disturbance the n values no3 16 po4 3 2 9 in μmol l 1 were calculated to evaluate deviations from the redfield ratio deutsch et al 2007 an obvious n spatial pattern was observed for the surface seawaters 18 of the 39 samples had negative n values n limited condition with most distributed in the nearshore region suggesting anthropogenic activities on the island may contribute more po4 3 relative to no3 to the sea the n values gradually became positive offshore n excess condition suggesting the existence of no3 input e g precipitation or generation nitrification i e oxidation of nh4 from pon mineralization and external inputs to no3 nh4 dominated the inorganic n species in the pore waters ranging from 23 9 to 70 3 mean 40 5 μmol l 1 which were much higher than the in the surface seawater anova p 0 01 the no3 concentrations showed high variability in the pore water ranging from 3 1 to 45 4 mean 15 2 μmol l 1 a notable feature of the pore waters was the significantly enriched po4 3 mean 58 8 μmol l 1 the extremely negative n suggested a n limited condition which may be associated with n removal e g denitrification or assimilation in the sediments these speculations need more evidence to confirm see discussions below 3 2 isotopic compositions of the surface seawater and pelagic n cycling the δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n pon compositions of the seawaters are also tabulated in table s1 the spatial variation of the isotopic values for the surface seawaters is shown in fig 2d f the δ15n no3 values were high in the nearshore region suggesting more contributions from 15n enriched anthropogenic sources e g sewage fig 2d the δ15n no3 gradually decreased moving offshore fig 2d while the δ18o no3 had the opposite pattern with low values observed for the nearshore region fig 2e the δ15n pon values were generally higher in the offshore region fig 2f classic keeling plots δ15n δ18o versus 1 no3 were used to identify n cycling processes in the seawater kendall et al 2007 conservative mixing between two major no3 sources yields a linear correlation between δ15n δ18o no3 and 1 no3 on a keeling plot whereas biological no3 removal processes i e bacterial denitrification reduction of no3 to n2 or algal assimilation produces a curved correlation furthermore no3 removal can be identified by either a negative linear relationship between δ15n δ18o no3 and ln no3 mariotti et al 1981 or a 1 1 co enrichment in the dual isotopes kendall et al 2007 the keeling plots for the surface seawaters are shown in fig 3 we observed significant linear correlations between δ15n δ18o no3 and 1 no3 which is characteristic of conservative mixing between two endmembers meanwhile instead of a co enrichment a roughly negative relationship was found between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 fig 4 these results suggest that pelagic assimilation or denitrification was likely minor the oxic conditions in the surface seawater dissolved oxygen 5 3 7 3 mg l 1 did not favor denitrification the weak assimilation signal was potentially attributed to the oligotrophic condition of the water column while previous studies have suggested pelagic nitrification could be significant in some human impacted coastal regions archana et al 2018 jiang et al 2020a 2021 nitrification in the seawater column should be minor in a closed system nitrification can cause a decrease in nh4 and a simultaneous increase in no3 note that we observed a significant positive relationship between no3 and nh4 which ruled out nitrification but implied common sources for the two n species the lack of a relationship between δ15n no3 and δ15n pon r2 0 07 p 0 5 also pointed to a minor role for coupled mineralization nitrification jiang et al 2020b overall the pelagic n transformation processes i e n2 fixation denitrification assimilation mineralization and nitrification were shown to be insignificant and the n loads in the water column were largely regulated by conservative mixing between two endmembers the y intercept of the regression line in fig 3a is 13 2 while that in fig 3b is 2 1 indicating that one major no3 source should have high δ15n no3 but low δ18o no3 values while the other source would have the opposite pattern wong et al 2018 as sewage was an endmember with a δ15n composition 10 xue et al 2009 we consider it likely that sewage was the first dominant no3 source coral could also be the first endmember as it may release considerable amounts of dissolved and particulate organic matter into the water column which would undergo mineralization nitrification in the seawater and contribute to the pelagic no3 pool wild et al 2004a 2004b lamb wozniak 2007 however the high δ15n no3 and low δ18o no3 values were distributed on the southern coast where human activities are intense rather than in the areas where coral reefs are widespread fig 1 and fig 2d e implying sewage was indeed the major no3 source precipitation was most plausibly the δ15n depleted but δ18o enriched source as its role in contributing oceanic no3 is well documented duce et al 2008 ren et al 2017 the no3 sources were quantified by a two endmember mixing model jiang et al 2020a the endmembers for the precipitation and sewage are given in table 1 we estimated that 13 8 71 4 mean sd 49 6 16 8 of the no3 is from precipitation and that the remainder mean sd 50 4 16 8 is from sewage note that the estimation might generate uncertainties as there are only 2 sewage end member samples it is not unexpected that the southern inshore regions receive more sewage input for the first time the significant contribution of anthropogenic activities to the no3 pool in the seawater of a coral reef ecosystem has been quantified we observed a significant positive correlation between the coral bleaching rate table s3 and the proportional contributions of sewage or δ15n no3 r2 0 81 p 0 1 fig s1 given the correlation was not significantly confounded by different levels of heat stress at the small ecosystem scale water depth generally less than 5 m fig 1 we suspect sewage induced no3 enrichments might be pivotal to coral bleaching wooldridge et al 2017 donovan et al 2020 decarlo et al 2020 first high no3 may lead to denser symbiont populations and the transfer of less c to the coral host reducing coral net primary production cunning and baker 2012 vega thurber et al 2014 burkepile et al 2020 second high no3 may induce phosphorus p starvation in algal symbionts which would alter the composition of algal photosynthetic membranes damaging the photosystem ii and increasing production of reactive oxygen species in algal symbionts wooldridge 2013 the above mechanisms can result in the loss of algal symbionts and coral bleaching which have been well documented in previous studies e g wiedenmann et al 2013 shantz and burkepile 2014 wang et al 2018 although previous studies suggest no3 exposure determines whether corals bleach they claim the effect on the bleaching rate may be small burkepile et al 2020 yet our results indicate that the severity of bleaching is also likely strongly correlated with no3 exposure 3 3 isotopic compositions of the sediments and sedimentary n cycling the isotopic compositions of sedimentary organic n δ15n son and the no3 in sedimentary pore water δ15n pwn are shown in table s2 the spatial variation in the isotopic values of the nearshore sediments is shown in fig s2 there was a significant positive correlation between δ15n son and δ15n pon r2 0 40 p 0 05 fig 5 a indicating that the deposition of pon was indeed a major source of son while n assimilation by phytoplankton in the surface seawater was difficult to identify against a dominant role of conservative mixing the abundance of phytoplankton is thought to have increased due to anthropogenic nutrient inputs the high chl a in the nearshore region supports this point fig 2a phytoplankton in the seawater eventually settle and become incorporated as a part of the son in addition coral mucus efficiently traps particulate organic matter in the seawater and carries it to the sediment huettel et al 2006 wild et al 2004a note that the δ15n son values were much lower than the δ15n pon values of the overlying seawater fig 5a we postulated that this deviation from the 1 1 line in fig 5a is consistent with a n2 fixation source benthic n2 fixation is increasingly regarded as a major source of n in reef environments rao and charette 2012 cardini et al 2014 generating organic n with a δ15n value close to 1 0 casciotti 2016 a supply of n to the ecosystem via n2 fixation would allow for the enrichment of 14n explaining the depleted δ15n son signature based on the isotopic mass balance it is estimated that n2 fixation and the deposition of pon contributed 32 5 0 and 68 5 0 of the son respectively the isotopic approach used in this study quantitively highlights the principal role of persistent n2 fixation on the n supply in the coral reef ecosystem supporting previous studies hypothesizing an important role for n2 fixation based on discrepancies between n inputs and exports webb et al 1975 smith 1984 the higher proportional contributions of n2 fixation inputs were recorded for the southern shore region implying anthropogenic sewage might promote n2 fixation el khaled et al 2020 sewage induced high dissolved n and p levels might stimulate diazotroph proliferation thereby increasing n2 fixation activity in the holobiont cardini et al 2014 in addition we suspect that sewage induced nutrient enrichment has increased denitrification and caused the current n limitation and high p availability in the sediments table s2 which could allow for diazotrophic microorganisms to proliferate and stimulate n2 fixation howarth and marino 2006 cardini et al 2014 erler et al 2020 it has been well documented that n2 fixation dramatically increased in the great barrier reef bell et al 1999 and red sea reef el khaled et al 2021 as a result of increased terrestrial nutrient flux a positive correlation was found between the δ15n son and δ15n pwn values fig 5b indicating the occurrence of coupled mineralization nitrification jiang et al 2020b capone et al 1992 also suggested that nitrification was a quantitatively important component in the sedimentary n cycling of the great barrier reef in addition denitrification has been well documented to be a major loss pathway for n in coral reefs erler et al 2020 the occurrence of denitrification is supported by the nutrient concentrations and isotopic data for the sediments due to the isotopic discrimination effect of organisms biological no3 removal enriches residual pools of no3 with heavier δ15n and δ18o at the same time no3 removal can decrease the no3 po4 3 ratio because po4 3 is not lost through denitrification paerl 2018 in this region the pore water showed more enriched isotope values and lower no3 po4 3 ratios than the overlying seawaters fig 6 clearly validating our speculation that denitrification was a prevailing factor in the sediments the significant linear relationship between the dual isotopes and the logarithm of the no3 po4 3 fig 6 is consistent with rayleigh isotope fractionation that is characteristic of the denitrification mariotti et al 1981 as assimilation can simultaneously reduce no3 and po4 3 paerl 2018 the role of assimilation is unclear in the sediments but we speculate that assimilation could also be important here because the coral holobiont is highly efficient in n assimilation houlbrèque and ferrier pagès 2009 glaze et al 2021 the capacity to assimilate plays a major role in alleviating n limitation in the sediments of coral ecosystems lesser et al 2004 for example the microbes in nutrient replete quartz sands and mud assimilate external n inputs in coral reefs eyre and ferguson 2005 cook et al 2007 erler et al 2014 also found that more inorganic n was retained than lost as gaseous products in permeable carbonate sediments in a tropical coral cay overall the isotopic compositions suggest significant benthic mineralization nitrification denitrification assimilation processes in the coral reef ecosystem 3 4 interactions between pelagic and sedimentary n cycling processes the n cycling in the coral reef ecosystem includes not only the pelagic and sedimentary n processes but also interactions between the pelagic and sedimentary processes we have quantitively demonstrated that the settlement of pon was a dominant source of son which is efficiently mineralized nitrified assimilated diffused and lost via denitrification the benthic diffusion of n in permeable sediments is an important mechanism that links the pelagic and sedimentary n cycling processes seidel et al 2015 ning et al 2019 benthic n flux varies in both flux direction and strength under different environmental conditions alongi et al 2008 ning et al 2020 in this study we did not find a clear positive relationship between the no3 concentrations negative relationship r2 0 15 p 0 05 and no3 isotopic compositions δ15n no3 r2 0 04 p 0 05 δ18o no3 r2 0 06 p 0 05 of the pore water and seawater implying a minor role for benthic n diffusion this minor benthic n diffusion to surface seawater may be associated with the high n retention and recycling efficiencies of the organisms in this coral reef ecosystem lamb wozniak 2007 glaze et al 2021 which allow the ecosystem to flourish in the oligotrophic water column indeed a recent study suggested that in much of weizhou island s nearshore area where the coral reef is distributed dissolved inorganic n was transferred from seawater to sediment ning et al 2019 2020 3 5 the integrated n cycling processes in the coral reef ecosystem fig 7 provides a conceptual diagram illustrating the integrated n cycling in the weizhou coral reef ecosystem the spatial distribution of the no3 loading in the water column was largely from sewage up to 86 2 and precipitation while the assimilation of no3 from the water column by algae was not significant relative to the external inputs the large input of sewage resulted in the no3 plentiful pelagic condition which limited pelagic n2 fixation and may be closely related to the loss of algal symbionts in coral hosts and coral bleaching in the ecosystem shantz and burkepile 2014 wang et al 2018 the enrichment of no3 could fuel an increase in phytoplankton biomass which would settle after death be trapped by coral mucus or be ingested and excreted as biodeposits finally being incorporated into the son wild et al 2004a these processes would enrich the sediments with abundant organic matter and create favorable conditions for mineralization nitrification denitrification erler et al 2020 in addition sewage may directly increase no3 transport from the water column to the sediment which could enhance the no3 availability that is essential for denitrification to prevail howarth and marino 2006 the denitrification would consequently lead to p accumulation and further fuel n2 fixation in the sediments cardini et al 2014 currently the sediments were n limited suggesting denitrification outcompetes external n inputs however given the increasing anthropogenic n inputs it is uncertain how long the situation will persist if the amounts of n2 fixation and anthropogenic n inputs exceed that of denitrification eutrophic conditions may take hold accordingly limiting anthropogenic nutrient flux is essential for maintaining the current situation and avoiding future acute chronic eutrophication and coral degradation in the ecosystem while pelagic n significantly contributed to the sedimentary n its export from the sediments to surface seawater was potentially short circuited by the high n retention and recycling efficiencies of the organisms in the coral reef ecosystem lamb wozniak 2007 glaze et al 2021 to some extent this decoupling may be responsible for the absence of strong pelagic turnover processes in this ecosystem 4 conclusions and implications applying a multiple isotopic method we have systematically identified the key processes involved in the pelagic and sedimentary n cycling as well as their interactions in a human disturbed coral reef ecosystem our study clearly shows that the complex processes controlling the n budget and cycling in the ecosystems are effectively reflected in the isotopic compositions of the seawaters and sediments thus adding an important dimension to understanding n cycling in coral reef ecosystems however it should be noted that this study was only a snapshot of the summer and seasonal variations of the cycling deserve further study the isotopic composition of other n species e g ammonium δ15n nh4 and nitrite δ15n δ18o no2 could provide supplementary information on the n cycling processes and should be included in further studies it should also be noted that there must be more to coral reef ecosystems than meets the eye for example critical n cycling processes including anaerobic ammonia oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in the riverine system are not elaborated in this study the 15n isotopic labeling technology holtappels et al 2011 glaze et al 2021 and in situ microbial community analysis yin et al 2018 wang et al 2021 should be incorporated in the future study to confirm the contribution of various n transformations processes in environments these

a quantitative description of the n sources transportations and transformations in coral reef ecosystems lamb wozniak 2007 duprey et al 2016 which undermines regional and global coral recovery efforts the isotopic compositions of n species are effective in tracing n cycling in aquatic ecosystems archana et al 2018 jiang et al 2020a 2021 first as different n sources generally have distinct isotopic signatures isotopic compositions are indicative of the n sources xue et al 2009 second biological n turnover processes e g nitrification assimilation and denitrification generate predictable isotopic signals which is known as fractionation kendall et al 2007 casciotti 2016 we hypothesized that the isotopic composition of n species in the seawater and sediments could be used as an indicator to explore n cycling processes in coral reef ecosystems however few studies have performed such an exploration in this study we conducted an isotopic survey of the weizhou island coral reef ecosystem which is suffering from severe anthropogenic disturbances we measured the isotopic compositions of the seawater pore water sedimentary organic n son and suspended particulate organic n pon collected from the region as a way of constraining the n sources we also measured the isotopic compositions of the local sewage groundwater and precipitation conventional coral reef monitoring data e g nutrient concentrations and bleaching rates were also obtained key questions addressed in this study were 1 what are the spatial distribution patterns of n in the coral reef ecosystem 2 what are the primary n sources and cycling processes in the ecosystem under severe anthropogenic disturbance we believed the isotopic compositions could shed some light on the complex n cycling processes in the coral reef ecosystem and provide implications for the restoration of coral reefs 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural and anthropogenic settings of the weizhou coral reef ecosystem weizhou island is located in the northern beibu gulf of the south china sea fig 1 a the inshore surface seawater has a temperature range of 19 0 30 4 c annual mean 24 6 c a ph of 8 0 8 2 an annual average salinity of 31 9 and a transparency of 3 0 10 0 m chen et al 2013 yu et al 2019 such natural settings provide an ideal habitat for coral growth over the past few decades the island has undergone societal shifts from a fisheries based economy to today s tourism dominated industry along with a dramatic degradation in the coral reefs studies have shown that the average live coral cover declined from 69 to 6 from 1990 to 2015 xu et al 2020 which is likely related to n enrichment and global warming yu et al 2019 agricultural practices and significant overland runoff e g rivers are absent on the island the potential n sources are precipitation sewage that is discharged directly into the coastal seawater via the beach or effluent released in pipes field observations to date the extent to which the different sources have contributed to the n loads remains unknown 2 2 field sampling the field sampling was performed in july 2020 a total of 39 surface seawater samples fig 1b were collected from the upper 1 m of the water column using 20 l polyethylene bottles at each station the coordinates were recorded by gps rino 650 garmin water quality parameters i e salinity ph water temperature dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations were recorded in situ using pre calibrated probes ysi exo3 the samples were immediately filtered through 0 7 μm pre combusted glass fiber membrane filters gf f whatman using a vacuum pump the filtered seawater samples were collected in glass bottles for the ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 and δ15n δ18o no3 analyses while the membranes containing suspended particulate matters were used for the δ15n pon analyses meanwhile surface sediments 0 to 20 cm were collected in polythene bags by scuba diving at 10 inshore stations around the island fig 1b approximately 5 kg of sediment was collected at each site with a shovel and placed in polyethylene bags porewater was collected from the sediment using rhizon samplers connected to a 50 ml syringe via 5 mm polyethylene tubing robertson and savage 2018 each sample was filtered by connecting the syringe to a glass fiber membrane filter head the filtered seawaters membranes pore waters and sediment samples were transported to the laboratory in darkness in a refrigerated box and stored at 20 c until further treatment potential end member samples i e precipitation groundwater and domestic sewage were collected to evaluate their contributions to the n pool in the seawater the sampling locations for each source are shown in fig 1b groundwater samples n 3 were collected from local artificial wells on weizhou island precipitation samples during the wet season n 10 were collected from nearby qinzhou city fig 1a during july 2019 to june 2020 using a measuring cylinder domestic sewage samples n 2 were collected from the visible sewage outlets on the island these waters were also filtered with a 50 ml syringe and frozen at 20 c in darkness until further analysis 2 3 analytical procedures the nh4 no3 and po4 3 concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using a continuous flow analyzer with uncertainties of 0 2 μmol l 1 apha 2005 the δ15n δ18o no3 compositions in the water samples were obtained through the complete reduction of no3 to nitrous oxide n2o by denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas aureofaciens and the subsequent measurement of its δ15n and δ18o with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo delta v plus weigand et al 2016 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric air air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively kendall et al 2007 standards usgs 32 34 and 35 were used to correct the data the analytical uncertainties were 0 3 the suspended particulate matters were carefully scraped from the membranes solid samples i e suspended particles and sediments were rinsed with millipore water lyophilized ground and passed through a 150 μm sieve the powdered samples were placed in 5 5 mm silver cups and introduced into an element analyzer coupled to an irms to determine the δ15n pon and δ15n son compositions jiang et al 2020a the isotopic data were reported relative to air standards usgs 32 and 34 were used to correct the data the analytical uncertainties were 0 4 for the δ15n 2 4 statistical analyses analysis of variance anova was performed to analyze differences in nutrient concentrations relationships among considered variables were analyzed using pearson correlation statistical analyses were carried out with the software spss 20 0 for windows 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of n pollution in the coral reef ecosystem water quality parameters and nutrient concentrations in the surface seawater and sedimentary pore water samples are tabulated in table s1 in the supplementary information the spatial distributions of chl a no3 and nh4 in the surface seawater are shown in fig 2 a c the chl a ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 μg l 1 with high values observed in the nearshore regions fig 2a the no3 and nh4 showed comparable concentrations ranging from 2 3 to 48 3 mean 9 9 μmol l 1 and from 0 5 to 67 0 mean 7 1 μmol l 1 respectively high no3 and nh4 concentrations on the southern shore are consistent with the concentrated distribution of residents on the southern island fig 2b c possibly reflecting the impact of anthropogenic sewage on the n loads the weizhou island coral reef ecosystem appeared to have no3 and nh4 concentrations much higher than other coral reef ecosystems such as those in the great barrier reef erler et al 2020 bahia costa et al 2008 and florida keys lamb wozniak 2007 thurber et al 2014 indicating significant anthropogenic disturbance the n values no3 16 po4 3 2 9 in μmol l 1 were calculated to evaluate deviations from the redfield ratio deutsch et al 2007 an obvious n spatial pattern was observed for the surface seawaters 18 of the 39 samples had negative n values n limited condition with most distributed in the nearshore region suggesting anthropogenic activities on the island may contribute more po4 3 relative to no3 to the sea the n values gradually became positive offshore n excess condition suggesting the existence of no3 input e g precipitation or generation nitrification i e oxidation of nh4 from pon mineralization and external inputs to no3 nh4 dominated the inorganic n species in the pore waters ranging from 23 9 to 70 3 mean 40 5 μmol l 1 which were much higher than the in the surface seawater anova p 0 01 the no3 concentrations showed high variability in the pore water ranging from 3 1 to 45 4 mean 15 2 μmol l 1 a notable feature of the pore waters was the significantly enriched po4 3 mean 58 8 μmol l 1 the extremely negative n suggested a n limited condition which may be associated with n removal e g denitrification or assimilation in the sediments these speculations need more evidence to confirm see discussions below 3 2 isotopic compositions of the surface seawater and pelagic n cycling the δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n pon compositions of the seawaters are also tabulated in table s1 the spatial variation of the isotopic values for the surface seawaters is shown in fig 2d f the δ15n no3 values were high in the nearshore region suggesting more contributions from 15n enriched anthropogenic sources e g sewage fig 2d the δ15n no3 gradually decreased moving offshore fig 2d while the δ18o no3 had the opposite pattern with low values observed for the nearshore region fig 2e the δ15n pon values were generally higher in the offshore region fig 2f classic keeling plots δ15n δ18o versus 1 no3 were used to identify n cycling processes in the seawater kendall et al 2007 conservative mixing between two major no3 sources yields a linear correlation between δ15n δ18o no3 and 1 no3 on a keeling plot whereas biological no3 removal processes i e bacterial denitrification reduction of no3 to n2 or algal assimilation produces a curved correlation furthermore no3 removal can be identified by either a negative linear relationship between δ15n δ18o no3 and ln no3 mariotti et al 1981 or a 1 1 co enrichment in the dual isotopes kendall et al 2007 the keeling plots for the surface seawaters are shown in fig 3 we observed significant linear correlations between δ15n δ18o no3 and 1 no3 which is characteristic of conservative mixing between two endmembers meanwhile instead of a co enrichment a roughly negative relationship was found between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 fig 4 these results suggest that pelagic assimilation or denitrification was likely minor the oxic conditions in the surface seawater dissolved oxygen 5 3 7 3 mg l 1 did not favor denitrification the weak assimilation signal was potentially attributed to the oligotrophic condition of the water column while previous studies have suggested pelagic nitrification could be significant in some human impacted coastal regions archana et al 2018 jiang et al 2020a 2021 nitrification in the seawater column should be minor in a closed system nitrification can cause a decrease in nh4 and a simultaneous increase in no3 note that we observed a significant positive relationship between no3 and nh4 which ruled out nitrification but implied common sources for the two n species the lack of a relationship between δ15n no3 and δ15n pon r2 0 07 p 0 5 also pointed to a minor role for coupled mineralization nitrification jiang et al 2020b overall the pelagic n transformation processes i e n2 fixation denitrification assimilation mineralization and nitrification were shown to be insignificant and the n loads in the water column were largely regulated by conservative mixing between two endmembers the y intercept of the regression line in fig 3a is 13 2 while that in fig 3b is 2 1 indicating that one major no3 source should have high δ15n no3 but low δ18o no3 values while the other source would have the opposite pattern wong et al 2018 as sewage was an endmember with a δ15n composition 10 xue et al 2009 we consider it likely that sewage was the first dominant no3 source coral could also be the first endmember as it may release considerable amounts of dissolved and particulate organic matter into the water column which would undergo mineralization nitrification in the seawater and contribute to the pelagic no3 pool wild et al 2004a 2004b lamb wozniak 2007 however the high δ15n no3 and low δ18o no3 values were distributed on the southern coast where human activities are intense rather than in the areas where coral reefs are widespread fig 1 and fig 2d e implying sewage was indeed the major no3 source precipitation was most plausibly the δ15n depleted but δ18o enriched source as its role in contributing oceanic no3 is well documented duce et al 2008 ren et al 2017 the no3 sources were quantified by a two endmember mixing model jiang et al 2020a the endmembers for the precipitation and sewage are given in table 1 we estimated that 13 8 71 4 mean sd 49 6 16 8 of the no3 is from precipitation and that the remainder mean sd 50 4 16 8 is from sewage note that the estimation might generate uncertainties as there are only 2 sewage end member samples it is not unexpected that the southern inshore regions receive more sewage input for the first time the significant contribution of anthropogenic activities to the no3 pool in the seawater of a coral reef ecosystem has been quantified we observed a significant positive correlation between the coral bleaching rate table s3 and the proportional contributions of sewage or δ15n no3 r2 0 81 p 0 1 fig s1 given the correlation was not significantly confounded by different levels of heat stress at the small ecosystem scale water depth generally less than 5 m fig 1 we suspect sewage induced no3 enrichments might be pivotal to coral bleaching wooldridge et al 2017 donovan et al 2020 decarlo et al 2020 first high no3 may lead to denser symbiont populations and the transfer of less c to the coral host reducing coral net primary production cunning and baker 2012 vega thurber et al 2014 burkepile et al 2020 second high no3 may induce phosphorus p starvation in algal symbionts which would alter the composition of algal photosynthetic membranes damaging the photosystem ii and increasing production of reactive oxygen species in algal symbionts wooldridge 2013 the above mechanisms can result in the loss of algal symbionts and coral bleaching which have been well documented in previous studies e g wiedenmann et al 2013 shantz and burkepile 2014 wang et al 2018 although previous studies suggest no3 exposure determines whether corals bleach they claim the effect on the bleaching rate may be small burkepile et al 2020 yet our results indicate that the severity of bleaching is also likely strongly correlated with no3 exposure 3 3 isotopic compositions of the sediments and sedimentary n cycling the isotopic compositions of sedimentary organic n δ15n son and the no3 in sedimentary pore water δ15n pwn are shown in table s2 the spatial variation in the isotopic values of the nearshore sediments is shown in fig s2 there was a significant positive correlation between δ15n son and δ15n pon r2 0 40 p 0 05 fig 5 a indicating that the deposition of pon was indeed a major source of son while n assimilation by phytoplankton in the surface seawater was difficult to identify against a dominant role of conservative mixing the abundance of phytoplankton is thought to have increased due to anthropogenic nutrient inputs the high chl a in the nearshore region supports this point fig 2a phytoplankton in the seawater eventually settle and become incorporated as a part of the son in addition coral mucus efficiently traps particulate organic matter in the seawater and carries it to the sediment huettel et al 2006 wild et al 2004a note that the δ15n son values were much lower than the δ15n pon values of the overlying seawater fig 5a we postulated that this deviation from the 1 1 line in fig 5a is consistent with a n2 fixation source benthic n2 fixation is increasingly regarded as a major source of n in reef environments rao and charette 2012 cardini et al 2014 generating organic n with a δ15n value close to 1 0 casciotti 2016 a supply of n to the ecosystem via n2 fixation would allow for the enrichment of 14n explaining the depleted δ15n son signature based on the isotopic mass balance it is estimated that n2 fixation and the deposition of pon contributed 32 5 0 and 68 5 0 of the son respectively the isotopic approach used in this study quantitively highlights the principal role of persistent n2 fixation on the n supply in the coral reef ecosystem supporting previous studies hypothesizing an important role for n2 fixation based on discrepancies between n inputs and exports webb et al 1975 smith 1984 the higher proportional contributions of n2 fixation inputs were recorded for the southern shore region implying anthropogenic sewage might promote n2 fixation el khaled et al 2020 sewage induced high dissolved n and p levels might stimulate diazotroph proliferation thereby increasing n2 fixation activity in the holobiont cardini et al 2014 in addition we suspect that sewage induced nutrient enrichment has increased denitrification and caused the current n limitation and high p availability in the sediments table s2 which could allow for diazotrophic microorganisms to proliferate and stimulate n2 fixation howarth and marino 2006 cardini et al 2014 erler et al 2020 it has been well documented that n2 fixation dramatically increased in the great barrier reef bell et al 1999 and red sea reef el khaled et al 2021 as a result of increased terrestrial nutrient flux a positive correlation was found between the δ15n son and δ15n pwn values fig 5b indicating the occurrence of coupled mineralization nitrification jiang et al 2020b capone et al 1992 also suggested that nitrification was a quantitatively important component in the sedimentary n cycling of the great barrier reef in addition denitrification has been well documented to be a major loss pathway for n in coral reefs erler et al 2020 the occurrence of denitrification is supported by the nutrient concentrations and isotopic data for the sediments due to the isotopic discrimination effect of organisms biological no3 removal enriches residual pools of no3 with heavier δ15n and δ18o at the same time no3 removal can decrease the no3 po4 3 ratio because po4 3 is not lost through denitrification paerl 2018 in this region the pore water showed more enriched isotope values and lower no3 po4 3 ratios than the overlying seawaters fig 6 clearly validating our speculation that denitrification was a prevailing factor in the sediments the significant linear relationship between the dual isotopes and the logarithm of the no3 po4 3 fig 6 is consistent with rayleigh isotope fractionation that is characteristic of the denitrification mariotti et al 1981 as assimilation can simultaneously reduce no3 and po4 3 paerl 2018 the role of assimilation is unclear in the sediments but we speculate that assimilation could also be important here because the coral holobiont is highly efficient in n assimilation houlbrèque and ferrier pagès 2009 glaze et al 2021 the capacity to assimilate plays a major role in alleviating n limitation in the sediments of coral ecosystems lesser et al 2004 for example the microbes in nutrient replete quartz sands and mud assimilate external n inputs in coral reefs eyre and ferguson 2005 cook et al 2007 erler et al 2014 also found that more inorganic n was retained than lost as gaseous products in permeable carbonate sediments in a tropical coral cay overall the isotopic compositions suggest significant benthic mineralization nitrification denitrification assimilation processes in the coral reef ecosystem 3 4 interactions between pelagic and sedimentary n cycling processes the n cycling in the coral reef ecosystem includes not only the pelagic and sedimentary n processes but also interactions between the pelagic and sedimentary processes we have quantitively demonstrated that the settlement of pon was a dominant source of son which is efficiently mineralized nitrified assimilated diffused and lost via denitrification the benthic diffusion of n in permeable sediments is an important mechanism that links the pelagic and sedimentary n cycling processes seidel et al 2015 ning et al 2019 benthic n flux varies in both flux direction and strength under different environmental conditions alongi et al 2008 ning et al 2020 in this study we did not find a clear positive relationship between the no3 concentrations negative relationship r2 0 15 p 0 05 and no3 isotopic compositions δ15n no3 r2 0 04 p 0 05 δ18o no3 r2 0 06 p 0 05 of the pore water and seawater implying a minor role for benthic n diffusion this minor benthic n diffusion to surface seawater may be associated with the high n retention and recycling efficiencies of the organisms in this coral reef ecosystem lamb wozniak 2007 glaze et al 2021 which allow the ecosystem to flourish in the oligotrophic water column indeed a recent study suggested that in much of weizhou island s nearshore area where the coral reef is distributed dissolved inorganic n was transferred from seawater to sediment ning et al 2019 2020 3 5 the integrated n cycling processes in the coral reef ecosystem fig 7 provides a conceptual diagram illustrating the integrated n cycling in the weizhou coral reef ecosystem the spatial distribution of the no3 loading in the water column was largely from sewage up to 86 2 and precipitation while the assimilation of no3 from the water column by algae was not significant relative to the external inputs the large input of sewage resulted in the no3 plentiful pelagic condition which limited pelagic n2 fixation and may be closely related to the loss of algal symbionts in coral hosts and coral bleaching in the ecosystem shantz and burkepile 2014 wang et al 2018 the enrichment of no3 could fuel an increase in phytoplankton biomass which would settle after death be trapped by coral mucus or be ingested and excreted as biodeposits finally being incorporated into the son wild et al 2004a these processes would enrich the sediments with abundant organic matter and create favorable conditions for mineralization nitrification denitrification erler et al 2020 in addition sewage may directly increase no3 transport from the water column to the sediment which could enhance the no3 availability that is essential for denitrification to prevail howarth and marino 2006 the denitrification would consequently lead to p accumulation and further fuel n2 fixation in the sediments cardini et al 2014 currently the sediments were n limited suggesting denitrification outcompetes external n inputs however given the increasing anthropogenic n inputs it is uncertain how long the situation will persist if the amounts of n2 fixation and anthropogenic n inputs exceed that of denitrification eutrophic conditions may take hold accordingly limiting anthropogenic nutrient flux is essential for maintaining the current situation and avoiding future acute chronic eutrophication and coral degradation in the ecosystem while pelagic n significantly contributed to the sedimentary n its export from the sediments to surface seawater was potentially short circuited by the high n retention and recycling efficiencies of the organisms in the coral reef ecosystem lamb wozniak 2007 glaze et al 2021 to some extent this decoupling may be responsible for the absence of strong pelagic turnover processes in this ecosystem 4 conclusions and implications applying a multiple isotopic method we have systematically identified the key processes involved in the pelagic and sedimentary n cycling as well as their interactions in a human disturbed coral reef ecosystem our study clearly shows that the complex processes controlling the n budget and cycling in the ecosystems are effectively reflected in the isotopic compositions of the seawaters and sediments thus adding an important dimension to understanding n cycling in coral reef ecosystems however it should be noted that this study was only a snapshot of the summer and seasonal variations of the cycling deserve further study the isotopic composition of other n species e g ammonium δ15n nh4 and nitrite δ15n δ18o no2 could provide supplementary information on the n cycling processes and should be included in further studies it should also be noted that there must be more to coral reef ecosystems than meets the eye for example critical n cycling processes including anaerobic ammonia oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in the riverine system are not elaborated in this study the 15n isotopic labeling technology holtappels et al 2011 glaze et al 2021 and in situ microbial community analysis yin et al 2018 wang et al 2021 should be incorporated in the future study to confirm the contribution of various n transformations processes in environments these

16512,urban water services including drinking water supply and wastewater treatment are highly energy dependent contributing to the challenges described under the water energy nexus both future climate change and decentralized water system adoptions can potentially influence the energy use of the urban water services however the trend and the extent of such influences have not been well understood in this study a modeling framework was developed to quantify both the separate and the combined influences of climate change and decentralization on the life cycle energy use of the urban water cycle using the city of boston ma as a testbed two types of household decentralized systems were considered the greywater recycling gwr systems and the rainwater harvesting rwh systems this modeling framework integrates empirical models based on multilinear regression analysis hydrologic modeling water balance models and life cycle assessment to capture the complex interactions among centralized water services decentralized water system adoptions and climate parameters for cumulative energy demand ced assessment considering all residential buildings in boston it was found that climate change alone will slightly increase the energy use of the centralized systems towards the end of the century due to the cancelation effect amongst changes in water quality flow rate and space and water heating demand when decentralization is considered alone we found economically viable decentralized systems may not necessarily produce energy savings in fact rwh adoptions may increase energy use when climate change and decentralization are combined they will increase the water yield and cost savings of the decentralized systems while reducing the energy use from the centralized systems when the centralized systems are further added into the picture the ced of the entire urban water cycle is projected to increase by 0 9 or 2 3 towards the end of the century under climate

systems often require a large amount of energy for water acquisition collection treatment and delivery approximately 4 of the total us electricity consumption goes to the water and wastewater sector mo et al 2010 drinking water and wastewater treatment also represents up to 44 of the total public energy cost in a city santana et al 2014 yonkin et al 2008 this high dependency of water services on energy is a part of the issues that have been identified under the water energy nexus which contributes to aggravated system vulnerabilities and resource consumptions imposing system sustainability and resiliency challenges nair et al 2014 siddiqi and anadon 2011 valek et al 2017 centralized urban water systems are further challenged by issues related to infrastructure aging hasik et al 2017 lack of resiliency leigh and lee 2019 and vulnerability to natural and manmade threats stip et al 2019 furthermore centralized drinking water facilities treat every single drop of water to the highest possible quality while about 83 of the treated water is used to meet non potable demands hasik et al 2017 they also rely heavily on traditional ground and surface water resources which has become increasingly scarce under the rapidly growing demand to address problems related to the centralized scheme decentralized systems such as household or community scale water recycling and rainwater harvesting are increasingly being studied or implemented decentralized systems are small scale dispersed facilities that are located near or at the point of use stang et al 2021 decentralized system adoption can reduce potable water demand and avoid extra treatment and pumping through a centralized system pmseic 2007 stang et al 2021 wong and brown 2008 however the energy implication of integrating decentralized systems into the existing centralized water and wastewater system network is not well understood on a municipality scale retamal and turner 2010 sharma et al 2010 especially considering the uncertain future climate change climate change can alter water availability and quality for drinking water supply arnell 2003 de wit and stankiewicz 2006 delpla et al 2009 haddeland et al 2014 khalkhali et al 2018 limbrick et al 2000 mo et al 2016 vörösmarty et al 2000 whitehead et al 2009 it has also shown to have a prominent effect on both drinking water demand and wastewater generation khalkhali and mo 2020 mo et al 2016 for instance drinking water demand in new york city protopapas et al 2000 nevada lott et al 2013 and washington polebitski et al 2011 has been reported to increase with temperature rise climate change can also affect the decentralized systems for instance by altering the amount and pattern of precipitation that is critical to the rainwater harvesting systems aladenola et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 hence it is important to study the energy implications of both centralized and decentralized urban water services as a whole while considering the potential effect of climate change a life cycle perspective is important in obtaining a holistic understanding of the water energy nexus many efforts have been previously made to quantify the life cycle energy associated with individual drinking water or wastewater systems some studies have investigated the life cycle energy implications of the urban water services including both drinking water and wastewater services as a whole amores et al 2013 jeong et al 2015 lane et al 2015 mo et al 2014 slagstad and brattebø 2014 xue et al 2019 xue et al 2016 these studies have shown the importance of examining an integrated urban water cycle especially when water recycling is considered kim and chen 2018 lane et al 2015 mo et al 2014 other studies have further included decentralized systems as well as their interactions with the centralized systems and investigated the implications of such integrations on the life cycle energy of the urban water services chang et al 2017 kavvada et al 2016 newman et al 2014 stang et al 2021 vieira and ghisi 2016 some of these studies assumed a constant volumetric avoided energy use from the centralized systems regardless of the scale and pattern of the decentralized system integration chang et al 2017 newman et al 2014 vieira and ghisi 2016 while others simulated the avoided pumping and treatment energy in the centralized systems based on the spatial pattern and design of the decentralized systems kavvada et al 2016 stang et al 2021 the latter studies highlighted the influence of spatial characteristics such as the adopted decentralized systems distances from the centralized systems elevation as well as user demand and infrastructure characteristics on the life cycle energy of urban water services both studies concluded that with proper planning a reduction of the overall life cycle energy consumption can be achieved however neither of these studies further investigated how the energy implication of decentralization might be further influenced by climate change on the other hand several studies have investigated the influence of climate change on the life cycle energy consumption of centralized drinking water systems mo et al 2016 stang et al 2018 centralized wastewater systems khalkhali and mo 2020 li et al 2018 and the decentralized systems bixler et al 2019 lin et al 2019 separately most of these studies suggested a likely increase in the life cycle energy consumption when individual systems were considered nevertheless to the authors knowledge no specific effort has been made to quantify the life cycle energy implication of climate change on the entire urban water cycle including the potential adoption of decentralized systems this limits our capability to capture and understand the dynamic interactions across the centralized and decentralized systems when assessing their responses to external stressors which is important in informing proactive actions in sustainable water and energy system management accordingly this study presents a dynamic modeling framework to quantify the influences of climate change and decentralization on the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle using the city of boston ma as a testbed to the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to quantify both the effects of climate change and decentralization on the dynamic life cycle energy use of an entire urban water cycle including the energy use and recovery from both centralized drinking water and wastewater systems this work aims to answer four key research questions 1 what is the current life cycle energy consumption of the centralized urban water services 2 how does climate change influence the life cycle energy consumption of the centralized urban water services 3 how does decentralized system adoption influence the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle and 4 how does climate change and decentralized system adoption combined influence the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle 2 methods fig 1 presents the methodological framework adopted in this study which includes a centralized drinking water system cdws sub model a centralized wastewater system cwws sub model and a decentralized system decs sub model the cdws sub model simulates energy consumption associated with drinking water withdrawal conveyance treatment and delivery as well as hydropower generation by the centralized drinking water system the cwws sub model simulates energy consumption associated with wastewater collection treatment and discharge as well as energy recovery through combined heat generation and hydropower generation by the centralized wastewater system two types of decentralized household water systems were considered in this study the greywater recycling gwr system and the rainwater harvesting rwh system the decs sub model estimates gwr and rwh systems energy consumption as well as their contribution to avoided energy use in the cdws and the cwws the following sections provide the details of the centralized and decentralized systems section 2 1 the method for life cycle energy quantification section 2 2 the method for simulating the climate change impact section 2 3 and the method for sensitivity analysis section 2 4 2 1 system descriptions the studied boston ma cdws provides around 263 mm3 year of drinking water and serves a population of 2 8 million massdocs 2019 the cdws employs a relatively simple treatment process of ozonation chlorination and a final ph adjustment due to its relatively high raw water quality mo et al 2016 stang et al 2018 the system has a much higher elevation than most of its service area resulting in a relatively low pumping demand for water delivery energy generation at the cdws is practiced through two active hydropower stations the amount of hydropower generation depends on reservoir operation and water intake by the treatment plant historical monthly energy consumption july 2005 july 2014 chemical use july 2005 july 2014 and hydropower generation data september 2007 july 2016 were obtained from the cdws for estimating its observed ced and for developing future ced estimation models the boston ma cwws treats around 478 mm3 year of combined sewage and serves around 2 6 million population massdocs 2019 this cwws employs a treatment process that consists of primary and secondary treatment followed by chlorination and dechlorination khalkhali and mo 2020 sludge is thickened and anaerobically digested the generated biogas is used for producing electricity and heat through a combined heat and power generation chp system onsite the treated wastewater passes through hydroelectric turbines for hydropower generation historical monthly energy consumption chemical use and energy generation data between july 2006 april 2017 were obtained from the cwws for estimating its observed ced and for developing future ced estimation models for consistency the cdws service was proportioned to match the serving population of the cwws in terms of the decentralized systems the gwr system was assumed to collect greywater from sink shower and laundry treat water by filtration and then store water in a ground level tank the rwh system included a typical design of rooftop rainfall collection simple filtration treatment and a ground level tank toilet flushing and residential irrigation were assumed to be the only allowed applications of the collected water for both systems sections s 1 and s 2 of the supporting information si the former was assumed to require pumping energy while the latter was assumed to be gravity fed in order to design and simulate the decentralized systems two dynamic models one for the gwr system and the other for the rwh system were developed using python 3 7 which simulated the water balance the decs energy use the potential energy savings from the centralized systems and the household economic saving on a daily time step system water balance was simulated using a yield after spill method for both the gwr and the rwh systems the two models were then run for each of the residential buildings in the city of boston to identify the building scale optimal rwh and gwr system sizes that maximize life cycle economic savings using 30 year historical climate data between november 1988 and november 2018 stang et al 2021 data sources and modeling procedure are provided in table s 1 of supplemantary materials for the analyses presented in this paper only households that yield positive life cycle cost savings under the optimal tank sizes were considered for our adoption analysis out of the 68 567 residential buildings in the city of boston around 8130 buildings resulted in positive life cycle cost savings by installing rwh systems and all buildings resulted in positive life cycle cost savings by installing gwr systems stang et al 2021 we investigated the ceds of adoption scenarios where the gwr or rwh systems were installed in the top 10 50 and 100 of the buildings with positive life cycle cost savings 2 2 life cycle energy assessment a life cycle assessment lca approach was adopted for estimating the energy consumption and generation associated with providing urban water services all energy types were quantified in terms of cumulative energy demand ced which characterizes all energy types in their primary energy form eia 2013 huijbregts et al 2006 we classified energy into three types direct ced indirect ced and ced offset direct ced refers to the ced that is associated with energy directly consumed onsite of the centralized and decentralized systems mo and zhang 2012 indirect ced is the ced associated with providing materials chemicals and services for the centralized and decentralized systems mo and zhang 2012 ced offset accounts for onsite energy generation through approaches such as in conduit hydropower and combined heat and power generation the three types of ceds were calculated for the operation phase of the existing centralized systems i e cdws and cwws while the construction phase was excluded considering these systems are already in place both the construction and operation phases of the decentralized systems were included the end of life phase was not considered for both centralized and decentralized systems because it has been previously reported to be insignificant khalkhali and mo 2020 mo et al 2016 eqs 1 and 2 explains how the average annual ced for the integrated centralized and decentralized systems under each climate

the case study around 10 years we used seasonal climate variations as a surrogate to model the influences of future climate change the process involved three key steps first climate indicators e g mean monthly temperature monthly precipitation were used as independent variables to predict changes of key water quality indicators e g mean monthly water temperature chemical oxygen demand second individual regression models were developed for each energy and chemical species to predict their volumetric consumptions based on both climate and water quality indicators third the monthly volumes of water demand and wastewater generation were projected based on climate indicators using either model fitting or multilinear regression it has to be noted that only regression models with a r2 value of 0 5 or above were included in our analyses a detailed description of the regression modeling process for the cdws and the cwws can be found in mo et al 2016 and khalkhali and mo 2020 respectively the ced associated with hydropower generation in the cdws cedc hydrocdws is not a linear function of the volume of services we modelled cedc hydrocdws by using an integrated hydrologic reservoir operation and hydropower generation model li et al 2018 the hydrologic model simulated the available runoffs entering the source water of the cdws outputs from the hydrologic model were then used in the reservoir operation model to simulate the quantity and duration of water passing through the two hydropower stations based on drinking water demand vcdws and reservoir water storage which were then used to simulate hydropower generation for the decs pumping energy used during the operation phase was calculated based on the daily water yield that is allocated to toilet flushing decentralized system pump efficiency as well as the required head which depends on the length and friction loss of the pipeline and the building height the direct and indirect ceds associated with the construction and maintenance phases were calculated using the eio lca method cmu 2018 based on estimated system construction and maintenance costs stang et al 2021 decs adoption also affects energy consumption and generation in the cdws cedavoidedcdws and the cwws cedavoidedcwws particularly rwh systems affect energy consumption and generation in the cdws while the gwr systems affect energy consumption and generation in both the cdws and the cwws the avoided treatment energy in the cdws and the cwws can be estimated based on the water yield of the decs multiplied by the average treatment volumetric ced of the cdws and or the cwws potential avoided pumping in the cdws was estimated based on the elevation and distance of each building from the centralized system in this analysis we assumed pipelines are aligned with the road network and the approximate pipeline length between a household and the cdws was estimated using the network analyst toolset in arcmap 10 6 the influence of the decs adoptions on the pumping energy for wastewater collection at the cwws was ignored as the wastewater collection at the cwws was mostly gravity fed the decs adoptions will also influence energy offset through the hydropower generation at the cdws and the chp generation and the in conduit hydropower generation at the cwws such influences were captured as the water flow input changes with the scale and pattern of decs adoption 2 3 climate change scenarios outputs from 19 cmip5 general circulation models gcms listed in table s 2 were obtained from the bureau of reclamation usbr 2018 for 9 locations listed in table s 3 within our testbed area these 19 climate models have been statistically downscaled to 1 8th degree resolution over the continental united states using the bias correction and spatial disaggregation techniques wood et al 2002 we investigated two future climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for each of the 19 climate models these scenarios are consistent with a wide range of possible changes in future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and have been widely adopted by previous studies daniel et al 2018 greenhouse gas emissions in the low emission scenario of rcp 4 5 peak around 2040 while in the high emission scenario of rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century collins et al 2013 the obtained climate projection outputs were then applied to simulate future system ced as formulated in eqs 1 and 2 future ced was first estimated on a monthly basis for three 10 year period of the early 2027 2036 mid 2057 2066 and late 2087 2096 century the monthly values were then summed to calculate annual values the average of all annual values was reported we also used climate projections to estimate the ced of the water services for the baseline 2007 2016 period under each climate scenarios and compared these values against the observed ced as the projected ced for the baseline period were close to the observed ced the projected ced is around 90 of the observed ced no further bias correction was applied for consistency we reported the estimated baseline and future ced values based on projected climate outputs to allow comparison between the two 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of input variable changes on the estimated ced of the urban water cycle tested variables related to the cdws and the cwws include water flow rate treatment energy intensity pumping energy intensity and energy offset intensity tested variables related to the dess are the pumping energy intensity as well as construction and maintenance energy intensity in addition sensitivity of the estimated ced to the primary energy convertor of electricity used in the lca was investigated input variables were changed by 50 to represent a reasonable range of possible values the ced estimations were performed for each of the 19 climate models during the baseline period under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios to determine the variables influence on the outcomes eq 3 was used to create a sensitivity index si song et al 2019 the calculated sis under all climate models were averaged for each of the rcp scenarios and reported in addition relative standard deviation rsd amongst all climate models for each si was reported as a dimensionless measure of dispersion relative to the obtained average si the rsd was calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the sis from all climate models by the absolute value of the averaged si variables were considered highly sensitive if their averaged sis were greater than one rsds lower than 55 represent low variation statisticshowto 2020 3 s i c e d c h c e d o c e d o i n p u t c h i n p u t o i n p u t o where si is sensitivity

1 observed ced fig 2 presents the results of the observed ced of the combined cdws and cwws to provide water and wastewater services to the same serving population under the historical climate condition breaking down the contributions of each of the two subsystems by direct indirect and offset ced numerical values used to create fig 2 are provided in table 1 the total ced of the combined centralized system is 1483 tj year the ced of the cdws was estimated to be 345 tj year to provide 242 mm3 of potable water 1 43 mj m3 and the ced of the cwws was found to be 1137 tj year to collect and treat 478 mm3 of wastewater 2 38 mj m3 these values fall within the broad range of energy intensities for water supply 1 37 12 96 mj m3 with high extreme value of 59 mj m3 and wastewater services 1 15 18 36 mj m3 with high extreme value of 27 mj m3 that have been previously reported in north america lee et al 2017 the ced of the cwws is about three times that of the cdws as the wastewater services in this system are more energy intensive and also the volume of wastewater services is about twice the volume of the potable water services table 1 however it has to be noted that the cdws of the study area benefits from relatively high raw water quality and the ced could significantly increase in drinking water systems with lower raw water quality jeong et al 2015 stang et al 2018 the cwws has a higher direct ced which is mainly attributed to the electricity consumption for wastewater collection and secondary treatment table 1 the cdws has a higher indirect ced which is related to the larger amount and variety of treatment chemicals needed for potable water production the cwws has a higher ced offset as the chp system recovers 17 of the combined system s ced 3 2 influence of climate change on the ced of the centralized water services fig 3 presents the average changes in direct indirect and offset ceds under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios in the early mid and late century numerical values used to create fig 3 are provided in table 1 the simulated total ced of the combined centralized system at the baseline period is 1341 tj year the ced of the centralized water systems will on average rise by 2 under the two climate scenarios towards the end of the century 1 7 and 2 7 under low and high emission scenarios respectively with a steeper slope for late century period under the rcp 8 5 scenario this overall energy demand increase is due to the increase in both direct and indirect ced consumptions as well as the decrease in the ced offset as shown in fig 3 a indirect ced experiences the highest amount of change which will rise by 2 25 8 88 tj year as compared to 1 03 14 06 tj year rise in direct ced and 0 84 3 56 tj year drop in ced offset in the late century indirect ced also presents the highest variation under different climate models indicating its high uncertainty to climate effects tables s 4 and s 5 when looking individually at the cwws system its direct and indirect ced will increase by 15 42 and 1 98 tj year respectively while its ced offset will reduce by 5 44 tj year contributing to a total ced increase of 2 2 or 22 84 tj year towards the end of the century fig 3b it has to be noted that the wastewater inflow to the cwws under climate change was estimated to decrease by an average of 1 6 as a result of the decrease in groundwater infiltration and stormwater inflow into the wastewater collection network despite the reduced wastewater flow rate the cwws s overall ced increases because the decrease in groundwater infiltration and stormwater inflow will likely result in a less diluted wastewater influent and hence a higher amount of electricity used for secondary treatment meanwhile the lower wastewater flow rate was predicted to decrease hydropower production and the higher organic concentration is likely to shock the chp system resulting in less energy being recovered the overall ced of the cdws was estimated to change very little with an average increase of 0 1 towards the end of the century fig 3c the main contributing factors here are the reduced direct ced consumption due to the decrease in the natural gas usage for space and water heating within the cdws a 0 7 drop the increased ced offset by 1 6 due to increase in water demand and hydropower generation and the increased indirect ced a 2 9 rise consumption due to increase in water treatment needs under climate change conditions 3 3 influence of decentralized system adoption on the ced of urban water services fig 4 and tables s 6 and s 7 present the results on the expected changes in the ced of the urban water cycle due to decs adoption our results show that 100 adoption of the gwr systems 68 567 buildings will result in a reduction of 11 3 tj year of ced 0 8 drop while a 100 adoption of the rwh systems 8130 buildings will result in 4 7 tj year of increase in ced 0 4 rise as compared to the baseline of current climate and no decs adoption 1341 tj year a similar ced benefit provided by integrating gwr systems into the centralized network has been previously reported by jeong et al 2018 while the rwh s negative impact on ced consumption has been previously reported by racoviceanu and karney 2010 and lam et al 2017 one reason for the gwr systems to outperform the rwh systems is because the gwr systems reduce ced consumption from both the cdws and the cwws while the rwh systems only reduce ced consumption from the cdws stang et al 2021 it is also partly attributed to rwh systems lower water yield as compared to the gwr systems given their dependence on the intermittent rainfall maskwa et al 2021 economically positive gwr system adoptions in the city of boston will result in a 26 66 mm3 year of potable water saving from the cdws while rwh system adoptions only result in 1 32 mm3 year of potable water savings from the cdws 3 4 influence of decentralization and climate change on the ced of urban water services fig 5 shows the implications of both adoption rates and climate change on the ced of urban water services numerical values of fig 5 are provided in tables s 6 8 to simulate different adoption rates under baseline climate conditions the considered buildings were sorted by life cycle cost savings and the buildings with the highest life cycle cost savings were assumed to adopt the decs first more gwr systems adoption results in improvement in all the considered measures including the overall ced consumption the water yield and the cost savings fig 5a these benefits gradually level with the increase of the adoption rates when the adoption rate is below 2 there is a lag in the decrease of the net ced consumption the reason for this lag is that among the first adopters there are buildings with high number of floors and occupants although these buildings have high water yields and cost savings they need a high amount of energy to pump water for the gwr systems around 96 of the net ced reduction is achieved by only around 50 of the buildings the flattening of the curve is largely contributed by the reduced hydropower generation at the cdws as less water flows through the hydropower turbines the rwh systems have a relatively linear relationship between the adoption rate and the three considered metrics fig 5b rwh adoption improves water yield and cost saving but worsens the energy performance of the urban water cycle climate change when added on top of the gwr adoption scenarios shown as bars in fig 5 slightly increases the water yield and cost savings of the gwr systems in general while significantly reduces the ced consumption of the urban water cycle this can be explained by the increase in the volumetric energy intensity in the cwws under climate change even though future gwr adoptions will not save more water than what they do now they might significantly reduce the energy consumption of the urban water cycle given the increased energy demand in the centralized systems it appears that individual gwr users will not benefit much from this trend as reductions in end users life cycle cost savings are minimal however gwr adoptions has a potentially significant economic benefit to the centralized service providers in this case the cwws as such incentives for gwr adoptions may help the centralized systems to better cope with the energy challenges under future climate change for rwh systems climate change will also result in an increase in water yield and cost savings as well as a decrease in the ced consumption although the decrease in the ced consumption is to a much less extent as compared to the gwr adoptions as the rwh adoptions do not reduce the wastewater influent to the cwws its ced reduction primarily comes from both the more efficient use of the stored water for increased irrigation demand and the larger amount of rainfall to be collected under climate change fig 6 presents the total ced of the entire water cycle when both climate change and decentralized system adoptions are considered when centralized systems are further added into the picture the ced of the entire urban water cycle is projected to increase by 0 9 towards the end of the century under climate change if all households adopt the gwr systems this increase will be 2 3 if all households that can produce a positive life cycle cost saving by installing rwh systems have acted upon it 3 5 sensitivity analysis the ced of the entire water cycle as shown in table 2 is not sensitive to changes in any of the tested input variables the highest sensitivity is related to the flow rate and the treatment energy intensity of the cwws the primary energy convertor of electricity in the study region also has high impact on the estimated ced this aligns with findings from previous studies regarding the key role that the electricity grid mix plays in the life cycle impacts of water infrastructure investments jeong et al 2018 lam et al 2015 the calculated relative standard deviation rsd of the senstivity indices sis under different climate models are all below 55 indicating the different climate models have limited influence on the si outcomes out of all studied variables the cdws flow rate shows a relatively high rsd values which is likely a result of the sensitivity of the hydropower generation in the cdws to the various climate projections 4 conclusions this study investigated the influence of both climate change and decentralized system adoption on the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle historically the studied centralized drinking water and wastewater systems consumed around 1341 tj year of cummalitve energy demand ced with the centralized wastewater system contributing the most climate change is likely to increase the total ced of the centralized systems by 2 towards the end of the century primarily contributed by an increase in the ced use in the centralized wastewater system due to the predicted worsening of raw wastewater quality this is primarily contributed by the reduced wastewater dilution by stormwater due to a projected drier climate the centralized drinking water system is less sensitive to climate change due to the compounded effects of a decrease in space and water heating an increase in hydropower generation and an increase in chemical consumptions for water treatment on the other hand decentralized system adoption s influence on the urban water services ced is highly dependent on the type of decentralized system grey water recycling gwr adoption in all cost saving positive buildings is likely to reduce total ced while rain water harvestng rwh adoption in all cost saving positive buildings is likely to increase total ced the gwr adoption scenario also has a higher water saving benefit per building basis as compared to the rwh adoption scenario given its lower dependence on the intermittent rainfall when climate change and gwr adoptions are combined they will slightly increase the water yield and cost savings of the gwr systems while significantly reduce the ced as a result of an increase in the avoided energy from the centralized wastewater system this trend reveals a potential discrepancy between how individual end users and the centralized systems might benefit from future gwr adoptions indicating a need for potential incentives to bridge such a gap rwh adoptions combined with climate change have a similar trend except that the decrease in the ced consumption is to a much less extent when centralized systems are further added into the picture the ced of the entire urban water cycle is projected to increase by 0 9 or 2 3 towards the end of the century under climate change if gwr or rwh systems are adopted by their respective cost saving positive buildings our findings suggest an overall increasing trend in the ced of the urban water cycle under climate change and decentralized system adoptions while the magnitude of ced increase is dependent on the type scale and pattern of decentralized system adopted highlighting the importance of proactive decentralized system planning to alleviate future climate challenges while this study was focused on the energy use of urban water systems under future climate change and decentralization scenarios there are additional environmental as well as socioeconomic factors that may drive the decision making surrounding the sustainability and resiliency enhancement of urban water systems such as water pollution emergency preparedness environmental justice or infrastructure aging some of these factors might further influence the urban water energy nexus which was not captured in this study future studies may expand the modeling framework to multiple cities to investigate how municipal characteristics such as climate population water demand stormwater wastewater management and existing centralized treatment processes might influence the role of climate

16512,urban water services including drinking water supply and wastewater treatment are highly energy dependent contributing to the challenges described under the water energy nexus both future climate change and decentralized water system adoptions can potentially influence the energy use of the urban water services however the trend and the extent of such influences have not been well understood in this study a modeling framework was developed to quantify both the separate and the combined influences of climate change and decentralization on the life cycle energy use of the urban water cycle using the city of boston ma as a testbed two types of household decentralized systems were considered the greywater recycling gwr systems and the rainwater harvesting rwh systems this modeling framework integrates empirical models based on multilinear regression analysis hydrologic modeling water balance models and life cycle assessment to capture the complex interactions among centralized water services decentralized water system adoptions and climate parameters for cumulative energy demand ced assessment considering all residential buildings in boston it was found that climate change alone will slightly increase the energy use of the centralized systems towards the end of the century due to the cancelation effect amongst changes in water quality flow rate and space and water heating demand when decentralization is considered alone we found economically viable decentralized systems may not necessarily produce energy savings in fact rwh adoptions may increase energy use when climate change and decentralization are combined they will increase the water yield and cost savings of the decentralized systems while reducing the energy use from the centralized systems when the centralized systems are further added into the picture the ced of the entire urban water cycle is projected to increase by 0 9 or 2 3 towards the end of the century under climate

systems often require a large amount of energy for water acquisition collection treatment and delivery approximately 4 of the total us electricity consumption goes to the water and wastewater sector mo et al 2010 drinking water and wastewater treatment also represents up to 44 of the total public energy cost in a city santana et al 2014 yonkin et al 2008 this high dependency of water services on energy is a part of the issues that have been identified under the water energy nexus which contributes to aggravated system vulnerabilities and resource consumptions imposing system sustainability and resiliency challenges nair et al 2014 siddiqi and anadon 2011 valek et al 2017 centralized urban water systems are further challenged by issues related to infrastructure aging hasik et al 2017 lack of resiliency leigh and lee 2019 and vulnerability to natural and manmade threats stip et al 2019 furthermore centralized drinking water facilities treat every single drop of water to the highest possible quality while about 83 of the treated water is used to meet non potable demands hasik et al 2017 they also rely heavily on traditional ground and surface water resources which has become increasingly scarce under the rapidly growing demand to address problems related to the centralized scheme decentralized systems such as household or community scale water recycling and rainwater harvesting are increasingly being studied or implemented decentralized systems are small scale dispersed facilities that are located near or at the point of use stang et al 2021 decentralized system adoption can reduce potable water demand and avoid extra treatment and pumping through a centralized system pmseic 2007 stang et al 2021 wong and brown 2008 however the energy implication of integrating decentralized systems into the existing centralized water and wastewater system network is not well understood on a municipality scale retamal and turner 2010 sharma et al 2010 especially considering the uncertain future climate change climate change can alter water availability and quality for drinking water supply arnell 2003 de wit and stankiewicz 2006 delpla et al 2009 haddeland et al 2014 khalkhali et al 2018 limbrick et al 2000 mo et al 2016 vörösmarty et al 2000 whitehead et al 2009 it has also shown to have a prominent effect on both drinking water demand and wastewater generation khalkhali and mo 2020 mo et al 2016 for instance drinking water demand in new york city protopapas et al 2000 nevada lott et al 2013 and washington polebitski et al 2011 has been reported to increase with temperature rise climate change can also affect the decentralized systems for instance by altering the amount and pattern of precipitation that is critical to the rainwater harvesting systems aladenola et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 hence it is important to study the energy implications of both centralized and decentralized urban water services as a whole while considering the potential effect of climate change a life cycle perspective is important in obtaining a holistic understanding of the water energy nexus many efforts have been previously made to quantify the life cycle energy associated with individual drinking water or wastewater systems some studies have investigated the life cycle energy implications of the urban water services including both drinking water and wastewater services as a whole amores et al 2013 jeong et al 2015 lane et al 2015 mo et al 2014 slagstad and brattebø 2014 xue et al 2019 xue et al 2016 these studies have shown the importance of examining an integrated urban water cycle especially when water recycling is considered kim and chen 2018 lane et al 2015 mo et al 2014 other studies have further included decentralized systems as well as their interactions with the centralized systems and investigated the implications of such integrations on the life cycle energy of the urban water services chang et al 2017 kavvada et al 2016 newman et al 2014 stang et al 2021 vieira and ghisi 2016 some of these studies assumed a constant volumetric avoided energy use from the centralized systems regardless of the scale and pattern of the decentralized system integration chang et al 2017 newman et al 2014 vieira and ghisi 2016 while others simulated the avoided pumping and treatment energy in the centralized systems based on the spatial pattern and design of the decentralized systems kavvada et al 2016 stang et al 2021 the latter studies highlighted the influence of spatial characteristics such as the adopted decentralized systems distances from the centralized systems elevation as well as user demand and infrastructure characteristics on the life cycle energy of urban water services both studies concluded that with proper planning a reduction of the overall life cycle energy consumption can be achieved however neither of these studies further investigated how the energy implication of decentralization might be further influenced by climate change on the other hand several studies have investigated the influence of climate change on the life cycle energy consumption of centralized drinking water systems mo et al 2016 stang et al 2018 centralized wastewater systems khalkhali and mo 2020 li et al 2018 and the decentralized systems bixler et al 2019 lin et al 2019 separately most of these studies suggested a likely increase in the life cycle energy consumption when individual systems were considered nevertheless to the authors knowledge no specific effort has been made to quantify the life cycle energy implication of climate change on the entire urban water cycle including the potential adoption of decentralized systems this limits our capability to capture and understand the dynamic interactions across the centralized and decentralized systems when assessing their responses to external stressors which is important in informing proactive actions in sustainable water and energy system management accordingly this study presents a dynamic modeling framework to quantify the influences of climate change and decentralization on the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle using the city of boston ma as a testbed to the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to quantify both the effects of climate change and decentralization on the dynamic life cycle energy use of an entire urban water cycle including the energy use and recovery from both centralized drinking water and wastewater systems this work aims to answer four key research questions 1 what is the current life cycle energy consumption of the centralized urban water services 2 how does climate change influence the life cycle energy consumption of the centralized urban water services 3 how does decentralized system adoption influence the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle and 4 how does climate change and decentralized system adoption combined influence the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle 2 methods fig 1 presents the methodological framework adopted in this study which includes a centralized drinking water system cdws sub model a centralized wastewater system cwws sub model and a decentralized system decs sub model the cdws sub model simulates energy consumption associated with drinking water withdrawal conveyance treatment and delivery as well as hydropower generation by the centralized drinking water system the cwws sub model simulates energy consumption associated with wastewater collection treatment and discharge as well as energy recovery through combined heat generation and hydropower generation by the centralized wastewater system two types of decentralized household water systems were considered in this study the greywater recycling gwr system and the rainwater harvesting rwh system the decs sub model estimates gwr and rwh systems energy consumption as well as their contribution to avoided energy use in the cdws and the cwws the following sections provide the details of the centralized and decentralized systems section 2 1 the method for life cycle energy quantification section 2 2 the method for simulating the climate change impact section 2 3 and the method for sensitivity analysis section 2 4 2 1 system descriptions the studied boston ma cdws provides around 263 mm3 year of drinking water and serves a population of 2 8 million massdocs 2019 the cdws employs a relatively simple treatment process of ozonation chlorination and a final ph adjustment due to its relatively high raw water quality mo et al 2016 stang et al 2018 the system has a much higher elevation than most of its service area resulting in a relatively low pumping demand for water delivery energy generation at the cdws is practiced through two active hydropower stations the amount of hydropower generation depends on reservoir operation and water intake by the treatment plant historical monthly energy consumption july 2005 july 2014 chemical use july 2005 july 2014 and hydropower generation data september 2007 july 2016 were obtained from the cdws for estimating its observed ced and for developing future ced estimation models the boston ma cwws treats around 478 mm3 year of combined sewage and serves around 2 6 million population massdocs 2019 this cwws employs a treatment process that consists of primary and secondary treatment followed by chlorination and dechlorination khalkhali and mo 2020 sludge is thickened and anaerobically digested the generated biogas is used for producing electricity and heat through a combined heat and power generation chp system onsite the treated wastewater passes through hydroelectric turbines for hydropower generation historical monthly energy consumption chemical use and energy generation data between july 2006 april 2017 were obtained from the cwws for estimating its observed ced and for developing future ced estimation models for consistency the cdws service was proportioned to match the serving population of the cwws in terms of the decentralized systems the gwr system was assumed to collect greywater from sink shower and laundry treat water by filtration and then store water in a ground level tank the rwh system included a typical design of rooftop rainfall collection simple filtration treatment and a ground level tank toilet flushing and residential irrigation were assumed to be the only allowed applications of the collected water for both systems sections s 1 and s 2 of the supporting information si the former was assumed to require pumping energy while the latter was assumed to be gravity fed in order to design and simulate the decentralized systems two dynamic models one for the gwr system and the other for the rwh system were developed using python 3 7 which simulated the water balance the decs energy use the potential energy savings from the centralized systems and the household economic saving on a daily time step system water balance was simulated using a yield after spill method for both the gwr and the rwh systems the two models were then run for each of the residential buildings in the city of boston to identify the building scale optimal rwh and gwr system sizes that maximize life cycle economic savings using 30 year historical climate data between november 1988 and november 2018 stang et al 2021 data sources and modeling procedure are provided in table s 1 of supplemantary materials for the analyses presented in this paper only households that yield positive life cycle cost savings under the optimal tank sizes were considered for our adoption analysis out of the 68 567 residential buildings in the city of boston around 8130 buildings resulted in positive life cycle cost savings by installing rwh systems and all buildings resulted in positive life cycle cost savings by installing gwr systems stang et al 2021 we investigated the ceds of adoption scenarios where the gwr or rwh systems were installed in the top 10 50 and 100 of the buildings with positive life cycle cost savings 2 2 life cycle energy assessment a life cycle assessment lca approach was adopted for estimating the energy consumption and generation associated with providing urban water services all energy types were quantified in terms of cumulative energy demand ced which characterizes all energy types in their primary energy form eia 2013 huijbregts et al 2006 we classified energy into three types direct ced indirect ced and ced offset direct ced refers to the ced that is associated with energy directly consumed onsite of the centralized and decentralized systems mo and zhang 2012 indirect ced is the ced associated with providing materials chemicals and services for the centralized and decentralized systems mo and zhang 2012 ced offset accounts for onsite energy generation through approaches such as in conduit hydropower and combined heat and power generation the three types of ceds were calculated for the operation phase of the existing centralized systems i e cdws and cwws while the construction phase was excluded considering these systems are already in place both the construction and operation phases of the decentralized systems were included the end of life phase was not considered for both centralized and decentralized systems because it has been previously reported to be insignificant khalkhali and mo 2020 mo et al 2016 eqs 1 and 2 explains how the average annual ced for the integrated centralized and decentralized systems under each climate

the case study around 10 years we used seasonal climate variations as a surrogate to model the influences of future climate change the process involved three key steps first climate indicators e g mean monthly temperature monthly precipitation were used as independent variables to predict changes of key water quality indicators e g mean monthly water temperature chemical oxygen demand second individual regression models were developed for each energy and chemical species to predict their volumetric consumptions based on both climate and water quality indicators third the monthly volumes of water demand and wastewater generation were projected based on climate indicators using either model fitting or multilinear regression it has to be noted that only regression models with a r2 value of 0 5 or above were included in our analyses a detailed description of the regression modeling process for the cdws and the cwws can be found in mo et al 2016 and khalkhali and mo 2020 respectively the ced associated with hydropower generation in the cdws cedc hydrocdws is not a linear function of the volume of services we modelled cedc hydrocdws by using an integrated hydrologic reservoir operation and hydropower generation model li et al 2018 the hydrologic model simulated the available runoffs entering the source water of the cdws outputs from the hydrologic model were then used in the reservoir operation model to simulate the quantity and duration of water passing through the two hydropower stations based on drinking water demand vcdws and reservoir water storage which were then used to simulate hydropower generation for the decs pumping energy used during the operation phase was calculated based on the daily water yield that is allocated to toilet flushing decentralized system pump efficiency as well as the required head which depends on the length and friction loss of the pipeline and the building height the direct and indirect ceds associated with the construction and maintenance phases were calculated using the eio lca method cmu 2018 based on estimated system construction and maintenance costs stang et al 2021 decs adoption also affects energy consumption and generation in the cdws cedavoidedcdws and the cwws cedavoidedcwws particularly rwh systems affect energy consumption and generation in the cdws while the gwr systems affect energy consumption and generation in both the cdws and the cwws the avoided treatment energy in the cdws and the cwws can be estimated based on the water yield of the decs multiplied by the average treatment volumetric ced of the cdws and or the cwws potential avoided pumping in the cdws was estimated based on the elevation and distance of each building from the centralized system in this analysis we assumed pipelines are aligned with the road network and the approximate pipeline length between a household and the cdws was estimated using the network analyst toolset in arcmap 10 6 the influence of the decs adoptions on the pumping energy for wastewater collection at the cwws was ignored as the wastewater collection at the cwws was mostly gravity fed the decs adoptions will also influence energy offset through the hydropower generation at the cdws and the chp generation and the in conduit hydropower generation at the cwws such influences were captured as the water flow input changes with the scale and pattern of decs adoption 2 3 climate change scenarios outputs from 19 cmip5 general circulation models gcms listed in table s 2 were obtained from the bureau of reclamation usbr 2018 for 9 locations listed in table s 3 within our testbed area these 19 climate models have been statistically downscaled to 1 8th degree resolution over the continental united states using the bias correction and spatial disaggregation techniques wood et al 2002 we investigated two future climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for each of the 19 climate models these scenarios are consistent with a wide range of possible changes in future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and have been widely adopted by previous studies daniel et al 2018 greenhouse gas emissions in the low emission scenario of rcp 4 5 peak around 2040 while in the high emission scenario of rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century collins et al 2013 the obtained climate projection outputs were then applied to simulate future system ced as formulated in eqs 1 and 2 future ced was first estimated on a monthly basis for three 10 year period of the early 2027 2036 mid 2057 2066 and late 2087 2096 century the monthly values were then summed to calculate annual values the average of all annual values was reported we also used climate projections to estimate the ced of the water services for the baseline 2007 2016 period under each climate scenarios and compared these values against the observed ced as the projected ced for the baseline period were close to the observed ced the projected ced is around 90 of the observed ced no further bias correction was applied for consistency we reported the estimated baseline and future ced values based on projected climate outputs to allow comparison between the two 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of input variable changes on the estimated ced of the urban water cycle tested variables related to the cdws and the cwws include water flow rate treatment energy intensity pumping energy intensity and energy offset intensity tested variables related to the dess are the pumping energy intensity as well as construction and maintenance energy intensity in addition sensitivity of the estimated ced to the primary energy convertor of electricity used in the lca was investigated input variables were changed by 50 to represent a reasonable range of possible values the ced estimations were performed for each of the 19 climate models during the baseline period under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios to determine the variables influence on the outcomes eq 3 was used to create a sensitivity index si song et al 2019 the calculated sis under all climate models were averaged for each of the rcp scenarios and reported in addition relative standard deviation rsd amongst all climate models for each si was reported as a dimensionless measure of dispersion relative to the obtained average si the rsd was calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the sis from all climate models by the absolute value of the averaged si variables were considered highly sensitive if their averaged sis were greater than one rsds lower than 55 represent low variation statisticshowto 2020 3 s i c e d c h c e d o c e d o i n p u t c h i n p u t o i n p u t o where si is sensitivity

1 observed ced fig 2 presents the results of the observed ced of the combined cdws and cwws to provide water and wastewater services to the same serving population under the historical climate condition breaking down the contributions of each of the two subsystems by direct indirect and offset ced numerical values used to create fig 2 are provided in table 1 the total ced of the combined centralized system is 1483 tj year the ced of the cdws was estimated to be 345 tj year to provide 242 mm3 of potable water 1 43 mj m3 and the ced of the cwws was found to be 1137 tj year to collect and treat 478 mm3 of wastewater 2 38 mj m3 these values fall within the broad range of energy intensities for water supply 1 37 12 96 mj m3 with high extreme value of 59 mj m3 and wastewater services 1 15 18 36 mj m3 with high extreme value of 27 mj m3 that have been previously reported in north america lee et al 2017 the ced of the cwws is about three times that of the cdws as the wastewater services in this system are more energy intensive and also the volume of wastewater services is about twice the volume of the potable water services table 1 however it has to be noted that the cdws of the study area benefits from relatively high raw water quality and the ced could significantly increase in drinking water systems with lower raw water quality jeong et al 2015 stang et al 2018 the cwws has a higher direct ced which is mainly attributed to the electricity consumption for wastewater collection and secondary treatment table 1 the cdws has a higher indirect ced which is related to the larger amount and variety of treatment chemicals needed for potable water production the cwws has a higher ced offset as the chp system recovers 17 of the combined system s ced 3 2 influence of climate change on the ced of the centralized water services fig 3 presents the average changes in direct indirect and offset ceds under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios in the early mid and late century numerical values used to create fig 3 are provided in table 1 the simulated total ced of the combined centralized system at the baseline period is 1341 tj year the ced of the centralized water systems will on average rise by 2 under the two climate scenarios towards the end of the century 1 7 and 2 7 under low and high emission scenarios respectively with a steeper slope for late century period under the rcp 8 5 scenario this overall energy demand increase is due to the increase in both direct and indirect ced consumptions as well as the decrease in the ced offset as shown in fig 3 a indirect ced experiences the highest amount of change which will rise by 2 25 8 88 tj year as compared to 1 03 14 06 tj year rise in direct ced and 0 84 3 56 tj year drop in ced offset in the late century indirect ced also presents the highest variation under different climate models indicating its high uncertainty to climate effects tables s 4 and s 5 when looking individually at the cwws system its direct and indirect ced will increase by 15 42 and 1 98 tj year respectively while its ced offset will reduce by 5 44 tj year contributing to a total ced increase of 2 2 or 22 84 tj year towards the end of the century fig 3b it has to be noted that the wastewater inflow to the cwws under climate change was estimated to decrease by an average of 1 6 as a result of the decrease in groundwater infiltration and stormwater inflow into the wastewater collection network despite the reduced wastewater flow rate the cwws s overall ced increases because the decrease in groundwater infiltration and stormwater inflow will likely result in a less diluted wastewater influent and hence a higher amount of electricity used for secondary treatment meanwhile the lower wastewater flow rate was predicted to decrease hydropower production and the higher organic concentration is likely to shock the chp system resulting in less energy being recovered the overall ced of the cdws was estimated to change very little with an average increase of 0 1 towards the end of the century fig 3c the main contributing factors here are the reduced direct ced consumption due to the decrease in the natural gas usage for space and water heating within the cdws a 0 7 drop the increased ced offset by 1 6 due to increase in water demand and hydropower generation and the increased indirect ced a 2 9 rise consumption due to increase in water treatment needs under climate change conditions 3 3 influence of decentralized system adoption on the ced of urban water services fig 4 and tables s 6 and s 7 present the results on the expected changes in the ced of the urban water cycle due to decs adoption our results show that 100 adoption of the gwr systems 68 567 buildings will result in a reduction of 11 3 tj year of ced 0 8 drop while a 100 adoption of the rwh systems 8130 buildings will result in 4 7 tj year of increase in ced 0 4 rise as compared to the baseline of current climate and no decs adoption 1341 tj year a similar ced benefit provided by integrating gwr systems into the centralized network has been previously reported by jeong et al 2018 while the rwh s negative impact on ced consumption has been previously reported by racoviceanu and karney 2010 and lam et al 2017 one reason for the gwr systems to outperform the rwh systems is because the gwr systems reduce ced consumption from both the cdws and the cwws while the rwh systems only reduce ced consumption from the cdws stang et al 2021 it is also partly attributed to rwh systems lower water yield as compared to the gwr systems given their dependence on the intermittent rainfall maskwa et al 2021 economically positive gwr system adoptions in the city of boston will result in a 26 66 mm3 year of potable water saving from the cdws while rwh system adoptions only result in 1 32 mm3 year of potable water savings from the cdws 3 4 influence of decentralization and climate change on the ced of urban water services fig 5 shows the implications of both adoption rates and climate change on the ced of urban water services numerical values of fig 5 are provided in tables s 6 8 to simulate different adoption rates under baseline climate conditions the considered buildings were sorted by life cycle cost savings and the buildings with the highest life cycle cost savings were assumed to adopt the decs first more gwr systems adoption results in improvement in all the considered measures including the overall ced consumption the water yield and the cost savings fig 5a these benefits gradually level with the increase of the adoption rates when the adoption rate is below 2 there is a lag in the decrease of the net ced consumption the reason for this lag is that among the first adopters there are buildings with high number of floors and occupants although these buildings have high water yields and cost savings they need a high amount of energy to pump water for the gwr systems around 96 of the net ced reduction is achieved by only around 50 of the buildings the flattening of the curve is largely contributed by the reduced hydropower generation at the cdws as less water flows through the hydropower turbines the rwh systems have a relatively linear relationship between the adoption rate and the three considered metrics fig 5b rwh adoption improves water yield and cost saving but worsens the energy performance of the urban water cycle climate change when added on top of the gwr adoption scenarios shown as bars in fig 5 slightly increases the water yield and cost savings of the gwr systems in general while significantly reduces the ced consumption of the urban water cycle this can be explained by the increase in the volumetric energy intensity in the cwws under climate change even though future gwr adoptions will not save more water than what they do now they might significantly reduce the energy consumption of the urban water cycle given the increased energy demand in the centralized systems it appears that individual gwr users will not benefit much from this trend as reductions in end users life cycle cost savings are minimal however gwr adoptions has a potentially significant economic benefit to the centralized service providers in this case the cwws as such incentives for gwr adoptions may help the centralized systems to better cope with the energy challenges under future climate change for rwh systems climate change will also result in an increase in water yield and cost savings as well as a decrease in the ced consumption although the decrease in the ced consumption is to a much less extent as compared to the gwr adoptions as the rwh adoptions do not reduce the wastewater influent to the cwws its ced reduction primarily comes from both the more efficient use of the stored water for increased irrigation demand and the larger amount of rainfall to be collected under climate change fig 6 presents the total ced of the entire water cycle when both climate change and decentralized system adoptions are considered when centralized systems are further added into the picture the ced of the entire urban water cycle is projected to increase by 0 9 towards the end of the century under climate change if all households adopt the gwr systems this increase will be 2 3 if all households that can produce a positive life cycle cost saving by installing rwh systems have acted upon it 3 5 sensitivity analysis the ced of the entire water cycle as shown in table 2 is not sensitive to changes in any of the tested input variables the highest sensitivity is related to the flow rate and the treatment energy intensity of the cwws the primary energy convertor of electricity in the study region also has high impact on the estimated ced this aligns with findings from previous studies regarding the key role that the electricity grid mix plays in the life cycle impacts of water infrastructure investments jeong et al 2018 lam et al 2015 the calculated relative standard deviation rsd of the senstivity indices sis under different climate models are all below 55 indicating the different climate models have limited influence on the si outcomes out of all studied variables the cdws flow rate shows a relatively high rsd values which is likely a result of the sensitivity of the hydropower generation in the cdws to the various climate projections 4 conclusions this study investigated the influence of both climate change and decentralized system adoption on the life cycle energy consumption of the urban water cycle historically the studied centralized drinking water and wastewater systems consumed around 1341 tj year of cummalitve energy demand ced with the centralized wastewater system contributing the most climate change is likely to increase the total ced of the centralized systems by 2 towards the end of the century primarily contributed by an increase in the ced use in the centralized wastewater system due to the predicted worsening of raw wastewater quality this is primarily contributed by the reduced wastewater dilution by stormwater due to a projected drier climate the centralized drinking water system is less sensitive to climate change due to the compounded effects of a decrease in space and water heating an increase in hydropower generation and an increase in chemical consumptions for water treatment on the other hand decentralized system adoption s influence on the urban water services ced is highly dependent on the type of decentralized system grey water recycling gwr adoption in all cost saving positive buildings is likely to reduce total ced while rain water harvestng rwh adoption in all cost saving positive buildings is likely to increase total ced the gwr adoption scenario also has a higher water saving benefit per building basis as compared to the rwh adoption scenario given its lower dependence on the intermittent rainfall when climate change and gwr adoptions are combined they will slightly increase the water yield and cost savings of the gwr systems while significantly reduce the ced as a result of an increase in the avoided energy from the centralized wastewater system this trend reveals a potential discrepancy between how individual end users and the centralized systems might benefit from future gwr adoptions indicating a need for potential incentives to bridge such a gap rwh adoptions combined with climate change have a similar trend except that the decrease in the ced consumption is to a much less extent when centralized systems are further added into the picture the ced of the entire urban water cycle is projected to increase by 0 9 or 2 3 towards the end of the century under climate change if gwr or rwh systems are adopted by their respective cost saving positive buildings our findings suggest an overall increasing trend in the ced of the urban water cycle under climate change and decentralized system adoptions while the magnitude of ced increase is dependent on the type scale and pattern of decentralized system adopted highlighting the importance of proactive decentralized system planning to alleviate future climate challenges while this study was focused on the energy use of urban water systems under future climate change and decentralization scenarios there are additional environmental as well as socioeconomic factors that may drive the decision making surrounding the sustainability and resiliency enhancement of urban water systems such as water pollution emergency preparedness environmental justice or infrastructure aging some of these factors might further influence the urban water energy nexus which was not captured in this study future studies may expand the modeling framework to multiple cities to investigate how municipal characteristics such as climate population water demand stormwater wastewater management and existing centralized treatment processes might influence the role of climate

development lid many cities are beginning to focus on nature based solutions to combat issues of pollution and large volumes of stormwater in highly urbanized areas hobbie and grimm 2020 in highly impervious cities lid aims to reduce runoff to a pre urbanized state by increasing the amount of stormwater that can infiltrate through permeable land cover and thereby reducing the transport of contaminants from impervious surfaces to nearby aquatic environments walsh et al 2005 biofilters a type of lid that is composed of porous natural media and vegetation are successful in reducing the volume of urban runoff clar et al 2004 to monitor the removal of pathogens in biofilters studies have used fib as process indicators however the fate and transport of viruses in the environment can be distinct from fib geldenhuys and pretorius 1989 noble et al 2001 pusch et al 2005 viruses are of particular importance because they are highly infectious and recalcitrant in the environment fong and lipp 2005 hall 2012 the addition of geomedia like biochar to biofilters has been shown to increase the removal of trace organic contaminants fib and bacteriophage ms2 from urban stormwater runoff kranner et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 but the effect of adding vegetation to biofilters is less defined in biofilters specifically vegetation is thought to affect removal of microbial contaminants by enhancing mechanisms of removal such as filtration attachment decay and predation peng et al 2016 however there are only two studies to our knowledge that have examined the effect of vegetation in stormwater biofilters on removal of viruses chandrasena et al 2017 li et al 2012a in this study we characterized viruses in san francisco bay area urban runoff and assessed their removal in laboratory scale biofilters we first completed an observational field study aimed to answer the following questions at what concentrations fluxes and frequencies are viral human pathogens found in urban stormwater runoff in the san francisco bay area what are their relationships with land use and precipitation do fecal indicators correlate well with these viral human pathogens the results of the observation study informed experiments investigating the removal of these viruses in vegetated biochar amended biofilters we chose to use biochar amended biofilters as literature suggests that the presence of biochar can vastly improve pollutant removal capacity of biofilters boehm et al 2020 we aimed to answer the following questions does vegetation improve the performance of biofilters in removing viral pathogens is a model bacteriophage ms2 similarly removed when compared to viral pathogens the results of this study provide important information on the occurrence of human viruses in urban stormwater runoff and insights on the performance of biofilters in removing viruses from stormwater the data can inform risk assessments from exposure to stormwater and the design of biofilters respectively all data from this work is publicly available through the stanford digital repository https doi org 10 25740 pk916xf8847 2 methods 2 1 observational urban stormwater runoff study 2 1 1 urban stormwater runoff sample collection samples were collected from six creeks in the san francisco bay area three discharge to san francisco bay and three discharge to the pacific ocean all sites were visited approximately twice per month from october 2018 to march 2019 and all sites were visited on each sampling day n 9 one sample from one creek was lost during transport sampling commenced at 04 30 and ended by 09 00 a total of 53 unique sampling events defined as a time and location occurred and salinity turbidity and flowrate were measured for each sample as described in the sm approximately 10 of samples were collected in duplicate n 5 each collected at a unique sampling location sampling dates sites and precipitation details are described further in the sm and in table s1 2 1 2 e coli and enterococci enumeration e coli and enterococci were enumerated using epa method 1600 and 1603 respectively method 1600 2009 method 1603 2014 methods are described in detail in the sm 2 1 3 virus filtration viruses were concentrated from 10 l stormwater samples using electronegative filtration adapted from previous studies evaluating viral concentration methods katayama et al 2002 victoria et al 2009 two sites one bayside and one oceanside were chosen to estimate recovery of viruses by spiking surrogate virus ms2 into samples methods are detailed in the sm 2 1 4 nucleic acid extraction nucleic acids were extracted from filtration membranes in twelve batches of randomly selected membranes using the qiagen dna rna allprep powerviral kit with β mercaptoethanol several modifications were made to the manufacturer s recommendations bead beating time was increased to ten minutes to ensure complete lysis of virions and for samples that required the use of multiple filters membranes were extracted separately until the sample lysate is added to the qiagen spin column at this point multiple lysed solutions from a single sample were combined and added to one spin column extracts were eluted from spin columns with rnase free water in two rounds of 50 μl for a total extract volume of 100 μl per sample an extraction blank was run with every batch of extractions no membrane was added to a bead beating tube to control for contamination during the extraction process and this extraction blank was then processed along with the environmental samples all extracts were stored at 80 c until further processing maximum storage time 6 months 2 1 5 rt qpcr assays and inhibition assessment targeted viruses adenovirus a f enterovirus norovirus gii crassphage ms2 listed in table 1 were quantified in urban stormwater runoff using qpcr or rt qpcr assay characteristics including primer and probe concentrations are listed in the table two no template control ntc wells dna rna free water was substituted for template were included on every rt qpcr plate all samples were assayed in duplicate rt qpcr wells all assays were run on an applied biosystems steponeplus instrument thresholds and baselines were determined manually on the machine all samples with cqs less than 40 were considered positive the limit of detection lod for each assay was the theoretical concentration that would represent a cq of 40 the limit of quantification loq was set at the cq of the lowest standard measured for each rt qpcr target samples were considered below the limit of quantification blq if the average cq was higher than that of the lowest standard in the standard curve samples for which one of the technical replicates amplified but the other either was non detect nd or blq were substituted with half the value of the lod or loq respectively during data analysis if both technical replicates were negative then the sample was designated as a nd inhibition was assessed in a subset of samples further details are in the sm 2 1 6 spatial analysis and precipitation data all spatial analysis was performed using qgis the hydrologic unit classification huc 12 dataset from united states geological survey usgs was used to define the subwatershed boundaries land cover within each of the subwatersheds was determined using the national land cover database 2016 which classifies land cover into 17 categories homer et al 2020 jin et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the subwatershed map was clipped to the land cover raster data using qgis for the land cover analyses we used previously described methods walters et al 2011 in short the land cover classifications were subdivided into agricultural 81 82 forested 41 43 52 urban 21 24 and other 0 11 12 31 71 90 95 urban land cover area was normalized using subwatershed area resulting in a variable representing the fraction of a subwatershed that is considered developed an additional undeveloped land cover variable was calculated by subtracting the developed fraction from one antecedent precipitation data from the 24 h prior to sampling at each location was gathered from california nevada river forecast center for all sites noaa 2019 wet weather days were defined as days with precipitation greater than zero inches in the 24 h prior to sampling 2 1 7 data analysis because observations at sampling sites were repeated measures data generalized estimating equations gees in spss version 27 ibm were used to investigate how land cover precipitation and environmental variables were associated with virus concentrations fluxes or presence absence at each sampling point hardin 2005 gees are semi parametric models that do not assume response normality and provide population averaged effects of factors on an outcome they account for clustering by sample location and date which is required to control for correlation between samples at the same site and taken on the same day over the course of the study ballinger 2004 gees assume a correlated data structure correlated errors and do not need homogeneity of variance presence and magnitude of stormwater runoff was represented by antecedent precipitation increased sediment or suspended solids within a sample was represented by turbidity data fraction of a sample that was fresh rather than saline from tidal variations in creeks was represented by salinity and land cover was represented by the fraction of a watershed that was undeveloped undeveloped fraction of a watershed related to the developed fraction e g 1 developed fraction undeveloped fraction undeveloped fraction rather than developed fraction of a watershed was used in the model so that the model reference condition is a completely urbanized watershed and thus the model coefficients for the other independent variables represent their effects in this reference condition completely developed watershed to examine the association between environmental variables and binary virus variables coefficients from gees were log10 transformed to obtain odds ratios and risk ratios were approximated from odds ratios zhang and yu 1998 further details on gee analyses are in the sm the model considered whether covariate coefficients are significantly different from zero and if they are they are marked as significant results were considered significant if their respective p 0 05 for the gee results p 0 1 results are also discussed relationships between continuous indicator variables and binary viral pathogen variables were explored using the point biserial correlation which is calculated as the pearson s correlation coefficient but estimates the relationship between a continuous and dichotomous variable levine 1981 because there was spatial clustering in the dataset indicator variables were averaged by site yielding six site specific values for crassphage e coli and enterococci averages were log10 transformed and were confirmed to be normally distributed by examination of q q plots shown in figure s6 binary pathogen variables representing presence absence data for adv ev nv gii and any virus defined as the presence of any one of the human viral targets for each site were used for these analyses yielding six site specific binary values for each virus group if any of the samples from a given site were positive for a virus then the site was designated as a 1 for that virus if none of the samples from a given site were positive then the site was designated as a 0 for that virus 2 2 biofilter mesocosm experiments 2 2 1 overview of experimental design to investigate the effect of vegetation on the removal of viral pathogens in stormwater biofilters a study was designed using laboratory scale biofilter mesocosms for this purpose six biofilters were constructed of which three were planted with vegetation and three were left without vegetation biofilters underwent three experimental phases detailed in fig 1 construction and flushing conditioning and challenge testing construction and flushing lasted 9 weeks and consisted of constructing the pvc pipe columns according to previously described specifications ulrich et al 2017 adding biofilter media to each column adding plants to the vegetated column group juncus effusus spiralis a native californian grass and watering each column with 2 l of di water twice per week to flush fine particulates tracer tests were conducted at the beginning and end of the column experiments then to minimize start up effects of the columns on removal estimates during challenge tests and to simulate more realistic field conditions all columns underwent a period of conditioning when they were watered with 2 l of natural creek water twice per week for 21 weeks finally during the challenge test period all biofilters underwent three challenge tests using creek water that was spiked with laboratory cultivated virus stocks the effluent from these challenge tests was collected in fractions from each biofilter to determine removal of viruses from each biofilter all experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 c further information on biofilter construction and conditioning is detailed in the sm 2 2 2 biofilter challenge tests the day before each challenge test 56 l of natural creek water was collected in 10 hcl washed plastic carboys that were triple rinsed with creek water prior to taking the sample stocks of lab cultivated adenovirus adenovirus 2 atcc vr 846 enterovirus coxsackievirus b5 atcc vr 185 and ms2 atcc 15 597 b1 were spiked into the carboys and spiked creek water was held at 4 c for 18 20 h before the challenge tests viral cultivation methods in sm challenge tests were conducted three times with 4 5 days between each test columns were held under plant grow led lights kufung cat no b01ch75sgy between each challenge test on each challenge day biofilters were saturated with 1 pore volume pv of creek water then a 4 pv pulse of virus spiked creek water was applied to each biofilter which was then followed by 4 pvs of unspiked creek water to ensure that the effluent samples would capture the breakthrough and dissipation of the spiked viruses influent water was fed to the tops of columns using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 12 7 cm per hour with each event lasting less than 3 h for each biofilter effluent from each biofilter was collected in 0 5 pv increments in 500 ml autoclaved and acid washed polypropylene bottles tubing masterflex reg l s platinum cured silicon tubing size 15 cat no 96 410 15 was sterilized between challenge tests by soaking in 10 bleach then rinsing with di water within 48 h of collection each fraction from the column effluents as well as samples of the influent n 58 were filtered using two different techniques to concentrate viruses for i f coliphage plaque assays using previously described methods sinton et al 1996 and ii nucleic acid extraction using the same qiagen powerviral dna rna method as described in section 1 4 and subsequent virus detection using rt qpcr a filtration blank was done for both types of filtration techniques detailed above further details are in the sm 2 2 3 rt qpcr assays for biofilter samples and inhibition assessment details for the rt qpcr assays for adenovirus a f enterovirus and ms2 are listed in table 1 and are the same assays that were used for the observational stormwater study each sample was analyzed in technical duplicates on each rt qpcr plate duplicate ntc wells were also included on each plate rna dna free water was substituted for template a subset of samples were also checked for inhibition details are in the sm 2 2 4 data analysis breakthrough curves were constructed by dividing the concentration of each virus in each effluent fraction c by the concentration in the influent c0 and plotting against the pore volume pv standard deviations from concentration measurements for each effluent sample and the influent samples were propagated to obtain standard deviations for each c c0 data point taylor 1982 log10 removal values were calculated for each virus by log10 cmax c0 where cmax is the maximum concentration leaving the biofilter and c0 is the influent concentration for a given virus additional calculations examining the percent of viruses removed by biofilters using a mass balance approach mohanty et al 2014 sasidharan et al 2016 are provided in the sm normality was confirmed using q q plots see figure s7 welch s t test was used to compare the mean virus removals between the vegetated and non vegetated groups repeated measures one way anova was used to compare the mean virus removal between adv ev ms2 measured by rt qpcr and f coliphage measured by plaque assay 3 results 3 1 observational urban stormwater runoff study 3 1 1 fib in stormwater average fib concentrations by site are shown in figure s1 average e coli ranged from 10 to 1 6 104 cfu 100 ml average enterococci ranged from 10 to 2 0 104 cfu 100 ml filtration blanks for each type of microbiological media on each sampling day were all negative for both fib 3 1 2 viruses in stormwater in the recovery experiments at the bayside site the average recovery of ms2 was 11 4 9 3 mean standard deviation and at the oceanside site the average recovery was 9 8 5 8 when the rt qpcr results from samples from all sample replicates locations and dates were combined n 58 93 of samples were positive for crassphage crassphage concentrations average standard deviation ranged from 2 9 102 7 0 101 to 3 5 105 4 1 103 gc l and fluxes ranged from 4 1 102 1 6 102 to 2 6 109 2 0 108 gc sec standard curve characteristics are described in the sm all negative controls ntcs extraction blanks filtration blanks were nd many of the samples that were positive for pathogens were below the loq 16 of samples n 9 were positive for nv gii but only one was above the loq in that sample nv gii concentration was 1 2 102 7 7 101 gc l and nv gii flux was 3 8 103 2 5 103 gc sec mean standard deviation of technical duplicates 5 of samples n 3 were positive for enterovirus but only one was above the loq in that sample ev concentration was 1 9 102 1 1 101 gc l and ev flux was 4 6 104 2 6 103 gc sec all samples that were positive for ev were on wet weather days because of inhibition adv had to be diluted 1 10 prior to qpcr which increased the limit of detection 14 of samples n 8 were positive for adenovirus and all were below the loq when data from all sampling dates were combined for each location only one site guadelupe river was positive for all four viruses steven s creek was positive for three viruses crassphage nv gii adv baker beach crassphage nv gii pilarcitos creek crassphage ev and san francisquito creek crassphage adv were positive for two viruses over the course of the study san pedro creek was only positive for one virus crassphage all six sites were positive for crassphage fig 2 3 1 3 associations between viruses or indicators and environmental variables gees revealed associations between environmental variables and pathogen occurrence in urban runoff samples table 2 adv occurrence was not significantly associated with any environmental variables ev occurrence was negatively associated with salinity indicating that fresher water rather than saline water from estuarine or marine waters was associated with the detection of ev nv gii occurrence was associated with undeveloped fraction of a watershed antecedent precipitation and turbidity risk ratios associated with these variables indicate that increasing the undeveloped fraction of a watershed decreases risk of occurrence of nv gii as does antecedent precipitation however increasing turbidity increases the risk of nv gii occurrence potentially pointing to particle association of nv gii in these samples when all pathogens were combined in a single binary dataset i e adv or nv gii or ev was detected for a given sample only salinity was significantly associated with the detection of a pathogen the risk ratio associated with salinity indicates that saline waters increased the risk of detecting a pathogen in these samples both the concentrations and flux of the viral indicator crassphage were not significantly associated with any of the variables in the model for fib flux and concentrations there was a positive association with antecedent precipitation taken together this is consistent with the conceptual model where increased precipitation and therefore runoff sweeps microbes to enter waterways further analysis of fib gee results and spatial analyses are detailed in the sm relationships between indicators and pathogens were explored using the point biserial correlation with site averaged indicator data and binary pathogen data for crassphage only adv had a statistically significant correlation rpb 0 97 95 ci 0 73 1 0 p 0 0015 ev and nv did not have a significant relationship with crassphage nor did the binary variable representing the presence of any of the three viral pathogens at a site over the duration of the study this was also true for correlations between e coli and adv rpb 0 89 95 ci 0 27 0 99 p 0 018 however no other viruses and the all virus variable had significant relationships enterococci had no statistically significant relationships with binary virus data 3 2 biofilter mesocosm experiments 3 2 1 tracer testing tracer tests were used qualitatively to monitor changes in hydraulic performance between construction and the end of challenge tests there were some changes in tracer test data between the first test and the second test figure s2 potentially due to development of plant root structures and or media shifting over time however the shifts in the curves for each biofilter were limited and indicated relatively small changes in hydraulic performance over the course of the study 3 2 2 challenge test rt qpcr results adv ev and ms2 were monitored in biofilter samples using rt qpcr concentrations of adv in the influent to the biofilters across the three challenge tests ranged from 3 5 106 to 2 6 107 gc l the range for ev in the influent was 8 4 104 to 3 2 105 gc l the concentration for ms2 in the influent ranged from 1 5 104 to 7 5 104 gc l breakthrough curves for ev are shown in fig 3 breakthrough curves for adv and ms2 are shown in figures s3 4 ntcs were negative for all viruses extraction blanks and filtration blanks were negative for adv and ev but five of twelve extraction blanks and one of three field blanks were positive for ms2 at low concentrations because the concentrations of ms2 in these negative controls were low relative to the very high concentrations of ms2 spiked into the influent and present in the effluent we proceeded to use the samples in our analyses 3 2 3 plaque assay results f coliphage concentrations in the influent to the biofilters ranged from 3 8 105 to 7 2 105 pfu l over the three challenge tests samples of the influent prior to spiking were assayed for f coliphage background concentrations were low but detectable 20 pfu l breakthrough curves for f coliphage are shown in figure s5 filtration blanks and method blanks were negative for f coliphage 3 2 4 log10 removal of viruses log10 removal of each virus was determined and compared between the vegetated and non vegetated groups for adv ev and f coliphage there was no significant difference between the vegetated and non vegetated groups welch s t test p 0 05 for ms2 there was improved removal in vegetated biofilters compared to non vegetated biofilters however the effect size was small 0 40 log10 units welch s t test p 0 004 when comparing the log10 removal of viruses adv vs ev vs ms2 the removals varied significantly fig 4 log10 removals for each virus were combined and were determined to be normally distributed and the mean log10 removal for adv was 3 2 95 ci 3 1 3 4 for ev was 1 1 95 ci 0 85 1 3 for ms2 measured by rt qpcr was 0 36 95 ci 0 21 0 51 and measured by plaque assay was 0 36 95 ci 0 13 0 58 mean log10 removal for each virus was significantly different from the others rm one way anova p 0 05 except for ms2 and f coliphage 4 discussion we aimed to characterize the occurrence of human viruses and fecal indicators in runoff and assess the performance of biochar amended vegetated biofilters in removing viruses from runoff as they are suggested to reduce the impact of runoff on surface waters we found widespread contamination of urban runoff in the san francisco bay area adv ev nv gii with human fecal origin given the high detection frequencies and concentrations of crassphage and fib all six sampling locations were positive for crassphage over the course of the study and 93 of the samples were above the loq moreover crassphage was positively correlated with the presence of human pathogen adv in the runoff samples while it is possible that fib come from non human sources viral fecal indicator crassphage has been shown to be a reliable indicator of human specific feces ahmed et al 2018 stachler et al 2017 although a recent study reported crassphage are also present in feces of cats li et al 2021 it is unclear whether the assay used herein would amplify feline crassphage notwithstanding this potential cross reactivity human fecal sources are likely responsible for the microbial pollution and viruses in the urban creeks studied here given the co occurrence of human viruses nucleic acids from all three viral human pathogens adv ev nv gii were found at five of the six urban creeks during over the course of the study when we investigated the impact of land cover precipitation and particle association on the occurrence of each viral pathogen and fecal indicator we found variable effects of each on viruses and indicators particle association which has been reported in other studies investigating pathogens in stormwater was evident for nv gii and e coli table 2 characklis et al 2005 cizek et al 2008 krometis et al 2007 schillinger and gannon 1985 increased undeveloped land cover in a watershed decreased the risk of detecting nv gii at our study sites since undeveloped land cover is inversely related to developed land cover see methods 1 6 this suggests urban land cover as a source of nv gii to urban creeks however this was not observed with the other viral pathogens when analyzed individually or compiled together into one dataset biochar amended biofilters represent a nature based approach for removing microbial pollutants from urban runoff lid is of substantial interest to municipalities due to its ability to reduce the volume of runoff in urbanized areas however its ability to improve the water quality of infiltrating runoff particularly by removing pathogens has not been widely assessed some studies have looked at the performance stormwater biofilter mesocosms in removing fib and bacterial pathogens but not viral pathogens afrooz et al 2018 chandrasena et al 2016 2012 kranner et al 2019 this study aimed to assess the effect of vegetation on the removal of viruses from urban stormwater runoff in biofilter mesocosms the average removal of each virus in the vegetated biofilter configuration was not significantly different from the average removal of each virus in the non vegetated biofilter configuration with the exception of ms2 which was slightly better removed in vegetated biofilter columns similarly others have observed no improvement in f coliphage removal in vegetated biofilters compared to non vegetated chandrasena et al 2017 li et al 2012b li et al concluded that vegetation may introduce media fissures through evapotranspiration and moisture loss which reduces virus removal because there was no significant difference between vegetated and non vegetated biofilters we grouped results together to test the impact of biofiltration on each virus we found that some viruses were more effectively removed than others the log10 removal of each virus from highest to lowest was adv ev ms2 because an adsorbent biochar was added to biofilter media attachment is likely partially responsible for the removal of adv and ev ms2 has a lower isoelectric point than adv and ev which could have affected its removal by attachment and contributed to the differences between the virus removals michen and graule 2010 however the role of attachment of viruses to biochar in stormwater biofilters has been questioned one study that employed batch and column experiments to examine attachment of coliphage to biochar amended sand found that viral attachment to biochar was negligible and that sand columns outperformed biochar amended columns in virus reduction sasidharan et al 2016 our study did not address this specifically and future studies should consider the effects of biochar biofilter media on the removal of various types of viruses inactivation likely also contributed to removal of adv and ev from biofilter effluent inactivation in both the liquid phase and solid phase is virus specific and highly dependent on temperature in porous media john and rose 2005 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 sidhu et al 2015 we were not able to assess the extent of liquid phase inactivation for adv and ev as rt qpcr was used to monitor effluent and has been shown to detect non infectious viruses sobsey et al 1998 however inactivation in either phase did not likely affect ms2 in this study given that there was no removal of ms2 as measured by rt qpcr nor f coliphage as measured by plaque assay furthermore the agreement between ms2 rt qpcr data and f coliphage plaque assay data presents the possibility that rt qpcr data may serve as an appropriate proxy for infectious ms2 in these experiments but future work should confirm this and investigate this relationship for other viruses straining and filtration occurs when viruses are constrained by size in biofilter media pores this is likely not the dominant mechanism of removal of the viruses due to their small sizes compared to the biofilter media grain size mcdowell boyer et al 1986 yet virus stocks generated from cell cultures like those used in our challenge experiments can produce highly aggregated viruses and or viruses that are attached to cellular debris sobsey et al 1991 young and sharp 1977 which could lead to removal via straining especially if aggregates are attached to solids in infiltrating water most likely it was a combination of mechanisms that removed adv and ev from the biofilters the dominant mechanisms were not examined in this study and future experiments should be carried out to explain how each mechanism influences removal of pathogenic viruses and indicators this can then further inform design and maintenance of biofilters to enhance virus removal knowledge of biofilter designs that promote virus inactivation for instance could be useful to irreversibly remove viral pathogens from infiltrating stormwater runoff in addition information on the adsorption of viruses to biochar amended biofilter media will be useful to determine the extent of viral attachment and detachment to and from biofilter media and can inform when biofilter media needs to be changed to ensure adequate performance there were some limitations to this study that could have affected the results presented herein although the gravity fed mesocosm biofilters in this study are more realistic than column studies with respect to their size and downflow design the flow of water through each was less precisely controlled there is a possibility that some of the biofilters had preferential flow paths that affected the removal of viruses tracer tests were performed to assess this possibility and we did not find evidence of this but the tracer influent itself di water with potassium bromide may have disrupted established biofilms and altered the flow of water through the biofilters additionally in the challenge tests we spiked the biofilter influent with lab cultured virus stocks at final concentrations higher than what we saw in our urban stormwater runoff observations lab cultured viruses may behave differently than endogenous viruses so the presented experiments may not reflect the virus removal of naturally occurring viruses however in order to construct breakthrough curves for each virus a higher concentration of each virus was needed and made spiking impossible to avoid 5 conclusions urban runoff is a source of fib and human viruses in the san francisco bay area human fecal contamination as indicated by widespread detection of human specific microbial source tracking marker crassphage which was correlated with adv detection in the stormwater samples appears to be the source of human viruses detected in this study this is consistent with a recent study investigating microbes in california urban stormwater runoff steele et al 2018 vegetation did not have a statistically significant effect on the removal of human viruses vegetated biofilters had slightly higher ms2 log10 removals than non vegetated when measured by rt qpcr difference 0 40 log10 units but when measured by plaque assay there was no difference in removal between the biofilter groups log10 removals of pathogenic viruses adv 3 2 ev 1 1 were significantly different than indicator ms2 removal using rt qpcr 0 36 removal using

16513,urban runoff is one of the greatest sources of microbial pollution to surface waters biofilters can limit the impact of stormwater runoff on surface water quality by diverting runoff from receiving waters however our understanding of how biofilter design choices including the addition of vegetation and geomedia may impact the removal of pathogens is lacking in this study we characterized viruses adenovirus enterovirus norovirus gii crassphage in san francisco bay area urban runoff and assessed the removal of lab cultured viruses ms2 adenovirus 2 coxsackievirus b5 from biochar amended biofilter mesocosms during challenge testing we quantified viruses using rt qpcr and f coliphage plaque assays we found that all the pathogenic viruses targeted were found at low concentrations adenovirus all positive samples were limit of quantification enterovirus limit of quantification 1 9 102 gc l norovirus gii limit of quantification 1 2 102 gc l in san francisco bay area urban runoff and the presence of norovirus gii in runoff was associated with developed land use and decreased precipitation biofilters had variable success in removing adenovirus enterovirus and ms2 from runoff in laboratory scale column experiments in addition there was no significant difference in the removal of each virus in vegetated versus non vegetated biofilters with the exception of ms2 which had slightly higher removal in vegetated biofilters 0 40 log10 units welch s t test p 0 004 when comparing removal of human viruses and viral indicators adenovirus and enterovirus were

development lid many cities are beginning to focus on nature based solutions to combat issues of pollution and large volumes of stormwater in highly urbanized areas hobbie and grimm 2020 in highly impervious cities lid aims to reduce runoff to a pre urbanized state by increasing the amount of stormwater that can infiltrate through permeable land cover and thereby reducing the transport of contaminants from impervious surfaces to nearby aquatic environments walsh et al 2005 biofilters a type of lid that is composed of porous natural media and vegetation are successful in reducing the volume of urban runoff clar et al 2004 to monitor the removal of pathogens in biofilters studies have used fib as process indicators however the fate and transport of viruses in the environment can be distinct from fib geldenhuys and pretorius 1989 noble et al 2001 pusch et al 2005 viruses are of particular importance because they are highly infectious and recalcitrant in the environment fong and lipp 2005 hall 2012 the addition of geomedia like biochar to biofilters has been shown to increase the removal of trace organic contaminants fib and bacteriophage ms2 from urban stormwater runoff kranner et al 2019 ulrich et al 2017 but the effect of adding vegetation to biofilters is less defined in biofilters specifically vegetation is thought to affect removal of microbial contaminants by enhancing mechanisms of removal such as filtration attachment decay and predation peng et al 2016 however there are only two studies to our knowledge that have examined the effect of vegetation in stormwater biofilters on removal of viruses chandrasena et al 2017 li et al 2012a in this study we characterized viruses in san francisco bay area urban runoff and assessed their removal in laboratory scale biofilters we first completed an observational field study aimed to answer the following questions at what concentrations fluxes and frequencies are viral human pathogens found in urban stormwater runoff in the san francisco bay area what are their relationships with land use and precipitation do fecal indicators correlate well with these viral human pathogens the results of the observation study informed experiments investigating the removal of these viruses in vegetated biochar amended biofilters we chose to use biochar amended biofilters as literature suggests that the presence of biochar can vastly improve pollutant removal capacity of biofilters boehm et al 2020 we aimed to answer the following questions does vegetation improve the performance of biofilters in removing viral pathogens is a model bacteriophage ms2 similarly removed when compared to viral pathogens the results of this study provide important information on the occurrence of human viruses in urban stormwater runoff and insights on the performance of biofilters in removing viruses from stormwater the data can inform risk assessments from exposure to stormwater and the design of biofilters respectively all data from this work is publicly available through the stanford digital repository https doi org 10 25740 pk916xf8847 2 methods 2 1 observational urban stormwater runoff study 2 1 1 urban stormwater runoff sample collection samples were collected from six creeks in the san francisco bay area three discharge to san francisco bay and three discharge to the pacific ocean all sites were visited approximately twice per month from october 2018 to march 2019 and all sites were visited on each sampling day n 9 one sample from one creek was lost during transport sampling commenced at 04 30 and ended by 09 00 a total of 53 unique sampling events defined as a time and location occurred and salinity turbidity and flowrate were measured for each sample as described in the sm approximately 10 of samples were collected in duplicate n 5 each collected at a unique sampling location sampling dates sites and precipitation details are described further in the sm and in table s1 2 1 2 e coli and enterococci enumeration e coli and enterococci were enumerated using epa method 1600 and 1603 respectively method 1600 2009 method 1603 2014 methods are described in detail in the sm 2 1 3 virus filtration viruses were concentrated from 10 l stormwater samples using electronegative filtration adapted from previous studies evaluating viral concentration methods katayama et al 2002 victoria et al 2009 two sites one bayside and one oceanside were chosen to estimate recovery of viruses by spiking surrogate virus ms2 into samples methods are detailed in the sm 2 1 4 nucleic acid extraction nucleic acids were extracted from filtration membranes in twelve batches of randomly selected membranes using the qiagen dna rna allprep powerviral kit with β mercaptoethanol several modifications were made to the manufacturer s recommendations bead beating time was increased to ten minutes to ensure complete lysis of virions and for samples that required the use of multiple filters membranes were extracted separately until the sample lysate is added to the qiagen spin column at this point multiple lysed solutions from a single sample were combined and added to one spin column extracts were eluted from spin columns with rnase free water in two rounds of 50 μl for a total extract volume of 100 μl per sample an extraction blank was run with every batch of extractions no membrane was added to a bead beating tube to control for contamination during the extraction process and this extraction blank was then processed along with the environmental samples all extracts were stored at 80 c until further processing maximum storage time 6 months 2 1 5 rt qpcr assays and inhibition assessment targeted viruses adenovirus a f enterovirus norovirus gii crassphage ms2 listed in table 1 were quantified in urban stormwater runoff using qpcr or rt qpcr assay characteristics including primer and probe concentrations are listed in the table two no template control ntc wells dna rna free water was substituted for template were included on every rt qpcr plate all samples were assayed in duplicate rt qpcr wells all assays were run on an applied biosystems steponeplus instrument thresholds and baselines were determined manually on the machine all samples with cqs less than 40 were considered positive the limit of detection lod for each assay was the theoretical concentration that would represent a cq of 40 the limit of quantification loq was set at the cq of the lowest standard measured for each rt qpcr target samples were considered below the limit of quantification blq if the average cq was higher than that of the lowest standard in the standard curve samples for which one of the technical replicates amplified but the other either was non detect nd or blq were substituted with half the value of the lod or loq respectively during data analysis if both technical replicates were negative then the sample was designated as a nd inhibition was assessed in a subset of samples further details are in the sm 2 1 6 spatial analysis and precipitation data all spatial analysis was performed using qgis the hydrologic unit classification huc 12 dataset from united states geological survey usgs was used to define the subwatershed boundaries land cover within each of the subwatersheds was determined using the national land cover database 2016 which classifies land cover into 17 categories homer et al 2020 jin et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the subwatershed map was clipped to the land cover raster data using qgis for the land cover analyses we used previously described methods walters et al 2011 in short the land cover classifications were subdivided into agricultural 81 82 forested 41 43 52 urban 21 24 and other 0 11 12 31 71 90 95 urban land cover area was normalized using subwatershed area resulting in a variable representing the fraction of a subwatershed that is considered developed an additional undeveloped land cover variable was calculated by subtracting the developed fraction from one antecedent precipitation data from the 24 h prior to sampling at each location was gathered from california nevada river forecast center for all sites noaa 2019 wet weather days were defined as days with precipitation greater than zero inches in the 24 h prior to sampling 2 1 7 data analysis because observations at sampling sites were repeated measures data generalized estimating equations gees in spss version 27 ibm were used to investigate how land cover precipitation and environmental variables were associated with virus concentrations fluxes or presence absence at each sampling point hardin 2005 gees are semi parametric models that do not assume response normality and provide population averaged effects of factors on an outcome they account for clustering by sample location and date which is required to control for correlation between samples at the same site and taken on the same day over the course of the study ballinger 2004 gees assume a correlated data structure correlated errors and do not need homogeneity of variance presence and magnitude of stormwater runoff was represented by antecedent precipitation increased sediment or suspended solids within a sample was represented by turbidity data fraction of a sample that was fresh rather than saline from tidal variations in creeks was represented by salinity and land cover was represented by the fraction of a watershed that was undeveloped undeveloped fraction of a watershed related to the developed fraction e g 1 developed fraction undeveloped fraction undeveloped fraction rather than developed fraction of a watershed was used in the model so that the model reference condition is a completely urbanized watershed and thus the model coefficients for the other independent variables represent their effects in this reference condition completely developed watershed to examine the association between environmental variables and binary virus variables coefficients from gees were log10 transformed to obtain odds ratios and risk ratios were approximated from odds ratios zhang and yu 1998 further details on gee analyses are in the sm the model considered whether covariate coefficients are significantly different from zero and if they are they are marked as significant results were considered significant if their respective p 0 05 for the gee results p 0 1 results are also discussed relationships between continuous indicator variables and binary viral pathogen variables were explored using the point biserial correlation which is calculated as the pearson s correlation coefficient but estimates the relationship between a continuous and dichotomous variable levine 1981 because there was spatial clustering in the dataset indicator variables were averaged by site yielding six site specific values for crassphage e coli and enterococci averages were log10 transformed and were confirmed to be normally distributed by examination of q q plots shown in figure s6 binary pathogen variables representing presence absence data for adv ev nv gii and any virus defined as the presence of any one of the human viral targets for each site were used for these analyses yielding six site specific binary values for each virus group if any of the samples from a given site were positive for a virus then the site was designated as a 1 for that virus if none of the samples from a given site were positive then the site was designated as a 0 for that virus 2 2 biofilter mesocosm experiments 2 2 1 overview of experimental design to investigate the effect of vegetation on the removal of viral pathogens in stormwater biofilters a study was designed using laboratory scale biofilter mesocosms for this purpose six biofilters were constructed of which three were planted with vegetation and three were left without vegetation biofilters underwent three experimental phases detailed in fig 1 construction and flushing conditioning and challenge testing construction and flushing lasted 9 weeks and consisted of constructing the pvc pipe columns according to previously described specifications ulrich et al 2017 adding biofilter media to each column adding plants to the vegetated column group juncus effusus spiralis a native californian grass and watering each column with 2 l of di water twice per week to flush fine particulates tracer tests were conducted at the beginning and end of the column experiments then to minimize start up effects of the columns on removal estimates during challenge tests and to simulate more realistic field conditions all columns underwent a period of conditioning when they were watered with 2 l of natural creek water twice per week for 21 weeks finally during the challenge test period all biofilters underwent three challenge tests using creek water that was spiked with laboratory cultivated virus stocks the effluent from these challenge tests was collected in fractions from each biofilter to determine removal of viruses from each biofilter all experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 c further information on biofilter construction and conditioning is detailed in the sm 2 2 2 biofilter challenge tests the day before each challenge test 56 l of natural creek water was collected in 10 hcl washed plastic carboys that were triple rinsed with creek water prior to taking the sample stocks of lab cultivated adenovirus adenovirus 2 atcc vr 846 enterovirus coxsackievirus b5 atcc vr 185 and ms2 atcc 15 597 b1 were spiked into the carboys and spiked creek water was held at 4 c for 18 20 h before the challenge tests viral cultivation methods in sm challenge tests were conducted three times with 4 5 days between each test columns were held under plant grow led lights kufung cat no b01ch75sgy between each challenge test on each challenge day biofilters were saturated with 1 pore volume pv of creek water then a 4 pv pulse of virus spiked creek water was applied to each biofilter which was then followed by 4 pvs of unspiked creek water to ensure that the effluent samples would capture the breakthrough and dissipation of the spiked viruses influent water was fed to the tops of columns using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 12 7 cm per hour with each event lasting less than 3 h for each biofilter effluent from each biofilter was collected in 0 5 pv increments in 500 ml autoclaved and acid washed polypropylene bottles tubing masterflex reg l s platinum cured silicon tubing size 15 cat no 96 410 15 was sterilized between challenge tests by soaking in 10 bleach then rinsing with di water within 48 h of collection each fraction from the column effluents as well as samples of the influent n 58 were filtered using two different techniques to concentrate viruses for i f coliphage plaque assays using previously described methods sinton et al 1996 and ii nucleic acid extraction using the same qiagen powerviral dna rna method as described in section 1 4 and subsequent virus detection using rt qpcr a filtration blank was done for both types of filtration techniques detailed above further details are in the sm 2 2 3 rt qpcr assays for biofilter samples and inhibition assessment details for the rt qpcr assays for adenovirus a f enterovirus and ms2 are listed in table 1 and are the same assays that were used for the observational stormwater study each sample was analyzed in technical duplicates on each rt qpcr plate duplicate ntc wells were also included on each plate rna dna free water was substituted for template a subset of samples were also checked for inhibition details are in the sm 2 2 4 data analysis breakthrough curves were constructed by dividing the concentration of each virus in each effluent fraction c by the concentration in the influent c0 and plotting against the pore volume pv standard deviations from concentration measurements for each effluent sample and the influent samples were propagated to obtain standard deviations for each c c0 data point taylor 1982 log10 removal values were calculated for each virus by log10 cmax c0 where cmax is the maximum concentration leaving the biofilter and c0 is the influent concentration for a given virus additional calculations examining the percent of viruses removed by biofilters using a mass balance approach mohanty et al 2014 sasidharan et al 2016 are provided in the sm normality was confirmed using q q plots see figure s7 welch s t test was used to compare the mean virus removals between the vegetated and non vegetated groups repeated measures one way anova was used to compare the mean virus removal between adv ev ms2 measured by rt qpcr and f coliphage measured by plaque assay 3 results 3 1 observational

bayside site the average recovery of ms2 was 11 4 9 3 mean standard deviation and at the oceanside site the average recovery was 9 8 5 8 when the rt qpcr results from samples from all sample replicates locations and dates were combined n 58 93 of samples were positive for crassphage crassphage concentrations average standard deviation ranged from 2 9 102 7 0 101 to 3 5 105 4 1 103 gc l and fluxes ranged from 4 1 102 1 6 102 to 2 6 109 2 0 108 gc sec standard curve characteristics are described in the sm all negative controls ntcs extraction blanks filtration blanks were nd many of the samples that were positive for pathogens were below the loq 16 of samples n 9 were positive for nv gii but only one was above the loq in that sample nv gii concentration was 1 2 102 7 7 101 gc l

was 1 9 102 1 1 101 gc l and ev flux was 4 6 104 2 6 103 gc sec all samples that were positive for ev were on wet weather days because of inhibition adv had to be diluted 1 10 prior to qpcr which increased the limit of detection 14 of samples n 8 were positive for adenovirus and all were below the loq when data from all sampling dates were combined for each location only one site guadelupe river was positive for all four viruses steven s creek was positive for three viruses crassphage nv gii adv baker beach crassphage nv gii pilarcitos creek crassphage ev and san francisquito creek crassphage adv were positive for two viruses over the course of the study san pedro creek was only positive for one virus crassphage all six sites were positive for crassphage fig 2 3 1 3 associations between viruses or indicators and environmental variables gees revealed associations between environmental variables and pathogen occurrence in urban runoff samples table 2 adv occurrence was not significantly associated with any environmental variables ev occurrence was negatively associated with salinity indicating that fresher water rather than saline water from estuarine or marine waters was associated with the detection of ev nv gii occurrence was associated with undeveloped fraction of a watershed antecedent precipitation and turbidity risk ratios associated with these variables indicate that increasing the undeveloped fraction of a watershed decreases risk of occurrence of nv gii as does antecedent precipitation however increasing turbidity increases the risk of nv gii occurrence potentially pointing to particle association of nv gii in these samples when all pathogens were combined in a single binary dataset i e adv or nv gii or ev was detected for a given sample only salinity was significantly associated with the detection of a pathogen the risk ratio associated with salinity indicates that saline waters increased the risk of detecting a pathogen in these samples both the concentrations and flux of the viral indicator crassphage were not significantly associated with any of the variables in the model for fib flux and concentrations there was a positive association with antecedent precipitation taken together this is consistent with the conceptual model where increased precipitation and therefore runoff sweeps microbes to enter waterways further analysis of fib gee results and spatial analyses are detailed in the sm relationships between indicators and pathogens were explored using the point biserial correlation with site averaged indicator data and binary pathogen data for crassphage only adv had a statistically significant correlation rpb 0 97 95 ci 0 73 1 0 p 0 0015 ev and nv did not have a significant relationship with crassphage nor did the binary variable representing the presence of any of the three viral pathogens at a site over the duration of the study this was also true for correlations between e coli and adv rpb 0 89 95 ci 0 27 0 99 p 0 018 however no other viruses and the all virus variable had significant relationships enterococci had no statistically significant relationships with binary virus data 3 2 biofilter mesocosm experiments 3 2 1 tracer testing tracer tests were used qualitatively to monitor changes in hydraulic performance between construction and the end of challenge tests there were some changes in tracer test data between the first test and the second test figure s2 potentially due to development of plant root structures and or media shifting over time however the shifts in the curves for each biofilter were limited and indicated relatively small changes in hydraulic performance over the course of the study 3 2 2 challenge test rt qpcr results adv ev and ms2 were monitored in biofilter samples using rt qpcr concentrations of adv in the influent to the biofilters across the three challenge tests ranged from 3 5 106 to 2 6 107 gc l the range for ev in the influent was 8 4 104 to 3 2 105 gc l the concentration for ms2 in the influent ranged from 1 5 104 to 7 5 104 gc l breakthrough curves for ev are shown in fig 3 breakthrough curves for adv and ms2 are shown in figures s3 4 ntcs were negative for all viruses extraction blanks and filtration blanks were negative for adv and ev but five of twelve extraction blanks and one of three field blanks were positive for ms2 at low concentrations because the concentrations of ms2 in these negative controls were low relative to the very high concentrations of ms2 spiked into the influent and present in the effluent we proceeded to use the samples in our analyses 3 2 3 plaque assay results f coliphage concentrations in the influent to the biofilters ranged from 3 8 105 to 7 2 105 pfu l over the three challenge tests samples of the influent prior to spiking were assayed for f coliphage background concentrations were low but detectable 20 pfu l breakthrough curves for f coliphage are shown in figure s5 filtration blanks and method blanks were negative for f coliphage 3 2 4 log10 removal of viruses log10 removal of each virus was determined and compared between the vegetated and non vegetated groups for adv ev and f coliphage there was no significant difference between the vegetated and non vegetated groups welch s t test p 0 05 for ms2 there was improved removal in vegetated biofilters compared to non vegetated biofilters however the effect size was small 0 40 log10 units welch s t test p 0 004 when comparing the log10 removal of viruses adv vs ev vs ms2 the removals varied significantly fig 4 log10 removals for each virus were combined and were determined to be normally distributed and the mean log10 removal for adv was 3 2 95 ci 3 1 3 4 for ev was 1 1 95 ci 0 85 1 3 for ms2 measured by rt qpcr was 0 36 95 ci 0 21 0 51 and measured by plaque assay was 0 36 95 ci 0 13 0 58 mean log10 removal for each virus was significantly different from the others rm one way anova p 0 05 except for ms2 and f coliphage 4 discussion we aimed to characterize the occurrence of human viruses and fecal indicators in runoff and assess the performance of biochar amended vegetated biofilters in removing viruses from runoff as they are suggested to reduce the impact of runoff on surface waters we found widespread contamination of urban runoff in the san francisco bay area adv ev nv gii with human fecal origin given the high detection frequencies and concentrations of crassphage and fib all six sampling locations were positive for crassphage over the course of the study and 93 of the samples were above the loq moreover crassphage was positively correlated with the presence of human pathogen adv in the runoff samples while it is possible that fib come from non human sources viral fecal indicator crassphage has been shown to be a reliable indicator of human specific feces ahmed et al 2018 stachler et al 2017 although a recent study reported crassphage are also present in feces of cats li et al 2021 it is unclear whether the assay used herein would amplify feline crassphage notwithstanding this potential cross reactivity human fecal sources are likely responsible for the microbial pollution and viruses in the urban creeks studied here given the co occurrence of human viruses nucleic acids from all three viral human pathogens adv ev nv gii were found at five of the six urban creeks during over the course of the study when we investigated the impact of land cover precipitation and particle association on the occurrence of each viral pathogen and fecal indicator we found variable effects of each on viruses and indicators particle association which has been reported in other studies investigating pathogens in stormwater was evident for nv gii and e coli table 2 characklis et al 2005 cizek et al 2008 krometis et al 2007 schillinger and gannon 1985 increased undeveloped land cover in a watershed decreased the risk of detecting nv gii at our study sites since undeveloped land cover is inversely related to developed land cover see methods 1 6 this suggests urban land cover as a source of nv gii to urban creeks however this was not observed with the other viral pathogens when analyzed individually or compiled together into one dataset biochar amended biofilters represent a nature based approach for removing microbial pollutants from urban runoff lid is of substantial interest to municipalities due to its ability to reduce the volume of runoff in urbanized areas however its ability to improve the water quality of infiltrating runoff particularly by removing pathogens has not been widely assessed some studies have looked at the performance stormwater biofilter mesocosms in removing fib and bacterial pathogens but not viral pathogens afrooz et al 2018 chandrasena et al 2016 2012 kranner et al 2019 this study aimed to assess the effect of vegetation on the removal of viruses from urban stormwater runoff in biofilter mesocosms the average removal of each virus in the vegetated biofilter configuration was not significantly different from the average removal of each virus in the non vegetated biofilter configuration with the exception of ms2 which was slightly better removed in vegetated biofilter columns similarly others have observed no improvement in f coliphage removal in vegetated biofilters compared to non vegetated chandrasena et al 2017 li et al 2012b li et al concluded that vegetation may introduce media fissures through evapotranspiration and moisture loss which reduces virus removal because there was no significant difference between vegetated and non vegetated biofilters we grouped results together to test the impact of biofiltration on each virus we found that some viruses were more effectively removed than others the log10 removal of each virus from highest to lowest was adv ev ms2 because an adsorbent biochar was added to biofilter media attachment is likely partially responsible for the removal of adv and ev ms2 has a lower isoelectric point than adv and ev which could have affected its removal by attachment and contributed to the differences between the virus removals michen and graule 2010 however the role of attachment of viruses to biochar in stormwater biofilters has been questioned one study that employed batch and column experiments to examine attachment of coliphage to biochar amended sand found that viral attachment to biochar was negligible and that sand columns outperformed biochar amended columns in virus reduction sasidharan et al 2016 our study did not address this specifically and future studies should consider the effects of biochar biofilter media on the removal of various types of viruses inactivation likely also contributed to removal of adv and ev from biofilter effluent inactivation in both the liquid phase and solid phase is virus specific and highly dependent on temperature in porous media john and rose 2005 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 sidhu et al 2015 we were not able to assess the extent of liquid phase inactivation for adv and ev as rt qpcr was used to monitor effluent and has been shown to detect non infectious viruses sobsey et al 1998 however inactivation in either phase did not likely affect ms2 in this study given that there was no removal of ms2 as measured by rt qpcr nor f coliphage as measured by plaque assay furthermore the agreement between ms2 rt qpcr data and f coliphage plaque assay data presents the possibility that rt qpcr data may serve as an appropriate proxy for infectious ms2 in these experiments but future work should confirm this and investigate this relationship for other viruses straining and filtration occurs when viruses are constrained by size in biofilter media pores this is likely not the dominant mechanism of removal of the viruses due to their small sizes compared to the biofilter media grain size mcdowell boyer et al 1986 yet virus stocks generated from cell cultures like those used in our challenge experiments can produce highly aggregated viruses and or viruses that are attached to cellular debris sobsey et al 1991 young and sharp 1977 which could lead to removal via straining especially if aggregates are attached to solids in infiltrating water most likely it was a combination of mechanisms that removed adv and ev from the biofilters the dominant mechanisms were not examined in this study and future experiments should be carried out to explain how each mechanism influences removal of pathogenic viruses and indicators this can then further inform design and maintenance of biofilters to enhance virus removal knowledge of biofilter designs that promote virus inactivation for instance could be useful to irreversibly remove viral pathogens from infiltrating stormwater runoff in addition information on the adsorption of viruses to biochar amended biofilter media will be useful to determine the extent of viral attachment and detachment to and from biofilter media and can inform when biofilter media needs to be changed to ensure adequate performance there were some limitations to this study that could have affected the results presented herein although the gravity fed mesocosm biofilters in this study are more realistic than column studies with respect to their size and downflow design the flow of water through each was less precisely controlled there is a possibility that some of the biofilters had preferential flow paths that affected the removal of viruses tracer tests were performed to assess this possibility and we did not find evidence of this but the tracer influent itself di water with potassium bromide may have disrupted established biofilms and altered the flow of water through the biofilters additionally in the challenge tests we spiked the biofilter influent with lab cultured virus stocks at final concentrations higher than what we saw in our urban stormwater runoff observations lab cultured viruses may behave differently than endogenous viruses so the presented experiments may not reflect the virus removal of naturally occurring viruses however in order to construct breakthrough curves for each virus a higher concentration of each virus was needed and made spiking impossible to avoid 5 conclusions urban runoff is a source of fib and human viruses in the san francisco bay area human fecal contamination as indicated by widespread detection of human specific microbial source tracking marker crassphage which was correlated with adv detection in the stormwater samples appears to be the source of human viruses detected in this study this is consistent with a recent study investigating microbes in california urban stormwater runoff steele et al 2018 vegetation did not have a statistically significant effect on the removal of human viruses vegetated biofilters had slightly higher ms2 log10 removals than non vegetated when measured by rt qpcr difference 0 40 log10 units but when measured by plaque assay there was

antibiotic resistant bacteria this work focuses on evaluating the changes of antibiotic resistance genes args and bacterial communities in a planted advanced biological wastewater treatment system abwwts under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline in the abwwts the removal rates of tetracycline ranged from 97 9 to 99 9 and a 17 2 decrease in the average removal rates of nh4 n was observed after the addition of tetracycline although the background of abwwts contributed to the args in effluents the concentration of 283 targeted args σargs was 83 5 lower in effluents than in influents after sub mic tetracycline exposure and the concentrations of σargs in the abwwts were on average 30 0 lower than those in an unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts after a performance of 130 days the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes increased within abwwts and ubwwts under tetracycline exposure after tetracycline exposure bacterial diversity in abwwts and ubwwts increased on average by 36 2 and 42 7 respectively and the abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone were more than 10 times higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts sub mic tetracycline concentrations were linearly correlated with the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in escherichia coli e coli long term exposure to tetracycline at the same concentration increased abundances of the same args i e tetr 02 and tetm 01 in e coli and the microflora of the abwwts revealing that sub mic tetracycline could increase the abundance of args in the abwwts by facilitating the vertical transfer of tetracycline resistance genes these findings demonstrated that planted abwwts played a positive role in removing args under low antibiotic selective pressure which was in accompany with increasing levels of corresponding args within the system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced biological wastewater treatment system selective pressure args bacterial diversity plants vertical transfer 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are considered to be one emerging contaminant pruden et al 2006 and represent a serious threat to human health args originate from microorganisms and the microbiome is a reservoir of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria as direct selective agents of antibiotic resistance antibiotics are emerging contaminants that can select antibiotic resistance at lethal or non lethal concentrations andersson and hughes 2012 lupo et al 2012 the removal of antibiotics by wastewater treatment plants wwtps can help eliminate the selection of antibiotics on args however conventional wwtps are not designed to remove emerging contaminants and wwtps are considered to be hotspots for the release of antibiotics and args in the environment michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 in particular args can never be eliminated from environments where bacterial communities exist and thus also occur in the secondary effluent of wwtps therefore it is essential to apply advanced wastewater treatment techniques to eliminate the risks of antibiotics and args from the secondary effluent of wwtps and to assess and improve the removal efficiency of args by treatment facilities would require the identification of the changes of args and bacterial communities in response to low antibiotic concentrations advanced treatment techniques are efficient at removing emerging contaminants for example advanced biological wastewater treatment systems abwwts e g constructed wetlands and biological filters based on ecological technologies are a green and low cost operation that allow the incorporation of multiple removal mechanisms chang et al 2019 he et al 2021 qian et al 2021 such systems have been increasingly used to remove antibiotics and args chen and zhang 2013 faleye et al 2019 lamba and ahammad 2017 pei et al 2019 sabri et al 2021 although multiple removal mechanisms broaden the types of target contaminants the removal of contaminants is heavily reliant upon nature based purification thus the removal efficiency of some specific contaminants is limited and there is much room for improvement in the removal efficiency of contaminants in abwwts plants media flow configuration and aeration can affect the removal of antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment processes avila et al 2021 chen et al 2017 chen et al 2016 he et al 2021 furthermore plants can alter the structure of the bacterial community in the environment through rhizosphere effects thereby altering the structure of the antibiotic resistome song et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 significant differences in the removal rates of args have been observed between planted and unplanted constructed wetlands chen et al 2016 optimizing the bioreactor configuration or the process configuration will facilitate an improvement in the removal efficiency of emerging contaminants by enhancing removal mechanisms such as biodegradation and adsorption a et al 2021 chen et al 2017 muller et al 2013 oberoi et al 2019 additionally antibiotics can affect the removal of n and p in bioreactors fan et al 2020 yang et al 2019a the presence of antibiotics in wastewater treatment systems endangers water quality thus it is necessary to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of contaminants under exposure to antibiotics in abwwts previous studies have shown that high concentrations in the mg l magnitude of antibiotics can increase the abundance of args and alter the microbiota structure in activated sludge reactors zhao et al 2019 importantly the selection and enrichment of antibiotic resistant bacteria is also a consequence of weak selective pressures of low antibiotic concentrations e g at the μg l magnitude andersson and hughes 2012 gullberg et al 2011 and low antibiotic concentrations have been reported to increase the abundance of args in effluents of membrane bioreactors song et al 2018 zarei baygi et al 2019 however information regarding the in situ influence of low antibiotic concentrations on antibiotic resistance in biological wastewater treatment systems is limited since the inflow of the systems often contains a combination of antibiotics it is difficult to identify the selection of a specific antibiotic on args furthermore the background of biological wastewater treatment systems contains abundant args and bacterial communities an et al 2018 guo et al 2017 yang et al 2019b zarei baygi et al 2019 zhang and zhang 2011 and the effects of low concentration antibiotics on the occurrence of args within abwwts remain unclear in this study an abwwts with an optimized bioreactor configuration and process configuration was constructed to treat secondary effluents with the addition of tetracycline coupled with an evolution experiment of escherichia coli e coli this study revealed the mechanism for the effects of sub mic tetracycline concentrations on args in abwwts the primary purposes of this study were to 1 assess the role of plants in the improvement of water quality and removal of emerging contaminants in abwwts 2 investigate the changes of args under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline in abwwts 3 investigate the changes of bacterial communities under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline in abwwts and 4 decipher the mechanisms underlying the effects of low tetracycline selective pressure on tetracycline resistance genes 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment systems setup abwwts was mainly composed of a surface plant area and a biological reaction area at the bottom no plants were included in an unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts the setups of the two systems were the same except the plants fig s1a emergent plants including reeds canna yellow calamus and barracuda grass were uniformly distributed in different zones of the abwwts limestone ceramsite and zeolite were placed in

coordinates analyses bray curtis distances and linear regression analyses were conducted based on r software 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of tetracycline fig 1 removal of tetracycline by the advanced biological wastewater treatment system abwwts and unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts as a function of time the concentrations of tetracycline in the effluents of the abwwts and ubwwts ranged from 0 02 to 0 61 μg l at stage ii day 40 130 fig 1 which were lower than the predicted no effect concentrations pnec of tetracycline for antibiotic resistance bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the levels of antibiotics were below detection limits of antibiotics at stage i day 0 40 the abwwts displayed high removal rates 97 9 99 9 of tetracycline compared to other biological wastewater treatment systems table s2 on day 130 the removal rates of tetracycline for the abwwts and ubwwts were 98 9 however differences in the removal rates of tetracycline between the abwwts and ubwwts were not significant fig s2a p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test similar results were also reported for constructed wetlands fernandes et al 2015 there were no significant differences in the ratios of tetracycline to cod between the abwwts and ubwwts fig s2b p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test the results demonstrated that the presence of plants did not significantly improve the removal efficiency of tetracycline which was largely dependent on the biodegradation of biofilm attached to the substrate and filter adsorption a et al 2021 chen et al 2016 the average concentration of tetracycline gradually decreased from the influent to the effluent of the two systems fig s2c the most obvious decline in the concentrations of tetracyclines was observed in the aerobic zone followed by the facultative aerobic zone and the anaerobic zone between the two systems fig s2c the aerobic zone accounted for 82 8 and 87 4 of the removal of tetracycline for the ubwwts and the abwwts respectively as aeration could promote the removal of pharmaceuticals avila et al 2021 3 2 improvements of water quality fig 2 removal of tp a tn b and nh4 n c by the advanced biological wastewater treatment systems abwwts and unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts as a function of time the average concentrations of tp tn and nh4 n were lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts table s3 the removal rates of tp tn and nh4 n were significantly higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts fig s3 p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test which indicated that the presence of plants facilitated the improvement of water quality the average removal rates of tp tn and nh4 n for the abwwts were 65 2 53 6 and 65 6 respectively which were comparable to those reported for other wastewater treatment systems table s4 reeds and pike grass could absorb n compounds and a recent report also pointed out that mixed macrophyte species could improve the removal rates of tn in constructed wetlands zhang et al 2021 meanwhile do can facilitate the removal of n in constructed wetlands lu et al 2020 and ammonia oxidizing bacteria could efficiently oxidize ammonia under aerobic conditions plants provide o and attachment points for microorganisms and create redox conditions in the bottom substrates thereby favoring the microbiological degradation of ammonia compounds and the sorption of phosphorus paranychianakis et al 2016 substrates and biofilms attached to substrates can adsorb phosphorus and transform organic substances into inorganic substances that can support plant growth vohla et al 2011 the removal rates of tp stabilized in the absence of tetracycline fig 2a with average values of 63 6 and 38 5 for abwwts and ubwwts respectively after the addition of tetracycline the removal rates of tp for the abwwts and ubwwts fluctuated around 63 6 and 38 5 respectively fig 2a these results differed from those of a previous study which showed that the addition of antibiotics in the mg l magnitude significantly inhibited the removal of soluble orthophosphorus in activated sludge reactors by inhibiting metabolic enzymes of phosphate accumulating organisms paos wu et al 2021 the possible reason could be that the concentrations i e magnitude of ng l or μg l of tetracycline within the system were too low to inhibit the metabolic enzymes of paos furthermore tetracycline does not contain p therefore it is reasonable to assume that the antibiotic did not have an obvious impact on tp content however tetracycline contains nitrogen and degradation of tetracycline might therefore produce nh4 n accordingly the average removal rates of tn and nh4 n in the ubwwts decreased by 12 4 and 33 4 with the addition of tetracycline respectively similar results were reported by guo et al 2020 in the abwwts the removal rates of tn did not substantially decline with the addition of tetracycline fig 2b while the average removal rate of nh4 n decreased by 17 2 with the addition of tetracycline fig 2c 3 3 dynamic patterns of args mges and 16s rrna fig 3 variations of args mges and 16s rrna in the influent the effluent the advanced biological wastewater treatment system abwwts and the unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts a ratios of concentrations of args mges and 16s rrna in the effluent to those in the influent b temporal variations of args classes within the two systems c spatial distributions of total targeted args within the two systems a1 the aerobic zone a2 the facultative anaerobic zone a3 or a4 the anaerobic zone 3 3 1 changes of args among the 283 targeted arg subtypes 158 were detected using ht qpcr in ubwwts fig s4 and all arg classes were found in the effluents at day 130 fig s4 on days 0 and 40 the same arg classes showed positive increasing ratios from influents to effluents fig 3a and the same args classes aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes were dominant fig 3b the number of args increased from 52 in influents to 88 in effluents at day 0 and from 58 in influents to 99 in effluents at day 40 after the addition of tetracycline negative increasing ratios of five args classes from influents to effluents were observed fig 3a and the dominant args in the ubwwts shifted from aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes to those conferring resistance to sulfonamide and tetracycline fig 3b suggesting that sub mic tetracycline exposure has a major influence on the arg composition within ubwwts the concentrations of the total targeted args σargs increased between the facultative anaerobic zone and the anaerobic zone after the addition of tetracycline fig 3c although the concentrations of σargs decreased from 2 5 107 copies ml in the influent to 2 0 107 copies ml in the effluent at day 130 the concentration of σargs in the effluent increased from 5 6 106 copies ml at day 40 to 2 0 107 copies ml at day 130 under sub mic tetracycline exposure hence ubwwts did not display a high removal rate of σargs in total 148 out of the 283 arg subtypes were found in abwwts fig s5 consistent with the ubwwts increasing rates of args from the influent to the effluent showed the same trend between day 0 and day 40 fig 3a and arg compositions were similar between day 0 and day 40 fig 3b the number of args also showed an upward trend from the influent to the effluent at day 0 and day 40 reflecting the contributions of the background of abwwts to the antibiotic resistome in effluents in contrast to ubwwts abwwts showed constant arg compositions between day 40 and day 130 fig 3b while the most abundant arg classes for the abwwts were the same genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside multidrug and beta lactamase between stage i day 0 40 and stage ii day 40 130 the concentrations of σargs were 29 3 times and 51 7 times higher in effluents than in influents for day 0 and day 40 respectively the increase 1050 4 fold in the concentrations of σargs in influents was far greater than that 2 3 fold in the concentrations of σargs in effluents from day 40 to day 130 accordingly the concentrations of σargs were 83 5 lower in effluents than in influents at day 130 and similar removal efficiencies of total args were reported for hybrid constructed wetlands and advanced oxidation units chen et al 2019a hou et al 2019 therefore an upward trend in the concentrations of args from influents to effluents was reversed by abwwts under sub mic tetracycline exposure although there was an increase in the concentration of σargs in the facultative anaerobic zone and the anaerobic zone from day 0 to day 40 as well as from day 0 to day 130 fig 3c the average increase 2 7 fold in the concentrations of σargs in the four zones of abwwts was substantially lower than the increase 1050 4 fold in the concentrations of σargs in the influent from day 40 to day 130 hence the increase in the levels of σargs in wastewater were inhibited under subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline which was likely related to the accumulation of the args on substrates song et al 2018 for example the concentrations of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside multidrug beta lactamase mlsb flor chlor am phenicol and vancomycin decreased in the abwwts from day 40 to day 130 even though the concentrations of sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes increased in the presence of tetracycline fig 3b in line with the concentrations of σargs the relative abundance of σargs was 77 0 lower in the effluent than in the influent at day 130 fig s6 reflecting abwwts contributed to eliminations of args in wastewater 3 3 2 optimized configurations for the removal of args the concentrations of σargs in the aerobic zone the facultative anaerobic zone and the anaerobic zone were on average 30 0 lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts after a performance of 130 days fig 3c while the abundance of σargs was on average 54 0 lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at day 130 fig s6 furthermore the logarithmic increasing rates of args were significantly lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at day 130 p 0 05 paired t test when the concentration and abundance of σargs in the effluent of the abwwts were 92 8 and 78 7 lower than those of the ubwwts respectivley taken together these results indicated that abwwts exhibited a higher efficiency in removing args from wastewater compared to ubwwts which could be associated with the presence of plants in abwwts chen and zhang 2013 also found that the planted constructed wetland contributed to a more significant removal of args compared to the biological aerated filter and uv disinfector in the advanced treatment process in the ubwwts a 42 9 and 49 6 reduction in the concentration and abundance of σargs were observed in the aerobic zone from day 0 to day 40 respectively fig 3c and fig s6 reflecting the negative impact of aerobic conditions on the occurrence of args in wastewater likewise the concentration and abundance of σargs decreased by 32 5 and 24 5 in the aerobic zone of the abwwts from day 0 to day 40 respectively moreover a 72 6 and 33 2 decrease in the concentration and abundance of σargs were observed in the aerobic zone of the abwwts from day 40 to day 130 respectively these results were in accordance with previous studies showing that aerobic reactors had a better removal efficiency for args compared to anaerobic reactors christgen et al 2015 lamba and ahammad 2017 additionally the concentration and abundance of σargs in both abwwts and ubwwts showed a descending trend from the aerobic zone to the facultative anaerobic zone followed by an upward trend from the facultative anaerobic zone to the anaerobic zone fig 3c and fig s6 partially because anaerobic conditions could efficiently favor the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria compared to semi aerobic conditions threedeach et al 2012 the results also suggest that facultative anaerobic treatment might play an essential role in the removal of args from wastewater 3 3 3 changes of mges and 16s rrna mges and bacteria play important roles in the horizontal transfer of args in various environmental settings clinic int1 has been suggested as an indicator for the removal efficiency of args in the wwtp based on correlations of integron integrase genes with args zheng et al 2020 twelve mges including integron integrase genes and transposase genes were selected in this study due to the limitation of the primer selection and ht qpcr the total selected mges σmges and 16s rrna showed positive increasing ratios from the influent to the effluent of the abwwts on days 0 and 40 fig 3a however negative increasing ratios of both σmges and 16s rrna from the influent to the effluent of the abwwts were observed on day 130 fig 3a importantly clinic int1 was removed from the abwwts on day 130 zheng et al 2020 furthermore the concentration and abundance of σmges in the effluent of the abwwts decreased by 10 2 and 43 7 after 130 days respectively fig s7 and fig s8 which could lead to a decrease in the potential for horizontal transfer of args in effluents additionally the concentrations of 16s rrna in abwwts were similar for day 0 and day 40 fig s9 and the average concentrations of 16s rrna in the abwwts decreased by 74 1 from day 40 to day 130 in accordance with args 16s rrna had the lowest concentration in the facultative anaerobic zone in the abwwts after a performance of 130 days fig s9 implying the args carrying microorganisms could be retained in the substrates of the zone the spatial distribution of 16s rrna in abwwts differed from that in ubwwts fig s9 in contrast to the ubwwts the increasing rates of 16s rrna from influents to effluents were negative for the abwwts at day 130 fig 3a which could result from the presence of plants 3 4 changes of bacterial community fig 4 structures of bacterial community in the influent the

and ubwwts fig 4a the main bacterial phyla in the two systems were proteobacteria with average relative abundances of 26 6 and 32 7 for ubwwts and abwwts respectively at the genus level the bacterial community at day 0 and day 40 clustered together while there was a slight shift in bacterial communities for the two systems from day 40 to day 130 fig 4b there were no significant differences in the shannon index of the bacterial community in the systems between day 0 and day 40 fig s10 p 0 05 paired t test however after the addition of tetracycline the shannon index of the bacterial community increased on average by 36 2 and 42 7 for abwwts and ubwwts respectively fig s10 consistent results were also found in a constructed wetland in which tetracycline led to higher microbial diversity and richness guo et al 2020 previous results have shown that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can lead to the occurrence of mutant antibiotic resistant strains kohanski et al 2010 while antibiotics can be utilized by microorganisms as a c source or n source to support the growth of bacteria muller et al 2013 taken together these results suggest that sub mic tetracycline exposure could be related to an increase in the diversity of the bacterial community in the two systems for the ubwwts the bacterial composition was similar for days 0 and 40 fig 4a the bacterial community in the effluents mainly arose from the facultative anaerobic zone fig 4c the shannon index of the bacterial community in effluents was 2 5 and 2 7 for day 0 and day 40 respectively however a 1 6 fold increase in the shannon index of the bacterial community was observed in the effluents from day 40 to day 130 proteobacteria and firmicutes contain important members that are prone to acquire args berendonk et al 2015 among the four zones of ubwwts no significant changes in the relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes occurred from day 0 to day 40 while there was an increase in the relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes in ubwwts with the addition of tetracycline fig 4a at the genus level the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria e g nitrosomonas and nitrospira increased in the aerobic zone from day 40 to day 130 table s5 which might be involved in the removal of nitrogen compounds the abundance of candidatus accumulibacter remained stable in the anaerobic zone from day 0 to day 40 while the abundance of candidatus accumulibacter increased after the addition of tetracycline for the abwwts the bacterial composition was similar for days 0 and 40 fig 4a the proportions of the anaerobic zone source of bacterial communities in effluents were similar for days 0 and 40 increasing from 14 5 at day 40 to 57 7 at day 130 fig 4c the shannon index of the bacterial community in effluents was 2 6 and 2 5 for day 0 and day 40 respectively and a 2 1 fold increase in the shannon index of the bacterial community was found in the effluent after the addition of tetracycline consistent with the ubwwts abwwts exhibited an elevated relative abundance of firmicutes in all the zones tetracycline could significantly increase the relative abundance of firmicutes after exposure for 40 days jung et al 2018 which may be ascribed to the fact that most of the members of firmicutes can produce spores and resist dehydration and extreme environments at the genus level tolumonas pseudarcobacter and lactococcus had the highest relative abundances table s5 lactococcus was absent in the abwwts at day 0 and day 40 but was observed in all zones of abwwts at day 130 table s5 similar results were also reported in a sequencing batch reactor sbr where lactococcus became the dominant bacteria after tetracycline exposure for 60 days wang et al 2018 tetracycline could select for lactococcus bacteria whereas members of lactococcus could carry tetracycline resistance genes and develop resistance to oxytetracycline kim et al 2004 a relatively higher relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone was observed on day 130 compared to day 40 which was consistent with the results obtained in ubwwts on day 0 nitrosomonas had the higher abundance in the roots of plants reeds cannas yellow calamus and barracuda grass than that in the wastewater from the aerobic zone table s5 while the abundance of nitrospira was higher in the roots of canna and barracuda grass than in the wastewater from the aerobic zone at day 130 the abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone were more than 10 times higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts table s5 these results reflected that the presence of plants could facilitate the nitrification by regulating the bacterial community the abundance of denitrifying bacteria i g thermomonas and denitratisoma was not higher in the roots of plants than in the wastewater of the anaerobic zone at day 0 table s5 while the abundance of thermomonas and denitratisoma in the anaerobic zone were higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at day 130 no members of candidatus accumulibacter were found in the roots of plants and candidatus accumulibacter was not found in the abwwts at day 130 and the average abundance of candidatus accumulibacter in the anaerobic zone was lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at days 0 40 and 130 these results indicate that the release of phosphorus by paos is limited in the presence of plants 3 5 effects of sub mic tetracycline on tetracycline resistance genes fig 5 occurrence of tetracycline resistance genes in the influent the

relative abundance in the two systems at day 130 for the ubwwts differences in the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes were not significant for day 0 and day 40 p 0 05 paired t test however a higher relative abundance of the total selected tetracycline resistance genes σtetracycline resistance genes was found in four zones of ubwwts at day 130 compared to day 40 or day 0 fig 5b before the addition of tetracycline σtetracycline resistance genes had the highest abundance in the anaerobic zone 2 0 10 2 copy 16s rrna at day 0 and 2 3 10 2 copy 16s rrna at day 40 followed by the facultative anaerobic zone 4 3 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 0 and 7 0 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 40 and the aerobic area 4 4 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 0 and 4 0 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 40 fig 5b the results were consistent with the observation that five out of six tetracycline resistance genes in the sequential bioreactor had a lower relative abundance in the aerobic treatment than that in the anaerobic treatment gao et al 2018 a previous study also showed that limited oxygen conditions could promote the occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance bacteria threedeach et al 2016 however after tetracycline exposure of 90 days the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes followed the order aerobic zone 1 1 copy 16s rrna facultative anaerobic zone 7 6 10 2 copy 16s rrna anaerobic zone 7 5 10 2 copy 16s rrna fig 5b the spatial distribution of σtetracycline resistance genes at day 130 was consistent with the spatial variation of tetracycline in the ubwwts fig 5b and fig s2c therefore it s reasonable to suppose that the sub mic tetracycline exposure was related to the spatial distribution of tetracycline resistance genes in the ubwwts with regard to the abwwts differences in the relative abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes were not significant between day 0 and day 40 p 0 05 paired t test and elevated relative abundances of σtetracycline resistance genes were found in four zones of abwwts after sub mic tetracycline exposure consistent with the ubwwts the spatial distribution of σtetracycline resistance genes aerobic zone facultative anaerobic zone anaerobic zone in abwwts was also in agreement with that of tetracycline on day 130 fig 5b and fig s2c suggesting that tetracycline enriched tetracycline resistance genes in the biological wastewater treatment facilities similarly chen et al 2019b determined a strong positive correlation between the abundance of tetm and the concentration of tetracycline in composting products furthermore tetg 02 teta 02 tetg 01 and tetr 02 had the highest abundances in effluents during the period from day 0 to day 130 and the abundance of teta 02 tetg 01 and tetr 02 increased in all zones after the tetracycline exposure tet 34 and tetd 02 were not detected in any zones before the addition of tetracycline or the influents after the addition of tetracycline the emergence of tetd 02 and tet 34 in effluents at day 130 reflected the selective pressure of tetracycline on antibiotic resistance mutations in abwwts these findings indicated that sub mic tetracycline exposure was associated with the emergence and elevated abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in effluents additionally numbers and concentrations of tetracycline resistance genes were higher in effluents than in influents on day 0 fig 5a and fig s11 demonstrating that the resistome background in the abwwts contributed to the occurrence of tetracycline resistance genes in the effluents however the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes in effluents was 86 1 lower than that in influents at day 130 fig 5b in particular tetg 02 dominated the tetracycline resistance genes in effluents at day 40 while a 54 0 reduction in the abundance of tetg 02 from the influent to the effluent was observed on day 130 consequently the abwwts played a positive role in removing tetracycline resistance genes from wastewater regardless of the contributions of the background of abwwts to args in effluents in addition differences in the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes were not significant between abwwts and ubwwts at day 0 p 0 5 paired t test after a permormance of 130 days the abundances of σtetracycline resistance genes were relatively lower in the abwwts compared to the ubwwts fig 5c while the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes in effluents of the abwwts was 78 5 lower than that in effluents of the ubwwts these results suggest that the presence of plants was related to the removal of tetracycline resistance genes from wastewater meanwhile there was a 24 9 reduction in the average concentrations of σtetracycline resistance genes in the abwwts from day 0 to day 40 despite the purification process the concentrations of σtetracycline resistance genes in the abwwts were relatively higher at day 130 compared to day 0 or day 40 fig s11 reflecting the positive impact of tetracycline on the tetracycline resistance genes 3 6 effects of tetracycline on vertical transfer of tetracycline resistance genes fig 6 effects of tetracycline on the tetracycline resistance genes a linear relationship of the concentration of tetracycline with the relative abundance of total selected tetracycline resistance genes in e coli b the number of tetracycline resistance genes in e coli under different concentrations of tetracycline to confirm the mechanisms underlying the effects of sub mic tetracycline exposure on tetracycline resistance genes bacterial passage experiments were conducted over a period of 30 days the selected subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline covered those observed in the abwwts the selected tetracycline resistance genes in the e coli strain did not exhibit obvious changes in the relative abundance 3 7 10 5 copy 16s rrna vs 3 1 10 5 copy 16s rrna or numbers 1 vs 2 in the control group without tetracycline after 30 days however the addition of tetracycline increased the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes which were positively correlated with the concentrations of tetracycline fig 6a tetracycline exposure for 30 days also led to a slight increase in the number of tetracycline resistance genes fig 6b the results suggested that low tetracycline concentrations increased the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes by enriching the antibiotic resistance mutation gullberg et al 2011 additionally after sub mic tetracycline exposure tetpb 01 which was detected in the quality control strain showed a 6 3 fold and 12 5 fold increase in the abundance under 0 02 and 0 2 μg l of tetracycline respectively notably the concentrations were lower than the pnec of tetracycline for antibiotic resistance development bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 indicating that antibiotic resistance development was not exclusive to an increase in the abundance of args in addition to the single strain sub mic tetracycline exposure could increase the abundance of tet genes in aquatic biofilms lundstrom et al 2016 furthermore tetm 01 and tetr 02 were the main tetracycline resistance genes in e coli fig 5a and their abundances increased after exposure to tetracycline at 20 μg l indicating that sub mic tetracycline exposure could facilitate the vertical transfer of tetr 02 and tetm 01 in the single bacterial system likewise the abundance of both tetr 02 and tetm 01 increased in the four zones of the abwwts after exposure to tetracycline 20 μg l these results implied that the vertical transfer of genes could lead to the increase in the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes not only in single bacterial systems but also in complex aquatic bacterial communities of the abwwts under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline 4 conclusions this study deciphered the changes of args and bacterial communities in biological wastewater treatment systems under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline the main conclusions are as follows abwwts that integrate hybrid ecological technologies exhibited good performance regarding removal of tp tn nh4 n and tetracycline from the secondary effluent additional experimental replicates on abwwts integrating different configurations need to be performed to further optimize the removal efficiency of contaminants abwwts reduced the concentrations of σargs in terms of influents even though the antibiotic resistome background of the bioreactor and tetracycline selective pressure contributed to the increase in the levels of σargs in abwwts the addition of vegetation and aerobic treatment could be optimized configurations for removing args from wastewater in biological wastewater treatment systems the diversity of bacterial communities and the relative abundance of firmicutes in the abwwts and ubwwts increased after the addition of sub mic tetracycline the abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone were higher in abwwts than in ubwwts on day 130 which could be attributable to the presence of plants in abwwts long term sub mic tetracycline exposure was associated with an increase in the relative abundance and concentration of tetracycline resistance genes in biological wastewater treatment systems the weakened selective pressure of antibiotics at low concentrations contributes to the vertical transfer of args in single bacterial systems and complex aquatic bacterial communities appealing for attention to the propagation of args in wastewater treatment processes furthermore exposure of tetracycline at concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 20 μg l could still increase the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in e coli systems explaining why the removal efficiency of args was not high in the wastewater treatment systems containing antibiotics to achieve complete removal of antibiotics and args physical technologies such as membrane separation unit could be integrated into the advanced biological

16514,effluents of conventional wastewater treatment systems contain antibiotic residues at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentrations mic which nevertheless could still select for antibiotic resistant bacteria this work focuses on evaluating the changes of antibiotic resistance genes args and bacterial communities in a planted advanced biological wastewater treatment system abwwts under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline in the abwwts the removal rates of tetracycline ranged from 97 9 to 99 9 and a 17 2 decrease in the average removal rates of nh4 n was observed after the addition of tetracycline although the background of abwwts contributed to the args in effluents the concentration of 283 targeted args σargs was 83 5 lower in effluents than in influents after sub mic tetracycline exposure and the concentrations of σargs in the abwwts were on average 30 0 lower than those in an unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts after a performance of 130 days the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes increased within abwwts and ubwwts under tetracycline exposure after tetracycline exposure bacterial diversity in abwwts and ubwwts increased on average by 36 2 and 42 7 respectively and the abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone were more than 10 times higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts sub mic tetracycline concentrations were linearly correlated with the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in escherichia coli e coli long term exposure to tetracycline at the same concentration increased abundances of the same args i e tetr 02 and tetm 01 in e coli and the microflora of the abwwts revealing that sub mic tetracycline could increase the abundance of args in the abwwts by facilitating the vertical transfer of tetracycline resistance genes these findings demonstrated that planted abwwts played a positive role in removing args under low antibiotic selective pressure which was in accompany with increasing levels of corresponding args within the system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced biological wastewater treatment system selective pressure args bacterial diversity plants vertical transfer 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are considered to be one emerging contaminant pruden et al 2006 and represent a serious threat to human health args originate from microorganisms and the microbiome is a reservoir of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria as direct selective agents of antibiotic resistance antibiotics are emerging contaminants that can select antibiotic resistance at lethal or non lethal concentrations andersson and hughes 2012 lupo et al 2012 the removal of antibiotics by wastewater treatment plants wwtps can help eliminate the selection of antibiotics on args however conventional wwtps are not designed to remove emerging contaminants and wwtps are considered to be hotspots for the release of antibiotics and args in the environment michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 in particular args can never be eliminated from environments where bacterial communities exist and thus also occur in the secondary effluent of wwtps therefore it is essential to apply advanced wastewater treatment techniques to eliminate the risks of antibiotics and args from the secondary effluent of wwtps and to assess and improve the removal efficiency of args by treatment facilities would require the identification of the changes of args and bacterial communities in response to low antibiotic concentrations advanced treatment techniques are efficient at removing emerging contaminants for example advanced biological wastewater treatment systems abwwts e g constructed wetlands and biological filters based on ecological technologies are a green and low cost operation that allow the incorporation of multiple removal mechanisms chang et al 2019 he et al 2021 qian et al 2021 such systems have been increasingly used to remove antibiotics and args chen and zhang 2013 faleye et al 2019 lamba and ahammad 2017 pei et al 2019 sabri et al 2021 although multiple removal mechanisms broaden the types of target contaminants the removal of contaminants is heavily reliant upon nature based purification thus the removal efficiency of some specific contaminants is limited and there is much room for improvement in the removal efficiency of contaminants in abwwts plants media flow configuration and aeration can affect the removal of antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment processes avila et al 2021 chen et al 2017 chen et al 2016 he et al 2021 furthermore plants can alter the structure of the bacterial community in the environment through rhizosphere effects thereby altering the structure of the antibiotic resistome song et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 significant differences in the removal rates of args have been observed between planted and unplanted constructed wetlands chen et al 2016 optimizing the bioreactor configuration or the process configuration will facilitate an improvement in the removal efficiency of emerging contaminants by enhancing removal mechanisms such as biodegradation and adsorption a et al 2021 chen et al 2017 muller et al 2013 oberoi et al 2019 additionally antibiotics can affect the removal of n and p in bioreactors fan et al 2020 yang et al 2019a the presence of antibiotics in wastewater treatment systems endangers water quality thus it is necessary to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of contaminants under exposure to antibiotics in abwwts previous studies have shown that high concentrations in the mg l magnitude of antibiotics can increase the abundance of args and alter the microbiota structure in activated sludge reactors zhao et al 2019 importantly the selection and enrichment of antibiotic resistant bacteria is also a consequence of weak selective pressures of low antibiotic concentrations e g at the μg l magnitude andersson and hughes 2012 gullberg et al 2011 and low antibiotic concentrations have been reported to increase the abundance of args in effluents of membrane bioreactors song et al 2018 zarei baygi et al 2019 however information regarding the in situ influence of low antibiotic concentrations on antibiotic resistance in biological wastewater treatment systems is limited since the inflow of the systems often contains a combination of antibiotics it is difficult to identify the selection of a specific antibiotic on args furthermore the background of biological wastewater treatment systems contains abundant args and bacterial communities an et al 2018 guo et al 2017 yang et al 2019b zarei baygi et al 2019 zhang and zhang 2011 and the effects of low concentration antibiotics on the occurrence of args within abwwts remain unclear in this study an abwwts with an optimized bioreactor configuration and process configuration was constructed to treat secondary effluents with the addition of tetracycline coupled with an evolution experiment of escherichia coli e coli this study revealed the mechanism for the effects of sub mic tetracycline concentrations on args in abwwts the primary purposes of this study were to 1 assess the role of plants in the improvement of water quality and removal of emerging contaminants in abwwts 2 investigate the changes of args under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline in abwwts 3 investigate the changes of bacterial communities under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline in abwwts and 4 decipher the mechanisms underlying the effects of low tetracycline selective pressure on tetracycline resistance genes 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment systems setup abwwts was mainly composed of a surface plant area and a biological reaction area at the bottom no plants were included in an unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts the setups of the two systems were the same except the plants fig s1a emergent plants including reeds canna yellow calamus and barracuda grass were uniformly distributed in different zones of the abwwts limestone ceramsite and zeolite were placed in the two systems at a height of 10 cm and suspended fiber balls were placed in the two systems at a height of 40 cm the two systems were 1 m high and the diameters of the outer ring inner ring and

the systems had been running for about one year in accompany with the input of the artificial wastewater before the experiment at stage i day 0 40 the two systems ran in accordance with the input of the synthetic influent without tetracycline in stage ii day 40 130 tetracycline solution was added to the influents to ensure that the concentration of tetracycline in the influents of the two systems

coordinates analyses bray curtis distances and linear regression analyses were conducted based on r software 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of tetracycline fig 1 removal of tetracycline by the advanced biological wastewater treatment system abwwts and unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts as a function of time the concentrations of tetracycline in the effluents of the abwwts and ubwwts ranged from 0 02 to 0 61 μg l at stage ii day 40 130 fig 1 which were lower than the predicted no effect concentrations pnec of tetracycline for antibiotic resistance bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the levels of antibiotics were below detection limits of antibiotics at stage i day 0 40 the abwwts displayed high removal rates 97 9 99 9 of tetracycline compared to other biological wastewater treatment systems table s2 on day 130 the removal rates of tetracycline for the abwwts and ubwwts were 98 9 however differences in the removal rates of tetracycline between the abwwts and ubwwts were not significant fig s2a p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test similar results were also reported for constructed wetlands fernandes et al 2015 there were no significant differences in the ratios of tetracycline to cod between the abwwts and ubwwts fig s2b p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test the results demonstrated that the presence of plants did not significantly improve the removal efficiency of tetracycline which was largely dependent on the biodegradation of biofilm attached to the substrate and filter adsorption a et al 2021 chen et al 2016 the average concentration of tetracycline gradually decreased from the influent to the effluent of the two systems fig s2c the most obvious decline in the concentrations of tetracyclines was observed in the aerobic zone followed by the facultative aerobic zone and the anaerobic zone between the two systems fig s2c the aerobic zone accounted for 82 8 and 87 4 of the removal of tetracycline for the ubwwts and the abwwts respectively as aeration could promote the removal of pharmaceuticals avila et al 2021 3 2 improvements of water quality fig 2 removal of tp a tn b and nh4 n c by the advanced biological wastewater treatment systems abwwts and unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts as a function of time the average concentrations of tp tn and nh4 n were lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts table s3 the removal rates of tp tn and nh4 n were significantly higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts fig s3 p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum test which indicated that the presence of plants facilitated the improvement of water quality the average removal rates of tp tn and nh4 n for the abwwts were 65 2 53 6 and 65 6 respectively which were comparable to those reported for other wastewater treatment systems table s4 reeds and pike grass could absorb n compounds and a recent report also pointed out that mixed macrophyte species could improve the removal rates of tn in constructed wetlands zhang et al 2021 meanwhile do can facilitate the removal of n in constructed wetlands lu et al 2020 and ammonia oxidizing bacteria could efficiently oxidize ammonia under aerobic conditions plants provide o and attachment points for microorganisms and create redox conditions in the bottom substrates thereby favoring the microbiological degradation of ammonia compounds and the sorption of phosphorus paranychianakis et al 2016 substrates and biofilms attached to substrates can adsorb phosphorus and transform organic substances into inorganic substances that can support plant growth vohla et al 2011 the removal rates of tp stabilized in the absence of tetracycline fig 2a with average values of 63 6 and 38 5 for abwwts and ubwwts respectively after the addition of tetracycline the removal rates of tp for the abwwts and ubwwts fluctuated around 63 6 and 38 5 respectively fig 2a these results differed from those of a previous study which showed that the addition of antibiotics in the mg l magnitude significantly inhibited the removal of soluble orthophosphorus in activated sludge reactors by inhibiting metabolic enzymes of phosphate accumulating organisms paos wu et al 2021 the possible reason could be that the concentrations i e magnitude of ng l or μg l of tetracycline within the system were too low to inhibit the metabolic enzymes of paos furthermore tetracycline does not contain p therefore it is reasonable to assume that the antibiotic did not have an obvious impact on tp content however tetracycline contains nitrogen and degradation of tetracycline might therefore produce nh4 n accordingly the average removal rates of tn and nh4 n in the ubwwts decreased by 12 4 and 33 4 with the addition of tetracycline respectively similar results were reported by guo et al 2020 in the abwwts the removal rates of tn did not substantially decline with the addition of tetracycline fig 2b while the average removal rate of nh4 n decreased by 17 2 with the addition of tetracycline fig 2c 3 3 dynamic patterns of args mges and 16s rrna fig 3 variations of args mges and 16s rrna in the influent the effluent the advanced biological wastewater treatment system abwwts and the unplanted biological wastewater treatment system ubwwts a ratios of concentrations of args mges and 16s rrna in the effluent to those in the influent b temporal variations of args classes within the two systems c spatial distributions of total targeted args within the two systems a1 the aerobic zone a2 the facultative anaerobic zone a3 or a4 the anaerobic zone 3 3 1 changes of args among the 283 targeted arg subtypes 158 were detected using ht qpcr in ubwwts fig s4 and all arg classes were found in the effluents at day 130 fig s4 on days 0 and 40 the same arg classes showed positive increasing ratios from influents to effluents fig 3a and the same args classes aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes were dominant fig 3b the number of args increased from 52 in influents to 88 in effluents at day 0 and from 58 in influents to 99 in effluents at day 40 after the addition of tetracycline negative increasing ratios of five args classes from influents to effluents were observed fig 3a and the dominant args in the ubwwts shifted from aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes to those conferring resistance to sulfonamide and tetracycline fig 3b suggesting that sub mic tetracycline exposure has a major influence on the arg composition within ubwwts the concentrations of the total targeted args σargs increased between the facultative anaerobic zone and the anaerobic zone after the addition of tetracycline fig 3c although the concentrations of σargs decreased from 2 5 107 copies ml in the influent to 2 0 107 copies ml in the effluent at day 130 the concentration of σargs in the effluent increased from 5 6 106 copies ml at day 40 to 2 0 107 copies ml at day 130 under sub mic tetracycline exposure hence ubwwts did not display a high removal rate of σargs in total 148 out of the 283 arg subtypes were found in abwwts fig s5 consistent with the ubwwts increasing rates of args from the influent to the effluent showed the same trend between day 0 and day 40 fig 3a and arg compositions were similar between day 0 and day 40 fig 3b the number of args also showed an upward trend from the influent to the effluent at day 0 and day 40 reflecting the contributions of the background of abwwts to the antibiotic resistome in effluents in contrast to ubwwts abwwts showed constant arg compositions between day 40 and day 130 fig 3b while the most abundant arg classes for the abwwts were the same genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside multidrug and beta lactamase between stage i day 0 40 and stage ii day 40 130 the concentrations of σargs were 29 3 times and 51 7 times higher in effluents than in influents for day 0 and day 40 respectively the increase 1050 4 fold in the concentrations of σargs in influents was far greater than that 2 3 fold in the concentrations of σargs in effluents from day 40 to day 130 accordingly the concentrations of σargs were 83 5 lower in effluents than in influents at day 130 and similar removal efficiencies of total args were reported for hybrid constructed wetlands and advanced oxidation units chen et al 2019a hou et al 2019 therefore an upward trend in the concentrations of args from influents to effluents was reversed by abwwts under sub mic tetracycline exposure although there was an increase in the concentration of σargs in the facultative anaerobic zone and the anaerobic zone from day 0 to day 40 as well as from day 0 to day 130 fig 3c the average increase 2 7 fold in the concentrations of σargs in the four zones of abwwts was substantially lower than the increase 1050 4 fold in the concentrations of σargs in the influent from day 40 to day 130 hence the increase in the levels of σargs in wastewater were inhibited under subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline which was likely related to the accumulation of the args on substrates song et al 2018 for example the concentrations of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside multidrug beta lactamase mlsb flor chlor am phenicol and vancomycin decreased in the abwwts from day 40 to day 130 even though the concentrations of sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes increased in the presence of tetracycline fig 3b in line with the concentrations of σargs the relative abundance of σargs was 77 0 lower in the effluent than in the influent at day 130 fig s6 reflecting abwwts contributed to eliminations of args in wastewater 3 3 2 optimized configurations for the removal of args the concentrations of σargs in the aerobic zone the facultative anaerobic zone and the anaerobic zone were on average 30 0 lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts after a performance of 130 days fig 3c while the abundance of σargs was on average 54 0 lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at day 130 fig s6 furthermore the logarithmic increasing rates of args were significantly lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at day 130 p 0 05 paired t test when the concentration and abundance of σargs in the effluent of the abwwts were 92 8 and 78 7 lower than those of the ubwwts respectivley taken together these results indicated that abwwts exhibited a higher efficiency in removing args from wastewater compared to ubwwts which could be associated with the presence of plants in abwwts chen and zhang 2013 also found that the planted constructed wetland contributed to a more significant removal of args compared to the biological aerated filter and uv disinfector in the advanced treatment process in the ubwwts a 42 9 and 49 6 reduction in the concentration and abundance of σargs were observed in the aerobic zone from day 0 to day 40 respectively fig 3c and fig s6 reflecting the negative impact of aerobic conditions on the occurrence of args in wastewater likewise the concentration and abundance of σargs decreased by 32 5 and 24 5 in the aerobic zone of the abwwts from day 0 to day 40 respectively moreover a 72 6 and 33 2 decrease in the concentration and abundance of σargs were observed in the aerobic zone of the abwwts from day 40 to day 130 respectively these results were in accordance with previous studies showing that aerobic reactors had a better removal efficiency for args compared to anaerobic reactors christgen et al 2015 lamba and ahammad 2017 additionally the concentration and abundance of σargs in both abwwts and ubwwts showed a descending trend from the aerobic zone to the facultative anaerobic zone followed by an upward trend from the facultative anaerobic zone to the anaerobic zone fig 3c and fig s6 partially because anaerobic conditions could efficiently favor the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria compared to semi aerobic conditions threedeach et al 2012 the results also suggest that facultative anaerobic treatment might play an essential role in the removal of args from wastewater 3 3 3 changes of mges and 16s rrna mges and bacteria play important roles in the horizontal transfer of args in various environmental settings clinic int1 has been suggested as an indicator for the removal efficiency of args in the wwtp based on correlations of integron integrase genes with args zheng et al 2020 twelve mges including integron integrase genes and transposase genes were selected in this study due to the limitation of the primer selection and ht qpcr the total selected mges σmges and 16s rrna showed positive increasing ratios from the influent to the effluent of the abwwts on days 0 and 40 fig 3a however negative increasing ratios of both σmges and 16s rrna from the influent to the effluent of the abwwts were observed on day 130 fig 3a importantly clinic int1 was removed from the abwwts on day 130 zheng et al 2020 furthermore the concentration and abundance of σmges in the effluent of the abwwts decreased by 10 2 and 43 7 after 130 days respectively fig s7 and fig s8 which could lead to a decrease in the potential for horizontal transfer of args in effluents additionally the concentrations of 16s rrna in abwwts were similar for day 0 and day 40 fig s9 and the average concentrations of 16s rrna in the abwwts decreased by 74 1 from day 40 to day 130 in accordance with args 16s rrna had the lowest concentration in the facultative anaerobic zone in the abwwts after a performance of 130 days fig s9 implying the args carrying microorganisms could be retained in the substrates of the zone the spatial distribution of 16s rrna in abwwts differed from that in ubwwts fig s9 in contrast to the ubwwts the increasing rates of 16s rrna from influents to effluents were negative for the abwwts at day 130 fig 3a which could result from the presence of plants 3 4 changes of bacterial community fig 4 structures of bacterial community in the influent the

and ubwwts fig 4a the main bacterial phyla in the two systems were proteobacteria with average relative abundances of 26 6 and 32 7 for ubwwts and abwwts respectively at the genus level the bacterial community at day 0 and day 40 clustered together while there was a slight shift in bacterial communities for the two systems from day 40 to day 130 fig 4b there were no significant differences in the shannon index of the bacterial community in the systems between day 0 and day 40 fig s10 p 0 05 paired t test however after the addition of tetracycline the shannon index of the bacterial community increased on average by 36 2 and 42 7 for abwwts and ubwwts respectively fig s10 consistent results were also found in a constructed wetland in which tetracycline led to higher microbial diversity and richness guo et al 2020 previous results have shown that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can lead to the occurrence of mutant antibiotic resistant strains kohanski et al 2010 while antibiotics can be utilized by microorganisms as a c source or n source to support the growth of bacteria muller et al 2013 taken together these results suggest that sub mic tetracycline exposure could be related to an increase in the diversity of the bacterial community in the two systems for the ubwwts the bacterial composition was similar for days 0 and 40 fig 4a the bacterial community in the effluents mainly arose from the facultative anaerobic zone fig 4c the shannon index of the bacterial community in effluents was 2 5 and 2 7 for day 0 and day 40 respectively however a 1 6 fold increase in the shannon index of the bacterial community was observed in the effluents from day 40 to day 130 proteobacteria and firmicutes contain important members that are prone to acquire args berendonk et al 2015 among the four zones of ubwwts no significant changes in the relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes occurred from day 0 to day 40 while there was an increase in the relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes in ubwwts with the addition of tetracycline fig 4a at the genus level the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria e g nitrosomonas and nitrospira increased in the aerobic zone from day 40 to day 130 table s5 which might be involved in the removal of nitrogen compounds the abundance of candidatus accumulibacter remained stable in the anaerobic zone from day 0 to day 40 while the abundance of candidatus accumulibacter increased after the addition of tetracycline for the abwwts the bacterial composition was similar for days 0 and 40 fig 4a the proportions of the anaerobic zone source of bacterial communities in effluents were similar for days 0 and 40 increasing from 14 5 at day 40 to 57 7 at day 130 fig 4c the shannon index of the bacterial community in effluents was 2 6 and 2 5 for day 0 and day 40 respectively and a 2 1 fold increase in the shannon index of the bacterial community was found in the effluent after the addition of tetracycline consistent with the ubwwts abwwts exhibited an elevated relative abundance of firmicutes in all the zones tetracycline could significantly increase the relative abundance of firmicutes after exposure for 40 days jung et al 2018 which may be ascribed to the fact that most of the members of firmicutes can produce spores and resist dehydration and extreme environments at the genus level tolumonas pseudarcobacter and lactococcus had the highest relative abundances table s5 lactococcus was absent in the abwwts at day 0 and day 40 but was observed in all zones of abwwts at day 130 table s5 similar results were also reported in a sequencing batch reactor sbr where lactococcus became the dominant bacteria after tetracycline exposure for 60 days wang et al 2018 tetracycline could select for lactococcus bacteria whereas members of lactococcus could carry tetracycline resistance genes and develop resistance to oxytetracycline kim et al 2004 a relatively higher relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone was observed on day 130 compared to day 40 which was consistent with the results obtained in ubwwts on day 0 nitrosomonas had the higher abundance in the roots of plants reeds cannas yellow calamus and barracuda grass than that in the wastewater from the aerobic zone table s5 while the abundance of nitrospira was higher in the roots of canna and barracuda grass than in the wastewater from the aerobic zone at day 130 the abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone were more than 10 times higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts table s5 these results reflected that the presence of plants could facilitate the nitrification by regulating the bacterial community the abundance of denitrifying bacteria i g thermomonas and denitratisoma was not higher in the roots of plants than in the wastewater of the anaerobic zone at day 0 table s5 while the abundance of thermomonas and denitratisoma in the anaerobic zone were higher in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at day 130 no members of candidatus accumulibacter were found in the roots of plants and candidatus accumulibacter was not found in the abwwts at day 130 and the average abundance of candidatus accumulibacter in the anaerobic zone was lower in the abwwts than in the ubwwts at days 0 40 and 130 these results indicate that the release of phosphorus by paos is limited in the presence of plants 3 5 effects of sub mic tetracycline on tetracycline resistance genes fig 5 occurrence of tetracycline resistance genes in the influent the

tetracycline resistance genes influent the influent a1 the aerobic zone a2 the facultative anaerobic zone a3 or a4 the anaerobic zone effluent the effluent of the 39 selected tetracycline resistance genes 26 were detected in influents effluents abwwts and ubwwts fig 5a in particular teta 02 tetg 02 and tetr 02 were detected in all samples while tetr 02 teta 02 tetg 02 and tetm 01 had the highest relative abundance in the two systems at day 130 for the ubwwts differences in the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes were not significant for day 0 and day 40 p 0 05 paired t test however a higher relative abundance of the total selected tetracycline resistance genes σtetracycline resistance genes was found in four zones of ubwwts at day 130 compared to day 40 or day 0 fig 5b before the addition of tetracycline σtetracycline resistance genes had the highest abundance in the anaerobic zone 2 0 10 2 copy 16s rrna at day 0 and 2 3 10 2 copy 16s rrna at day 40 followed by the facultative anaerobic zone 4 3 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 0 and 7 0 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 40 and the aerobic area 4 4 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 0 and 4 0 10 3 copy 16s rrna at day 40 fig 5b the results were consistent with the observation that five out of six tetracycline resistance genes in the sequential bioreactor had a lower relative abundance in the aerobic treatment than that in the anaerobic treatment gao et al 2018 a previous study also showed that limited oxygen conditions could promote the occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance bacteria threedeach et al 2016 however after tetracycline exposure of 90 days the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes followed the order aerobic zone 1 1 copy 16s rrna facultative anaerobic zone 7 6 10 2 copy 16s rrna anaerobic zone 7 5 10 2 copy 16s rrna fig 5b the spatial distribution of σtetracycline resistance genes at day 130 was consistent with the spatial variation of tetracycline in the ubwwts fig 5b and fig s2c therefore it s reasonable to suppose that the sub mic tetracycline exposure was related to the spatial distribution of tetracycline resistance genes in the ubwwts with regard to the abwwts differences in the relative abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes were not significant between day 0 and day 40 p 0 05 paired t test and elevated relative abundances of σtetracycline resistance genes were found in four zones of abwwts after sub mic tetracycline exposure consistent with the ubwwts the spatial distribution of σtetracycline resistance genes aerobic zone facultative anaerobic zone anaerobic zone in abwwts was also in agreement with that of tetracycline on day 130 fig 5b and fig s2c suggesting that tetracycline enriched tetracycline resistance genes in the biological wastewater treatment facilities similarly chen et al 2019b determined a strong positive correlation between the abundance of tetm and the concentration of tetracycline in composting products furthermore tetg 02 teta 02 tetg 01 and tetr 02 had the highest abundances in effluents during the period from day 0 to day 130 and the abundance of teta 02 tetg 01 and tetr 02 increased in all zones after the tetracycline exposure tet 34 and tetd 02 were not detected in any zones before the addition of tetracycline or the influents after the addition of tetracycline the emergence of tetd 02 and tet 34 in effluents at day 130 reflected the selective pressure of tetracycline on antibiotic resistance mutations in abwwts these findings indicated that sub mic tetracycline exposure was associated with the emergence and elevated abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in effluents additionally numbers and concentrations of tetracycline resistance genes were higher in effluents than in influents on day 0 fig 5a and fig s11 demonstrating that the resistome background in the abwwts contributed to the occurrence of tetracycline resistance genes in the effluents however the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes in effluents was 86 1 lower than that in influents at day 130 fig 5b in particular tetg 02 dominated the tetracycline resistance genes in effluents at day 40 while a 54 0 reduction in the abundance of tetg 02 from the influent to the effluent was observed on day 130 consequently the abwwts played a positive role in removing tetracycline resistance genes from wastewater regardless of the contributions of the background of abwwts to args in effluents in addition differences in the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes were not significant between abwwts and ubwwts at day 0 p 0 5 paired t test after a permormance of 130 days the abundances of σtetracycline resistance genes were relatively lower in the abwwts compared to the ubwwts fig 5c while the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes in effluents of the abwwts was 78 5 lower than that in effluents of the ubwwts these results suggest that the presence of plants was related to the removal of tetracycline resistance genes from wastewater meanwhile there was a 24 9 reduction in the average concentrations of σtetracycline resistance genes in the abwwts from day 0 to day 40 despite the purification process the concentrations of σtetracycline resistance genes in the abwwts were relatively higher at day 130 compared to day 0 or day 40 fig s11 reflecting the positive impact of tetracycline on the tetracycline resistance genes 3 6 effects of tetracycline on vertical transfer of tetracycline resistance genes fig 6 effects of tetracycline on the tetracycline resistance genes a linear relationship of the concentration of tetracycline with the relative abundance of total selected tetracycline resistance genes in e coli b the number of tetracycline resistance genes in e coli under different concentrations of tetracycline to confirm the mechanisms underlying the effects of sub mic tetracycline exposure on tetracycline resistance genes bacterial passage experiments were conducted over a period of 30 days the selected subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline covered those observed in the abwwts the selected tetracycline resistance genes in the e coli strain did not exhibit obvious changes in the relative abundance 3 7 10 5 copy 16s rrna vs 3 1 10 5 copy 16s rrna or numbers 1 vs 2 in the control group without tetracycline after 30 days however the addition of tetracycline increased the abundance of σtetracycline resistance genes which were positively correlated with the concentrations of tetracycline fig 6a tetracycline exposure for 30 days also led to a slight increase in the number of tetracycline resistance genes fig 6b the results suggested that low tetracycline concentrations increased the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes by enriching the antibiotic resistance mutation gullberg et al 2011 additionally after sub mic tetracycline exposure tetpb 01 which was detected in the quality control strain showed a 6 3 fold and 12 5 fold increase in the abundance under 0 02 and 0 2 μg l of tetracycline respectively notably the concentrations were lower than the pnec of tetracycline for antibiotic resistance development bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 indicating that antibiotic resistance development was not exclusive to an increase in the abundance of args in addition to the single strain sub mic tetracycline exposure could increase the abundance of tet genes in aquatic biofilms lundstrom et al 2016 furthermore tetm 01 and tetr 02 were the main tetracycline resistance genes in e coli fig 5a and their abundances increased after exposure to tetracycline at 20 μg l indicating that sub mic tetracycline exposure could facilitate the vertical transfer of tetr 02 and tetm 01 in the single bacterial system likewise the abundance of both tetr 02 and tetm 01 increased in the four zones of the abwwts after exposure to tetracycline 20 μg l these results implied that the vertical transfer of genes could lead to the increase in the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes not only in single bacterial systems but also in complex aquatic bacterial communities of the abwwts under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline 4 conclusions this study deciphered the changes of args and bacterial communities in biological wastewater treatment systems under long term exposure to sub mic tetracycline the main conclusions are as follows abwwts that integrate hybrid ecological technologies exhibited good performance regarding removal of tp tn nh4 n and tetracycline from the secondary effluent additional experimental replicates on abwwts integrating different configurations need to be performed to further optimize the removal efficiency of contaminants abwwts reduced the concentrations of σargs in terms of influents even though the antibiotic resistome background of the bioreactor and tetracycline selective pressure contributed to the increase in the levels of σargs in abwwts the addition of vegetation and aerobic treatment could be optimized configurations for removing args from wastewater in biological wastewater treatment systems the diversity of bacterial communities and the relative abundance of firmicutes in the abwwts and ubwwts increased after the addition of sub mic tetracycline the abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the aerobic zone were higher in abwwts than in ubwwts on day 130 which could be attributable to the presence of plants in abwwts long term sub mic tetracycline exposure was associated with an increase in the relative abundance and concentration of tetracycline resistance genes in biological wastewater treatment systems the weakened selective pressure of antibiotics at low concentrations contributes to the vertical transfer of args in single bacterial systems and complex aquatic bacterial communities appealing for attention to the propagation of args in wastewater treatment processes furthermore exposure of tetracycline at concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 20 μg l could still increase the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in e coli systems explaining why the removal efficiency of args was not high in the wastewater treatment systems containing antibiotics to achieve complete removal of antibiotics and args physical technologies such as membrane separation unit could be integrated into the advanced biological
