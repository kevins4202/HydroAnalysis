7920,study region nile basin study focus several studies have shown a relationship between climate change and changes in sediment yield however there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost this study proposes a methodological framework using the swat model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data scarce regions using global datasets we implement a framework that a incorporates topographic factors from high medium resolution dems b incorporates crop phenology data c introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and d apply a hydrological mass balance calibration we test this methodology in the nile basin using a model application with revised and without default the framework under historical and future climate projections new hydrological insights for the region results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates the contemporary long term 1989 2019 annual mean sediment yield in the revised model was 1 79 t ha 1 yr 1 and projected to increase by 61 44 more than the default estimates in the future period 2071 2100 with the greatest sediment yield increase in the eastern part of the basin thus the proposed framework improves and influences modeled and predicted sediment yield respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil erosion sediment yield swat regional modeling climate change nile basin 1 introduction with the need to keep soil erosion within the focus of all major environmental and agricultural policies such as the sustainable development goals sdgs and soil and nature conservation large scale sediment yield modeling and mapping are required tamene and le 2015 alewell et al 2019 moreover regional to continental sediment yield datasets bridge the knowledge gaps in water quality food security hydrology and climate change mitigation scenarios zhu et al 2010 alewell et al 2019 however measuring sediment yield across the whole landscape is impractical thus computational modeling is often applied to estimate soil loss upon which mitigation and global change scenarios may be based bosco et al 2015 despite the efforts assessing sediment yield at large spatial scales remains one of the main challenges in sediment yield modeling not the least due to high computational demands especially for process based models eekhout et al 2018 as a compromise between accuracy and practicality models often utilize input data of low spatial resolution restrict the number of simulated model units while adopting simplifications that ignore physical landscape processes vigiak et al 2015 nkwasa et al 2022 subsequently research is continuously needed to improve modeling approaches for estimating sediment yield at large spatial scales the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is among the most well known semi distributed models that simulate sediment yield and river sediment transport using hydrological and sediment modules swat utilizes the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 to predict sediment yield at hydrologic response unit hru level the model assumes that all the eroded sediments within the hru reach the river lenhart et al 2005 de vente et al 2013 swat has been widely used for sediment yield modeling in several river basins across the globe at different spatial scales betrie et al 2011 tibebe and bewket 2011 mosbahi et al 2013 phuong et al 2014 bonumá et al 2015 vigiak et al 2017 aga et al 2018 markhi et al 2019 mosbahi and benabdallah 2020 shrestha et al 2020 with limited applications on regional to continental sediment yield modeling previous studies have highlighted the sediment yield sensitivity issues of the model with regards to the resolution of input data cotter et al 2003 luzio et al 2005 lin et al 2013 and the spatial scale dependency of the musle chen and mackay 2004 vigiak et al 2015 gwapedza et al 2018a among the input data cotter et al 2003 shows that the swat model output is most sensitive to the digital elevation model dem unlike streamflow which is largely unaffected by dem pixel size malagò et al 2018 tan et al 2018 sediment yield estimates decrease significantly with the increasing cell size of the dem as the cell aggregation reduces the spatial variability wu et al 2005 chaplot 2014 sharma and tiwari 2014 li et al 2021 cell aggregation significantly influences the slope steepness and slope length topographic factors lin et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2013 topographic factors have the most significant influence on sediment yield among the musle factors in several basins kruk et al 2020 hence large scale swat applications that often utilize coarser resolution dems substantially underestimate the sediment yield simulations one common alternative that has not been investigated in large scale swat applications is the use of topographic factors slope data extracted from medium high resolution dems and resampled to the coarser resolution of the model setup grohmann 2015 recommended using resampled morphometric parameters slope and aspect derived from a higher resolution dem than morphometric parameters derived from a resampled dem additionally chen and mackay 2004 highlighted the nonlinear relationship of the musle between the hru sediment yield and the hru area in the swat model affecting the conservation of sediment generation among different levels of watershed partitioning however chiang and yuan 2015 argue that the runoff concentration times increase as the hru area increases resulting in lower sediment yield estimates which neutralizes the nonlinear relationship between sediment generation and hru area other studies e g betrie et al 2011 de vente et al 2013 duru et al 2018 dutta and sen 2018 markhi et al 2019 have also shown that calibrating the musle parameters can indirectly correct for the overestimations or underestimations of the sediment yields however matching the sediment loadings at the watershed outlet does not mean that the internal processes are correctly represented vigiak et al 2015 gwapedza et al 2021 gwapedza et al 2018a recommends that efforts be made by users of the musle to minimize the spatial scale effects as far as possible for example vigiak et al 2015 proposed an approach that introduces a threshold area in the musle above which sediment yields are linearized in relation to the hru area by setting the threshold area at 0 01 km2 for a 132 000 km2 catchment vigiak et al 2015 showed that the modification significantly impacted sediment yields at both hillslope and basin scale on the other hand increasing the threshold area may conceptually account for other sediment sources and sinks de vente and poesen 2005 within the danube basin vigiak et al 2017 set a threshold of 50 km2 which was consistent with the musle range of application the potential effect of this approach in minimizing the spatial scale dependency of the musle is further explored in this study according to morgan and nearing 2011 and zhao et al 2013 the cover management factor is probably among the different sediment yield factors the most important with crop cover playing an important role in controlling soil erosion gyssels et al 2005 bosco et al 2015 panagos et al 2015 however simplified approaches in representing agricultural land use are usually adopted at a large scale in regional hydrological models srivastava et al 2020 nkwasa et al 2022 previous applications of the swat model schuol and abbaspour 2006 schuol et al 2008 and swat model chawanda et al 2020 at a regional scale in africa have utilized the default generic way of representing agricultural land use without management practices affecting the parametrization of the cover management factor for cultivated areas and subsequent sediment yields however nkwasa et al 2022 suggested a methodological approach that utilizes global crop phenology datastes and decision tables to incorporate crop phenology and the associated management practices of planting harvesting irrigation and fertilization in regional swat model applications this approach coupled with the musle equation could improve crop cover estimation for cultivated areas by accounting for the correct temporal variation several sediment yield studies e g tibebe and bewket 2011 da silva et al 2013 mosbahi et al 2013 have shown a strong correlation between surface runoff and soil loss the musle explicitly considers surface runoff in estimating the sediment yield hence an accurate simulation of surface runoff is essential the swat model was originally intended for use in large ungauged watersheds arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 2010 in many studies where observed data is available calibration is done using a time series of flow data at the outlet to improve the model performance however this does not mean that the internal processes such as surface runoff are correctly represented chawanda et al 2020 proposed a hydrological mass balance calibration hmbc approach to calibrate large scale regional models hmbc utilizes soft data information on individual processes e g surface runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater to enhance the calibration process for large scale models at lower computation and time costs this paper proposes a methodological framework using the swat model bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 2018 to improve regional scale predictions of sediment yield in a data scare region and where relatively coarse spatial data is utilized more specifically the framework involves 1 assessing and adopting an approach to utilize topographic factors extracted from medium fine resolution dems and resampled to a coarser swat model resolution 2 incorporating and assessing the approach proposed by vigiak et al 2015 for reducing the sensitivity of sediment yields to the hru area in the musle 3 adopting the approach proposed by nkwasa et al 2022 for incorporating crop phenology and agricultural management in regional swat model applications with respect to sediment yield estimates 4 applying the regional hydrological mass balance calibration approach chawanda et al 2020 to improve model surface runoff prediction we compare the influence of the methodological framework on sediment yield estimates and river sediment loads against measured and reported local estimates in the region we further evaluate the influence of the proposed methodological framework on sediment yield projections under climate change using a scenario analysis involving the shared socioeconomic pathway and representative concentration pathway ssp5 rcp8 5 high co2 emission scenario to demonstrate how the proposed framework can impact projected sediment yield estimates under climate change this research provides an overall representation of the nile basin s current and future sediment yield rates under climate change and may be used by policy makers as input in decision making to design suitable practices for adapting and mitigating climate change impacts on sediment yield in addition the modeling framework proposed here can be adopted in other regional studies to estimate sediment yield under climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study area in the northeast part of africa fig 1 is about 3489 000 km2 this area covers the nile basin countries including kenya tanzania uganda burundi rwanda ethiopia egypt sudan and south sudan the region s climate is characterized by a strong latitudinal wetness gradient and a spatially contrasted mean annual rainfall distribution camberlin 2009 the mean annual rainfall varies from 1000 to 1500 mm falling to almost zero in the lower parts of the basin kirby et al 2010 the nile basin has several sub basins such as the blue nile victoria nile white nile atbara baro akobo sobat bahr el jebel and bahr el ghazal the blue nile contributes about 60 of the total flow of the nile while atbara and baro akobo sobat contribute slightly less than 15 each beyene et al 2010 the geology and structural setup of the basin is characterized by crystalline basement rocks ranging in age from precambrian to quaternary which determines its hydrogeomorphic nature garzanti et al 2006 however the uplands mainly in ethiopia are occupied by volcanic rocks alemayehu et al 2017 several studies in the region have highlighted high sediment yield estimates which have been attributed mainly to topography rainfall and land conversion to agriculture vanmaercke et al 2014 blake et al 2018 however most of the studies e g fenta et al 2016 haregeweyn et al 2017 ebabu et al 2019 yibeltal et al 2019 have focused on assessing soil erosion and sediment yield at plot to watershed scales fenta et al 2020 used the rusle method to estimate water and wind erosion across east africa which represents a great advancement in mapping large scale soil loss estimates within the region nevertheless with limited regional studies the geographical distribution of sediment yield remains roughly known accordingly the lack of sufficient information on regional sediment yields poses significant challenges to national and regional planning towards soil erosion in the region fenta et al 2020 2 2 swat model swat model arnold et al 2018 is a completely restructured version of the swat arnold et al 1998 model which offers greater flexibility with connecting spatial units in the representation of management operations bieger et al 2017 in swat a basin is divided into sub basins connected by a stream network further divided into land scape units lsus and hrus lsus allow the separation of upland processes from wetlands bieger et al 2017 while hrus are areas of unique properties of land use soil slope class and management practices neitsch et al 2005 the hru discretization was preferred in this study due to the resonable computational demands at a regional scale compared to a grid discretization that requires significant computational requirements pignotti et al 2017 simulations in the model are done at two phases a land phase at the hru level and a stream phase at the reach sub basin level neitsch et al 2005 the land phase deals with surface runoff sediment yield evapotranspiration et nutrient and soil water process simulations in contrast the routing phase defines the water sediment and nutrient movement through the channel network to the outlet bouslihim 2020 swat has not been widely used since it is relatively new unlike swat that has been applied across the world in various sediment yield studies betrie et al 2011 tibebe and bewket 2011 vigiak et al 2017 dutta and sen 2018 mosbahi and benabdallah 2020 shrestha et al 2020 2 2 1 sediment yield generation the swat model estimates sediment yield using the musle for each hru neitsch et al 2005 compared to the usle universal soil loss equation the musle eq 1 uses the surface runoff and peak flow rate which increases the model prediction accuracy since there is no need for a delivery ratio and the sediment yields of single storms can be estimated shen et al 2009 the musle estimates sediment yields not gross erosion vigiak et al 2015 1 sy 11 8 q surf q peak a h ru 0 56 x k usle x c usle x p usle x ls usle x cfrg where sy is the sediment yield tons day q surf is the surface runoff volume mm day 1 q peak is the peak runoff rate m3 s 1 a hru is the area of the hru ha k usle is the usle soil erodibility factor c usle is the usle crop management factor p usle is the usle support practice factor ls usle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor however vigiak et al 2015 modified eq 1 to eq 2 to reduce the impact of the hru area on the estimation of the sediment yield chen and mackay 2004 by introducing a threshold area a t above which sediment yields are linearized proportionally to the hru area however this approach holds for non urban hrus for urban hrus the buildup wash off approach applied by default is retained neitsch et al 2005 2 sy 11 8 q surf q r a m 0 56 x k usle x c usle x p usle x ls usle x cfrg a hru a m where q r is the peak runoff rate m3 s linearized by area eq 3 3 q r q peak a m a hru a m min a hru a t where a m is the minimum area between the hru area a hru and the threshold area a t which can be conceptualized as the largest hydrologically isolated unit occurring within a large hru 2 3 datasets and default model setup global datasets used in this research were obtained from freely available data the datasets included the digital elevation model dem downloaded from shutter radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 at 90 m resolution the harmonized land use luh2 hurtt et al 2020 at 0 250 resolution soil map at 250 m resolution from africa soil information service afsis hengl et al 2015 weather inputs at a 0 50 resolution from the global observational dataset gswp3 w5e5 which is a merge between the gswp3 global soil wetness projected phase 3 data set dirmeyer et al 2006 kim et al 2017 and the w5e5 dataset lange 2019a cucchi et al 2020 crop phenology plant and harvest dates from global gridded crop model intercomparison ggcmi jägermeyr et al 2021 at 0 50 resolution irrigated areas from food and agriculture organization fao siebert et al 2013 at 0 0830 resolution elemental nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer from hurtt et al 2020 and lu and tian 2017 at 0 50 resolution respectively discharge data from global runoff data centre grdc http grdc bafg de at a monthly timestep reservoir data from the global reservoir and dam grand database lehner et al 2011 and et at 250 m resolution from fao water productivity open access portal wapor https wapor apps fao org the default swat model revision 60 5 was set up with the qgis from 1950 to 2019 the harmonized land use product is formatted as netcdf thus the swat code was adapted to include subroutines to read the netcdf data using an approach proposed by chawanda et al 2020 the study area was discretized into 768 landscape units and 63 622 hrus based on soil land use and slope the number of hrus was selected to balance the computational cost while reducing the error due to lumping effects the discharge data from grdc was manually reviewed and checked for inconsistencies only stations with four or more years of data above 1950 were retained in the calibration process 2 4 model adaptations and parameterization 2 4 1 topographic factor the topographic factor ls usle eq 4 reflects the effect of surface topography combination of slope steepness and slope length on sediment yield the swat model derives its topographic factors slope steepness and slope length from the dem at the hru level the model sets the slope length based on a lookup table that relates the slope length to the hru slope gradient malagò et al 2018 it is worth noting that a resampled dem 90 250 m was used during the default regional model setup to overcome the high computational demands during setup hence the default model s topographic factors slope steepness and slope length were extracted from this resampled dem 250 m 4 ls usle l 22 1 m x 65 41 x sin 2 4 56 x sin 0 065 where ls usle is the topographic factor l is the slope length m is the exponential term and is the angle of the slope the exponential term m is calculated as in eq 5 5 m 0 6 x 1 exp 35 835 x tan to overcome the impact of the dem derivatives topographic factors on the model outputs specifically sediment yield an alternative approach that uses topographic factors extracted from a medium resolution dem 90 m and resampled to the coarser resolution of the model was adopted fig 2 these topographic factors were extracted from the dem using the same algorithm used by swat to generate flow direction and slope i e terrain analysis using digital elevation models taudem https hydrology usu edu taudem taudem5 index html the use of a 90 m dem ensured the computation of the topographic factors maintaining a scale congruent with the one used during the usle s experimental plots borrelli et al 2017 this approach was first tested in the blue nile basin fig 1 using topographic factors derived from resampled dems 250 m 500 m and 1000 m resampled from 90 m and resampled topographic factors derived from a 90 m dem supporting material a the approach was later extended to the regional nile basin model the default model topographic factors originally extracted from a resampled 250 m dem were replaced at the hru level by resampled topographic factors extracted from the 90 m dem 2 4 2 hru area threshold the approach proposed by vigiak et al 2015 in eq 2 and eq 3 to reduce the impact of hru area on the estimation of the sediment yield by applying a threshold area was adopted in this study fig 2 the relationship between a peak in the sediment yields and hru area was used as a rule to select the threshold area a t the same concept was used by vigiak et al 2017 within the danube basin considering that the musle was developed to assess sediment yields for catchments of area up to 40 km2 hrus were thus conceptually interpreted as small catchments the threshold area was defined as the area at which the relationship between sediment yields and catchment size would peak using the compiled sediment yield data from previous local studies in africa vanmaercke et al 2014 41 catchment sizes of up to 625 km2 comparable to the largest model hru size were used to guide the threshold area selection 2 4 3 crop land use and cover factor the swat model simulates agricultural land use by default in a generic way where the phenological development of crops from planting is driven by accumulated heat units arnold et al 1998 however this approach may not work for tropical and sub tropical regions where crop growth is mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature taye alemayehu et al 2017 tadesse alemayehu et al 2017 nkwasa et al 2020 hence the use of heat units in crop scheduling could lead to inconsistencies in crop phenology simulations especially for tropical and subtropical regions in turn affecting the estimation of the cover and management factor c usle in the musle for cultivated areas as an alternative nkwasa et al 2022 proposed an approach to incorporate crop phenology and associated management practices at a large scale using global datasets adopted in this study fig 2 technical details on the implementation of this approach for this case study can be found in nkwasa et al 2022 swat updates the cover and management factor daily using eq 6 because the plant cover varies during the plant s growth cycle neitsch et al 2005 6 c usle exp in 0 8 in c m x exp 0 00115 x rsd s in c m where c usle is the cover management factor c m is the minimum value for the cover management factor for the land cover and rsd s is the amount of soil surface residue kg ha 1 c m can be estimated from a known average annual factor using eq 7 arnold and williams 1995 7 c m 1 463 in c a 0 1034 where c a is the mean annual c usle factor for the land cover 2 4 4 other musle parameters other factors influencing sediment yield were set as follows soil erodibility k usle was estimated according to the equations described by williams 1995 and neitsch et al 2011 using the afsis database hengl et al 2015 at 250 m resolution the coarse fragment factor cfrg was estimated as the percentage of rock in the first soil layer using the equations described in neitsch et al 2011 the support practice factor p usle was set according to the land use and land cover lulc the wischmeier and smith 1978 table of p usle was used to set the p usle factor values for agricultural land use depending on the support practice and the maximum slope length a cross slope support practice was assumed for all agricultural areas however a value of 1 was set for all non agricultural land uses and land uses where no conservation was found to be practiced 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is done to evaluate the influence of parameters on model output shoemaker and benaman 2003 the response of each musle parameter was measured using a simple deterministic sensitivity analysis approach developed by benaman 2002 maximum and minimum possible values of each musle factor for this region selected from literature kassam et al 1991 nill et al 1996 balabathina et al 2020 girmay et al 2020 kebede et al 2021 were used in the sensitivity analysis initially the model was run using the basin factor values used as baseline values subsequently the model was run with the minimum and maximum factor values respectively one at a time to evaluate the sediment yield variations in the model according to loucks et al 2005 and gwapedza et al 2018b using such an approach may reflect differences in model outputs between maximum and minimum values for each factor showing the most sensitive factors 2 6 model calibration and evaluation 2 6 1 hydrological mass balance calibration hmbc arnold et al 2015 recommended soft calibration to improve process representation by more realistically simulating the hydrological mass balance components such as the surface run off q surf that is directly used in the musle consequently the hmbc chawanda et al 2020 approach was adopted in this study fig 2 using the following general method 1 the subbasins were divided into calibration zones based on expert judgement supporting material b fig b1 long term averages of water balance components for each calibration zone were derived from global datasets i e global observational precipitation dataset gswp3 w5e5 et from wapor surface runoff extracted from the grdc discharge data using wetspro willems 2009 and groundwater precipitation minus et and surface runoff using the water balance output file from swat the corresponding long term averages of water balance components for each calibration zone were extracted 2 the input data for the hmbc was expressed as water balance ratios supporting material b table b1 and selected parameters table 1 were adjusted automatically for each region using an algorithm written in python chawanda et al 2020 the parameters were selected based on their influence on the water balance component using previous https swat tamu edu publications calibrationvalidation publications swat calibration and validation literature 2 6 2 comparison of swat sediment yield estimates with observed and reported sediment yield estimates formal independent validation of sediment yields at a regional or larger scale is not feasible due to a lack of long term field scale measurements kirkby et al 2004 furthermore field or plot measurements are mainly carried out in croplands or erosion prone areas which do not capture the landscape variability elnashar et al 2021 consequently sediment yield evaluation followed a cross comparison of modeling results from previous measured and reported local studies in the region a compiled dataset of observed and reported sediment yield estimates mainly from vanmaercke et al 2014 was utilized in a cross comparison of modeling results validating model simulations using previous estimates is not very reliable although it provides a starting point in the context of data scarcity comparison was made on long term sediment yield rates as one to one comparisons were prevented by the differences in the temporal and spatial scales of the previous local studies and model simulations further insights were obtained by calculating the spatial correlation of the model sediment yield estimates with observed and reported sediment yield estimates due to the limited availability of regional river sediment yield data calibration of river sediment yield rssy was not carried out however the simulated long term annual average river sediment loads across the river network were evaluated against observed and published estimates from literature the model setup with the proposed adaptations i e slope adaptation to overcome the impact of the dem derivatives on the model outputs hru area threshold to reduce the spatial scale effects of hrus on the estimation of the sediment yield improved agricultural land use representation to improve crop cover estimation for cultivated areas and hmbc to calibrate large scale regional models is hereafter referred to as the revised model in the subsequent sections these adaptations are expected to improve the robustness of the revised model in sediment yield prediction 2 7 climate change scenarios for soil loss projections in order to explore how the two setups default and revised model setups affect sediment yield projections under climate change we used 5 gcms gfdl esm4 ipsl cm6a lr mpi esm1 2 hr mri esm2 0 and ukesm1 0 ll from the bias corrected cmip6 climate forcing data lange 2019b lange et al 2021 for historical and future ssp5 rcp8 5 conditions the five gcms were selected to show the possible future precipitation pattern fig 3 under the ssp rcp8 5 scenario representing the high end of plausible future pathways the 5 selected gcms mostly project an increase in precipitation fig 3 within the region especially in the ethiopian highlands which represents the cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project mean model ensemble under the ssp5 rcp8 5 scenario almazroui et al 2020 for the historical reference we ran both the default and revised swat models from 1971 to 2000 and for the future scenario from 2070 to 2100 in total we run 20 simulations with gcm forcing i e 2 model setups each forced with 5gcms for both the historical and future scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis results table 2 revealed that the model was more sensitive to the parameter relating to the topographic factor ls usle compared to other parameters despite using a low maximum ls usle factor for the region the minimum and maximum ranges for the ls usle parameter gave the lowest and highest default model outputs respectively the model output associated with the maximum ls usle were 60 higher than the outputs given by setting other parameters to a maximum value a similar trend was observed with the model outputs associated with the minimum ls usle that were 63 lower than the model outputs given by setting other parameters to minimum values it is important to point out that some few studies such as girmay et al 2020 reported a maximum ls usle factor range of 100 311 occupying 1 5 in agewmariayam watershed northern ethiopia and balabathina et al 2020 reported a maximum ls usle factor of 96 47 occupying 1 6 of the lake tana basin in ethiopia which further shows the diverse sensitivity of the topographic factor in the region additionally claessens et al 2008 also found out that the topographic factor was the main factor defining the large potential erosion patterns in east africa these results underscore the importance of critically considering the topographic factor in sediment yield studies within the nile basin region as it has a profound impact on the magnitude of soil loss 3 2 topographic factor adaptation by replacing the topographic factors extracted from the 250 m dem resolution with resampled topographic factors extracted from a 90 m dem resolution the default annual average sediment yield estimates increased by 38 4 with most of the high elevation areas having a greater percentage increase fig 4 a this increase offsets the original underestimation of the sediment yield estimates caused by coarse slope data extracted from a resampled 250 m dem table c1 supporting material c shows how the underestimation of sediment yield is consistently pronounced in the default model estimates which could be attributed to the coarse slope data derived from a resampled 250 m dem resampling a high resolution dem prior to calculating slope and slope length attenuates relief and slope systematically decreases as the resolution gets coarser a reduction in slope and slope length causes a lower ls usle factor resulting into a reduction in sediment yield output however resampled slopes are more correlated to original ones with a smaller decrease in maximum values and similar mean values grohmann 2015 3 3 crop land use representation fig 4 b shows the impact of improved agricultural representation on sediment yield estimates for cultivated areas sediment yield is reduced in cultivated hrus with the improvement in agricultural land use representation because the crop canopy cover grows within the correct cropping season mainly corresponding to the start of the rainy season which reduces the effective energy of the intercepted raindrops consequently the crop cover factor estimation is improved to correlate with the growing seasons supporting material d fig d1 i e crop cover factor is lowest in the rainy seasons which implies a strong crop cover on the soil layer the reduction in sediment yield estimates goes over 40 fig 4 b in some cultivated areas with the average regional sediment yield reduction of 7 8 however the single cropping season per year provided by the global phenology datasets jägermeyr et al 2021 leads to the representation of only a single cropping season even for areas with multiple cropping seasons this means that some cultivated areas are bare in the additional cropping seasons leading to an increase in sediment yield estimates for some agricultural hrus nkwasa et al 2022 recommended that global phenology datasets incorporate present day multiple cropping seasons as these impact sediment yield estimates nevertheless these results show that a realistic representation of the role of crop canopy cover in soil erosion and sediment yield modeling is essential the role of crop cover representation on sediment yield estimates in this study conforms to studies done by abaci and papanicolaou 2009 and ma et al 2019 which show how crop characteristics such as canopy or residue cover significantly amplify or deamplify the impact of precipitation on soil erosion in agricultural watersheds through interception of rain droplets crop cover and crop residue left on the fields directly affect soil loss 3 4 hru adaptation within the 41 catchments selected from literature vanmaercke et al 2014 the sediment yield peaked in the catchment size class of 20 40 km2 supporting material e fig e1 consistent with the musle range of application consequently an area threshold of 40 km2 was selected for this region setting the threshold area to 40 km2 resulted into a 14 62 reduction in the annual average regional sediment yield with reductions varying from 0 to 28 in the hrus fig 4 c using a 40 km2 area threshold assumes an hru as a hydrologically isolated small catchment while staying in agreement with the size for which the original musle was developed and tested additionally the 40 km2 threshold area falls within the range recommended by vigiak et al 2015 from 0 01 km2 accounting for hillslope process up to 50 km2 conceptually accounting for other sediment sources other than sheet and inter rill erosion that dominates at the hillslope scale the use of a threshold area above which the sediment yields are linearized is important in reducing sediment yields inflated by large hru areas since the musle can in part account for the increase in sediment yield but it cannot consider its decrease vigiak et al 2015 2017 the decrease in the sediment yield estimates due to the hru area threshold coupled with the decrease in the sediment yield estimates due to improved crop representation and an increase in sediment yield estimates due to slope adaptation shown in the previous sections results to a combined 15 98 increase in the annual average sediment yield estimates in comparison to the default model this indicates that in some practical applications the underestimation in the average sediment yield estimate due to the use of slope factors from a coarse dem can be compensated for by an overestimation due to incorrect crop representation and large model units leading to partial error cancellation however this does not mean that the sediment yield simulation at the hru level is spatially correct 3 5 hmbc evaluation the surface runoff ratio et ratio and groundwater ratio between the observed and simulated values improved towards the objective ratios derived from long term data supporting material b table b1 thus increasing the confidence in the representation of the water balance components hmbc provides an opportunity for controlling the surface runoff generated within subbasins rather than just adjusting the flow results at the outlets or gauging stations fig 5 a and b show the statistical comparison of discharge at the grdc gauging stations with 70 of the stations having an nse 0 5 a significant improvement to the default model results most of the gauge stations with poor performance had extra abstractions from the corresponding rivers which were not implemented in the model due to lack of detailed data degefu and he 2016 reported several unilateral water abstraction schemes within the nile basin needed to meet the population s growing demand since this study focuses on the land surface processes a better representation of the water balance components specifically the surface runoff improves the model s credibility in the estimation of hru sediment yield using the musle the use of this approach with soft data makes it useful for data scarce regions that would otherwise have not been calibrated 3 6 sediment yield spatial distribution fig 6 a and b show the spatial pattern of sediment yield estimates in both the default and revised model setups respectively a similar spatial trend is visible in both models with high sediment yield rates concentrated in the ethiopian highlands which is related to the region s high slopes however the magnitude of sediment yield estimates is higher in the revised model than in the default model in most erosion prone regions characterized by high sediment yield fig 6 c the long term average annual sediment yield 1989 2019 estimated by the revised model is 1 79 t ha 1 yr 1 27 more than the default model estimate differences in sediment yield magnitudes are more noticeable in the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia which has previously been reported to experience widespread soil erosion due to intensive cultivation erosion prone topography and climatic conditions belayneh et al 2020 the results of this study were first compared to previous studies that have either employed the same model swat in sediment yield estimates or reported sediment yield estimates within the region from literature the upper blue nile basin is the most documented basin with swat applications within the nile basin region the sediment yield estimates from the revised model in the upper blue nile basin from this study ranged between 0 and 190 t ha 1 yr 1 which is comparable to the estimates from betrie et al 2011 that ranged from 0 to over 150 t ha 1 yr 1 while the sediment yield estimates from the default model were greatly underestimated 0 113 t ha 1 yr 1 in comparison to the ethiopian national review of observed soil rates of 29 9 t ha 1 yr 1 in the upper blue nile basin haregeweyn et al 2015b the revised model estimates 21 7 t ha 1 yr 1 are comparable while the default model estimates 12 4 t ha 1 yr 1 are greatly underestimated hence based on a plausibility check with previous swat studies in the upper blue basin there is a consistent underestimation with the default model as the revised model gives estimates in comparable ranges this underestimation is revealed in fig 6 c which shows the difference between the revised and default models additional validation of the sediment yield estimates in supporting material c table c1 shows a better performance of the revised model in comparison to reported estimates in the region 3 6 1 comparison with measured catchment sediment yield considering only large catchments area 100 km2 from observed sediment yield data vanmaercke et al 2014 a significant positive relationship exists ρ 5 for both the default and revised model estimates with the observed and reported sediment yield supporting material c fig c1 however the correlation r 2 between the observed sediment yield and the simulated sediment yield estimates improved from 0 11 to 0 39 for the default and revised model simulations respectively this improvement in the correlation provides insights on the credibility of the approaches made in the revised model towards improvement in the sediment yield estimates this means that the revised swat sediment yield estimates from this study explain 39 of the variance in observed sediment yield using the same observed sediment yield data fenta et al 2020 obtained an overall correlation r 2 of 0 4 between rusle soil erosion estimates and sediment yield observations in east africa however as noted by vanmaercke et al 2014 there is a strong bias in sediment yield observations towards erosion prone areas additionally the sediment yield observations at the catchment outlet reflect several erosion processes such as gully erosion and river bank erosion which are not taken into account in this study hence this relationship only considers rain driven sheet erosion 3 7 evaluation of sediment load in the region the long term annual average river sediment loads in the revised model were broadly comparable to the reported ranges of observations compared to the river sediment loads simulated by the default model supporting material f fig f1 and table f1 this improvement in the sediment load estimates by the revised model can be attributed to both the methodological framework adaptations and the reservoir implementations however there was still a slight overestimation of sediment load at some gauging stations nevertheless with a more detailed time series of measured river sediment loadings the overestimation can be corrected through additional calibration of the peak channel velocities that plays a critical role in sediment transport by water lin et al 2013 detailed calibration and validation would be carried out with better data availability in the region to make model predictions more accurate and improve the revised model s overall performance however the different plausibility checks and validation methods used in this study indicate that the revised swat model gives satisfactory sediment yield and sediment load estimates compared to the default model without performing detailed calibrations this is especially of importance for data scarce or large scale studies where detailed calibrations can not be conducted for practical reasons lack of data or lack of computer power 3 8 sediment yield projections under climate change a similar signal is found in both the default and revised model simulations with annual average sediment yield increasing with climate change fig 7 however higher annual average sediment yield estimates with the revised model are observed in both the historical and future periods the long term annual average sediment yield is projected to increase by 61 8 up to 5 2 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 in the revised model and by 39 1 up to 3 6 1 3 t ha 1 yr 1 in the default model with future climate change this difference shows that the proposed methodological adaptations during model set up will affect the magnitude of results even if the climate signal remains the same fig 8 further shows the spatial difference between the default and revised models in both the historical and future climate periods as expected the spatial difference is stronger during the future period due to the projected spatial increase in precipitation fig 3 which increases the surface runoff thereby increasing erositivity however the difference is more noticeable in the erosion prone areas such as the ethiopian highlands hence the proposed methodological approaches have an influence if the model is to be used for sediment yield impact studies and more especially if the results are to be interpreted at the hru local scale from the contemporary and future sediment yield estimates in the nile basin sediment yield is highest within the ethiopian highlands which are identified as erosion hotspot areas previous studies vanmaercke et al 2014 have considered sediment yield rates in ethiopia as high by african standards this has implications for not only ethiopia but also downstream countries sudan and egpyt in the basin by increasing the sediment load in the nile river with large quantities of eroded material downstream reservoirs e g merowe gerd grand renaissance ethiopian dam aswan are also on a threat of speedy sedimentation if the sediment yield rates continue thus there is need for prioritization of soil erosion risks in the eastern part of the nile basin which experiences high sediment yield to support sustainable use of the basin s land and water resources under both current and future climate change scenarios in addition to climate change land use practices and changes such as agricultural over utilization overgrazing and deforestation can easily facilitate soil erosion through loosening of the soil surface hence future work is recommended targeting the impacts of current and future land use changes on sediment yield in the basin 3 9 limitations in this study we applied the swat model using the musle at a regional scale to estimate sediment yield even though the musle was developed for small catchments 40 km2 to predict sheet and rill erosion processes williams and berndt 1977 subsequently this model is not expected to perform well in areas where other erosion processes such as landslides and ephemeral erosion are dominant hence modelers need to always be aware of the processes being modeled the sensitivity approach used can be considered simplistic as the k usle c usle p usle and ls usle factors easily represent linear scaling factors gwapedza et al 2021 future applications of the model could test the sensitivity of changes in hru units on the erositivity factor another limitation to the modeling study is the sparse and poor quality records of river flow reservoir data plot scale measurements and sediment loads which are considered high by regional standards conway 2000 haregeweyn et al 2015a making a proper validation of the model results challenging with most of the sediment load in the region ca 90 flowing from the ethiopian highlands through the blue nile and atbara rivers abdalla 2013 most of the reported sediment load observations and estimations were for the blue nile basin this limited a proper evaluation of the river sediment loads within the white nile basin lower part of the region in addition the scale of application in this study suggests that the required input data resolution for large scale process based models like swat is currently lacking and improvements are necessary for better performance of the models for example global phenology datasets with multiple cropping seasons are needed to better represent the agricultural practices that impact sediment yield estimation in the musle 4 summary and conclusion this paper demonstrates methodological approaches to improve swat sediment yield predictions and projections at regional scales under global change factors an approach to overcome the sediment yield underestimations of a regional swat model due to topographic factors extracted from a coarse dem has been proposed this approach involves extracting topographic factors from a high medium resolution dem resampling to the model resolution and replacing the topographic factors at the hru level we thus find that using this approach reduces the underestimations of sediment yield by using topographic factors extracted from a medium resolution dem 90 m than from a resampled dem 250 m however if not bounded by computational constraints using a higher dem resolution throughout the model setup is recommended to minimize uncertainty in model simulations the incorporation of crop phenology and management practices significantly impacted sediment yield estimates especially in the highly cultivated regions therefore a better representation of crop phenology at the regional scale is recommended to minimize errors in sediment yield estimates since the swat model updates the cover management factor daily as the crop grows regarding the model unit size introducing an area threshold 40 km2 above which the hru sediment yields are linearized in relation to the hru area helped overcome the risk of overestimating sediment yields in large hrus however it is worth mentioning that the underestimation due to the coarse dem and the over estimation due to the large hru size coupled with incorrect crop representation can easily lead to partial error cancellation which needs to be further investigated for the hydrology component although with limited availability of measured data the hmbc approach adopted in this study leads to improved representation of processes in the model specifically the surface runoff that is explicitly used in the musle to estimate the volume of eroded material overall the sediment yield projections under the high end climate change scenario ssp5 rcp8 5 increase in both the default and revised model setups however there is a significant difference in sediment yield magnitude and spatial distribution between the two model setups thus the methodological framework adopted in this study greatly influences the sediment yield projections estimates at hru level consequently to apply swat for regional sediment yield prediction and mapping the following general protocol should be incorporated in the modeling framework 1 use resampled topographic factors extracted from medium fine resolution dems as opposed to topographic factors extracted from resampled dems unless restricted by computational capacity 2 adopt an area threshold in the musle above which sediment yields are linearized in relation to the hru area to avoid overestimating the hru sediment yield 3 incorporate crop phenology and agricultural management in regional swat model applications to improve crop cover estimation 4 apply the hmbc to improve the hydrologic component of the model with a specific interest in the surface runoff prediction software the swat model is publicly available at https swat tamu edu software plus analysis and processing

7920,study region nile basin study focus several studies have shown a relationship between climate change and changes in sediment yield however there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost this study proposes a methodological framework using the swat model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data scarce regions using global datasets we implement a framework that a incorporates topographic factors from high medium resolution dems b incorporates crop phenology data c introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and d apply a hydrological mass balance calibration we test this methodology in the nile basin using a model application with revised and without default the framework under historical and future climate projections new hydrological insights for the region results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates the contemporary long term 1989 2019 annual mean sediment yield in the revised model was 1 79 t ha 1 yr 1 and projected to increase by 61 44 more than the default estimates in the future period 2071 2100 with the greatest sediment yield increase in the eastern part of the basin thus the proposed framework improves and influences modeled and predicted sediment yield respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil erosion sediment yield swat regional modeling climate change nile basin 1 introduction with the need to keep soil erosion within the focus of all major environmental and agricultural policies such as the sustainable development goals sdgs and soil and nature conservation large scale sediment yield modeling and mapping are required tamene and le 2015 alewell et al 2019 moreover regional to continental sediment yield datasets bridge the knowledge gaps in water quality food security hydrology and climate change mitigation scenarios zhu et al 2010 alewell et al 2019 however measuring sediment yield across the whole landscape is impractical thus computational modeling is often applied to estimate soil loss upon which mitigation and global change scenarios may be based bosco et al 2015 despite the efforts assessing sediment yield at large spatial scales remains one of the main challenges in sediment yield modeling not the least due to high computational demands especially for process based models eekhout et al 2018 as a compromise between accuracy and practicality models often utilize input data of low spatial resolution restrict the number of simulated model units while adopting simplifications that ignore physical landscape processes vigiak et al 2015 nkwasa et al 2022 subsequently research is continuously needed to improve modeling approaches for estimating sediment yield at large spatial scales the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is among the most well known semi distributed models that simulate sediment yield and river sediment transport using hydrological and sediment modules swat utilizes the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 to predict sediment yield at hydrologic response unit hru level the model assumes that all the eroded sediments within the hru reach the river lenhart et al 2005 de vente et al 2013 swat has been widely used for sediment yield modeling in several river basins across the globe at different spatial scales betrie et al 2011 tibebe and bewket 2011 mosbahi et al 2013 phuong et al 2014 bonumá et al 2015 vigiak et al 2017 aga et al 2018 markhi et al 2019 mosbahi and benabdallah 2020 shrestha et al 2020 with limited applications on regional to continental sediment yield modeling previous studies have highlighted the sediment yield sensitivity issues of the model with regards to the resolution of input data cotter et al 2003 luzio et al 2005 lin et al 2013 and the spatial scale dependency of the musle chen and mackay 2004 vigiak et al 2015 gwapedza et al 2018a among the input data cotter et al 2003 shows that the swat model output is most sensitive to the digital elevation model dem unlike streamflow which is largely unaffected by dem pixel size malagò et al 2018 tan et al 2018 sediment yield estimates decrease significantly with the increasing cell size of the dem as the cell aggregation reduces the spatial variability wu et al 2005 chaplot 2014 sharma and tiwari 2014 li et al 2021 cell aggregation significantly influences the slope steepness and slope length topographic factors lin et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2013 topographic factors have the most significant influence on sediment yield among the musle factors in several basins kruk et al 2020 hence large scale swat applications that often utilize coarser resolution dems substantially underestimate the sediment yield simulations one common alternative that has not been investigated in large scale swat applications is the use of topographic factors slope data extracted from medium high resolution dems and resampled to the coarser resolution of the model setup grohmann 2015 recommended using resampled morphometric parameters slope and aspect derived from a higher resolution dem than morphometric parameters derived from a resampled dem additionally chen and mackay 2004 highlighted the nonlinear relationship of the musle between the hru sediment yield and the hru area in the swat model affecting the conservation of sediment generation among different levels of watershed partitioning however chiang and yuan 2015 argue that the runoff concentration times increase as the hru area increases resulting in lower sediment yield estimates which neutralizes the nonlinear relationship between sediment generation and hru area other studies e g betrie et al 2011 de vente et al 2013 duru et al 2018 dutta and sen 2018 markhi et al 2019 have also shown that calibrating the musle parameters can indirectly correct for the overestimations or underestimations of the sediment yields however matching the sediment loadings at the watershed outlet does not mean that the internal processes are correctly represented vigiak et al 2015 gwapedza et al 2021 gwapedza et al 2018a recommends that efforts be made by users of the musle to minimize the spatial scale effects as far as possible for example vigiak et al 2015 proposed an approach that introduces a threshold area in the musle above which sediment yields are linearized in relation to the hru area by setting the threshold area at 0 01 km2 for a 132 000 km2 catchment vigiak et al 2015 showed that the modification significantly impacted sediment yields at both hillslope and basin scale on the other hand increasing the threshold area may conceptually account for other sediment sources and sinks de vente and poesen 2005 within the danube basin vigiak et al 2017 set a threshold of 50 km2 which was consistent with the musle range of application the potential effect of this approach in minimizing the spatial scale dependency of the musle is further explored in this study according to morgan and nearing 2011 and zhao et al 2013 the cover management factor is probably among the different sediment yield factors the most important with crop cover playing an important role in controlling soil erosion gyssels et al 2005 bosco et al 2015 panagos et al 2015 however simplified approaches in representing agricultural land use are usually adopted at a large scale in regional hydrological models srivastava et al 2020 nkwasa et al 2022 previous applications of the swat model schuol and abbaspour 2006 schuol et al 2008 and swat model chawanda et al 2020 at a regional scale in africa have utilized the default generic way of representing agricultural land use without management practices affecting the parametrization of the cover management factor for cultivated areas and subsequent sediment yields however nkwasa et al 2022 suggested a methodological approach that utilizes global crop phenology datastes and decision tables to incorporate crop phenology and the associated management practices of planting harvesting irrigation and fertilization in regional swat model applications this approach coupled with the musle equation could improve crop cover estimation for cultivated areas by accounting for the correct temporal variation several sediment yield studies e g tibebe and bewket 2011 da silva et al 2013 mosbahi et al 2013 have shown a strong correlation between surface runoff and soil loss the musle explicitly considers surface runoff in estimating the sediment yield hence an accurate simulation of surface runoff is essential the swat model was originally intended for use in large ungauged watersheds arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 2010 in many studies where observed data is available calibration is done using a time series of flow data at the outlet to improve the model performance however this does not mean that the internal processes such as surface runoff are correctly represented chawanda et al 2020 proposed a hydrological mass balance calibration hmbc approach to calibrate large scale regional models hmbc utilizes soft data information on individual processes e g surface runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater to enhance the calibration process for large scale models at lower computation and time costs this paper proposes a methodological framework using the swat model bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 2018 to improve regional scale predictions of sediment yield in a data scare region and where relatively coarse spatial data is utilized more specifically the framework involves 1 assessing and adopting an approach to utilize topographic factors extracted from medium fine resolution dems and resampled to a coarser swat model resolution 2 incorporating and assessing the approach proposed by vigiak et al 2015 for reducing the sensitivity of sediment yields to the hru area in the musle 3 adopting the approach proposed by nkwasa et al 2022 for incorporating crop phenology and agricultural management in regional swat model applications with respect to sediment yield estimates 4 applying the regional hydrological mass balance calibration approach chawanda et al 2020 to improve model surface runoff prediction we compare the influence of the methodological framework on sediment yield estimates and river sediment loads against measured and reported local estimates in the region we further evaluate the influence of the proposed methodological framework on sediment yield projections under climate change using a scenario analysis involving the shared socioeconomic pathway and representative concentration pathway ssp5 rcp8 5 high co2 emission scenario to demonstrate how the proposed framework can impact projected sediment yield estimates under climate change this research provides an overall representation of the nile basin s current and future sediment yield rates under climate change and may be used by policy makers as input in decision making to design suitable practices for adapting and mitigating climate change impacts on sediment yield in addition the modeling framework proposed here can be adopted in other regional studies to estimate sediment yield under climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study area in the northeast part of africa fig 1 is about 3489 000 km2 this area covers the nile basin countries including kenya tanzania uganda burundi rwanda ethiopia egypt sudan and south sudan the region s climate is characterized by a strong latitudinal wetness gradient and a spatially contrasted mean annual rainfall distribution camberlin 2009 the mean annual rainfall varies from 1000 to 1500 mm falling to almost zero in the lower parts of the basin kirby et al 2010 the nile basin has several sub basins such as the blue nile victoria nile white nile atbara baro akobo sobat bahr el jebel and bahr el ghazal the blue nile contributes about 60 of the total flow of the nile while atbara and baro akobo sobat contribute slightly less than 15 each beyene et al 2010 the geology and structural setup of the basin is characterized by crystalline basement rocks ranging in age from precambrian to quaternary which determines its hydrogeomorphic nature garzanti et al 2006 however the uplands mainly in ethiopia are occupied by volcanic rocks alemayehu et al 2017 several studies in the region have highlighted high sediment yield estimates which have been attributed mainly to topography rainfall and land conversion to agriculture vanmaercke et al 2014 blake et al 2018 however most of the studies e g fenta et al 2016 haregeweyn et al 2017 ebabu et al 2019 yibeltal et al 2019 have focused on assessing soil erosion and sediment yield at plot to watershed scales fenta et al 2020 used the rusle method to estimate water and wind erosion across east africa which represents a great advancement in mapping large scale soil loss estimates within the region nevertheless with limited regional studies the geographical distribution of sediment yield remains roughly known accordingly the lack of sufficient information on regional sediment yields poses significant challenges to national and regional planning towards soil erosion in the region fenta et al 2020 2 2 swat model swat model arnold et al 2018 is a completely restructured version of the swat arnold et al 1998 model which offers greater flexibility with connecting spatial units in the representation of management operations bieger et al 2017 in swat a basin is divided into sub basins connected by a stream network further divided into land scape units lsus and hrus lsus allow the separation of upland processes from wetlands bieger et al 2017 while hrus are areas of unique properties of land use soil slope class and management practices neitsch et al 2005 the hru discretization was preferred in this study due to the resonable computational demands at a regional scale compared to a grid discretization that requires significant computational requirements pignotti et al 2017 simulations in the model are done at two phases a land phase at the hru level and a stream phase at the reach sub basin level neitsch et al 2005 the land phase deals with surface runoff sediment yield evapotranspiration et nutrient and soil water process simulations in contrast the routing phase defines the water sediment and nutrient movement through the channel network to the outlet bouslihim 2020 swat has not been widely used since it is relatively new unlike swat that has been applied across the world in various sediment yield studies betrie et al 2011 tibebe and bewket 2011 vigiak et al 2017 dutta and sen 2018 mosbahi and benabdallah 2020 shrestha et al 2020 2 2 1 sediment yield generation the swat model estimates sediment yield using the musle for each hru neitsch et al 2005 compared to the usle universal soil loss equation the musle eq 1 uses the surface runoff and peak flow rate which increases the model prediction accuracy since there is no need for a delivery ratio and the sediment yields of single storms can be estimated shen et al 2009 the musle estimates sediment yields not gross erosion vigiak et al 2015 1 sy 11 8 q surf q peak a h ru 0 56 x

usle is the usle soil erodibility factor c usle is the usle crop management factor p usle is the usle support practice factor ls usle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor however vigiak et al 2015 modified eq 1 to eq 2 to reduce the impact of the hru area on the estimation of the sediment yield chen and mackay 2004 by introducing a threshold area a t above which sediment yields are linearized proportionally to the hru area however this approach holds for non urban hrus for urban hrus the buildup wash off approach applied by default is retained neitsch et al

m resolution from fao water productivity open access portal wapor https wapor apps fao org the default swat model revision 60 5 was set up with the qgis from 1950 to 2019 the harmonized land use product is formatted as netcdf thus the swat code was adapted to include subroutines to read the netcdf data using an approach proposed by chawanda et al 2020 the study area was discretized into 768 landscape units and 63 622 hrus based on soil land use and slope the number of hrus was selected to balance the computational cost while reducing the error due to lumping effects the discharge data from grdc was manually reviewed and checked for inconsistencies only stations with four or more years of data above 1950 were retained in the calibration process 2 4 model adaptations and parameterization 2 4 1 topographic factor the topographic factor ls usle eq 4 reflects the effect of surface topography combination of slope steepness and slope length on sediment yield the swat model derives its topographic factors slope steepness and slope length from the dem at the hru level the model sets the slope length based on a lookup table that relates the slope length to the hru slope gradient malagò et al 2018 it is worth noting that a resampled dem 90 250 m was used during the default regional model setup to overcome the high computational demands during setup hence the default model s topographic factors slope steepness and slope length were extracted from this resampled dem 250 m 4 ls usle l 22 1 m x 65 41 x sin 2 4 56 x sin 0 065 where ls usle is the topographic factor l is the slope length m is the exponential term and is the angle of the slope the exponential term m is calculated as in eq 5 5 m 0 6 x 1 exp 35 835 x tan to overcome the impact of the dem derivatives topographic factors on the model outputs specifically sediment yield an alternative approach that uses topographic factors extracted from a medium resolution dem 90 m and resampled to the coarser resolution of the model was adopted fig 2 these topographic factors were extracted from the dem using the same algorithm used by swat to generate flow direction and slope i e terrain analysis using digital elevation models taudem https hydrology usu edu taudem taudem5 index html the use of a 90 m dem ensured the computation of the topographic factors maintaining a scale congruent with the one used during the usle s experimental plots borrelli et al 2017 this approach was first tested in the blue nile basin fig 1 using topographic factors derived from resampled dems 250 m 500 m and 1000 m resampled from 90 m and resampled topographic factors derived from a 90 m dem supporting material a the approach was later extended to the regional nile basin model the default model topographic factors originally extracted from a resampled 250 m dem were replaced at the hru level by resampled topographic factors extracted from the 90 m dem 2 4 2 hru area threshold the approach proposed by vigiak et al 2015 in eq 2 and eq 3 to reduce the impact of hru area on the estimation of the sediment yield by applying a threshold area was adopted in this study fig 2 the relationship between a peak in the sediment yields and hru area was used as a rule to select the threshold area a t the same concept was used by vigiak et al 2017 within the danube basin considering that the musle was developed to assess sediment yields for catchments of area up to 40 km2 hrus were thus conceptually interpreted as small catchments the threshold area was defined as the area at which the relationship between sediment yields and catchment size would peak using the compiled sediment yield data from previous local studies in africa vanmaercke et al 2014 41 catchment sizes of up to 625 km2 comparable to the largest model hru size were used to guide the threshold area selection 2 4 3 crop land use and cover factor the swat model simulates agricultural land use by default in a generic way where the phenological development of crops from planting is driven by accumulated heat units arnold et al 1998 however this approach may not work for tropical and sub tropical regions where crop growth is mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature taye alemayehu et al 2017 tadesse alemayehu et al 2017 nkwasa et al 2020 hence the use of heat units in crop scheduling could lead to inconsistencies in crop phenology simulations especially for tropical and subtropical regions in turn affecting the estimation of the cover and management factor c usle in the musle for cultivated areas as an alternative nkwasa et al 2022 proposed an approach to incorporate crop phenology and associated management practices at a large scale using global datasets adopted in this study fig 2 technical details on the implementation of this approach for this case study can be found in nkwasa et al 2022 swat updates the cover and management factor daily using eq 6 because the plant cover varies during the plant s growth cycle neitsch et al 2005 6 c usle exp in 0 8 in c m x exp 0 00115 x rsd s in c m where c usle is the cover management factor c m is the minimum value for the cover management factor for the land cover and rsd s is the amount of soil surface residue kg ha 1 c m can be estimated from a known average annual factor using eq 7 arnold and williams 1995 7 c m 1 463 in c a 0 1034 where c a is the mean annual c usle factor for the land cover 2 4 4 other musle parameters other factors influencing sediment yield were set as follows soil erodibility k usle was estimated according to the equations described by williams 1995 and neitsch et al 2011 using the afsis database hengl et al 2015 at 250 m resolution the coarse fragment factor cfrg was estimated as the percentage of rock in the first soil layer using the equations described in neitsch et al 2011 the support practice factor p usle was set according to the land use and land cover lulc the wischmeier and smith 1978 table of p usle was used to set the p usle factor values for agricultural land use depending on the support practice and the maximum slope length a cross slope support practice was assumed for all agricultural areas however a value of 1 was set for all non agricultural land uses and land uses where no conservation was found to be practiced 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is done to evaluate the influence of parameters on model output shoemaker and benaman 2003 the response of each musle parameter was measured using a simple deterministic sensitivity analysis approach developed by benaman 2002 maximum and minimum possible values of each musle factor for this region selected from literature kassam et al 1991 nill et al 1996 balabathina et al 2020 girmay et al 2020 kebede et al 2021 were used in the sensitivity analysis initially the model was run using the basin factor values used as baseline values subsequently the model was run with the minimum and maximum factor values respectively one at a time to evaluate the sediment yield variations in the model according to loucks et al 2005 and gwapedza et al 2018b using such an approach may reflect differences in model outputs between maximum and minimum values for each factor showing the most sensitive factors 2 6 model calibration and evaluation 2 6 1 hydrological mass balance calibration hmbc arnold et al 2015 recommended soft calibration to improve process representation by more realistically simulating the hydrological mass balance components such as the surface run off q surf that is directly used in the musle consequently the hmbc chawanda et al 2020 approach was adopted in this study fig 2 using the following general method 1 the subbasins were divided into calibration zones based on expert judgement supporting material b fig b1 long term averages of water balance components for each calibration zone were derived from global datasets i e global observational precipitation dataset gswp3 w5e5 et from wapor surface runoff extracted from the grdc discharge data using wetspro willems 2009 and groundwater precipitation minus et and surface runoff using the water balance output file from swat the corresponding long term averages of water balance components for each calibration zone were extracted 2 the input data for the hmbc was expressed as water balance ratios supporting material b table b1 and selected parameters table 1 were adjusted automatically for each region using an algorithm written in python chawanda et al 2020 the parameters were selected based on their influence on the water balance component using previous https swat tamu edu publications calibrationvalidation publications swat calibration and validation literature 2 6 2 comparison of swat sediment yield estimates with observed and reported sediment yield estimates formal independent validation of sediment yields at a regional or larger scale is not feasible due to a lack of long term field scale measurements kirkby et al 2004 furthermore field or plot measurements are mainly carried out in croplands or erosion prone areas which do not capture the landscape variability elnashar et al 2021 consequently sediment yield evaluation followed a cross comparison of modeling results from previous measured and reported local studies in the region a compiled dataset of observed and reported sediment yield estimates mainly from vanmaercke et al 2014 was utilized in a cross comparison of modeling results validating model simulations using previous estimates is not very reliable although it provides a starting point in the context of data scarcity comparison was made on long term sediment yield rates as one to one comparisons were prevented by the differences in the temporal and spatial scales of the previous local studies and model simulations further insights were obtained by calculating the spatial correlation of the model sediment yield estimates with observed and reported sediment yield estimates due to the limited availability of regional river sediment yield data calibration of river sediment yield rssy was not carried out however the simulated long term annual average river sediment loads across the river network were evaluated against observed and published estimates from literature the model setup with the proposed adaptations i e slope adaptation to overcome the impact of the dem derivatives on the model outputs hru area threshold to reduce the spatial scale effects of hrus on the estimation of the sediment yield improved agricultural land use representation to improve crop cover estimation for cultivated areas and hmbc to calibrate large scale regional models is hereafter referred to as the revised model in the subsequent sections these adaptations are expected to improve the robustness of the revised model in sediment yield prediction 2 7 climate change scenarios for soil loss projections in order to explore how the two setups default and revised model setups affect sediment yield projections under climate change we used 5 gcms gfdl esm4 ipsl cm6a lr mpi esm1 2 hr mri esm2 0 and ukesm1 0 ll from the bias corrected cmip6 climate forcing data lange 2019b lange et al 2021 for historical and future ssp5 rcp8 5 conditions the five gcms were selected to show the possible future precipitation pattern fig 3 under the ssp rcp8 5 scenario representing the high end of plausible future pathways the 5 selected gcms mostly project an increase in precipitation fig 3 within the region especially in the ethiopian highlands which represents the cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project mean model ensemble under the ssp5 rcp8 5 scenario almazroui et al 2020 for the historical reference we ran both the default and revised swat models from 1971 to 2000 and for the future scenario from 2070 to 2100 in total we run 20 simulations with gcm forcing i e 2 model setups each forced with 5gcms for both the historical and future scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis results table 2 revealed that the model was more sensitive to the parameter relating to the topographic factor ls usle compared to other parameters despite using a low maximum ls usle factor for the region the minimum and maximum ranges for the ls usle parameter gave the lowest and highest default model outputs respectively the model output associated with the maximum ls usle were 60 higher than the outputs given by setting other parameters to a maximum value a similar trend was observed with the model outputs associated with the minimum ls usle that were 63 lower than the model outputs given by setting other parameters to minimum values it is important to point out that some few studies such as girmay et al 2020 reported a maximum ls usle factor range of 100 311 occupying 1 5 in agewmariayam watershed northern ethiopia and balabathina et al 2020 reported a maximum ls usle factor of 96 47 occupying 1 6 of the lake tana basin in ethiopia which further shows the diverse sensitivity of the topographic factor in the region additionally claessens et al 2008 also found out that the topographic factor was the main factor defining the large potential erosion patterns in east africa these results underscore the importance of critically considering the topographic factor in sediment yield studies within the nile basin region as it has a profound impact on the magnitude of soil loss 3 2 topographic factor adaptation by replacing the topographic factors extracted from the 250 m dem resolution with resampled topographic factors extracted from a 90 m dem resolution the default annual average sediment yield estimates increased by 38 4 with most of the high elevation areas having a greater percentage increase fig 4 a this increase offsets the original underestimation of the sediment yield estimates caused by coarse slope data extracted from a resampled 250 m dem table c1 supporting material c shows how the underestimation of sediment yield is consistently pronounced in the default model estimates which could be attributed to the coarse slope data derived from a resampled 250 m dem resampling a high resolution dem prior to calculating slope and slope length attenuates relief and slope systematically decreases as the resolution gets coarser a reduction in slope and slope length causes a lower ls usle factor resulting into a reduction in sediment yield output however resampled slopes are more correlated to original ones with a smaller decrease in maximum values and similar mean values grohmann 2015 3 3 crop land use representation fig 4 b shows the impact of improved agricultural representation on sediment yield estimates for cultivated areas sediment yield is reduced in cultivated hrus with the improvement in agricultural land use representation because the crop canopy cover grows within the correct cropping season mainly corresponding to the start of the rainy season which reduces the effective energy of the intercepted raindrops consequently the crop cover factor estimation is improved to correlate with the growing seasons supporting material d fig d1 i e crop cover factor is lowest in the rainy seasons which implies a strong crop cover on the soil layer the reduction in sediment yield estimates goes over 40 fig 4 b in some cultivated areas with the average regional sediment yield reduction of 7 8 however the single cropping season per year provided by the global phenology datasets jägermeyr et al 2021 leads to the representation of only a single cropping season even for areas with multiple cropping seasons this means that some cultivated areas are bare in the additional cropping seasons leading to an increase in sediment yield estimates for some agricultural hrus nkwasa et al 2022 recommended that global phenology datasets incorporate present day multiple cropping seasons as these impact sediment yield estimates nevertheless these results show that a realistic representation of the role of crop canopy cover in soil erosion and sediment yield modeling is essential the role of crop cover representation on sediment yield estimates in this study conforms to studies done by abaci and papanicolaou 2009 and ma et al 2019 which show how crop characteristics such as canopy or residue cover significantly amplify or deamplify the impact of precipitation on soil erosion in agricultural watersheds through interception of rain droplets crop cover and crop residue left on the fields directly affect soil loss 3 4 hru adaptation within the 41 catchments selected from literature vanmaercke et al 2014 the sediment yield peaked in the catchment size class of 20 40 km2 supporting material e fig e1 consistent with the musle range of application consequently an area threshold of 40 km2 was selected for this region setting the threshold area to 40 km2 resulted into a 14 62 reduction in the annual average regional sediment yield with reductions varying from 0 to 28 in the hrus fig 4 c using a 40 km2 area threshold assumes an hru as a hydrologically isolated small catchment while staying in agreement with the size for which the original musle was developed and tested additionally the 40 km2 threshold area falls within the range recommended by vigiak et al 2015 from 0 01 km2 accounting for hillslope process up to 50 km2 conceptually accounting for other sediment sources other than sheet and inter rill erosion that dominates at the hillslope scale the use of a threshold area above which the sediment yields are linearized is important in reducing sediment yields inflated by large hru areas since the musle can in part account for the increase in sediment yield but it cannot consider its decrease vigiak et al 2015 2017 the decrease in the sediment yield estimates due to the hru area threshold coupled with the decrease in the sediment yield estimates due to improved crop representation and an increase in sediment yield estimates due to slope adaptation shown in the previous sections results to a combined 15 98 increase in the annual average sediment yield estimates in comparison to the default model this indicates that in some practical applications the underestimation in the average sediment yield estimate due to the use of slope factors from a coarse dem can be compensated for by an overestimation due to incorrect crop representation and large model units leading to partial error cancellation however this does not mean that the sediment yield simulation at the hru level is spatially correct 3 5 hmbc evaluation the surface runoff ratio et ratio and groundwater ratio between the observed and simulated values improved towards the objective ratios derived from long term data supporting material b table b1 thus increasing the confidence in the representation of the water balance components hmbc provides an opportunity for controlling the surface runoff generated within subbasins rather than just adjusting the flow results at the outlets or gauging stations fig 5 a and b show the statistical comparison of discharge at the grdc gauging stations with 70 of the stations having an nse 0 5 a significant improvement to the default model results most of the gauge stations with poor performance had extra abstractions from the corresponding rivers which were not implemented in the model due to lack of detailed data degefu and he 2016 reported several unilateral water abstraction schemes within the nile basin needed to meet the population s growing demand since this study focuses on the land surface processes a better representation of the water balance components specifically the surface runoff improves the model s credibility in the estimation of hru sediment yield using the musle the use of this approach with soft data makes it useful for data scarce regions that would otherwise have not been calibrated 3 6 sediment yield spatial distribution fig 6 a and b show the spatial pattern of sediment yield estimates in both the default and revised model setups respectively a similar spatial trend is visible in both models with high sediment yield rates concentrated in the ethiopian highlands which is related to the region s high slopes however the magnitude of sediment yield estimates is higher in the revised model than in the default model in most erosion prone regions characterized by high sediment yield fig 6 c the long term average annual sediment yield 1989 2019 estimated by the revised model is 1 79 t ha 1 yr 1 27 more than the default model estimate differences in sediment yield magnitudes are more noticeable in the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia which has previously been reported to experience widespread soil erosion due to intensive cultivation erosion prone topography and climatic conditions belayneh et al 2020 the results of this study were first compared to previous studies that have either employed the same model swat in sediment yield estimates or reported sediment yield estimates within the region from literature the upper blue nile basin is the most documented basin with swat applications within the nile basin region the sediment yield estimates from the revised model in the upper blue nile basin from this study ranged between 0 and 190 t ha 1 yr 1 which is comparable to the estimates from betrie et al 2011 that ranged from 0 to over 150 t ha 1 yr 1 while the sediment yield estimates from the default model were greatly underestimated 0 113 t ha 1 yr 1 in comparison to the ethiopian national review of observed soil rates of 29 9 t ha 1 yr 1 in the upper blue nile basin haregeweyn et al 2015b the revised model estimates 21 7 t ha 1 yr 1 are comparable while the default model estimates 12 4 t ha 1 yr 1 are greatly underestimated hence based on a plausibility check with previous swat studies in the upper blue basin there is a consistent underestimation with the default model as the revised model gives estimates in comparable ranges this underestimation is revealed in fig 6 c which shows the difference between the revised and default models additional validation of the sediment yield estimates in supporting material c table c1 shows a better performance of the revised model in comparison to reported estimates in the region 3 6 1 comparison with measured catchment sediment yield considering only large catchments area 100 km2 from observed sediment yield data vanmaercke et al 2014 a significant positive relationship exists ρ 5 for both the default and revised model estimates with the observed and reported sediment yield supporting material c fig c1 however the correlation r 2 between the observed sediment yield and the simulated sediment yield estimates improved from 0 11 to 0 39 for the default and revised model simulations respectively this improvement in the correlation provides insights on the credibility of the approaches made in the revised model towards improvement in the sediment yield estimates this means that the revised swat sediment yield estimates from this study explain 39 of the variance in observed sediment yield using the same observed sediment yield data fenta et al 2020 obtained an overall correlation r 2 of 0 4 between rusle soil erosion estimates and sediment yield observations in east africa however as noted by vanmaercke et al 2014 there is a strong bias in sediment yield observations towards erosion prone areas additionally the sediment yield observations at the catchment outlet reflect several erosion processes such as gully erosion and river bank erosion which are not taken into account in this study hence this relationship only considers rain driven sheet erosion 3 7 evaluation of sediment load in the region the long term annual average river sediment loads in the revised model were broadly comparable to the reported ranges of observations compared to the river sediment loads simulated by the default model supporting material f fig f1 and table f1 this improvement in the sediment load estimates by the revised model can be attributed to both the methodological framework adaptations and the reservoir implementations however there was still a slight overestimation of sediment load at some gauging stations nevertheless with a more detailed time series of measured river sediment loadings the overestimation can be corrected through additional calibration of the peak channel velocities that plays a critical role in sediment transport by water lin et al 2013 detailed calibration and validation would be carried out with better data availability in the region to make model predictions more accurate and improve the revised model s overall performance however the different plausibility checks and validation methods used in this study indicate that the revised swat model gives satisfactory sediment yield and sediment load estimates compared to the default model without performing detailed calibrations this is especially of importance for data scarce or large scale studies where detailed calibrations can not be conducted for practical reasons lack of data or lack of computer power 3 8 sediment yield projections under climate change a similar signal is found in both the default and revised model simulations with annual average sediment yield increasing with climate change fig 7 however higher annual average sediment yield estimates with the revised model are observed in both the historical and future periods the long term annual average sediment yield is projected to increase by 61 8 up to 5 2 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 in the revised model and by 39 1 up to 3 6 1 3 t ha 1 yr 1 in the default model with future climate change this difference shows that the proposed methodological adaptations during model set up will affect the magnitude of results even if the climate signal remains the same fig 8 further shows the spatial difference between the default and revised models in both the historical and future climate periods as expected the spatial difference is stronger during the future period due to the projected spatial increase in precipitation fig 3 which increases the surface runoff thereby increasing erositivity however the difference is more noticeable in the erosion prone areas such as the ethiopian highlands hence the proposed methodological approaches have an influence if the model is to be used for sediment yield impact studies and more especially if the results are to be interpreted at the hru local scale from the contemporary and future sediment yield estimates in the nile basin sediment yield is highest within the ethiopian highlands which are identified as erosion hotspot areas previous studies vanmaercke et al 2014 have considered sediment yield rates in ethiopia as high by african standards this has implications for not only ethiopia but also downstream countries sudan and egpyt in the basin by increasing the sediment load in the nile river with large quantities of eroded material downstream reservoirs e g merowe gerd grand renaissance ethiopian dam aswan are also on a threat of speedy sedimentation if the sediment yield rates continue thus there is need for prioritization of soil erosion risks in the eastern part of the nile basin which experiences high sediment yield to support sustainable use of the basin s land and water resources under both current and future climate change scenarios in addition to climate change land use practices and changes such as agricultural over utilization overgrazing and deforestation can easily facilitate soil erosion through loosening of the soil surface hence future work is recommended targeting the impacts of current and future land use changes on sediment yield in the basin 3 9 limitations in this study we applied the swat model using the musle at a regional scale to estimate sediment yield even though the musle was developed for small catchments 40 km2 to predict sheet and rill erosion processes williams and berndt 1977 subsequently this model is not expected to perform well in areas where other erosion processes such as landslides and ephemeral erosion are dominant hence modelers need to always be aware of the processes being modeled the sensitivity approach used can be considered simplistic as the k usle c usle p usle and ls usle factors easily represent linear scaling factors gwapedza et al 2021 future applications of the model could test the sensitivity of changes in hru units on the erositivity factor another limitation to the modeling study is the sparse and poor quality records of river flow reservoir data plot scale measurements and sediment loads which are considered high by regional standards conway 2000 haregeweyn et al 2015a making a proper validation of the model results challenging with most of the sediment load in the region ca 90 flowing from the ethiopian highlands through the blue nile and atbara rivers abdalla 2013 most of the reported sediment load observations and estimations were for the blue nile basin this limited a proper evaluation of the river sediment loads within the white nile basin lower part of the region in addition the scale of application in this study suggests that the required input data resolution for large scale process based models like swat is currently lacking and improvements are necessary for better performance of the models for example global phenology datasets with multiple cropping seasons are needed to better represent the agricultural practices that impact sediment yield estimation in the musle 4 summary and conclusion this paper demonstrates methodological approaches to improve swat sediment yield predictions and projections at regional scales under global change factors an approach to overcome the sediment yield underestimations of a regional swat model due to topographic factors extracted from a coarse dem has been proposed this approach involves extracting topographic factors from a high medium resolution dem resampling to the model resolution and replacing the topographic factors at the hru level we thus find that using this approach reduces the underestimations of sediment yield by using topographic factors extracted from a medium resolution dem 90 m than from a resampled dem 250 m however if not bounded by computational constraints using a higher dem resolution throughout the model setup is recommended to minimize uncertainty in model simulations the incorporation of crop phenology and management practices significantly impacted sediment yield estimates especially in the highly cultivated regions therefore a better representation of crop phenology at the regional scale is recommended to minimize errors in sediment yield estimates since the swat model updates the cover management factor daily as the crop grows regarding the model unit size introducing an area threshold 40 km2 above which the hru sediment yields are linearized in relation to the hru area helped overcome the risk of overestimating sediment yields in large hrus however it is worth mentioning that the underestimation due to the coarse dem and the over estimation due to the large hru size coupled with incorrect crop representation can easily lead to partial error cancellation which needs to be further investigated for the hydrology component although with limited availability of measured data the hmbc approach adopted in this study leads to improved representation of processes in the model specifically the surface runoff that is explicitly used in the musle to estimate the volume of eroded material overall the sediment yield projections under the high end climate change scenario ssp5 rcp8 5 increase in both the default and revised model setups however there is a significant difference in sediment yield magnitude and spatial distribution between the two model setups thus the methodological framework adopted in this study greatly influences the sediment yield projections estimates at hru level consequently to apply swat for regional sediment yield prediction and mapping the following general protocol should be incorporated in the modeling framework 1 use resampled topographic factors extracted from medium fine resolution dems as opposed to topographic factors extracted from resampled dems unless restricted by computational capacity 2 adopt an area threshold in the musle above which sediment yields are linearized in relation to the hru area to avoid overestimating the hru sediment yield 3 incorporate crop phenology and agricultural management in regional swat model applications to improve crop cover estimation 4 apply the hmbc to improve the hydrologic component of the model with a specific interest in the surface runoff prediction software the swat model is publicly available at https swat tamu edu software plus analysis and processing

7921,study region panjiakou reservoir hebei province china study focus based on our multiple measurements of dissolved organic matter dom and collected published papers dom itself stratification has been identified then this stratification is adopted to analyze vertical distribution of dom and its influencing factors during the thermal stratification period in the panjiakou reservoir a deep and channel type reservoir new hydrological insights for the region it was found that dom itself was stratified due to thermal stratification and other factors but its stratification boundaries were not fully consistent with the thermal stratification ones this strongly indicated that dom characteristics of different layers should be appropriately and accurately analyzed based on its own stratification rather than the thermal stratification in the upper layer dom characteristics were not only affected by endogenous input but also affected by an external contribution and photodegradation resulting in low aromaticity and low molecular weight of dom in the middle layer influenced by runoff phytoplankton secretion and microbial activities dom quantity first increased and then decreased meanwhile dom had properties of higher aromaticity molecular weight and humification in the lower layer endogenous input had the maximum influence on dom properties resulting in a decrease in aromaticity and humification of dom however endogenous input produced less dom because microbial activity and phytoplankton growth were limited by the low temperature and low oxygen environment graphical abstract ga1 keywords dissolved organic matter vertical distribution dom stratification thermal stratification reservoir 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom refers to water soluble organic matter that contains amino acids humic acids and aromatic hydrocarbon polymers in the water environment ni and li 2020 during the disinfection process of raw water dom causes aesthetic issues like an unpleasant taste and color and transforms into potentially harmful by products like free chlorine ozone and chlorine dioxide all of which have a significant impact on the sensory properties and chemical safety of drinking water zhou et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 furthermore a fraction of dom can be employed as a microbial growth substrate during the transportation of drinking water compromising the supply s safety escobar et al 2001 reservoirs have become the primary source of water supply in many nations due to the over exploitation of groundwater wang et al 2021 typically reservoirs have a large volume surface area and slow flow tending to occur stratification of water bodies of differing densities by temperature changes bonnet et al 2000 the epilimnion is formed when the surface water temperature rises with the air temperature the bottom water body known as the hypolimnion maintains a low temperature and high density the metalimnion is the water that exists between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion jones et al 2008 the difference in water density during the thermal stratification period hindered the substance exchange between top and bottom water bodies the bottom water body could not be supplemented by oxygen resulting in anoxia or even an anaerobic state causing the release and morphology transformation of nutrients and organic matter at the water sediment interface chen and hur 2015 besides that phytoplankton will thrive in the surface water with poor fluidity under suitable light temperature and nutrients and produce a large amount of endogenous dom during metabolism wei et al 2019 furthermore soil dom in the upper reaches could enter the reservoir along with surface runoff elçi 2008 when the thermal stratification diminishes as season changes water mixing will change the overall water quality of the reservoir affecting the safety of drinking water currently some researches concentrated on the source migration and transformation of dom in deep reservoirs hur et al 2007 found that exogenous dom entered yongdam reservoir in south korea after a storm runoff resulting in humic like substance dominance of dom kraus et al 2011 found dom from terrestrial sources steadily decreased in san luis reservoir but endogenous dom produced by phytoplankton gradually increased according to nguyen et al 2011 the amount of dom in paldang reservoir was found to be regulated by sediment release and algal metabolic activities however few studies focused on the response and influencing factors of dom characteristics to the thermal stratification in reservoir the analysis method used to detect dom properties is critical when examining dom profile in a reservoir to investigate the composition and properties of dom the newly developed and widely applied three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra combined with parallel factor parafac analysis and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy

aromaticity of dom 2 6 determination of vertical gradient of thermal stratification the widely used method for determining the metalimnion currently requires a vertical temperature gradient greater than a particular value bertrand et al 2010 while standardized method to determine the appropriate gradient value between 0 05 c m 1 and 1 c m 1 is not yet clear hao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 0 5 c m 1 was selected as the criterion value for defining the metalimnion based on the recorded water temperature profile of panjiakou reservoir which was also widely used in other deep water lakes or reservoirs foley et al 2012 2 7 data processing and statistics statistical analysis was used to examine the relationships between variables p 0 05 using the spss statistics 19 0 redundancy analysis rda was used to analyze the relationships between dom characteristics and environmental factors using canoco 5 0 software graphs were drawn using origin 2018 the sampling map was created using arcgis 10 8 this study grouped the above variables into physicochemical factors t do ph and ntu nitrogen nutrients tn tdn nh3 n and no3 n phosphorus nutrients tp tdp and op dom and its components and biological indicators phytoplankton and microbe for the sake of discussions fig 2 3 results 3 1 vertical distribution of physicochemical factors this study found that there was an apparent thermal stratification in panjiakou reservoir in summers the water body was divided into epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion by the temperature gradient of 0 5 c m 1 as shown in fig 2a the epilimnion had a relatively high water temperature due to significant solar radiation and air heat exchange the average water temperature was greater than 25 5 c in august and declined to 22 3 c in september but it was still higher than other layers in addition the vertical distributions of water temperature in the epilimnion were nearly uniform in the metalimnion the water temperature dropped from 22 5 c to 12 4 c on average as the water depth increased due to the rapid attenuation of solar radiation and the weakening of wind mixing the depth of the metalimnion gradually increased with time the temperature of hypolimnion was little affected by solar radiation resulting in a temperature difference of larger than 12 c between hypolimnion and epilimnion as time passed the depth of the hypolimnion increased continuously and the average water temperature increased from 10 8 c to 11 7 c the vertical variation of dissolved oxygen do was similar to that of temperature the epilimnion showed the highest do content as well as the least vertical variation with the decrease of water temperature the solubility of oxygen increased resulting in an increase in do concentration from 8 04 mg l 1 to 9 10 mg l 1 on average as the water depth increased do concentration in the metalimnion dropped dramatically from 7 54 mg l 1 to 3 86 mg l 1 in the hypolimnion do concentrations decreased from 3 86 mg l 1 to 2 42 mg l 1 with an average of 3 20 mg l 1 but the change gradient was reduced ph similarly showed a declining trend as water depth increased with an average range of 7 28 8 85 the water body was weakly alkaline in the epilimnion ph vertical variation was relatively stable as time went on ph in the epilimnion overall increased slightly ranging from 8 39 to 8 81 with an average of 8 68 in the metalimnion ph changed little with time and dropped dramatically from 8 53 to 7 79 on average with increasing water depth in the hypolimnion ph continued to descend with the water depth increase even with a slower rate it ranged from 7 78 to 7 52 with an average of 7 63 the vertical distributions of turbidity changed little over time the epilimnion had an average turbidity of 1 05 turbidity in the metalimnion increased first then decreased as the water depth increased with an average of 1 00 in the hypolimnion turbidity was relatively stable with an average of 0 83 3 2 vertical distribution of nutrients the vertical variations of tn tdn no3 n and nh3 n in panjiakou reservoir were general same all showed an increasing tendency fig 2b however as time passed the average tn and tdn concentration decreased from 4 30 mg l 1 to 3 87 mg l 1 and from 4 10 mg l 1 to 3 71 mg l 1 respectively in the epilimnion tn concentration continued to rise with the increase of water depth ranging from 3 51 mg l 1 to 3 71 mg l 1 on average while tdn concentration decreased first then increased ranging from 3 42 mg l 1 to 3 53 mg l 1 on average no3 n and nh3 n also raised in this layer with average ranges of 2 52 2 67 mg l 1 and 0 13 0 31 mg l 1 respectively in the metalimnion the increasing gradient of tn tdn no3 n and nh3 n became larger and the average ranges were 3 84 4 01 mg l 1 3 67 3 87 mg l 1 2 74 3 00 mg l 1 and 0 41 0 50 mg l 1 respectively in the hypolimnion the increasing gradient of tn tdn no3 n and nh3 n slowed down with the averages of 4 51 mg l 1 4 37 mg l 1 3 29 mg l 1 and 0 87 mg l 1 respectively in the vertical direction tp tdp and op all showed an increasing tendency fig 2c tp concentration in the epilimnion fluctuated greatly in august and was relatively stable in september with an average of 0 088 mg l 1 tdp concentration grew significantly on august 21st and remained relatively stable at other times with an average of 0 035 mg l 1 op concentration steadily increased reaching an average of 0 016 mg l 1 in the metalimnion tp tdp and op all increased with the increase of depth and the averages were 0 109 mg l 1 0 056 mg l 1 and 0 030 mg l 1 respectively in the hypolimnion tp tdp and op continued to increase and increased substantially at the bottom 45 m with average ranges of 0 162 0 260 mg l 1 0 104 0 184 mg l 1 and 0 048 0 112 mg l 1 respectively 3 3 vertical distribution of biological indicators the study found phytoplankton biomass reduced from 1 86 mg l 1 to 0 88 mg l 1 in the depth range of 1 9 m increased from 0 65 mg l 1 to 1 05 mg l 1 in the depth range of 12 20 m and decreased from 0 91 mg l 1 to 0 51 mg l 1 in the depth range of 25 45 m fig 2e 1 the study also found the microbial cell concentration grew first then declined in the depth range of 1 9 m ranging from 2 63 106 cells l 1 to 2 78 106 cells l 1 it decreased gradually from 2 76 106 cells l 1 to 1 54 106 cells l 1 in the range of 12 40 m and it increased to 1 76 106 cells l 1 at 45 m fig 2e 2 3 4 eem parafac components all fluorescence eem spectra of dom were decomposed into four components successfully fig 3 as shown in table 2 these four components were identified as uva humic like substance c1 peaks λex em 260 310 400 nm uvc humic like substance c2 peak λex em 260 460 nm protein like substance c3 peaks λex em 230 290 340 nm and uva humic like substance c4 peak λex em 270 500 nm stedmon et al 2005 fellman et al 2010 castillo et al 2010 stedmon and markager 2005 the vertical distributions of dom components fluorescence intensity and spectral indices in panjiakou reservoir were discussed in sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 discussion 4 1 dom stratification currently some researches focused on the vertical distribution of dom or doc the main component of dom in the three thermal layers during thermal stratification period choi et al 2001 found that doc was relatively labile in the epilimnion variable in its composition in the metalimnion and refractory in the hypolimnion during the thermal stratification period in soyang reservoir south korea zhang et al 2015 found a higher content of dom in the metalimnion of qiandaohu reservoir china pifer et al 2011 found that 10 m depth dom samples had higher fluorescence intensities and suva values than the 3 m and 18 m depth samples however based on our data as shown in fig 2d and the other researchers data as shown in fig 4 partly reproduced based on choi et al 2001 and zhang et al 2015 dom was vertically stratified with stratification borders that were not completely the same as the thermal stratification boundaries this strongly implied that dom characteristics of different layers should be appropriately and accurately analyzed based on its own stratification rather than the thermal stratification to our best knowledge previous studies on the vertical distribution characteristics of dom were all based on thermal stratification choi et al 2001 zhang et al 2015 which did not accurately or fully reveal the vertical distribution characteristics of dom observably dom in panjiakou reservoir can be vertically stratified into three layers namely the upper layer middle layer and lower layer fig 2d and in the middle layer dom experienced a relatively sharp increase and decrease with an obvious peak based on dom measurements the differences of dom and its spectral indices between in dom stratification and in thermal stratification were analyzed individually table 3 the results revealed that the differences in various indicators in different layers of dom stratification were more significant than those in different layers of the thermal stratification further statistically indicating that dom stratification differed from the thermal stratification it was more accurate and reasonable to divide dom stratification by vertical profile of dom itself 4 2 vertical distribution of fluorescence intensity of dom and its components as shown in fig 2d dom and its components showed obvious stratification throughout the sampling period in the upper layer of dom stratification the vertical distributions of uva humic like substance c1 at different sampling times were basically similar the fmax of c1 increased slightly from 21 40 to 22 64 qsu as water depth increased with an average of 22 09 qsu the vertical distributions of uvc humic like substance c2 were different at different sampling times as water depth increased the fmax of c2 increased first and then decreased on august 28th and september 11th with average values of 23 42 and 25 47 qsu respectively it showed a slightly increasing trend at other times with an average of 24 27 qsu the vertical distributions of protein like substances c3 were different at different sampling times the fmax of c3 gradually increased from 16 72 to 20 80 qsu on august 21st while it decreased from 21 17 to 16 70 qsu on september 4th c3 was relatively stable on august 28th september 11th and september 18th with average values of 20 36 18 10 and 12 92 qsu respectively the vertical distributions of uva humic like substance c4 had little change at any time as water depth increased the fmax of c4 increased from 17 47 to 18 47 qsu with an average of 18 06 qsu the vertical distributions of dom were different at different sampling times the fmax of dom first decreased then increased with an average of 85 82 qsu on september 4th while it had an opposite trend with an average of 86 84 qsu on september 11th and it showed an increasing trend at other times with an average of 79 66 qsu in addition the depth range of the upper layer was generally same as that of the epilimnion in the middle layer of dom stratification the fmax of dom and its components increased dramatically as the water depth increased then it greatly decreased generating an apparent peak the average fmax of the peaks of c1 c2 c3 c4 dom were 26 18 28 96 22 69 21 84 99 67 qsu respectively the highest of peaks of c1 c2 c3 c4 dom appeared on september 4th reaching 27 81 32 09 26 02 23 47 109 24 qsu respectively furthermore the thickness of this layer was obviously larger than that of metalimnion but the bottom depth of this layer increased with the increase of metalimnion thickness in the lower layer of dom stratification the fmax of dom and its components remained stable generally except for september 4th which needed further study in the future the average fmax of c1 c2 c3 c4 dom were 24 41 26 00 17 31 20 26 87 99 qsu respectively which were lower than that of middle layer but higher than that of upper layer furthermore the overall fmax of dom in the whole water tended to rise at first then fell as time passed 4 3 vertical distribution of spectral indices of dom at present some spectral indices are often used to assist the analysis of dom characteristics see section 2 5 for the meanings of different spectral indices wang et al 2017 ge et al 2021 this study also analyzed the vertical distribution of dom spectral indices in the upper layer of dom stratification the average of fi hix and suva254 were 1 78 3 71 2 43 l mg c 1 m 1 respectively lower than those in the other two layers while sr was relatively large with an average of 9 37 compared with the upper layer fi hix and suva254 increased with averages of 1 81 4 00 3 33 l mg c 1 m 1 respectively while sr decreased with an average of 8 54 in the middle layer in the lower layer of dom stratification fi increased from 1 82 to 1 87 with an average of 1 84 higher than that in the other two layers hix and suva254 had averages of 3 75 and 3 00 l mg c 1 m 1 respectively which were lower than those in the middle layer the average of sr was 8 06 smaller than that in the upper layer fig 5 the foregoing discussion further illustrated dom stratified in the reservoir and the stratification characteristics differed from those of thermal stratification this was because dom was not only affected by thermal stratification but also affected by the vertical profiles of many physicochemical factors nutrients phytoplankton and microbes dom quantities and properties in different dom layers in panjiakou reservoir depended on various influencing factors of each layer which will be discussed in detail in the following sections 4 4 influencing factors of dom in the upper layer of dom stratification the rda ordination diagram of dom characteristics and environmental factors in the upper layer was shown in fig 6a the eigenvalues for the first and second axes were 0 76 and 0 11 respectively the two axes accounted for 92 1 of the observed variation in dom components and properties of the relationships of the dom environmental factors the analysis showed the protein like substance c3 positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass and nitrogen nutrients this could be due to the epilimnion s sunny and nutrient rich conditions which caused phytoplankton to flourish and release a large amount of c3 in the upper layer during photosynthesis wei et al 2019 found phytoplankton in the weihe river released a lot of protein like substances with peaks of λex em 240 280 338 nm castillo et al 2010 found that phytoplankton secreted protein like substances with peaks of λex em 275 340 nm during indoor culture the peaks of protein like substances found in these studies were similar to the peaks of c3 λex em 230 290 340 nm in this study further confirming that c3 was mainly influenced by phytoplankton growth uva humic like substance c1 positively correlated with microbe fig 6a this was due to the presence of a significant number of microbes in the epilimnion which were active when the water temperature was high and emitted quite an amount of endogenous dom kamjunke et al 2016 xu and guo 2018 found uva humic like substance with a peak at λex em 320 430 nm in the milwaukee estuary usa was related to microbial activities chen et al 2021 found that uva humic like substance peaks at λex em 245 325 400 nm secreted by microbes existed in wwtp of hebei province china the uva humic like substance in these studies was similar to the peak of c1 λex em 260 310 400 nm in this study which was a product of microbial degradation this study found that the average fi of the upper layer was 1 78 between 1 4 and 1 9 indicating that the upper layer not only had endogenous dom input but also had an external contribution li et al 2022 fig 6a showed uvc humic like substance c2 and uva humic like substance c4 positively correlated with no3 n that indicated c2 and c4 were homologous with no3 n in the upper layer he et al 2021 at present many studies have shown uvc and uva humic like substances are common terrestrial aromatic humic acid organic compounds in water bai et al 2015 found two terrestrial humic like substances existed in the yangtze river estuary namely uvc humic like substance with peaks at λex em 270 360 440 nm and uva humic like substance with a peak at λex em 260 495 nm he et al 2021 found two kinds of humic like substance with peaks of λex em 255 454 nm and λex em 260 474 nm from terrestrial sources existed in mountain ponds in china the peak values of humic like substance in these studies were similar to the peaks of c2 λex em 260 460 nm and c4 λex em 270 500 nm in this study this further inferred c2 and c4 were derived from soil or terrestrial plant decomposition according to huang and xiang 2015 a substantial amount of nitrogen fertilizer was sprayed to cropland in the upper reaches of panjiakou reservoir surface runoff carried fertilizers comprising nitrogen nutrients as well as a terrestrial humic like substance into the luanhe river and its tributaries which ultimately flowed into the reservoir the inflow density upstream of the reservoir is mainly determined by the suspended sediment content and water temperature since the inflow sediment concentration was low during the study period wei et al 2021 the inflow density was mainly affected by the water temperature the higher the temperature the lower the water density in the summer the temperature of the upstream inflow is often lower than or close to that of the surface water in the reservoir but significantly higher than that of the bottom water choi et al 2001 therefore the upstream inflow will enter the epilimnion and metalimnion thus affecting the composition and properties of dom in the upper and middle layer besides despite the low input sediment concentration terrigenous dom induced an increase in turbidity therefore c2 and c4 in the upper layer positively correlated with turbidity in addition phytoplankton absorbed co2 in water and released o2 through photosynthesis raising the ph of water with increasing water depth phytoplankton growth declined ph decreased dom accumulated and dom was found to be adversely linked with ph in general the aromaticity and molecular weight of dom produced by algal and microbial activities are often lower than those of humic like compounds derived from terrestrial sources helms 2012 this study found suva254 in the upper layer was significantly lower than that in the other two layers while sr was the opposite indicating that the aromaticity and molecular weight of dom were smaller this may be due to photochemical degradation of humic like substances from terrestrial sources according to xu et al 2018 sun radiation easily affected humic like substances resulting in photochemical degradation which destroyed dom benzene ring and other unsaturated structures lowering dom amount molecular weight and aromaticity finally both endogenous dom and photochemical degradation of humic like substances lead to dom with low molecular weight and low aromaticity in the upper layers of dom stratification 4 5 influencing factors of dom in the middle layer of dom stratification the rda ordination diagram of dom environmental factors in the middle layer was shown in fig 6b the eigenvalues for the first and second axes were 0 72 and 0 10 respectively the two axes accounted for 91 0 of the observed variation in dom characteristics of the relationships of dom environmental factors the results showed protein like substance c3 positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass and nitrogen nutrients this was probably because phytoplankton produced plenty of protein like substances during its growth the phytoplankton biomass increased in the metalimnion but decreased in the hypolimnion fig 2e1 as a result c3 increased first then reduced in the middle layer in addition uva humic like substance c1 also positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass which was because the dead algae in the metalimnion and the sinking algae after dead in the epilimnion generated dom in the decomposition process sadchikov and ostroumov 2020 meanwhile c1 positively correlated with microbe however with the increase of water depth both the phytoplankton biomass and microbial cell concentrations decreased resulting in the trend of c1 first increasing then decreasing in the middle layer furthermore due to phytoplankton respiration and degradation large amounts of oxygen were consumed and carbon dioxide and organic acids were released hargrave 1969 meanwhile the photosynthesis of phytoplankton was limited by light therefore dom negatively correlated with do and ph in conclusion phytoplankton metabolism and microbial degradation were the primary influences on endogenous dom in the middle layer the average fi of the middle layer was 1 81 indicating that dom of this layer was both from endogenous sources and external sources it was found that c2 and c4 positively correlated with tn tdn and no3 n in the middle layer the layer had a high degree of humification and aromaticity fig 5b c chen et al 2011 derrien et al 2017 and the molecular weight also increased significantly fig 5d given that terrestrial humic like substances typically have higher aromaticity molecular weight and humification fichot and benner 2012 it was likely that terrestrial dom was introduced into the middle layer as discussed above the middle layer was also partly affected by runoff however the terrestrial input of dom decreased in the hypolimnion so c2 and c4 quantity increased then decreased in the middle layer moreover due to the weak photodegradation of this layer dom retained the properties of the terrestrial source but the humification and aromaticity decreased slightly 4 6 influencing factors of dom in the lower layer of dom stratification fig 6c showed the rda ordination diagram of dom environmental factors in the lower layer the eigenvalues for the first and second axes were 0 65 and 0 12 respectively the two axes accounted for 85 0 of the observed variation in dom characteristics of the relationships of dom environmental factors this study found the average fi in the lower layer was 1 84 indicating that this layer was mainly influenced by endogenous sources the terrestrial humic like substance components c2 and c4 gradually decreased with the increase of water depth fig 2d resulting in the continuous decrease of suva254 and hix fig 5 in addition uva humic like substance c1 positively correlated with microbe indicating that dom in this layer was affected by microbial degradation activities however the biomass and activities of aerobic bacteria in the hypolimnion reduced because of low temperature and low do causing that c1 decreased in the lower layer furthermore due to limited light in the hypolimnion phytoplankton biomass was severely reduced leading to a decrease in c3 in the lower layer fig 6c also showed dom and nutrients especially phosphorus nutrients had a negative correlation which was mainly influenced by the release of nutrients from sediments before 2017 cage fish culture was vigorously developed in panjiakou reservoir kang et al 2020 and a lot of fish food was put into water it has been found that fish food utilization rate was low with more than 65 remaining in the water phillips et al 1986 therefore the sediments of panjiakou reservoir were mainly fish food which contained a mass of organic nitrogen and organophosphorus yang et al 2021 under the activities of microbes organic nitrogen and organophosphorus were mineralized into inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and thus released into the overlying water hansen et al 1993 increasing the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients fig 2b c 5 conclusions during the thermal stratification of panjiakou reservoir a channel type multiyear regulated deep water reservoir dom stratified with water depth but its stratification boundaries was not fully consistent with the thermal stratification ones this was because dom was affected not only by temperature but also by physicochemical factors nutrients and biological factors therefore dom characteristics of different layers should be appropriately and accurately analyzed based on its own stratification rather than the thermal stratification in the upper layer dom characteristics were affected by endogenous input and external contribution meanwhile photodegradation also directly affected dom resulting in low aromaticity and molecular weight of dom in the middle layer dom quantity first dramatically increased then greatly decreased generating an apparent peak the increase was due to the release of numerous of dom by phytoplankton secretion and microbial decomposition as well as runoff input in the metalimnion the decrease was caused by the decrease of the above factors moreover due to the weaken of photodegradation in this layer dom retained the properties of the terrestrial source of higher aromaticity molecular weight and degree of humification in the lower layer endogenous input had the maximum influence on dom properties resulting in a decrease in aromaticity and humification furthermore the low temperature and low do limited microbial activities and phytoplankton growth thus the average quantity of different layers dom ranked by middle layer lower layer upper layer this study is the first to propose dom stratification which is insightful and helpful for analyzing dom characteristics in different layers and optimizing reservoir drinking water treatment systems credit authorship contribution statement mengjiao wei data curation formal

7921,study region panjiakou reservoir hebei province china study focus based on our multiple measurements of dissolved organic matter dom and collected published papers dom itself stratification has been identified then this stratification is adopted to analyze vertical distribution of dom and its influencing factors during the thermal stratification period in the panjiakou reservoir a deep and channel type reservoir new hydrological insights for the region it was found that dom itself was stratified due to thermal stratification and other factors but its stratification boundaries were not fully consistent with the thermal stratification ones this strongly indicated that dom characteristics of different layers should be appropriately and accurately analyzed based on its own stratification rather than the thermal stratification in the upper layer dom characteristics were not only affected by endogenous input but also affected by an external contribution and photodegradation resulting in low aromaticity and low molecular weight of dom in the middle layer influenced by runoff phytoplankton secretion and microbial activities dom quantity first increased and then decreased meanwhile dom had properties of higher aromaticity molecular weight and humification in the lower layer endogenous input had the maximum influence on dom properties resulting in a decrease in aromaticity and humification of dom however endogenous input produced less dom because microbial activity and phytoplankton growth were limited by the low temperature and low oxygen environment graphical abstract ga1 keywords dissolved organic matter vertical distribution dom stratification thermal stratification reservoir 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom refers to water soluble organic matter that contains amino acids humic acids and aromatic hydrocarbon polymers in the water environment ni and li 2020 during the disinfection process of raw water dom causes aesthetic issues like an unpleasant taste and color and transforms into potentially harmful by products like free chlorine ozone and chlorine dioxide all of which have a significant impact on the sensory properties and chemical safety of drinking water zhou et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 furthermore a fraction of dom can be employed as a microbial growth substrate during the transportation of drinking water compromising the supply s safety escobar et al 2001 reservoirs have become the primary source of water supply in many nations due to the over exploitation of groundwater wang et al 2021 typically reservoirs have a large volume surface area and slow flow tending to occur stratification of water bodies of differing densities by temperature changes bonnet et al 2000 the epilimnion is formed when the surface water temperature rises with the air temperature the bottom water body known as the hypolimnion maintains a low temperature and high density the metalimnion is the water that exists between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion jones et al 2008 the difference in water density during the thermal stratification period hindered the substance exchange between top and bottom water bodies the bottom water body could not be supplemented by oxygen resulting in anoxia or even an anaerobic state causing the release and morphology transformation of nutrients and organic matter at the water sediment interface chen and hur 2015 besides that phytoplankton will thrive in the surface water with poor fluidity under suitable light temperature and nutrients and produce a large amount of endogenous dom during metabolism wei et al 2019 furthermore soil dom in the upper reaches could enter the reservoir along with surface runoff elçi 2008 when the thermal stratification diminishes as season changes water mixing will change the overall water quality of the reservoir affecting the safety of drinking water currently some researches concentrated on the source migration and transformation of dom in deep reservoirs hur et al 2007 found that exogenous dom entered yongdam reservoir in south korea after a storm runoff resulting in humic like substance dominance of dom kraus et al 2011 found dom from terrestrial sources steadily decreased in san luis reservoir but endogenous dom produced by phytoplankton gradually increased according to nguyen et al 2011 the amount of dom in paldang reservoir was found to be regulated by sediment release and algal metabolic activities however few studies focused on the response and influencing factors of dom characteristics to the thermal stratification in reservoir the analysis method used to detect dom properties is critical when examining dom profile in a reservoir to investigate the composition and properties of dom the newly developed and widely applied three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra combined with parallel factor parafac analysis and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy were used this method requires a small amount of sample has high repeatability and sensitivity with no structural damage to the sample ge et al 2021 duan et al 2022 panjiakou reservoir multiyear regulated deep water reservoir of channel type in hebei province china was selected in this study this reservoir will form a stable thermal stratification every summer july september li et al 2019 based on multiple monitoring of general water quality parameters biological factors and dom with water depth dom itself stratification has been identified then this stratification is adopted to analyze vertical distribution of dom and its influencing factors which provided a reference for water quality management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling location panjiakou

reservoir serves as a water supply for tianjin city and tangshan city therefore the quality of the water in panjiakou reservoir has always been greatly concerned by governments and the public the sampling location in this study was located about 1 km 40 24 n 118 17 e away from the dam of panjiakou reservoir fig 1 where the water was relatively deep about 46 m during the sampling period during the sampling period relatively little water was released from the reservoir in comparison to the water volume in the reservoir http www hwcc gov cn and the reservoir s water level and thermal stratification structure were quite stable 2 2 sample collection as shown in table 1 and fig 2 five times of samplings were carried on august 21st august 28th september 4th september 11th and september 18th 2020 respectively in order to reduce the interference of external factors such as water waves or wind leading to the deviation of sampling position a 3 5 m 3 5 m square polyethylene

aromaticity of dom 2 6 determination of vertical gradient of thermal stratification the widely used method for determining the metalimnion currently requires a vertical temperature gradient greater than a particular value bertrand et al 2010 while standardized method to determine the appropriate gradient value between 0 05 c m 1 and 1 c m 1 is not yet clear hao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 0 5 c m 1 was selected as the criterion value for defining the metalimnion based on the recorded water temperature profile of panjiakou reservoir which was also widely used in other deep water lakes or reservoirs foley et al 2012 2 7 data processing and statistics statistical analysis was used to examine the relationships between variables p 0 05 using the spss statistics 19 0 redundancy analysis

10 8 this study grouped the above variables into physicochemical factors t do ph and ntu nitrogen nutrients tn tdn nh3 n and no3 n phosphorus nutrients tp tdp and op dom and its components and biological indicators phytoplankton and microbe for the sake of discussions fig 2 3 results 3 1 vertical distribution of physicochemical factors this study found that there was an apparent thermal stratification in panjiakou reservoir in summers the water body was divided into epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion by the temperature gradient of 0 5 c m 1 as shown in fig 2a the epilimnion had a relatively high water temperature due to significant solar radiation and air heat exchange the average water temperature was greater than 25 5 c in august and declined to 22 3 c in september but it was still higher than other layers in addition the vertical distributions of water temperature in the epilimnion were nearly uniform in the metalimnion the water temperature dropped from 22 5 c to 12 4 c on average as the water depth increased due to the rapid attenuation of solar radiation and the weakening of wind mixing the depth of the metalimnion gradually increased with time the temperature of hypolimnion was little affected by solar radiation resulting in a temperature difference of larger than 12 c between hypolimnion and epilimnion as time passed the depth of the hypolimnion increased continuously and the average water temperature increased from 10 8 c to 11 7 c the vertical variation of dissolved oxygen do was similar to that of temperature the epilimnion showed the highest do content as well as the least vertical variation with the decrease of water temperature the solubility of oxygen increased resulting in an increase in do concentration from 8 04 mg l 1 to 9 10 mg l 1 on average as the water depth increased do concentration in the metalimnion dropped dramatically from 7 54 mg l 1 to 3 86 mg l 1 in the hypolimnion do concentrations decreased from 3 86 mg l 1 to 2 42 mg l 1 with an average of 3 20 mg l 1 but the change gradient was reduced ph similarly showed a declining trend as water depth increased with an average range of 7 28 8 85 the water body was weakly alkaline in the epilimnion ph vertical variation was relatively stable as time went on ph in the epilimnion overall increased slightly ranging from 8 39 to 8 81 with an average of 8 68 in the metalimnion ph changed little with time and dropped dramatically from 8 53 to 7 79 on average with increasing water depth in the hypolimnion ph continued to descend with the water depth increase even with a slower rate it ranged from 7 78 to 7 52 with an average of 7 63 the vertical distributions of turbidity changed little over time the epilimnion had an average turbidity of 1 05 turbidity in the metalimnion increased first then decreased as the water depth increased with an average of 1 00 in the hypolimnion turbidity was relatively stable with an average of 0 83 3 2 vertical distribution of nutrients the vertical variations of tn tdn no3 n and nh3 n in panjiakou reservoir were general same all showed an increasing tendency fig 2b however as time passed the average tn and tdn concentration decreased from 4 30 mg l 1 to 3 87 mg l 1 and from 4 10 mg l 1 to 3 71 mg l 1 respectively in the epilimnion tn concentration continued to rise with the increase of water depth ranging from 3 51 mg l 1 to 3 71 mg l 1 on average while tdn concentration decreased first then increased ranging from 3 42 mg l 1 to 3 53 mg l 1 on average no3 n and nh3 n also raised in this layer with average ranges of 2 52 2 67 mg l 1 and 0 13 0 31 mg l 1 respectively in the metalimnion the increasing gradient of tn tdn no3 n and nh3 n became larger and the average ranges were 3 84 4 01 mg l 1 3 67 3 87 mg l 1 2 74 3 00 mg l 1 and 0 41 0 50 mg l 1 respectively in the hypolimnion the increasing gradient of tn tdn no3 n and nh3 n slowed down with the averages of 4 51 mg l 1 4 37 mg l 1 3 29 mg l 1 and 0 87 mg l 1 respectively in the vertical direction tp tdp and op all showed an increasing tendency fig 2c tp concentration in the epilimnion fluctuated greatly in august and was relatively stable in september with an average of 0 088 mg l 1 tdp concentration grew significantly on august 21st and remained relatively stable at other times with an average of 0 035 mg l 1 op concentration steadily increased reaching an average of 0 016 mg l 1 in the metalimnion tp tdp and op all increased with the increase of depth and the averages were 0 109 mg l 1 0 056 mg l 1 and 0 030 mg l 1 respectively in the hypolimnion tp tdp and op continued to increase and increased substantially at the bottom 45 m with average ranges of 0 162 0 260 mg l 1 0 104 0 184 mg l 1 and 0 048 0 112 mg l 1 respectively 3 3 vertical distribution of biological indicators the study found phytoplankton biomass reduced from 1 86 mg l 1 to 0 88 mg l 1 in the depth range of 1 9 m increased from 0 65 mg l 1 to 1 05 mg l 1 in the depth range of 12 20 m and decreased from 0 91 mg l 1 to 0 51 mg l 1 in the depth range of 25 45 m fig 2e 1 the study also found the microbial cell concentration grew first then declined in the depth range of 1 9 m ranging from 2 63 106 cells l 1 to 2 78 106 cells l 1 it decreased gradually from 2 76 106 cells l 1 to 1 54 106 cells l 1 in the range of 12 40 m and it increased to 1 76 106 cells l 1 at 45 m fig 2e 2 3 4 eem parafac components all fluorescence eem spectra of dom were decomposed into four components successfully fig 3 as shown in table 2 these four components were identified as uva humic like substance c1 peaks λex em 260 310 400 nm uvc humic like substance c2 peak λex em 260 460 nm protein like substance c3 peaks λex em 230 290 340 nm and uva humic like substance c4 peak λex em 270 500 nm stedmon et al 2005 fellman et al 2010 castillo et al 2010 stedmon and markager 2005 the vertical distributions of dom components fluorescence intensity and spectral indices in panjiakou reservoir were discussed in sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 discussion 4 1 dom stratification currently some researches focused on the vertical distribution of dom or doc the main component of dom in the three thermal layers during thermal stratification period choi et al 2001 found that doc was relatively labile in the epilimnion variable in its composition in the metalimnion and refractory in the hypolimnion during the thermal stratification period in soyang reservoir south korea zhang et al 2015 found a higher content of dom in the metalimnion of qiandaohu reservoir china pifer et al 2011 found that 10 m depth dom samples had higher fluorescence intensities and suva values than the 3 m and 18 m depth samples however based on our data as shown in fig 2d and the other researchers data as shown in fig 4 partly reproduced based on choi et al 2001 and zhang et al 2015 dom was vertically stratified with stratification borders that were not completely the same as the thermal stratification boundaries this strongly implied that dom characteristics of different layers should be appropriately and accurately analyzed based on its own stratification rather than the thermal stratification to our best knowledge previous studies on the vertical distribution characteristics of dom were all based on thermal stratification choi et al 2001 zhang et al 2015 which did not accurately or fully reveal the vertical distribution characteristics of dom observably dom in panjiakou reservoir can be vertically stratified into three layers namely the upper layer middle layer and lower layer fig 2d and in the middle layer dom experienced a relatively sharp increase and decrease with an obvious peak based on dom measurements the differences of dom and its spectral indices between in dom stratification and in thermal stratification were analyzed individually table 3 the results revealed that the differences in various indicators in different layers of dom stratification were more significant than those in different layers of the thermal stratification further statistically indicating that dom stratification differed from the thermal stratification it was more accurate and reasonable to divide dom stratification by vertical profile of dom itself 4 2 vertical distribution of fluorescence intensity of dom and its components as shown in fig 2d dom and its components showed obvious stratification throughout the sampling period in the upper layer of dom stratification the vertical distributions of uva humic like substance c1 at different sampling times were basically similar the fmax of c1 increased slightly from 21 40 to 22 64 qsu as water depth increased with an average of 22 09 qsu the vertical distributions of uvc humic like substance c2 were different at different sampling times as water depth increased the fmax of c2 increased first and then decreased on august 28th and september 11th with average values of 23 42 and 25 47 qsu respectively it showed a slightly increasing trend at other times with an average of 24 27 qsu the vertical distributions of protein like substances c3 were different at different sampling times the fmax of c3 gradually increased from 16 72 to 20 80 qsu on august 21st while it decreased from 21 17 to 16 70 qsu on september 4th c3 was relatively stable on august 28th september 11th and september 18th with average values of 20 36 18 10 and 12 92 qsu respectively the vertical distributions of uva humic like substance c4 had little change at any time as water depth increased the fmax of c4 increased from 17 47 to 18 47 qsu with an average of 18 06 qsu the vertical distributions of dom were different at different sampling times the fmax of dom first decreased then increased with an average of 85 82 qsu on september 4th while it had an opposite trend with an average of 86 84 qsu on september 11th and it showed an increasing trend at other times with an average of 79 66 qsu in addition the depth range of the upper layer was generally same as that of the epilimnion in the middle layer of dom stratification the fmax of dom and its components increased dramatically as the water depth increased then it greatly decreased generating an apparent peak the average fmax of the peaks of c1 c2 c3 c4 dom were 26 18 28 96 22 69 21 84 99 67 qsu respectively the highest of peaks of c1 c2 c3 c4 dom appeared on september 4th reaching 27 81 32 09 26 02 23 47 109 24 qsu respectively furthermore the thickness of this layer was obviously larger than that of metalimnion but the bottom depth of this layer increased with the increase of metalimnion thickness in the lower layer of dom stratification the fmax of dom and its components remained stable generally except for september 4th which needed further study in the future the average fmax of c1 c2 c3 c4 dom were 24 41 26 00 17 31 20 26 87 99 qsu respectively which were lower than that of middle layer but higher than that of upper layer furthermore the overall fmax of dom in the whole water tended to rise at first then fell as time passed 4 3 vertical distribution of spectral indices of dom at present some spectral indices are often used to assist the analysis of dom characteristics see section 2 5 for the meanings of different spectral indices wang et al 2017 ge et al 2021 this study also analyzed the vertical distribution of dom spectral indices in the upper layer of dom stratification the average of fi hix and suva254 were 1 78 3 71 2 43 l mg c 1 m 1 respectively lower than those in the other two layers while sr was relatively large with an average of 9 37 compared with the upper layer fi hix and suva254 increased with averages of 1 81 4 00 3 33 l mg c 1 m 1 respectively while sr decreased with an average of 8 54 in the middle layer in the lower layer of dom stratification fi increased from 1 82 to 1 87 with an average of 1 84 higher than that in the other two layers hix and suva254 had averages of 3 75 and 3 00 l mg c 1 m 1 respectively which were lower than those in the middle layer the average of sr was 8 06 smaller than that in the upper layer fig 5 the foregoing discussion further illustrated dom stratified in the reservoir and the stratification characteristics differed from those of thermal stratification this was because dom was not only affected by thermal stratification but also affected by the vertical profiles of many physicochemical factors nutrients phytoplankton and microbes dom quantities and properties in different dom layers in panjiakou reservoir depended on various influencing factors of each layer which will be discussed in detail in the following sections 4 4 influencing factors of dom in the upper layer of dom stratification the rda ordination diagram of dom characteristics and environmental factors in the upper layer was shown in fig 6a the eigenvalues for the first and second axes were 0 76 and 0 11 respectively the two axes accounted for 92 1 of the observed variation in dom components and properties of the relationships of the dom environmental factors the analysis showed the protein like substance c3 positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass and nitrogen nutrients this could be due to the epilimnion s sunny and nutrient rich conditions which caused phytoplankton to flourish and release a large amount of c3 in the upper layer during photosynthesis wei et al 2019 found phytoplankton in the weihe river released a lot of protein like substances with peaks of λex em 240 280 338 nm castillo et al 2010 found that phytoplankton secreted protein like substances with peaks of λex em 275 340 nm during indoor culture the peaks of protein like substances found in these studies were similar to the peaks of c3 λex em 230 290 340 nm in this study further confirming that c3 was mainly influenced by phytoplankton growth uva humic like substance c1 positively correlated with microbe fig 6a this was due to the presence of a significant number of microbes in the epilimnion which were active when the water temperature was high and emitted quite an amount of endogenous dom kamjunke et al 2016 xu and guo 2018 found uva humic like substance with a peak at λex em 320 430 nm in the milwaukee estuary usa was related to microbial activities chen et al 2021 found that uva humic like substance peaks at λex em 245 325 400 nm secreted by microbes existed in wwtp of hebei province china the uva humic like substance in these studies was similar to the peak of c1 λex em 260 310 400 nm in this study which was a product of microbial degradation this study found that the average fi of the upper layer was 1 78 between 1 4 and 1 9 indicating that the upper layer not only had endogenous dom input but also had an external contribution li et al 2022 fig 6a showed uvc humic like substance c2 and uva humic like substance c4 positively correlated with no3 n that indicated c2 and c4 were homologous with no3 n in the upper layer he et al 2021 at present many studies have shown uvc and uva humic like substances are common terrestrial aromatic humic acid organic compounds in water bai et al 2015 found two terrestrial humic like substances existed in the yangtze river estuary namely uvc humic like substance with peaks at λex em 270 360 440 nm and uva humic like substance with a peak at λex em 260 495 nm he et al 2021 found two kinds of humic like substance with peaks of λex em 255 454 nm and λex em 260 474 nm from terrestrial sources existed in mountain ponds in china the peak values of humic like substance in these studies were similar to the peaks of c2 λex em 260 460 nm and c4 λex em 270 500 nm in this study this further inferred c2 and c4 were derived from soil or terrestrial plant decomposition according to huang and xiang 2015 a substantial amount of nitrogen fertilizer was sprayed to cropland in the upper reaches of panjiakou reservoir surface runoff carried fertilizers comprising nitrogen nutrients as well as a terrestrial humic like substance into the luanhe river and its tributaries which ultimately flowed into the reservoir the inflow density upstream of the reservoir is mainly determined by the suspended sediment content and water temperature since the inflow sediment concentration was low during the study period wei et al 2021 the inflow density was mainly affected by the water temperature the higher the temperature the lower the water density in the summer the temperature of the upstream inflow is often lower than or close to that of the surface water in the reservoir but significantly higher than that of the bottom water choi et al 2001 therefore the upstream inflow will enter the epilimnion and metalimnion thus affecting the composition and properties of dom in the upper and middle layer besides despite the low input sediment concentration terrigenous dom induced an increase in turbidity therefore c2 and c4 in the upper layer positively correlated with turbidity in addition phytoplankton absorbed co2 in water and released o2 through photosynthesis raising the ph of water with increasing water depth phytoplankton growth declined ph decreased dom accumulated and dom was found to be adversely linked with ph in general the aromaticity and molecular weight of dom produced by algal and microbial activities are often lower than those of humic like compounds derived from terrestrial sources helms 2012 this study found suva254 in the upper layer was significantly lower than that in the other two layers while sr was the opposite indicating that the aromaticity and molecular weight of dom were smaller this may be due to photochemical degradation of humic like substances from terrestrial sources according to xu et al 2018 sun radiation easily affected humic like substances resulting in photochemical degradation which destroyed dom benzene ring and other unsaturated structures lowering dom amount molecular weight and aromaticity finally both endogenous dom and photochemical degradation of humic like substances lead to dom with low molecular weight and low aromaticity in the upper layers of dom stratification 4 5 influencing factors of dom in the middle layer of dom stratification the rda ordination diagram of dom environmental factors in the middle layer was shown in fig 6b the eigenvalues for the first and second axes were 0 72 and 0 10 respectively the two axes accounted for 91 0 of the observed variation in dom characteristics of the relationships of dom environmental factors the results showed protein like substance c3 positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass and nitrogen nutrients this was probably because phytoplankton produced plenty of protein like substances during its growth the phytoplankton biomass increased in the metalimnion but decreased in the hypolimnion fig 2e1 as a result c3 increased first then reduced in the middle layer in addition uva humic like substance c1 also positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass which was because the dead algae in the metalimnion and the sinking algae after dead in the epilimnion generated dom in the decomposition process sadchikov and ostroumov 2020 meanwhile c1 positively correlated with microbe however with the increase of water depth both the phytoplankton biomass and microbial cell concentrations decreased resulting in the trend of c1 first increasing then decreasing in the middle layer furthermore due to phytoplankton respiration and degradation large amounts of oxygen were consumed and carbon dioxide and organic acids were released hargrave 1969 meanwhile the photosynthesis of phytoplankton was limited by light therefore dom negatively correlated with do and ph in conclusion phytoplankton metabolism and microbial degradation were the primary influences on endogenous dom in the middle layer the average fi of the middle layer was 1 81 indicating that dom of this layer was both from endogenous sources and external sources it was found that c2 and c4 positively correlated with tn tdn and no3 n in the middle layer the layer had a high degree of humification and aromaticity fig 5b c chen et al 2011 derrien et al 2017 and the molecular weight also increased significantly fig 5d given that terrestrial humic like substances typically have higher aromaticity molecular weight and humification fichot and benner 2012 it was likely that terrestrial dom was introduced into the middle layer as discussed above the middle layer was also partly affected by runoff however the terrestrial input of dom decreased in the hypolimnion so c2 and c4 quantity increased then decreased in the middle layer moreover due to the weak photodegradation of this layer dom retained the properties of the terrestrial source but the humification and aromaticity decreased slightly 4 6 influencing factors of dom in the lower layer of dom stratification fig 6c showed the rda ordination diagram of dom environmental factors in the lower layer the eigenvalues for the first and second axes were 0 65 and 0 12 respectively the two axes accounted for 85 0 of the observed variation in dom characteristics of the relationships of dom environmental factors this study found the average fi in the lower layer was 1 84 indicating that this layer was mainly influenced by endogenous sources the terrestrial humic like substance components c2 and c4 gradually decreased with the increase of water depth fig 2d resulting in the continuous decrease of suva254 and hix fig 5 in addition uva humic like substance c1 positively correlated with microbe indicating that dom in this layer was affected by microbial degradation activities however the biomass and activities of aerobic bacteria in the hypolimnion reduced because of low temperature and low do causing that c1 decreased in the lower layer furthermore due to limited light in the hypolimnion phytoplankton biomass was severely reduced leading to a decrease in c3 in the lower layer fig 6c also showed dom and nutrients especially phosphorus nutrients had a negative correlation which was mainly influenced by the release of nutrients from sediments before 2017 cage fish culture was vigorously developed in panjiakou reservoir kang et al 2020 and a lot of fish food was put into water it has been found that fish food utilization rate was low with more than 65 remaining in the water phillips et al 1986 therefore the sediments of panjiakou reservoir were mainly fish food which contained a mass of organic nitrogen and organophosphorus yang et al 2021 under the activities of microbes organic nitrogen and organophosphorus were mineralized into inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and thus released into the overlying water hansen et al 1993 increasing the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients fig 2b c 5 conclusions during the thermal stratification of panjiakou reservoir a channel type multiyear regulated deep water reservoir dom stratified with water depth but its stratification boundaries was not fully consistent with the thermal stratification ones this was because dom was affected not only by temperature but also by physicochemical factors nutrients and biological factors therefore dom characteristics of different layers should be appropriately and accurately analyzed based on its own stratification rather than the thermal stratification in the upper layer dom characteristics were affected by endogenous input and external contribution meanwhile photodegradation also directly affected dom resulting in low aromaticity and molecular weight of dom in the middle layer dom quantity first dramatically increased then greatly decreased generating an apparent peak the increase was due to the release of numerous of dom by phytoplankton secretion and microbial decomposition as well as runoff input in the metalimnion the decrease was caused by the decrease of the above factors moreover due to the weaken of photodegradation in this layer dom retained the properties of the terrestrial source of higher aromaticity molecular weight and degree of humification in the lower layer endogenous input had the maximum influence on dom properties resulting in a decrease in aromaticity and humification furthermore the low temperature and low do limited microbial activities and phytoplankton growth thus the average quantity of different layers dom ranked by middle layer lower layer upper layer this study is the first to propose dom stratification which is insightful and helpful for analyzing dom characteristics in different layers and optimizing reservoir drinking water treatment systems credit authorship contribution statement mengjiao wei data curation formal

trend from 1961 to 2015 in the upper middle reaches of the yzb spatially similar non monotonous changes were also detected with a turning point around 2000 which was greatly affected by precipitation periodic changes of annual and flood season runoff were significant on an approximate 3 year which was well correlated with precipitation and obviously different from dry season runoff the long range trend of runoff in 1961 2015 may be related to scaling behaviors in the midstream where about 10 7 14 9 of the trend of runoff were explained by precipitation in flood seasons precipitation changes contributed to above 50 of the runoff tendency and thus can be considered as the major driving factor of runoff changes in the upper stream and ny sub basin the study provides a new understanding of runoff precipitation variation through a comprehensive and quantitative analysis graphical abstract ga1 key words runoff variation precipitation trend periodicity climate changes 1 introduction driven by global climate changes and human activities global hydrological cycle and water balance are changing considerably in aspects of time space and quantity ipcc 2014 in this context understanding and grasping the evolution law of the hydrological cycle is one of the hot issues in the field of hydrology and is also significant for adaptive management of water resources as a key element in surface hydrological cycle runoff is a comprehensive reaction of the whole complex hydrological processes under influences of various factors such as climate and underlying surface yuan et al 2014 the variability of runoff directly reflects the underlying dynamics of the hydrological cycle therefore a better understanding of runoff variation and its temporal and regional connections with other impact factors can lead to better hydrological modeling and regional water resources management coulibaly and burn 2004 the yarlung zangbo river basin yzb is the largest river system in the south of the tibetan plateau the yarlung zangbo river i e upper brahmaputra river is a major pathway of water vapor transportation and also an international transborder river with rich water energy and important strategic position the terrain and climate conditions in the yzb are extremely unique and complex with an average elevation of above 4000 m dynamic interactions are prominent between cryosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere and the hydrological processes are complicated and sensitive to climate changes with high uncertainty li et al 2014 liu et al 2018a factors affecting runoff evolution are various and extremely complicated in the yzb pervez and henebry 2015 tang et al 2019 therefore runoff variation and its driving factors in the yzb have been the concerns of hydrology researchers for many years as for runoff variations of the yzb in the past decades most studies showed that there was no significant trend in the annual runoff of the mainstream cuo et al 2014 tang et al 2019 however the descriptions on specific characteristics of variation are often inconsistent in different studies since the data length and analysis methods used are often different for example huang et al 2007 concluded that annual runoff in the middle reaches of the yzb i e nugesha yangcun and nuxia hydrological stations decreased from 1956 to 2000 which is consistent with the conclusion by cao et al 2006 while the results from cuo et al 2019 indicated that annual runoff in the middle reaches was insignificantly increased in 1956 2011 liu et al 2018a obtained that annual runoff in the yzb slightly increased in 1982 2011 but runoff coefficient slightly decreased in addition liu et al 2018b considered that annual runoff at two hydrological stations yangcun and lhatse of the mainstream showed a decrease increase alternating trend in 1961 2009 therefore it can be found that runoff in the yzb may be characterized by a nonlinear variation and obvious spatial differences which are seldom analyzed systematically recently meanwhile runoff variation in the yzb is considered to be mainly related to climate among which one of the most important impact factors is precipitation sang et al 2016 tang et al 2019 according to some studies annual runoff and precipitation at the main hydrological stations showed significant positive correlation with correlation coefficients of above 0 8 and precipitation thus dominates the variation of annual runoff in the yzb nie et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 cuo et al 2019 nevertheless previous studies on the relationships between runoff and precipitation variation were mainly based on correlation analysis of two original series the mechanisms of runoff and precipitation processes are different and both show complex variability of multi time scale and nonlinearity labat 2005 lima and lall 2010 the relationships between runoff and precipitation may be different on different spatial temporal scales it is therefore difficult to effectively identify the intrinsic relations between runoff and precipitation by directly using the correlation analysis more importantly although precipitation is considered as a major driving factor of runoff changes few studies quantified the impacts of precipitation changes on runoff variations in the yzb with the application of some emerging analytical approaches recently a comprehensive analysis by combining different methods is especially necessary to describe runoff variation from different perspectives and to achieve more accurate and thorough understanding of complex characteristics of runoff variation meanwhile affected by the length of observed data the analytic studies can provide only a limited knowledge of runoff variation over a period given all the studies and the need for a good understanding of runoff changes comprehensive studies on runoff on different time scales and spatial distributions are required to investigate the complex characteristics of runoff variation and its impact factors based on the collection and extension of runoff data therefore based on longer runoff series at more stations the study attempts to systematically investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of runoff variation and quantified the impacts of precipitation variation on runoff on space time multi scales in the yzb using a comprehensive analysis method this is a comprehensive analyses of runoff changes and a quantitative discussion on the intrinsic relations of runoff and precipitation through decomposition and reconstruction of runoff specifically three aspects are pursued in this study 1 to clarify the spatiotemporal characteristics and differences of seasonal distribution and interannual variation of runoff 2 to reveal the complex correlations of runoff and precipitation variation on multi temporal scales 3 to quantified the impacts of precipitation on interannual variation of runoff this study is a basic but important step for water resources management in the yzb even the tibetan plateau and can provide basic supports for researches of hydrological mechanism and water resources 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yarlung zangbo river originates from the gyima yangzoin glacier in western tibetan plateau tp and flows through the whole southern tp and eventually into india called brahmaputra in india with a length of approximate 2057 km in china fig 1 it is the longest river in the tp and is also one of the highest major rivers in the world with an average elevation of over 4000 m above the sea level li et al 2013 the yarlung zangbo river basin yzb is between 82º00 97º07 e and 28º00 31º16 n with an area of 0 24 million km2 its maximum distance is about 1500 km from west to east but is only 290 km from south to north larger tributaries in the yzb include the lhasa river ls the nyang river ny the nianchu river nc and the parlung zangbo river etc fig 1 the yzb is generally divided into upper middle and lower reaches by taking the lhatse i e s10 and nuxia i e s1 hydrological stations as bounds fig 1 and table 1 the average annual runoff depth ranges from 100 mm in the upper reaches to over 620 mm in the lower reaches table 1 climatic and hydrologic conditions of the yzb are mainly dominated by geographic and topographic features of the tp and thus vary significantly with regions li et al 2013 the climate is warm and rainy in the southeast valleys with multi year average precipitation of over 1000 mm and multi year average temperature of 8 6 c while gradually becomes dry and cold from east to west the climate of the upper middle reaches is characterized by intense solar radiation low humidity and highly differences in daily temperature and distinct division of dry and wet seasons li et al 2014 mean annual precipitation varies from about 335 mm in the upper reaches to over 700 mm in the eastern region of the midstream table 1 and mostly falls in may to september sang et al 2016 meanwhile due to the influences of altitude and climatic conditions surrounding vegetation also shows significantly zonal distribution from downstream to upstream which changes from evergreen forest to deciduous scrub to arid steppe vegetation and ultimately changes to cold desert liu et al 2014 sun et al 2019 2 2 data description monthly runoff data measured at 12 hydrological stations were used to analyze runoff variability in the yzb the data were provided by the hydrology and water resource survey bureau tibet autonomous region of china all series have the same measurement years from 1961 to 2015 with no missing segments the 12 hydrological stations include 4 stations located in the mainstream of the yzb and 8 stations respectively from three main tributaries namely the ny the ls and the nc which can basically cover the whole up and mid stream regions of the yzb fig 1 and table 1 the long series of observed runoff data in the lower reaches of the yzb is usually not publicly available as a result investigations on runoff variability were mainly focused on the upper middle reaches of the yzb fig 1 precipitation data measured at 6 weather stations were used to approximately represent precipitation conditions of regions corresponding to the hydrological stations fig 1 and table 1 the precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn all precipitation series also have the same measurement years from 1961 to 2015 the six stations respectively control the main regions of the upper middle reaches as well as the three main sub basins ny ls and nc sub basins precipitation data at other weather stations was not used since the data series were not long enough or did not better correspond to other hydrological stations 2 3 methods 2 3 1 concentration ratio and concentration period for calculation of the concentration ration cr and concentration period cp it is assumed that monthly runoff is a vector with its magnitude as vector length and its located month as vector direction one year is considered as a cycle of 360 and the ith month corresponds to θ i 360 12 i 30 i i 1 2 12 the vector of monthly runoff can be expressed as 1 c r r x 2 r y 2 i 1 12 r i 2 c p arctan r x r y with 3 r x i 1 12 r i sin θ i r y i 1 12 r i cos θ i where r i is the runoff in the ith month r x and r y are the resulting vector in the direction of x and y respectively the cp is actually the angle indicated by the center of gravity of the vector which reflects the month in which maximum monthly runoff occurs in a year the cr indicates the concentrated degree of monthly runoff in a year with a value of between 0 and 1 2 3 2 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis wa is a powerful method to analyze complex variations of time series and has been widely applied in hydrology since the 1990s sang 2013 wa is a local time frequency analysis that can identify significant multi temporal fluctuation of time series through decomposing time series into time frequency domain using wavelet transform in general wavelet analysis can be classified into two types as continuous and discrete wavelet analysis the continuous wavelet transform cwt is more appropriate for revealing the characteristics of time series with multi temporal scale and non stationary the discrete wavelet transform dwt is usually used to identify and decompose different components of time series so as to aid the various time series analyses such as trend detection denoising of wavelet threshold and wavelet based hydrology simulating and forecasting sang 2013 2 3 2 1 continuous wavelet transform observed hydrological series in nature is usually discrete signals for discrete time series x n n 1 n with uniform time step of dt and length of n its continuous wavelet transform is defined as the convolution of x n with the scaled and normalized wavelet torrence and compo 1998 4 w x a b n 1 n x n ψ a b n with 5 ψ a b n d t a 1 2 ψ a b n b d t a a b r a 0 where w x a b is the continuous wavelet coefficient ψ a b n is the complex conjugate of mother wavelet ψ a b n a is temporal scale b is time translation factor and d t a 1 2 is used for normalizing wavelet to have unit energy on each scale a w x a b 2 is defined as wavelet power spectrum that represents the energy of series x n in the given scale and time domain and its variation represents energy distribution of series with time under different scales global wavelet spectrum gws can be obtained by averaging the wavelet power spectrum over time under different scales 6 g w s a 1 n 1 n w x a b 2 variation of gws can clearly describe the average energy changes with temporal scale based on which periodic characteristics of the series and its intensity can be identified generally temporal scales with peak energy values are the dominant periods significance test for time averaged wavelet spectrum i e gws is evaluated based on a background spectrum of red noise torrence and compo 1998 2 3 2 2 discrete wavelet transform following the wa theory the dwt of the above time series x n is often expressed as 7 w x j k n 1 n x n ψ j k n with 8 ψ j k n a 0 j 2 ψ a 0 j n b 0 k where a 0 and b 0 are constants integer j is decomposition level and k is time translation factor as the same b mentioned in eq 5 w x j k is the discrete wavelet coefficient under level j ψ j k n is the complex conjugate of mother wavelet ψ j k n in practice the dyadic discrete wavelet transform is commonly used by setting a 0 2 and b 0 1 mallat 1989 thus the expression is 9 ψ j k n 2 j 2 ψ 2 j n k generally maximum value m of decomposition level j is determined by eq 10 based on the length n of x n sang 2013 10 m log 2 n based on dwt the original series x n can be decomposed and reconstructed at different decomposition levels kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 11 x n j 1 m x j n x m with 12 x j n k w x j k ψ 2 j n k where x j n is the subsequence of original series x n at level j j 1 2 m which characterizes the detailed variation component in original series at level j x m is the approximate subsequence of original series at the maximum decomposition level j m which could define and describe the trend of series x n on the maximum time scale i e n almasri et al 2008 when the trend of series x n on certain smaller time scale k k n is concerned the sum of all subsequences at larger than the decomposition level of log2 k is considered as the trend identified as calculated by eq 11 magnitude of trend is determined using the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 given as eq 13 significance test for each subsequence at each decomposition level is conducted through the approach based on noise energy distribution proposed by sang et al 2013 13 β m e d i a n x j x i j i for all i j 2 3 3 dfa method the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa can explore the scaling behavior also called as long term persistence ltp of time series peng et al 1995 for a series x n with length n and given scale s it is first divided into segments of equal length s in each segment of length s the least square method is used to fit the data linearly for obtaining the local trend the y coordinate of the straight line segment is represented by x s n and the time series x n is detrended by subtracting the local trend x s n in each segment the fluctuation function f s of the detrended sequences is calculated by 14 f s 1 n n 1 n x n x s n 2 computation is repeated for all time scales to characterize the relationship between f s and scale s on a log log plot a linear relationship of log s and log f s indicates the presence of scaling behavior of which the slope is thus scaling coefficient h a scaling coefficient of 0 h 1 represents a power law scaling behavior of time series theoretically a h greater than 0 5 and less than 1 0 corresponds to long range correlated series and h 0 5 indicates an anticorrelation form while a coefficient h 0 5 corresponds to uncorrelated white noise peng et al 1995 significance of scaling coefficient h 0 5 is determined using mean value μ h and standard deviation σ h when h 0 5 which is normal distribution the μ h and σ h are functions of the sample size n as given by the following equations hamed 2008 15 μ h 0 5 2 87 n 0 9067 16 σ h 0 77654 n 0 5 0 0062 using eqs 15 and 16 a confidence interval around h 0 5 is constructed at a significant level of 0 05 to assess the significance of estimated h in this study 2 3 4 mk test and mk considering scaling behavior mk s the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 will be used to determine the changing point of trend of time series the detailed description on the mk test can be found in appendix b mk test is performed for the positive and reverse series of x n to obtain statistics z and z respectively the changing point of trend of x n can be determined based on the intersection and position of the two statistics of z and z the significant scaling behavior can greatly affect trend test hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 to consider the effects of scaling behaviors of time series the mk test considering scaling behavior mk s proposed by hamed 2008 was referred in this study the variance of s is calculated using the following equation if scaling coefficient h is found to be significant it is determined in 2 3 3 17 v a r h s i j k l 2 π sin 1 ρ j i ρ i l ρ j k ρ i k 2 2 ρ i j 2 2 ρ k l 18 ρ l 1 2 l 1 2 h 2 l 2 h l 1 2 h where var h s is variance of s when considering scaling coefficient h ρ l is autocorrelation function of time series at lag l for a given h and is independent of the time scale koutsoyiannis 2003 i j k l is indices of time series because var h s is a biased estimate a bias correction factor b is used to calculate an unbiased estimate var h s in eq 19 19 v a r h s b v a r h s where b is a function of h and n the length of time series and is given in appendix a substituting var h s for var s in mk equations to calculate the results of mk s effects of scaling behavior are evaluated through comparing the magnitude of trend eq 13 between original series and series considering scaling behavior 3 results analysis and discussion 3 1 seasonal distribution of runoff the cr and cp values as well as the ratio of runoff in flood seasons may to october to annual runoff hereafter simply ratio of flood season runoff were calculated to quantitatively characterize the seasonal distribution of runoff the monthly runoff of the mainstream s1 s5 s9 and s10 showed a multiyear average cr of 0 56 0 52 from east to west of the upper middle reaches with corresponding range of 0 45 0 66 0 32 0 69 0 33 0 70 and 0 31 0 66 during 1961 2015 which exhibited little spatial differences but significant interannual fluctuations figs 2a 1 according to cp values the maximum monthly runoff mainly occurred in july august but was gradually delayed from late july of s1 station to mid august of s10 station over space figs 2b 1 meanwhile the mean ratio of flood season runoff decreased from 76 to 71 from east to west figs 2c 1 showing consistent spatial changes with the precipitation sang et al 2016 the seasonal distribution of runoff in the ny ls and the nc sub basins showed similar spatial changes to the mainstream from east to west the three sub basins had an average cr value of 0 65 0 62 and 0 46 respectively figs 2a 2 3 4 the mean cp values were mid july late july and mid august in the three sub basins figs 2b 2 3 4 while the flood season runoff averagely accounted for 83 79 and 67 of annual runoff respectively figs 2c 2 3 4 overall runoff presented similar patterns of seasonal distribution in different years over the yzb despite of significant interannual fluctuations of runoff magnitude namely the runoff peak mainly appeared in july august with a cr of above 0 5 on average and flood season runoff could occupy over 70 of total annual runoff at different stations in space the flood season runoff appeared gradually later cp increased but its duration became shorter cr decreased from east midstream to upstream and the ratio of flood season runoff gradually decreased the spatial differences reflect a closely relationship with spatial changes of climatic conditions 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of runoff the annual and seasonal flood season and dry season runoff of each hydrological station was decomposed and reconstructed at 6 levels using dwt method the detailed and approximate subsequences were respectively obtained for runoff series of each station at each decomposition level the results of dwt and significance test were provided in appendix b according to the dwt the approximate subsequences at 6th decomposition level on 55 year scale could represent the trend of runoff changes during 1961 2015 as shown in fig 3 annual runoff of the mainstream and its main tributaries mainly showed a monotonous downward trend from 1961 to 2015 except for runoff of the ny i e s2 with an increasing trend among which only the trends of annual runoff at s10 and s4 stations were significant α 0 05 fig 3 from upstream to east midstream the average changing rate of annual runoff changed from significant decrease e g s10 to slight decrease e g s5 and even to increase s2 table 2 meanwhile the annual runoff of each station also presented similar non monotonous changes on 20 year scale i e the 4th decomposition level specifically performing a slightly downward trend before the 1985 and then an increase decrease trend during 1985 2015 fig 3 the specific turning points were further detected using the mk test showing a shift of changing trend in around 2000 at most stations fig 4 the trend of annual runoff on 20 year scale were significant α 0 05 at most stations excluding the stations in the upper ny ls and nc sub basins i e s3 s7 and s11 fig 3 the average changing rate of runoff for every 11 years was further analyzed fig 5 the runoff generally showed slight decreases in the periods of 1961 1982 and then became increased in the 1983 2004 especially in 1990 s obvious decreasing trends were then presented at most stations in the period of 2005 2015 it indicated more dramatic changes of runoff after 1990 s by contrast runoff in ny sub basin s2 and s3 changes relatively slightly compared to other stations especially in 2005 2015 when large decreases were showed in other stations fig 5 implying different driving factors of runoff changes in the ny sub basin from other regions comparing the changes of runoff in flood season may october and dry season november next april flood season runoff changes slightly smaller than that of annual runoff in the mainstream where dry season runoff changes obviously fig 5 in the sub basins ny ls and nc flood season runoff generally changed at a rate slightly lager than that of annual runoff while dry season changed very slightly or reversely such as s2 and s12 fig 5 it implies that the changes of annual runoff are mainly dominated by flood season runoff while dry season runoff has weak impacts on annual runoff fig 6 presents the gws of runoff series during 1961 2015 annual runoff of the mainstream s1 s5 s9 s10 and the ny and nc sub basins showed energy peak in about 3 year and 12 year periods which both passed the significance test fig 6 annual runoff in the ls sub basin e g s6 s8 mainly showed energy peaks in 3 year 12 year and 20 year periods fig 6 flood season runoff exhibited the same gws changes as annual runoff while gwss of dry season runoff mainly showed energy peaks in around 12 year at most stations fig 6 the periodicity of runoff is thus considered to be mainly dominated by flood season runoff and had periodic variations of 3 years and 12 years nevertheless it could be noted that the gws peak of dry season runoff were different from that of flood season runoff in the ny s2 upper ls s8 and upper nc s11 fig 6 which may be related to the greater influences of glacier and snow melt on runoff in these regions qiu et al 2014 chen et al 2017 jin et al 2019 3 3 scaling behavior of runoff and its effects scaling behavior is an aggregated phenomenon at large time scales koutsoyiannis 2002 reflecting long range variation characteristics of time series the scaling behavior of annual runoff was thus preliminarily discussed using the dfa method as shown in table 2 the scaling coefficient h of annual runoff at 12 stations were all significantly greater than 0 5 with a minimum of 0 638 at s10 station and a maximum of 0 943 at s7 station indicating that annual runoff had a long range positive correlation within 20 years namely a consistent changing trend moreover scaling behavior can reflect the different mechanism induced by surrounding environment on large scales koscielny bunde et al 2006 annual runoff had scaling coefficient h of mostly near 0 85 in the west and center midstream located in the western side of mira mountain where there is similar hydrological and climatic environment such as s5 and s9 of the mainstream s6 s8 of the ls sub basin and s11 s12 of the nc sub basin by contrast the h values of annual runoff were smaller than 0 8 in the ny sub basin s2 and s3 and the upper stream s10 table 2 the ny sub basin located in the east of the mira mountain is mainly influenced by the strong indian summer monsoon with warm moist airflow while the upstream region is dominated more by westerlies yao et al 2012 li et al 2019 which are both greatly different from the climate in the central yzb hence the differences between these two climatic conditions were also reflected in their different scaling behaviors the trend of annual runoff may be overestimated resulting from the existence of significant scaling behavior hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 the mk s test was thus applied to annual runoff to evaluate the effects of scaling behavior as shown in table 2 the magnitude of trend was recalculated for each annual runoff series after considering the fluctuations caused by scaling behaviors the magnitude of trend of annual runoff here referring to absolute value was changed by 2 5 87 5 of which about 6 12 and 9 12 stations showed over 50 and 40 reductions respectively table 2 only the runoff of s2 station originally showing increasing trend had an increase of 2 5 the above indicated that the scaling behavior caused a downward trend and had effects on detected trend generally the larger changes of trend slope 50 corresponded to larger scaling coefficient h 0 8 while h less than 0 8 had less effects on trend furthermore a reconstructed runoff series with a length of 400 years for the ls river i e s6 was used here to further verify the variations of runoff on large temporal scales and its scaling behavior the runoff series was reconstructed from tree rings chen et al 2019 the analyses of reconstructed runoff series indicated that the downward trend during 1961 2015 could be regarded as a part of the fluctuations on 100 year scale as shown in figs 7a 7b meanwhile the scaling coefficient h was larger than 0 5 within 50 years i e log s 1 7 indicating a monotonous trend of runoff could maintain within 50 years fig 7c this also demonstrates that above trend of runoff on 55 year scale may be related to the scaling behavior 3 4 correlation between runoff and precipitation correlations between runoff and precipitation at 6 stations were analyzed in detail for seasonal and interannual variations the seasonal variations of runoff were consistent with precipitation at each station but overall behind precipitation by one month fig 8 as shown in table 3 the months when runoff began to increase significantly had maximum increase and decrease rate and reached to peak were all one month behind that of precipitation at most stations however in the ls s6 and ny sub basins s2 the increase rate of monthly runoff reached to maximum in june and may respectively which was one month earlier than that of other stations in the same region but was in accordance with corresponding precipitation table 3 moreover it was interesting that the maximal increase rate of monthly runoff averaged 12 5 in may in the ny sub basin which was significantly higher than that of precipitation in this month 7 7 on the contrary the maximal increase rates of monthly runoff at other stations were all lower than that of precipitation table 3 it closely well corresponds with the largest snowmelt in may in the ny sub basin jin et al 2019 implying that the runoff is greatly influenced by glacier and snow melt etc besides of precipitation in the ny sub basin the interannual variations of runoff and precipitation series were compared as shown in fig 9 from the cumulative departure curves cdc of runoff and precipitation during 1961 2015 fig 9 the cdcs of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons illustrated basically similar changes with correlation coefficients of mostly above 0 70 in particular both of the two cdcs showed the same turning points at all stations fig 9 in contrast changes of dry season runoff showed little similarity with corresponding precipitation but were similar to flood season runoff except for the runoff of s2 station fig 9 the variations of runoff coefficients rc runoff precipitation were also showed in table 4 the rc decreased in the east midstream s1 and s2 and ls sub basin s6 during 55 years while increased in the west s12 and center midstream s5 and upper stream s10 of which the trend was significant at s2 and s6 stations table 4 the decreases of rc at s1 and s6 stations mainly resulted from the decreases of runoff and increases of precipitation or slightly changes by contrast the decrease of rc at s2 station was mainly due to less increase rate of runoff than that of precipitation the increases of rc at stations of s5 s10 and s12 were mainly induced by great decreases of precipitation table 4 looking at changes in different periods the rc of s2 s5 and s12 stations changed consistently in every 11 years overall table 4 and were thus approximately monotonous the rc of s1 s6 and s10 stations changed non monotonously which presented contrary trend during 1983 2004 to trend on 55 year scale table 4 overall the rc changed in different periods were highly related to different changes of runoff and precipitation and were indicated in detail in table 4 the correlations between runoff and precipitation were further analyzed on different temporal scales based on the decomposed subsequences of runoff and precipitation from dwt the subsequences were at a total of 6 decomposition levels d1 d6 on 3 year scale d1 the fluctuations of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons were well correlated at each station with a correlation coefficient range of 0 77 0 84 fig 10a on 12 year d3 and over 30 year scales d5 d6 the correlation coefficient of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons reached to 0 8 above at most stations fig 10a whereas the correlations of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons were overall weak at the 2th and 4th decomposition levels d2 and d4 for all stations fig 10a by contrast variations of dry season runoff were weakly related to corresponding precipitation on different temporal scales over space fig 10b meanwhile comparisons of runoff variations in flood and dry seasons illustrated that the variations of runoff in flood and dry seasons were quite different at d1 and d2 levels but were similar on scales of 12 year d3 and over 30 year d5 d6 fig 10c furthermore it could be found that both flood and dry season runoff showed similar variations on 12 year d3 and over 30 year d5 scales among different stations over space fig 10d e which was quite different from that of precipitation fig 10f it implies that the interannual variations of runoff are directly driven by flood season precipitation on 3 year scale in the upper middle reaches however spatially consistent changes of runoff in both flood and dry seasons on 12 year and larger scales may result from the influences of other large scale factors or nonlinear processes koutsoyiannis 2006 prokoph et al 2012 fu et al 2012 3 5 contribution of precipitation to runoff variation since the variations of annual runoff were mainly related to flood season precipitation thus flood season precipitation series was employed to fit the annual runoff for quantifying the impacts of precipitation on annual runoff variations the following runoff and precipitation series all refer to annual runoff and flood season precipitation respectively precipitation subsequences of each station at d1 d6 levels were used to reconstruct the runoff series for each station comparisons between fitted and original runoff are shown in fig 11 the yellow and blue points in fig 11 respectively represent the goodness of fit with and without the trend term of precipitation between which the difference is the trend of fitted runoff series the trend of fitted runoff as compared with the actual trend of runoff was thus considered as the explained proportion of runoff trend by precipitation the r2 of fitted runoff to original runoff was 0 56 0 80 among different stations when excluding the trend of precipitation series while the r2 was increased to 0 59 0 84 when including the trend of precipitation series fig 11 which indicates a positive contribution of trend of precipitation to actual runoff variation concretely in the middle reaches of the yzb including s1 s5 s2 s6 and s12 the r2 of fitted runoff to original runoff was 0 73 0 84 which means the fitted runoff can well explain 73 84 of actual runoff variations at these stations fig 11 however the r2 of fitted runoff to original runoff was 0 59 in the upper stream i e s10 fig 11 namely that the fitted runoff only explained about 59 of the actual runoff variation which was relatively lower than that in the midstream this may be related to two reasons the first is that the hydro climatic conditions are greatly different from that of the middle reaches and thus result in different evolution rules of the upstream runoff to some extent the second is that the upstream yzb is a wide area covering several longitudes where the dominant climate varies spatially and thus the precipitation only at s10 station cannot well represent the precipitation variations of the entire upstream yzb as shown table 5 there was a similar proportion about 10 7 14 9 of the trend of runoff changes to be explained by precipitation changes in the central and western regions of the midstream including the mainstream s1 and s5 the ls sub basin s6 and the nc sub basin s12 table 5 the smaller explained proportion implies less influence of precipitation on the trend of runoff changes in contrast precipitation could explain about 53 7 and 59 4 of the trend of runoff changes at s10 and s2 stations respectively table 5 the results are also consistent with the results of scaling behavior and its effect analyses namely the insignificant downward trend of annual runoff in 1961 2015 may be mainly due to its own scaling behaviors in the central and western midstream while precipitation changes are a major driving factor of runoff tendency in the upper reaches s10 and the ny river s2 4 conclusions in this study the characteristics of runoff variation and response to precipitation on multi spatial and temporal scales were identified and analyzed in the yarlung zangbo river basin yzb of the southern tibetan plateau by using a comprehensive approach based on runoff and precipitation series of 55 years 1961 2015 from 12 hydrological stations four primary findings are as follows 1 the seasonal distribution of runoff varies as the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation but generally lags behind precipitation changes by about one month in time the flood season is delayed and becomes shorter and the ratio of flood season runoff to annual runoff decreases from downstream to upstream the contribution of glacier and snow melt to runoff was reflected in the nyang river ny sub basin and lhasa river ls sub basin in may june 2 annual runoff mainly showed a monotonous downward trend in the upper middle reaches from 1961 to 2015 except for runoff of the ny showing an upward trend similar significant non monotonous changes were also shown in most annual runoff series over space specifically performing a slight decrease trend before 1985 and then an increase decrease trend with a turning point around 2000 periodic variations of annual runoff were significant on an approximate 3 year and 12 year scales 3 runoff variation on 3 year scale was mainly affected by precipitation in flood seasons which was obviously different from the dry season runoff all annual runoff series had scaling coefficients h significantly greater than 0 5 which had effects on trend test of runoff 4 precipitation in flood seasons was estimated to explain about 10 7 14 9 of the trend of runoff in the midstream the explained proportion of runoff tendency by precipitation changes was comparatively higher in the upper reaches and the ny sub basin with estimated values of 53 7 and 59 4 respectively indicating precipitation is the major driving factor of runoff changes in these two regions the study can provide a new and important understanding for runoff

7922,study region the yarlung zangbo river basin yzb in the tibetan plateau tp study focus hydro climatic processes in the tp are greatly sensitive to global climate change but are not well understood nowadays due to the lack of hydro climatic observations in this study runoff variation and response to precipitation on multi spatial and temporal scales were identified and quantified by using a comprehensive approach based on time series of monthly runoff and precipitation during 1961 2015 new hydrological insights for the region annual runoff and flood season runoff mainly showed a downward trend from 1961 to 2015 in the upper middle reaches of the yzb spatially similar non monotonous changes were also detected with a turning point around 2000 which was greatly affected by precipitation periodic changes of annual and flood season runoff were significant on an approximate 3 year which was well correlated with precipitation and obviously different from dry season runoff the long range trend of runoff in 1961 2015 may be related to scaling behaviors in the midstream where about 10 7 14 9 of the trend of runoff were explained by precipitation in flood seasons precipitation changes contributed to above 50 of the runoff tendency and thus can be considered as the major driving factor of runoff changes in the upper stream and ny sub basin the study provides a new understanding of runoff precipitation variation through a comprehensive and quantitative analysis graphical abstract ga1 key words runoff variation precipitation trend periodicity climate changes 1 introduction driven by global climate changes and human activities global hydrological cycle and water balance are changing considerably in aspects of time space and quantity ipcc 2014 in this context understanding and grasping the evolution law of the hydrological cycle is one of the hot issues in the field of hydrology and is also significant for adaptive management of water resources as a key element in surface hydrological cycle runoff is a comprehensive reaction of the whole complex hydrological processes under influences of various factors such as climate and underlying surface yuan et al 2014 the variability of runoff directly reflects the underlying dynamics of the hydrological cycle therefore a better understanding of runoff variation and its temporal and regional connections with other impact factors can lead to better hydrological modeling and regional water resources management coulibaly and burn 2004 the yarlung zangbo river basin yzb is the largest river system in the south of the tibetan plateau the yarlung zangbo river i e upper brahmaputra river is a major pathway of water vapor transportation and also an international transborder river with rich water energy and important strategic position the terrain and climate conditions in the yzb are extremely unique and complex with an average elevation of above 4000 m dynamic interactions are prominent between cryosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere and the hydrological processes are complicated and sensitive to climate changes with high uncertainty li et al 2014 liu et al 2018a factors affecting runoff evolution are various and extremely complicated in the yzb pervez and henebry 2015 tang et al 2019 therefore runoff variation and its driving factors in the yzb have been the concerns of hydrology researchers for many years as for runoff variations of the yzb in the past decades most studies showed that there was no significant trend in the annual runoff of the mainstream cuo et al 2014 tang et al 2019 however the descriptions on specific characteristics of variation are often inconsistent in different studies since the data length and analysis methods used are often different for example huang et al 2007 concluded that annual runoff in the middle reaches of the yzb i e nugesha yangcun and nuxia hydrological stations decreased from 1956 to 2000 which is consistent with the conclusion by cao et al 2006 while the results from cuo et al 2019 indicated that annual runoff in the middle reaches was insignificantly increased in 1956 2011 liu et al 2018a obtained that annual runoff in the yzb slightly increased in 1982 2011 but runoff coefficient slightly decreased in addition liu et al 2018b considered that annual runoff at two hydrological stations yangcun and lhatse of the mainstream showed a decrease increase alternating trend in 1961 2009 therefore it can be found that runoff in the yzb may be characterized by a nonlinear variation and obvious spatial differences which are seldom analyzed systematically recently meanwhile runoff variation in the yzb is considered to be mainly related to climate among which one of the most important impact factors is precipitation sang et al 2016 tang et al 2019 according to some studies annual runoff and precipitation at the main hydrological stations showed significant positive correlation with correlation coefficients of above 0 8 and precipitation thus dominates the variation of annual runoff in the yzb nie et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 cuo et al 2019 nevertheless previous studies on the relationships between runoff and precipitation variation were mainly based on correlation analysis of two original series the mechanisms of runoff and precipitation processes are different and both show complex variability of multi time scale and nonlinearity labat 2005 lima and lall 2010 the relationships between runoff and precipitation may be different on different spatial temporal scales it is therefore difficult to effectively identify the intrinsic relations between runoff and precipitation by directly using the correlation analysis more importantly although precipitation is considered as a major driving factor of runoff changes few studies quantified the impacts of precipitation changes on runoff variations in the yzb with the application of some emerging analytical approaches recently a comprehensive analysis by combining different methods is especially necessary to describe runoff variation from different perspectives and to achieve more accurate and thorough understanding of complex characteristics of runoff variation meanwhile affected by the length of observed data the analytic studies can provide only a limited knowledge of runoff variation over a period given all the studies and the need for a good understanding of runoff changes comprehensive studies on runoff on different time scales and spatial distributions are required to investigate the complex characteristics of runoff variation and its impact factors based on the collection and extension of runoff data therefore based on longer runoff series at more stations the study attempts to systematically investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of runoff variation and quantified the impacts of precipitation variation on runoff on space time multi scales in the yzb using a comprehensive analysis method this is a comprehensive analyses of runoff changes and a quantitative discussion on the intrinsic relations of runoff and precipitation through decomposition and reconstruction of runoff specifically three aspects are pursued in this study 1 to clarify the spatiotemporal characteristics and differences of seasonal distribution and interannual variation of runoff 2 to reveal the complex correlations of runoff and precipitation variation on multi temporal scales 3 to quantified the impacts of precipitation on interannual variation of runoff this study is a basic but important step for water resources management in the yzb even the tibetan plateau and can provide basic supports for researches of hydrological mechanism and water resources 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yarlung zangbo river originates from the gyima yangzoin glacier in western tibetan plateau tp and flows through the whole southern tp and eventually into india called brahmaputra in india with a length of approximate 2057 km in china fig 1 it is the longest river in the tp and is also one of the highest major rivers in the world with an average elevation of over 4000 m above the sea level li et al 2013 the yarlung zangbo river basin yzb is between 82º00 97º07 e and 28º00 31º16 n with an area of 0 24 million km2 its maximum distance is about 1500 km from west to east but is only 290 km from south to north larger tributaries in the yzb include the lhasa river ls the nyang river ny the nianchu river nc and the parlung zangbo river etc fig 1 the yzb is generally divided into upper middle and lower reaches by taking the lhatse i e s10 and nuxia i e s1 hydrological stations as bounds fig 1 and table 1 the average annual runoff depth ranges from 100 mm in the upper reaches to over 620 mm in the lower reaches table 1 climatic and hydrologic conditions of the yzb are mainly dominated by geographic and topographic features of the tp and thus vary significantly with regions li et al 2013 the climate is warm and rainy in the southeast valleys with multi year average precipitation of over 1000 mm and multi year average temperature of 8 6 c while gradually becomes dry and cold from east to west the climate of the upper middle reaches is characterized by intense solar radiation low humidity and highly differences in daily temperature and distinct division of dry and wet seasons li et al 2014 mean annual precipitation varies from about 335 mm in the upper reaches to over 700 mm in the eastern region of the midstream table 1 and mostly falls in may to september sang et al 2016 meanwhile due to the influences of altitude and climatic conditions surrounding vegetation also shows significantly zonal distribution from downstream to upstream which changes from evergreen forest to deciduous scrub to arid steppe vegetation and ultimately changes to cold desert liu et al 2014 sun et al 2019 2 2 data description monthly runoff data measured at 12 hydrological stations were used to analyze runoff variability in the yzb the data were provided by the hydrology and water resource survey bureau tibet autonomous region of china all series have the same measurement years from 1961 to 2015 with no missing segments the 12 hydrological stations include 4 stations located in the mainstream of the yzb and 8 stations respectively from three main tributaries namely the ny the ls and the nc which can basically cover the whole up and mid stream regions of the yzb fig 1 and table 1 the long series of observed runoff data in the lower reaches of the yzb is usually not publicly available as a result investigations on runoff variability were mainly focused on the upper middle reaches of the yzb fig 1 precipitation data measured at 6 weather stations were used to approximately represent precipitation conditions of regions corresponding to the hydrological stations fig 1 and table 1 the precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn all precipitation series also have the same measurement years from 1961 to 2015 the six stations respectively control the main regions of the upper middle reaches as well as the three main sub basins ny ls and nc sub basins precipitation data at other weather stations was not used since the data series were not long enough or did not better correspond to other hydrological stations 2 3 methods 2 3 1 concentration ratio and concentration period for calculation of the concentration ration cr and concentration period cp it is assumed that monthly runoff is a vector with its magnitude as vector length and its located month as vector direction one year is considered as a cycle of 360 and the ith month corresponds to θ i 360 12 i 30 i i 1 2 12 the vector of monthly runoff can be expressed as 1 c r r x 2 r y 2 i 1 12 r i 2 c p arctan r x r y with 3 r x i 1 12 r i sin θ i r y i 1 12 r i cos θ i where r i is the runoff in the ith month r x and r y are the resulting vector in the direction of x and y respectively the cp is actually the angle indicated by the center of gravity of the vector which reflects the month in which maximum monthly runoff occurs in a year the cr indicates the concentrated degree of monthly runoff in a year with a value of between 0 and 1 2 3 2 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis wa is a powerful method to analyze complex variations of time series and has been widely applied in hydrology since the 1990s sang 2013 wa is a local time frequency analysis that can identify significant multi temporal fluctuation of time series through decomposing time series into time frequency domain using wavelet transform in general wavelet analysis can be classified into two types as continuous and discrete wavelet analysis the continuous wavelet transform cwt is more appropriate for revealing the characteristics of time series with multi temporal scale and non stationary the discrete wavelet transform dwt is usually used to identify and decompose different components of time series so as to aid the various time series analyses such as trend detection denoising of wavelet threshold and wavelet based hydrology simulating and forecasting sang 2013 2 3 2 1 continuous wavelet transform observed hydrological series in nature is usually discrete signals for discrete time series x n n 1 n with uniform time step of dt and length of n its continuous wavelet transform is defined as the convolution of x n with the scaled and normalized wavelet torrence and compo 1998 4 w x a b n 1 n x n ψ a b n with 5 ψ a b n d t a 1 2 ψ a b n b d t a a b r a 0 where w x a b is the continuous wavelet coefficient ψ a b n is the complex conjugate of mother wavelet ψ a b n a is temporal scale b is time translation factor and d t a 1 2 is used for normalizing wavelet to have unit energy on each scale a w x a b 2 is defined as wavelet power spectrum that represents the energy of series x n in the given scale and time domain and its variation represents energy distribution of series with time under different scales global wavelet spectrum gws can be obtained by averaging the wavelet power spectrum over time under different scales 6 g w s a 1 n 1 n w x a b 2 variation of gws can clearly describe the average energy changes with temporal scale based on which periodic characteristics of the series and its intensity can be identified generally temporal scales with peak energy values are the dominant periods significance test for time averaged wavelet spectrum i e gws is evaluated based on a background spectrum of red noise torrence and compo 1998 2 3 2 2 discrete wavelet transform following the wa theory the dwt of the above time series x n is often expressed as 7 w x j k n 1 n x n ψ j k n with 8 ψ j k n a 0 j 2 ψ a 0 j n b 0 k where a 0 and b 0 are constants integer j is decomposition level and k is time translation factor as the same b mentioned in eq 5 w x j k is the discrete wavelet coefficient under level j ψ j k n is the complex conjugate of mother wavelet ψ j k n in practice the dyadic discrete wavelet transform is commonly used by setting a 0 2 and b 0 1 mallat 1989 thus the expression is 9 ψ j k n 2 j 2 ψ 2 j n k generally maximum value m of decomposition level j is determined by eq 10 based on the length n of x n sang 2013 10 m log 2 n based on dwt the original series x n can be decomposed and reconstructed at different decomposition levels kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 11 x n j 1 m x j n x m with 12 x j n k w x j k ψ 2 j n k where x j n is the subsequence of original series x n at level j j 1 2 m which characterizes the detailed variation component in original series at level j x m is the approximate subsequence of original series at the maximum decomposition level j m which could define and describe the trend of series x n on the maximum time scale i e n almasri et al 2008 when the trend of series x n on certain smaller time scale k k n is concerned the sum of all subsequences at larger than the decomposition level of log2 k is considered as the trend identified as calculated by eq 11 magnitude of trend is determined using the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 given as eq 13 significance test for each subsequence at each decomposition level is conducted through the approach based on noise energy distribution proposed by sang et al 2013 13 β m e d i a n x j x i j i for all i j 2 3 3 dfa method the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa can explore the scaling behavior also called as long term persistence ltp of time series peng et al 1995 for a series x n with length n and given scale s it is first divided into segments of equal length s in each segment of length s the least square method is used to fit the data linearly for obtaining the local trend the y coordinate of the straight line segment is represented by x s n and the time series x n is detrended by subtracting the local trend x s n in each segment the fluctuation function f s of the detrended sequences is calculated by 14 f s 1 n n 1 n x n x s n 2 computation is repeated for all time scales to characterize the relationship between f s and scale s on a log log plot a linear relationship of log s and log f s indicates the presence of scaling behavior of which the slope is thus scaling coefficient h a scaling coefficient of 0 h 1 represents a power law scaling behavior of time series theoretically a h greater than 0 5 and less than 1 0 corresponds to long range correlated series and h 0 5 indicates an anticorrelation form while a coefficient h 0 5 corresponds to uncorrelated white noise peng et al 1995 significance of scaling coefficient h 0 5 is determined using mean value μ h and standard deviation σ h when h 0 5 which is normal distribution the μ h and σ h are functions of the sample size n as given by the following equations hamed 2008 15 μ h 0 5 2 87 n 0 9067 16 σ h 0 77654 n 0 5 0 0062 using eqs 15 and 16 a confidence interval around h 0 5 is constructed at a significant level of 0 05 to assess the significance of estimated h in this study 2 3 4 mk test and mk considering scaling behavior mk s the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 will be used to determine the changing point of trend of time series the detailed description on the mk test can be found in appendix b mk test is performed for the positive and reverse series of x n to obtain statistics z and z respectively the changing point of trend of x n can be determined based on the intersection and position of the two statistics of z and z the significant scaling behavior can greatly affect trend test hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 to consider the effects of scaling behaviors of time series the mk test considering scaling behavior mk s proposed by hamed 2008 was referred in this study the variance of s is calculated using the following equation if scaling coefficient h is found to be significant it is determined in 2 3 3 17 v a r h s i j k l 2 π sin 1 ρ j i ρ i l ρ j k ρ i k 2 2 ρ i j 2 2 ρ k l 18 ρ l 1 2 l 1 2 h 2 l 2 h l 1 2 h where var h s is variance of s when considering scaling coefficient h ρ l is autocorrelation function of time series at lag l for a given h and is independent of the time scale koutsoyiannis 2003 i j k l is indices of time series because var h s is a biased estimate a bias correction factor b is used to calculate an unbiased estimate var h s in eq 19 19 v a r h s b v a r h s where b is a function of h and n the length of time series and is given in appendix a substituting var h s for var s in mk equations to calculate the results of mk s effects of scaling behavior are evaluated through comparing the magnitude of trend eq 13 between original series and series considering scaling behavior 3 results analysis and discussion 3 1 seasonal distribution of runoff the cr and cp values as well as the ratio of runoff in flood seasons may to october to annual runoff hereafter simply ratio of flood season runoff were calculated to quantitatively characterize the seasonal distribution of runoff the monthly runoff of the mainstream s1 s5 s9 and s10 showed a multiyear average cr of 0 56 0 52 from east to west of the upper middle reaches with corresponding range of 0 45 0 66 0 32 0 69 0 33 0 70 and 0 31 0 66 during 1961 2015 which exhibited little spatial differences but significant interannual fluctuations figs 2a 1 according to cp values the maximum monthly runoff mainly occurred in july august but was gradually delayed from late july of s1 station to mid august of s10 station over space figs 2b 1 meanwhile the mean ratio of flood season runoff decreased from 76 to 71 from east to west figs 2c 1 showing consistent spatial changes with the precipitation sang et al 2016 the seasonal distribution of runoff in the ny ls and the nc sub basins showed similar spatial changes to the mainstream from east to west the three sub basins had an average cr value of 0 65 0 62 and 0 46 respectively figs 2a 2 3 4 the mean cp values were mid july late july and mid august in the three sub basins figs 2b 2 3 4 while the flood season runoff averagely accounted for 83 79 and 67 of annual runoff respectively figs 2c 2 3 4 overall runoff presented similar patterns of seasonal distribution in different years over the yzb despite of significant interannual fluctuations of runoff magnitude namely the runoff peak mainly appeared in july august with a cr of above 0 5 on average and flood season runoff could occupy over 70 of total annual runoff at different stations in space the flood season runoff appeared gradually later cp increased but its duration became shorter cr decreased from east midstream to upstream and the ratio of flood season runoff gradually decreased the spatial differences reflect a closely relationship with spatial changes of climatic conditions 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of runoff the annual and seasonal flood season and dry season runoff of each hydrological station was decomposed and reconstructed at 6 levels using dwt method the detailed and approximate subsequences were respectively obtained for runoff series of each station at each decomposition level the results of dwt and significance test were provided in appendix b according to the dwt the approximate subsequences at 6th decomposition level on 55 year scale could represent the trend of runoff changes during 1961 2015 as shown in fig 3 annual runoff of the mainstream and its main tributaries mainly showed a monotonous downward trend from 1961 to 2015 except for runoff of the ny i e s2 with an increasing trend among which only the trends of annual runoff at s10 and s4 stations were significant α 0 05 fig 3 from upstream to east midstream the average changing rate of annual runoff changed from significant decrease e g s10 to slight decrease e g s5 and even to increase s2 table 2 meanwhile the annual runoff of each station also presented similar non monotonous changes on 20 year scale i e the 4th decomposition level specifically performing a slightly downward trend before the 1985 and then an increase decrease trend during 1985 2015 fig 3 the specific turning points were further detected using the mk test showing a shift of changing trend in around 2000 at most stations fig 4 the trend of annual runoff on 20 year scale were significant α 0 05 at most stations excluding the stations in the upper ny ls and nc sub basins i e s3 s7 and s11 fig 3 the average changing rate of runoff for every 11 years was further analyzed fig 5 the runoff generally showed slight decreases in the periods of 1961 1982 and then became increased in the 1983 2004 especially in 1990 s obvious decreasing trends were then presented at most stations in the period of 2005 2015 it indicated more dramatic changes of runoff after 1990 s by contrast runoff in ny sub basin s2 and s3 changes relatively slightly compared to other stations especially in 2005 2015 when large decreases were showed in other stations fig 5 implying different driving factors of runoff changes in the ny sub basin from other regions comparing the changes of runoff in flood season may october and dry season november next april flood season runoff changes slightly smaller than that of annual runoff in the mainstream where dry season runoff changes obviously fig 5 in the sub basins ny ls and nc flood season runoff generally changed at a rate slightly lager than that of annual runoff while dry season changed very slightly or reversely such as s2 and s12 fig 5 it implies that the changes of annual runoff are mainly dominated by flood season runoff while dry season runoff has weak impacts on annual runoff fig 6 presents the gws of runoff series during 1961 2015 annual runoff of the mainstream s1 s5 s9 s10 and the ny and nc sub basins showed energy peak in about 3 year and 12 year periods which both passed the significance test fig 6 annual runoff in the ls sub basin e g s6 s8 mainly showed energy peaks in 3 year 12 year and 20 year periods fig 6 flood season runoff exhibited the same gws changes as annual runoff while gwss of dry season runoff mainly showed energy peaks in around 12 year at most stations fig 6 the periodicity of runoff is thus considered to be mainly dominated by flood season runoff and had periodic variations of 3 years and 12 years nevertheless it could be noted that the gws peak of dry season runoff were different from that of flood season runoff in the ny s2 upper ls s8 and upper nc s11 fig 6 which may be related to the greater influences of glacier and snow melt on runoff in these regions qiu et al 2014 chen et al 2017 jin et al 2019 3 3 scaling behavior of runoff and its effects scaling behavior is an aggregated phenomenon at large time scales koutsoyiannis 2002 reflecting long range variation characteristics of time series the scaling behavior of annual runoff was thus preliminarily discussed using the dfa method as shown in table 2 the scaling coefficient h of annual runoff at 12 stations were all significantly greater than 0 5 with a minimum of 0 638 at s10 station and a maximum of 0 943 at s7 station indicating that annual runoff had a long range positive correlation within 20 years namely a consistent changing trend moreover scaling behavior can reflect the different mechanism induced by surrounding environment on large scales koscielny bunde et al 2006 annual runoff had scaling coefficient h of mostly near 0 85 in the west and center midstream located in the western side of mira mountain where there is similar hydrological and climatic environment such as s5 and s9 of the mainstream s6 s8 of the ls sub basin and s11 s12 of the nc sub basin by contrast the h values of annual runoff were smaller than 0 8 in the ny sub basin s2 and s3 and the upper stream s10 table 2 the ny sub basin located in the east of the mira mountain is mainly influenced by the strong indian summer monsoon with warm moist airflow while the upstream region is dominated more by westerlies yao et al 2012 li et al 2019 which are both greatly different from the climate in the central yzb hence the differences between these two climatic conditions were also reflected in their different scaling behaviors the trend of annual runoff may be overestimated resulting from the existence of significant scaling behavior hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 the mk s test was thus applied to annual runoff to evaluate the effects of scaling behavior as shown in table 2 the magnitude of trend was recalculated for each annual runoff series after considering the fluctuations caused by scaling behaviors the magnitude of trend of annual runoff here referring to absolute value was changed by 2 5 87 5 of which about 6 12 and 9 12 stations showed over 50 and 40 reductions respectively table 2 only the runoff of s2 station originally showing increasing trend had an increase of 2 5 the above indicated that the scaling behavior caused a downward trend and had effects on detected trend generally the larger changes of trend slope 50 corresponded to larger scaling coefficient h 0 8 while h less than 0 8 had less effects on trend furthermore a reconstructed runoff series with a length of 400 years for the ls river i e s6 was used here to further verify the variations of runoff on large temporal scales and its scaling behavior the runoff series was reconstructed from tree rings chen et al 2019 the analyses of reconstructed runoff series indicated that the downward trend during 1961 2015 could be regarded as a part of the fluctuations on 100 year scale as shown in figs 7a 7b meanwhile the scaling coefficient h was larger than 0 5 within 50 years i e log s 1 7 indicating a monotonous trend of runoff could maintain within 50 years fig 7c this also demonstrates that above trend of runoff on 55 year scale may be related to the scaling behavior 3 4 correlation between runoff and precipitation correlations between runoff and precipitation at 6 stations were analyzed in detail for seasonal and interannual variations the seasonal variations of runoff were consistent with precipitation at each station but overall behind precipitation by one month fig 8 as shown in table 3 the months when runoff began to increase significantly had maximum increase and decrease rate and reached to peak were all one month behind that of precipitation at most stations however in the ls s6 and ny sub basins s2 the increase rate of monthly runoff reached to maximum in june and may respectively which was one month earlier than that of other stations in the same region but was in accordance with corresponding precipitation table 3 moreover it was interesting that the maximal increase rate of monthly runoff averaged 12 5 in may in the ny sub basin which was significantly higher than that of precipitation in this month 7 7 on the contrary the maximal increase rates of monthly runoff at other stations were all lower than that of precipitation table 3 it closely well corresponds with the largest snowmelt in may in the ny sub basin jin et al 2019 implying that the runoff is greatly influenced by glacier and snow melt etc besides of precipitation in the ny sub basin the interannual variations of runoff and precipitation series were compared as shown in fig 9 from the cumulative departure curves cdc of runoff and precipitation during 1961 2015 fig 9 the cdcs of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons illustrated basically similar changes with correlation coefficients of mostly above 0 70 in particular both of the two cdcs showed the same turning points at all stations fig 9 in contrast changes of dry season runoff showed little similarity with corresponding precipitation but were similar to flood season runoff except for the runoff of s2 station fig 9 the variations of runoff coefficients rc runoff precipitation were also showed in table 4 the rc decreased in the east midstream s1 and s2 and ls sub basin s6 during 55 years while increased in the west s12 and center midstream s5 and upper stream s10 of which the trend was significant at s2 and s6 stations table 4 the decreases of rc at s1 and s6 stations mainly resulted from the decreases of runoff and increases of precipitation or slightly changes by contrast the decrease of rc at s2 station was mainly due to less increase rate of runoff than that of precipitation the increases of rc at stations of s5 s10 and s12 were mainly induced by great decreases of precipitation table 4 looking at changes in different periods the rc of s2 s5 and s12 stations changed consistently in every 11 years overall table 4 and were thus approximately monotonous the rc of s1 s6 and s10 stations changed non monotonously which presented contrary trend during 1983 2004 to trend on 55 year scale table 4 overall the rc changed in different periods were highly related to different changes of runoff and precipitation and were indicated in detail in table 4 the correlations between runoff and precipitation were further analyzed on different temporal scales based on the decomposed subsequences of runoff and precipitation from dwt the subsequences were at a total of 6 decomposition levels d1 d6 on 3 year scale d1 the fluctuations of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons were well correlated at each station with a correlation coefficient range of 0 77 0 84 fig 10a on 12 year d3 and over 30 year scales d5 d6 the correlation coefficient of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons reached to 0 8 above at most stations fig 10a whereas the correlations of runoff and precipitation in flood seasons were overall weak at the 2th and 4th decomposition levels d2 and d4 for all stations fig 10a by contrast variations of dry season runoff were weakly related to corresponding precipitation on different temporal scales over space fig 10b meanwhile comparisons of runoff variations in flood and dry seasons illustrated that the variations of runoff in flood and dry seasons were quite different at d1 and d2 levels but were similar on scales of 12 year d3 and over 30 year d5 d6 fig 10c furthermore it could be found that both flood and dry season runoff showed similar variations on 12 year d3 and over 30 year d5 scales among different stations over space fig 10d e which was quite different from that of precipitation fig 10f it implies that the interannual variations of runoff are directly driven by flood season precipitation on 3 year scale in the upper middle reaches however spatially consistent changes of runoff in both flood and dry seasons on 12 year and larger scales may result from the influences of other large scale factors or nonlinear processes koutsoyiannis 2006 prokoph et al 2012 fu et al 2012 3 5 contribution of precipitation to runoff variation since the variations of annual runoff were mainly related to flood season precipitation thus flood season precipitation series was employed to fit the annual runoff for quantifying the impacts of precipitation on annual runoff variations the following runoff and precipitation series all refer to annual runoff and flood season precipitation respectively precipitation subsequences of each station at d1 d6 levels were used to reconstruct the runoff series for each station comparisons between fitted and original runoff are shown in fig 11 the yellow and blue points in fig 11 respectively represent the goodness of fit with and without the trend term of precipitation between which the difference is the trend of fitted runoff series the trend of fitted runoff as compared with the actual trend of runoff was thus considered as the explained proportion of runoff trend by precipitation the r2 of fitted runoff to original runoff was 0 56 0 80 among different stations when excluding the trend of precipitation series while the r2 was increased to 0 59 0 84 when including the trend of precipitation series fig 11 which indicates a positive contribution of trend of precipitation to actual runoff variation concretely in the middle reaches of the yzb including s1 s5 s2 s6 and s12 the r2 of fitted runoff to original runoff was 0 73 0 84 which means the fitted runoff can well explain 73 84 of actual runoff variations at these stations fig 11 however the r2 of fitted runoff to original runoff was 0 59 in the upper stream i e s10 fig 11 namely that the fitted runoff only explained about 59 of the actual runoff variation which was relatively lower than that in the midstream this may be related to two reasons the first is that the hydro climatic conditions are greatly different from that of the middle reaches and thus result in different evolution rules of the upstream runoff to some extent the second is that the upstream yzb is a wide area covering several longitudes where the dominant climate varies spatially and thus the precipitation only at s10 station cannot well represent the precipitation variations of the entire upstream yzb as shown table 5 there was a similar proportion about 10 7 14 9 of the trend of runoff changes to be explained by precipitation changes in the central and western regions of the midstream including the mainstream s1 and s5 the ls sub basin s6 and the nc sub basin s12 table 5 the smaller explained proportion implies less influence of precipitation on the trend of runoff changes in contrast precipitation could explain about 53 7 and 59 4 of the trend of runoff changes at s10 and s2 stations respectively table 5 the results are also consistent with the results of scaling behavior and its effect analyses namely the insignificant downward trend of annual runoff in 1961 2015 may be mainly due to its own scaling behaviors in the central and western midstream while precipitation changes are a major driving factor of runoff tendency in the upper reaches s10 and the ny river s2 4 conclusions in this study the characteristics of runoff variation and response to precipitation on multi spatial and temporal scales were identified and analyzed in the yarlung zangbo river basin yzb of the southern tibetan plateau by using a comprehensive approach based on runoff and precipitation series of 55 years 1961 2015 from 12 hydrological stations four primary findings are as follows 1 the seasonal distribution of runoff varies as the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation but generally lags behind precipitation changes by about one month in time the flood season is delayed and becomes shorter and the ratio of flood season runoff to annual runoff decreases from downstream to upstream the contribution of glacier and snow melt to runoff was reflected in the nyang river ny sub basin and lhasa river ls sub basin in may june 2 annual runoff mainly showed a monotonous downward trend in the upper middle reaches from 1961 to 2015 except for runoff of the ny showing an upward trend similar significant non monotonous changes were also shown in most annual runoff series over space specifically performing a slight decrease trend before 1985 and then an increase decrease trend with a turning point around 2000 periodic variations of annual runoff were significant on an approximate 3 year and 12 year scales 3 runoff variation on 3 year scale was mainly affected by precipitation in flood seasons which was obviously different from the dry season runoff all annual runoff series had scaling coefficients h significantly greater than 0 5 which had effects on trend test of runoff 4 precipitation in flood seasons was estimated to explain about 10 7 14 9 of the trend of runoff in the midstream the explained proportion of runoff tendency by precipitation changes was comparatively higher in the upper reaches and the ny sub basin with estimated values of 53 7 and 59 4 respectively indicating precipitation is the major driving factor of runoff changes in these two regions the study can provide a new and important understanding for runoff

7923,study region the sanjiang plain located at the confluence of heilong songhua and wusuli rivers northeast china study focus due to the low and flat terrain wetlands and swamps were widely distributed in plain areas in history after decades of reclamation farmland has replaced wetland as the dominant landscape the competition of water resources between wetland ecological health and food security is very fierce which is mainly reflected in the serious overexploitation of groundwater this study used a new coupled surface water groundwater model with an innovative function of irrigation and drainage simulation to research the changes of groundwater in the sanjiang plain under different water resource allocation schemes and paddy development scale in the future which may provide a scientific basis for the planning of water resource allocation projects related to the restoration of groundwater and wetlands in this region new hydrological insights for the region we established four prediction models for different water resource allocation schemes and paddy areas by replacing the water supply data and planting structure of the baseline model in the sanjiang plain by comparing the groundwater balance and level of various schemes simulated by prediction models it was found that the complete water diversion scheme covering the plain areas would greatly reduce groundwater exploitation increase groundwater recharge and turn groundwater storage from deficit to surplus which would increase by 853 million m3 a it would gradually compensate for the historical debts due to groundwater overexploitation while achieving a balance between groundwater recharge and discharge thus the groundwater depth in most part of the plain areas would be restored to less than 5 m however the scheme also had a defect that is it may cause soil secondary salinization in shallow groundwater areas therefore the scheme needs to be further optimized to make full use of the low cost groundwater graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resource allocation groundwater response coupled surface water groundwater model paddy irrigation simulation sanjiang plain 1 introduction the sanjiang plain is one of the main grain producing areas in china in recent years the paddy area has shown an obvious expansion trend in the cultivated land cao et al 2021 which increased the regional water consumption and directly affected the water balance of the region sun et al 2021a despite the abundant passing runoff of the heilong songhua and wusuli rivers total 240 billion m3 a approximately the lagging surface water allocation project hinders the full utilization of this runoff which leads to over reliance on groundwater for paddy irrigation in the hinterland of the plain areas thus forming some large groundwater drawdown zones liu et al 2021 at the same time it also reduces the conservation effect of groundwater on wetlands causing the wetland area to shrink further zhou et al 2009 zou et al 2018 li et al 2021 according to the needs of national food security and ecological environment protection the sanjiang plain has to solve the problem of groundwater overexploitation while ensuring stable paddy production to curb the continued degradation of the wetland ecosystem therefore accelerating the construction of water diversion projects improving the utilization of passing runoff and decreasing the exploitation of groundwater are important measures to achieve food security and ecological restoration simultaneously water resource allocation is an important method for solving the time space mismatch between water supply and demand lin et al 2020 li et al 2020 relevant researches and applications of water resource allocation are extremely high wang et al 2008 zhuang 2016 bijl et al 2018 yu et al 2018 but the evaluation of the effect on groundwater of water resource allocation is still rare because the water resource allocation scheme is often the optimal scheme obtained by optimization or simulation methods wang and huang 2012 yu and lu 2018 martinsen et al 2019 cai et al 2021 few scholars have evaluated its implementation effect conversely however as many water resource allocation projects are major projects that require a large amount of national investment fu et al 2010 chen et al 2013 yu et al 2018 carefully evaluating the implementation effects of each allocation scheme and selecting the most appropriate scheme is of great significance for improving the effectiveness of national investment and maximizing project benefits after the implementation of different water resource allocation schemes whether the problem of regional groundwater overexploitation can be effectively solved and the river runoff depletion can be alleviated is extremely important for the necessity and rationality of the implementation of regional water resource allocation measures but it is difficult to realize quantitative evaluation by general means hydrological models are often used to study the impact of future climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle jiang et al 2007 d agostino et al 2010 li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 omer et al 2020 as a complex human activity that has an important impact on hydrological cycle and groundwater the implementation effect of water resource allocation can also be evaluated using hydrological models currently distributed hydrological models are mostly used which consider many hydrological influencing factors liang et al 1994 beven 1997 arnold et al 1998 jaber and shukla 2012 especially the distributed hydrological model with groundwater numerical simulation function that can more finely simulate the impact of various human activities on groundwater maxwell miller 2005 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2017 this study used the coupled surface water groundwater model as a tool to simulate the changes of recharge and discharge fluxes and groundwater level and analyze the effect on groundwater under different water resource allocation patterns two important functions of the model were introduced for the first time namely the coupled mechanism of surface water and groundwater simulation and the automatic recognition of paddy irrigation and drainage which were necessary to carry out this study 2 methods first we described the methodology applied to groundwater response evaluation of water resource allocation in which the hydrological model was a very important tool in the model the couped mechanism of surface water and groundwater and the simulation principle of paddy irrigation and drainage directly supported our study which were introduced here for the first time 2 1 evaluation methodology framework the impact of water resource development utilization and regulation on the regional hydrological cycle can be evaluated using hydrological models but a simple one may be difficult to clarify the impact on groundwater recharge discharge storage and level therefore our study used the object oriented modularized model for basin scale water cycle simulation modcycle to establish the coupled surface water groundwater model in the sanjiang plain from 2000 to 2014 baseline model based on the baseline model by taking the groundwater level at the end of 2014 as the initial values of the model and replacing water use data and planting structure we established 4 prediction models for different water resource allocation schemes and paddy areas the prediction models still adopted meteorological data from 2000 to 2014 to ensure that they had the same climatic conditions as the baseline model the groundwater fluxes and level simulated by the model under different schemes were compared and the impact of water resource allocation on groundwater was evaluated fig 1 the hydrological model of the sanjiang plain was first built in 2015 to support the preliminary planning and demonstration of the water diversion projects in this region at that time due to the support of relevant local departments the data before 2014 was relatively rich and no further data collection has been carried out since then in addition it is worth noting that from 2000 to 2014 the paddy area in the sanjiang plain increased sharply and the continuous and drastic change of land use had a great impact on the hydrological cycle sun et al 2021b it was also during this period that a large area of groundwater drawdown zones appeared therefore the hydrological cycle of this period 2000 2014 is very representative which can provide a baseline reference for the evaluation of water resource allocation schemes and has high research value 2 2 coupled mechanism of surface water and groundwater simulation the initial version of modcycle was a semi distributed hydrological model based on the spatial delineation of subwatersheds and hydrological response units hrus to improve the adaptability of the model in groundwater simulation of plain areas the groundwater flow numerical model based on the finite difference method was included so that the model had the ability to simulate groundwater level and flow in plain areas among the similar coupled models that have been reported menking et al 2003 galbiati et al 2006 kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 most of them adopt the spatial association and information interaction mechanism between hrus and grid cells gcs however to raise the simulation efficiency the building of a semi distributed hydrological model often deletes the hrus with small area proportion non dominant hrus and allocates them to other hrus dominant hrus because of the huge number of initial hrus or full hrus this merging will lead to the loss of spatial location attributes of hrus which conflicts with the above coupled method because the gcs need to be associated with spatially deterministic hrus therefore these coupled models have to use the full hrus to overlay with gcs and some models even take the pixels of the hru map as gcs of groundwater model kim et al 2008 which limit the efficiency of these models in the hydrological cycle simulation of large scale regions such as the sanjiang plain in view of the weakness of the above hru gc spatial association modcycle created a new spatial association mode between subwatersheds and gcs which can reduce a lot of workloads for processing of hru related data under the new mode hru can be merged at will which further expanded the advantages of the coupled model used in large scale regions fig 2 illustrates the spatial association between subwatersheds and gcs the spatial association between subwatersheds and gcs can be expressed as follows 1 a fr i j a i j a i where a fr i j is the area fraction of gc j in subwatershed i a i j is the overlapping area between subwatershed i and gc j l2 a i is the area of subwatershed i l2 when there is overlapping area between the subwatershed and gc a fr i j 0 on the contrary a fr i j 0 the semi distributed hydrological model and the groundwater numerical model realize joint simulation by transmitting necessary data to each other the source and sink data necessary for the groundwater numerical simulation such as precipitation and irrigation leakage recharge surface water seepage recharge groundwater exploitation base flow phreatic evaporation etc can be obtained from the hydrological simulation eq 2 the groundwater level simulated by the groundwater numerical model is transmitted to the hydrological model to assist the simulation of relevant hydrological processes including various sources and sinks required for the above groundwater simulation eq 3 2 q c e l j i 1 i r s u b i d s u b i a f r i j 3 h s u b i j 1 j h c e l j a f r i j where q cel j is the net flux of gc j the difference between recharge and discharge which is a positive value indicating that the gc is net recharge and a negative value indicating net discharge l3 t r sub i is the recharge of subwatershed i to the aquifer l3 t including precipitation and irrigation leakage surface water seepage etc d sub i is the groundwater discharge of subwatershed i from the aquifer l3 t including exploitation base flow phreatic evaporation etc h sub i is the groundwater level of subwatershed i l h cel j is the groundwater level of gc j l a fr i j is the area fraction of gc j in subwatershed i i and j are the total number of subwatersheds and gcs respectively the meaning of the eq 2 indicates that the sources and sinks of all subwatersheds overlapping with gc j are divided according to the area fraction of spatial association and summarized to form the net flux of gc j the meaning of the eq 3 is that the groundwater level of all gcs overlapping with subwatershed i is weighted and averaged according to the area fraction of spatial association to form the average groundwater level of subwatershed i 2 3 irrigation and drainage simulation for paddy fields the impact of paddy irrigation on the hydrological cycle in the sanjiang plain is very significant sun et al 2021b so it is necessary to accurately determine its water withdraw and irrigation processes in most hydrological models irrigation water quantity is input data which need to be investigated or predicted in advance rather than the simulated output data however the paddy irrigation processes are affected by precipitation evaporation transpiration infiltration water sources management and other factors if these processes are separated from the hydrological cycle and their quantities are calculated separately the accuracy is often insufficient especially in regions with large area and scattered distribution of paddy fields the spatial differences of various factors further increase the difficulty of irrigation evaluation such data used in hydrological model will affect the simulation accuracy therefore modcycle developed the automatic irrigation and drainage simulation function which can simulate the irrigation and drainage process of paddy water supply of water sources in different regions irrigation leakage recharge of groundwater etc in a word the model provides a powerful tool for the simulation of groundwater under different water resource allocation schemes and paddy areas fig 3 shows the flowchart of paddy irrigation and drainage in the model the model simulates the surface ponding depth of the paddy fields by considering precipitation evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff the simulated depth is compared with preset depth thresholds for paddy fields considering the suitable ponding depth range of different growth stages of rice by which the irrigation and drainage date is determined and the water quantity of irrigation for the paddy fields is calculated the penman monteith method is used to calculate the potential daily evapotranspiration rate of paddy fields the actual daily evapotranspiration of paddy fields is then calculated according to the constraints of conditions such as canopy interception surface ponding soil water content and rice growth status neitsch et al 2011 the green ampt equation is used to calculate the infiltration and runoff of paddy fields green and ampt 1911 which is modified considering ponding water depth in our study eq 4 4 i δ t i δ t s p n d δ t 1 where i δ t is the modified amount of precipitation and irrigation at the time step δ t mm i δ t is the total amount of precipitation and irrigation at the time step δ t mm s p n d δ t 1 is the ponding water depth at the end of the time step δ t 1 mm then the ponding water depth can be calculated by eq 5 5 s p n d δ t i δ t f inf δ t i δ t f inf δ t s p n d t h r s p n d t h r i δ t f inf δ t s p n d t h r where s p n d δ t is the ponding water depth at the end of the time step δ t mm f inf δ t is the infiltration amount modified according to i δ t at the time step δ t mm s p n d t h r is the maximum depth threshold of ponding water on the surface of paddy fields set by users mm thus runoff or drainage will appear when the ponding water depth exceeds the maximum depth threshold the model allows users to set different thresholds of appropriate ponding water depth according to the stages of rice growth in agricultural practice farmers often implement different ponding water depths at different growth stages to maximize production save irrigation water and cost and make full use of rainwater based on practical experience upper and lower thresholds of the ponding water depth can be input at each stage of rice growth if the ponding water depth calculated is less than the lower threshold irrigation will be carried out until the water depth reaches the upper threshold if the water depth is above the upper threshold drainage is carried out until the water depth falls to the upper threshold fig 3 the model can output the date and daily amount of paddy field irrigation and the annual irrigation amount through the above simulation which can be used for model calibration by compared with the measured irrigation amount from paddy irrigation experimental stations sun et al 2021b by adjusting the relevant parameters the accuracy of paddy field irrigation and drainage simulations can be improved the model draws water from different water sources to meet the daily water demand of paddy irrigation in different subregions users need to first determine the water sources corresponding to different subregions and then evaluate the water supply volume of each water source according to the investigation and statistics or predict the available water supply volume of each water source according to the relevant water planning when paddy fields in a subregion need irrigation the daily water demand is divided according to the proportion of water supply or available water supply volume of each corresponding water source and then the divided water volumes are extracted from water sources which finally enter paddy fields after evaporation and leakage losses are deducted along the way of water delivery and increase the ponding water depth to the threshold range fig 3 3 materials 3 1 study area the sanjiang plain is located in the eastern part of heilongjiang province the area where the heilong songhua and wusuli rivers meet it is bordered by the three major rivers xingkai lake and drainage divides with an area of approximately 105 700 km2 this region is composed of several small watersheds with similar climate hydrology topography geological conditions and agricultural patterns but is very different from other surrounding areas so it is often separated from heilongjiang province to carry out hydrological research water resources management and water engineering construction as a whole fig 4 the plain areas are the main social and economic activity region in the sanjiang plain and they are also the areas that cause the most serious disturbance to groundwater in the early period swamps and wetlands were widespread in the plains but after large scale reclamation they were gradually replaced by farmland in the 1980 s the use of paddies to control waterlogging was implemented and paddy area rose and became a major water consumer with the increase in paddy areas the problems due to backward surface water projects and insufficient irrigation facilities became prominent and groundwater became the main source of irrigation since 2000 the increase in paddy areas has accelerated from 9200 to 24 200 km2 in 2013 which has caused groundwater drawdown zones to expand year by year although the paddy area has stabilized since 2014 its impact on groundwater continues to increase sun et al 2021b to repair the overexploitation of groundwater curb the shrinking trend of wetlands increase the utilization rate of passing runoff improve paddy irrigation conditions and ensure grain production safety the sanjiang plain has conducted the planning and construction of many water resource allocation projects a number of which have already made important progress but it is still difficult to quantitatively evaluate the repair effects of various projects on the overexploitation of groundwater this is the focus of the present study 3 2 data the building of baseline model is the basis of this study which needs to collect and process sufficient basic spatial data and driving data of hydrological cycle due to the limited space this section briefly introduced the main basic spatial data of the model and the water resource allocation scheme data of prediction models 3 2 1 main basic spatial data the model first used digital elevation model dem and actual river network to delineate subwatersheds and generate main channels then to finely simulate the dynamics of groundwater in the plain areas the subwatersheds in the sanjiang plain were divided into plain and hilly subwatersheds in which the groundwater in plain subwatersheds was numerically simulated subwatersheds crossing hilly and plain areas were forcibly cut by the established mountain plain boundary and the corresponding main channels were also disconnected at the boundary so as to maintain the one to one correspondence between subwatersheds and main channels the whole region was delineated into 1705 subwatersheds with an average area of about 62 km2 fig 5a the model only carried out groundwater numerical simulation in the sanjiang low plain and the xingkai lake plain where aquifer consists of quaternary loose sediments with grain size between sand and gravel and no aquifuge the thickness of the quaternary aquifer is 50 300 m covered with 5 20 m clay layer in the eastern part of the sanjiang low plain which makes the groundwater under the clay layer confined in view of the above characteristics the quaternary aquifer was defined as a shallow aquifer and set as convertible aquifer in the model because groundwater heads may alternate between confined and unconfined conditions the model set a deep aquifer below the quaternary stratum which was virtual and did not participate in the hydrological cycle the shallow and deep aquifers were horizontally divided into 206 rows and 206 columns at an interval of 2 km there were 42 436 gcs in a single aquifer including 13 076 effective ones within the plain areas fig 5b compared with the pure groundwater numerical model one of the advantages of the coupled surface water and groundwater model is that the modeling process saves the work dealing with sources and sinks and boundary conditions artificially sources and sinks can be calculated by the hydrological model which can be calibrated and conform to the water balance so they are more accurate in the groundwater modeling of the sanjiang plain we only processed the aquifer and grid cell data necessary for the numerical model and did not set the sources and sinks and boundary conditions separately in the groundwater numerical simulation area the upstream boundaries of the aquifer are piedmont and the downstream boundaries are the heilong and wusuli rivers because the hydrological model and groundwater numerical model are coupled together the model did not simulate the lateral recharge from the piedmont to the aquifer but simulated the mountain runoff entering the plain and then leaking to recharge the aquifer therefore the upstream boundaries of the aquifer were set as no flow boundaries the model included the heilong and wusuli rivers into the river network system of the hydrological model which can simulate the interaction between the runoff of the two rivers and groundwater these rivers consequently were not set as head boundaries and the lateral flow of the downstream boundaries is 0 if the two rivers were not included in the river network system they can be set as head boundaries so that the lateral flow will not be 0 however doing so would increase the workload of river network system there would be many more small watersheds and outlets and boundary condition processing the model needed other spatial data such as land use soil and meteorological station distribution hydrogeological parameters initial conditions and other data for groundwater numerical simulation meteorological driven data such as precipitation air temperature wind speed radiation and air humidity human driven data such as agricultural irrigation water use reservoir control parameters water diversion groundwater exploitation and so on the groundwater numerical simulation did not need the source and sink data but the spatial association data of subwatersheds and gcs must be added 3 2 2 water resource allocation scheme data according to the relevant plan of the sanjiang plain by 2035 the paddy area was estimated to increase by an additional 6267 km2 and the demand for water resources would further increase if there was no corresponding water resource allocation project to solve the water supply problem it would further aggravate the situation of groundwater overexploitation and may lead to accelerated deterioration of the ecological environment to this end in the sanjiang plain two water diversion projects from major rivers was planned to supply water to 14 irrigation areas along the border river 14ia project and 29 on both sides of the songhua river 29ia project respectively which can cover most of the arable land in the sanjiang low plain and xingkai lake plain fig 6 based on the development prospects of paddy and the implementation progress of water diversion project planning we formed four schemes and established corresponding prediction models table 1 the current model was input the land use data including 23 773 km2 of paddy fields and the amount of surface water and groundwater supply in 2014 in 2035 the paddy area in the no water diversion model would be expanded to 30 040 km2 in proportion based on the current scheme however the two water diversion projects had not been completed and water would still be supplied according to the 2014 water resource allocation scheme in 2035 the partial water diversion scheme only allowed the 14ia project to supply water to the 14 irrigation areas the complete water diversion scheme in 2035 indicated that the two water diversion projects had reached the designed water supply capacity and supplied water to all 43 irrigation areas it should be noted that the water supply volume of various water sources in table 1 is the planned water supply target under each scheme and the corresponding model would simulate drawing water daily to paddy fields according to the water supply target proportion of water sources when the water supply from the water diversion projects and local surface water projects was shortage water would be pumped from the underground the final water amount pumped from underground may be greater than the groundwater supply target or even an exploitable amount the paddy area in the planning year was predicted by administrative region and irrigation area collectively referred to as subregion according to the plan the increased area of paddy fields would be transformed from dry land there was a set of hru data containing subwatershed number and subregion number in the input data of the current model including the paddy filed and dry land area in the current year this set of hru data was used to allocate the predicted paddy area to each subwatershed to form a new set of hru data for the prediction models 4 results the process of model calibration and verification can be found in the relevant literature sun et al 2021b so only part results were shown here the groundwater of the plain areas has the most significant response to the development utilization and allocation of water resources in the sanjiang plain the water use is little and the groundwater storage is stable relatively in the hill and valley plain areas therefore this study only analyzed the groundwater changes in the two large plains sanjiang low plain and xingkai lake plain 4 1 model calibration and verification according to the collected data the data from 2000 to 2008 was used for parameter calibration and that from 2009 to 2014 for model verification the calibration process adopted manual parameter adjustment the effect was evaluated by nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and determination coefficient r2 we collected long series of measured data of flow and groundwater level from 6 representative hydrological stations in the study area and 21 representative observation wells in the plain areas shown in fig 4 to fit the surface runoff and groundwater level simulated by the model respectively here shows nse and r2 by model calibration and verification and the key parameters used for hydrologic cycle and groundwater simulations at representative observation wells and hydrological stations tables 2 and 3 the fit effects of observed and simulated time series of flow and groundwater table at hydrological station s2 and observation well g20 are shown in fig 7 the simulated irrigation amount of paddy fields by the irrigation and drainage function of the model was also fitted with the measured irrigation amount from the experimental irrigation stations sun et al 2021b 4 2 main flux response of groundwater at present groundwater in the plain areas is the main water source for agricultural irrigation and paddy irrigation has the greatest impact on groundwater although the paddy area in the sanjiang plain has stabilized since 2014 as one of the main producing areas of high quality japonica rice there is still the possibility of further expansion for this reason increasing the utilization of passing runoff is an important way to meet the needs of paddy irrigation and alleviate the problem of groundwater overexploitation the impact of different paddy areas and water resource allocation patterns on groundwater is first reflected by the changes in groundwater exploitation fig 8a by 2035 the paddy area in the 43 irrigated areas will increase to 30 040 km2 if the current water resource allocation pattern is maintained the amount of groundwater exploitation will increase significantly with an average annual exploitation of 14 46 billion m3 table 4 even if partial water diversion is achieved i e the allocation of water resources in 14 irrigation areas has been completed the amount of groundwater exploitation will only have returned to the current level which will not help further repair groundwater overexploitation if the complete water resource allocation in all irrigation areas is achieved scheme d the amount of groundwater exploitation will be further reduced dropping to 8 20 billion m3 a table 4 which is lower than that of the current scheme groundwater overexploitation control will thus have a positive effect as a major water user in the sanjiang plain the expansion of paddy areas has increased water consumption and groundwater exploitation and also enhanced groundwater recharge fig 8b the paddy area under the current scheme scheme a is 23 773 km2 and the average annual groundwater recharge is 11 63 billion m3 in 2035 the paddy area will reach 30 040 km2 which will greatly increase groundwater recharge under various water resource allocation patterns and the rate of increase is roughly the same table 4 indicating that the main factor affecting groundwater recharge is the paddy area for a certain paddy area no matter how the water resource allocation pattern changes it is necessary to ensure the paddy irrigation demand otherwise it will lead to a reduction in rice yield therefore the amount of water recharged to the groundwater due to the leakage of paddy irrigation is basically the same baseflow is very sensitive to water resource allocation and it is closely related to the inter annual variation in precipitation fig 8c shows that under schemes a and b there is a difference in paddy area of 6267 km2 which has a great impact on the discharge and recharge of groundwater but has little impact on its baseflow the average baseflow is relatively similar under the two allocation schemes of partial and complete water diversion the baseflow increases significantly and the more surface water is introduced from major rivers the greater the baseflow the figure also shows that the baseflow under various schemes shows an increasing trend over time which should be related to the increasing trend of precipitation during the simulation period in the model except for meteorological data that change year by year other hydrological cycle driving data are fixed and do not change with time changes in hydrological processes within the region such as groundwater exploitation local surface water use and adjustment of agricultural planting structures have little impact on the baseflow of the plain areas only when the area is supplemented with water from the outside will a large change occur in the baseflow such as precipitation water diversion and the introduction of passing runoff phreatic evaporation is a small flux in groundwater discharge and its changes are also related to different water resource allocation schemes but have a certain correlation with paddy area as shown in fig 8d the inter annual changes and the differences due to different schemes in phreatic evaporation are similar to the change trends and differences in baseflow however compared to baseflow there are greater differences between schemes a and b in phreatic evaporation which indicate that local water resource development and utilization activities have a great impact on phreatic evaporation and the water resource allocation will further expand this impact 4 3 water balance response of groundwater from the perspective of water balance groundwater has been over exploited during 2000 2014 and its storage has been reduced by an average of 0 31 billion m3 per year table 4 if the paddy area and water resource allocation pattern of 2014 are still maintained scheme a then the annual average groundwater exploitation will further increase and storage will continue to decrease with an average annual deficit of 1 16 billion m3 which is much larger than the baseline 2000 2014 average level the paddy area increased annually from 2000 to 2014 the average annual paddy area in this period is smaller than the 2014 paddy area in scheme a and the dependence on groundwater in the early stage is relatively small although the intensity of groundwater exploitation increased in the later period it has not yet posed a particularly serious threat to groundwater as in scheme a by 2035 the paddy area will increase if the two water diversion projects in the plain areas are not completed the water resource allocation pattern is not improved scheme b and the paddy irrigation is still dominated by groundwater then the average annual reduction in groundwater storage will reach 2 54 billion m3 which is more than twice the current scheme and will have an unprecedented impact on water balance table 4 at this time if the partial water diversion in the plain areas can be realized that is the 14ia project currently under implementation reaches the designed water supply capacity scheme c then the severe overexploitation of groundwater in scheme b will be relieved to a large extent and the average annual reduction of groundwater storage will be reduced to 0 52 billion m3 if complete water diversion scheme can be achieved in the plain areas scheme d it will not only reduce groundwater exploitation but also increase groundwater recharge groundwater storage will turn from a deficit to surplus increasing by 0 85 billion m3 each year it can reverse the continuous overexploitation of groundwater and make up for the groundwater deficit accumulated in the plain before the completion of the water diversion projects from the perspective of the cumulative change of groundwater storage based on the storage at the beginning of the simulation period early 2000 there were completely different change trends in the cumulative storage change among the four schemes fig 9 the groundwater storage under the scheme a will be reduced by 17 48 billion m3 at the end of the simulation period if the current water allocation pattern is not improved by 2035 the large scale expansion of paddy will result in a cumulative decrease of 38 06 billion m3 in groundwater storage leading to serious overexploitation in the plain areas scheme b the 14ia project that reach the designed water supply capacity will effectively reduce groundwater overexploitation at the end of the simulation period the groundwater storage deficit will be 7 74 billion m3 the degree of overexploitation is significantly alleviated compared with that of the current plan but overall it is still in a state of overexploitation scheme c if the two water diversion projects can supply water to 43 irrigation areas groundwater storage will recover year by year and increase cumulatively by 12 80 billion m3 which can effectively compensate for the groundwater deficit before the supply water of the two projects and even recover the historical debts of groundwater overexploitation 4 4 groundwater level response changes in groundwater flux and water balance inevitably lead to corresponding changes in the groundwater level the spatial distribution of the final groundwater depth in the plain areas simulated by the model under four schemes is shown in fig 10 because all prediction models use the same initial groundwater level the final groundwater depth can reflect the effects of different schemes on the groundwater table at present large scale groundwater drawdown zones have formed in the northeast of the sanjiang low plain under the effect of the current paddy area and water resource allocation pattern groundwater drawdown zones will further expand and the groundwater depth will exceed 30 m however the depth of groundwater is less than 5 m in most other areas except for some areas where the terrain is high and the bedrock is exposed scheme b paddy area is further expanded but the construction of water resource allocation projects is lagging and groundwater overexploitation is intensified which will lead to the expansion of groundwater drawdown zones the area with groundwater depth of more than 30 m will spread to the central and southern sanjiang low plain the area with groundwater depth of less than 5 m will be greatly reduced if the 14ia project is put into operation the groundwater depth in the areas near the border rivers and the central and eastern regions of the sanjiang low plain will be restored to less than 5 m but there will be still some large drawdown zones in the central and southern regions if both projects supply water except for several areas with higher terrain and exposed bedrock the groundwater depth in most areas will be restored to less than 5 m which shows that the water diversion projects have positive effects on the control of groundwater overexploitation 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 discussion regional water resource allocation and its supporting projects play a key role in solving the mismatch between supply and demand of water resources the minimum ecological flow of river the water supply capacity of surface water project and the allowable exploitation of groundwater are the constraints of water resource allocation which are the premise not the purpose shen et al 2021 it is generally believed that the optimal allocation of water resources will maximize the benefits of water supply under the above constraints and the water resource allocation scheme is already the optimal scheme to realize the sustainable utilization of groundwater so there is no need to evaluate the groundwater response of the implementation of the optimal scheme conversely however in fact that the process of water supply from different water sources to water users is constantly changing especially to agriculture among the water resource allocation schemes of the sanjiang plain evaluated in this study the best scheme for groundwater restoration is the complete water diversion scheme which can gradually restore groundwater to the state before large scale exploitation and even groundwater overflow in some areas however this state may be not perfect too shallow groundwater depth may cause soil secondary salinization and groundwater overflow affects farmland cultivation and construction facilities therefore it is the best state to control the groundwater depth within a reasonable range if the groundwater level exceeds the upper limit it can be exploited for irrigation if the groundwater level is lower than the lower limit the external water can be used to irrigate the combined use of the two water sources can give play to their respective advantages and reduce the irrigation cost however this state is difficult to achieve only by water resource allocation and the formed allocation scheme may have many problems at this time evaluating the effect of water resource allocation schemes through model simulation will help decision makers understand the advantages and disadvantages of these schemes and support the further optimization of allocation schemes and the planning of related projects 5 2 conclusions based on the coupled surface water groundwater model of the sanjiang plain the response of groundwater was simulated and analyzed for different paddy scales and water resource allocation patterns and the following main conclusions were drawn 1 the water supply scale of the water diversion project in the plain areas directly affects the groundwater discharge flux but it is not the main influencing factor of groundwater recharge changes the larger the water supply scale and the wider the water supply range of the passing runoff in the sanjiang plain the higher the replacement ratio of groundwater irrigation amount and the lesser the groundwater exploitation the displacement of groundwater exploitation by the passing runoff can effectively increase the baseflow which plays a positive role in maintaining the ecological health of wetlands in the sanjiang plain the differences of groundwater recharge among all schemes are mainly caused by the change of paddy scale which has little correlation with the water resource allocation pattern 2 the comparative analysis of groundwater balance shows that the complete water diversion scheme can achieve a balance between groundwater discharge and recharge in the sanjiang plain and effectively compensate for the groundwater deficit before the completion of the water diversion projects in all types of water resource allocation schemes once two diversion projects reach the designed water supply capacity they will not only reduce groundwater exploitation but also increase groundwater recharge from external water groundwater storage will change from a deficit to surplus increasing by 853 million m3 per year which can gradually compensate for the historical debt of groundwater overexploitation while reaching the balance of groundwater 3 the water resource allocation based on the water diversion projects of major rivers will effectively improve the groundwater table drawdown problem caused by overexploitation in the sanjiang plain and ensure that the groundwater level is restored to a relatively reasonable range once the complete water diversion scheme is completed except for some areas with high terrain and bedrock exposed the groundwater depth in most areas can be restored to less than 5 m which will play an important role in maintaining the stability of wetland ecosystem in the sanjiang plain however too shallow groundwater depth may have many adverse effects so the complete water diversion scheme may need to be optimized the construction of water diversion projects in the sanjiang plain should be the core content of regional water resource allocation in the future which is of great significance to solve the problem of groundwater overexploitation repair the shrinking wetland ecology and ensure the safety of grain production the coupled surface water and groundwater model played an important role in our methodology we innovated the coupled mechanism of surface water and groundwater in the model which not only ensured the simulation accuracy of key areas but also improved the efficiency of model construction and running a new automatic irrigation and drainage simulation function was developed for the model which can simulate the irrigation amount of paddy field from different water sources according to the hydrological processes such as precipitation evaporation and infiltration these innovations strongly supported the groundwater response evaluation of water resource allocations subsequently we will consider adding a function that the model can control groundwater exploitation and surface water withdraw according to the reasonable thresholds of groundwater table and further optimizing the complete water diversion scheme to avoid the soil secondary salinization

7923,study region the sanjiang plain located at the confluence of heilong songhua and wusuli rivers northeast china study focus due to the low and flat terrain wetlands and swamps were widely distributed in plain areas in history after decades of reclamation farmland has replaced wetland as the dominant landscape the competition of water resources between wetland ecological health and food security is very fierce which is mainly reflected in the serious overexploitation of groundwater this study used a new coupled surface water groundwater model with an innovative function of irrigation and drainage simulation to research the changes of groundwater in the sanjiang plain under different water resource allocation schemes and paddy development scale in the future which may provide a scientific basis for the planning of water resource allocation projects related to the restoration of groundwater and wetlands in this region new hydrological insights for the region we established four prediction models for different water resource allocation schemes and paddy areas by replacing the water supply data and planting structure of the baseline model in the sanjiang plain by comparing the groundwater balance and level of various schemes simulated by prediction models it was found that the complete water diversion scheme covering the plain areas would greatly reduce groundwater exploitation increase groundwater recharge and turn groundwater storage from deficit to surplus which would increase by 853 million m3 a it would gradually compensate for the historical debts due to groundwater overexploitation while achieving a balance between groundwater recharge and discharge thus the groundwater depth in most part of the plain areas would be restored to less than 5 m however the scheme also had a defect that is it may cause soil secondary salinization in shallow groundwater areas therefore the scheme needs to be further optimized to make full use of the low cost groundwater graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resource allocation groundwater response coupled surface water groundwater model paddy irrigation simulation sanjiang plain 1 introduction the sanjiang plain is one of the main grain producing areas in china in recent years the paddy area has shown an obvious expansion trend in the cultivated land cao et al 2021 which increased the regional water consumption and directly affected the water balance of the region sun et al 2021a despite the abundant passing runoff of the heilong songhua and wusuli rivers total 240 billion m3 a approximately the lagging surface water allocation project hinders the full utilization of this runoff which leads to over reliance on groundwater for paddy irrigation in the hinterland of the plain areas thus forming some large groundwater drawdown zones liu et al 2021 at the same time it also reduces the conservation effect of groundwater on wetlands causing the wetland area to shrink further zhou et al 2009 zou et al 2018 li et al 2021 according to the needs of national food security and ecological environment protection the sanjiang plain has to solve the problem of groundwater overexploitation while ensuring stable paddy production to curb the continued degradation of the wetland ecosystem therefore accelerating the construction of water diversion projects improving the utilization of passing runoff and decreasing the exploitation of groundwater are important measures to achieve food security and ecological restoration simultaneously water resource allocation is an important method for solving the time space mismatch between water supply and demand lin et al 2020 li et al 2020 relevant researches and applications of water resource allocation are extremely high wang et al 2008 zhuang 2016 bijl et al 2018 yu et al 2018 but the evaluation of the effect on groundwater of water resource allocation is still rare because the water resource allocation scheme is often the optimal scheme obtained by optimization or simulation methods wang and huang 2012 yu and lu 2018 martinsen et al 2019 cai et al 2021 few scholars have evaluated its implementation effect conversely however as many water resource allocation projects are major projects that require a large amount of national investment fu et al 2010 chen et al 2013 yu et al 2018 carefully evaluating the implementation effects of each allocation scheme and selecting the most appropriate scheme is of great significance for improving the effectiveness of national investment and maximizing project benefits after the implementation of different water resource allocation schemes whether the problem of regional groundwater overexploitation can be effectively solved and the river runoff depletion can be alleviated is extremely important for the necessity and rationality of the implementation of regional water resource allocation measures but it is difficult to realize quantitative evaluation by general means hydrological models are often used to study the impact of future climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle jiang et al 2007 d agostino et al 2010 li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 omer et al 2020 as a complex human activity that has an important impact on hydrological cycle and groundwater the implementation effect of water resource allocation can also be evaluated using hydrological models currently distributed hydrological models are mostly used which consider many hydrological influencing factors liang et al 1994 beven 1997 arnold et al 1998 jaber and shukla 2012 especially the distributed hydrological model with groundwater numerical simulation function that can more finely simulate the impact of various human activities on groundwater maxwell miller 2005 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2017 this study used the coupled surface water groundwater model as a tool to simulate the changes of recharge and discharge fluxes and groundwater level and analyze the effect on groundwater under different water resource allocation patterns two important functions of the model were introduced for the first time namely the coupled mechanism of surface water and groundwater simulation and the automatic recognition of paddy irrigation and drainage which were necessary to carry out this study 2 methods first we described the methodology applied to groundwater response evaluation of water resource allocation in which the hydrological model was a very important tool in the model the couped mechanism of surface water and groundwater and the simulation principle of paddy irrigation and drainage directly supported our study which were introduced here for the first time 2 1 evaluation methodology framework the impact of water resource development utilization and regulation on the regional hydrological cycle can be evaluated using hydrological models but a simple one may be difficult to clarify the impact on groundwater recharge discharge storage and level therefore our study used the object oriented modularized model for basin scale water cycle simulation modcycle to establish the coupled surface water groundwater model in the sanjiang plain from 2000 to 2014 baseline model based on the baseline model by taking the groundwater level at the end of 2014 as the initial values of the model and replacing water use data and planting structure we established 4 prediction models for different water resource allocation schemes and paddy areas the prediction models still adopted meteorological data from 2000 to 2014 to ensure that they had the same climatic conditions as the baseline model the groundwater fluxes and level simulated by the model under different schemes were compared and the impact of water resource allocation on groundwater was evaluated fig 1 the hydrological model of the sanjiang plain was first built in 2015 to support the preliminary planning and demonstration of the water diversion projects in this region at that time due to the support of relevant local departments the data before 2014 was relatively rich and no further data collection has been carried out since then in addition it is worth noting that from 2000 to 2014 the paddy area in the sanjiang plain increased sharply and the continuous and drastic change of land use had a great impact on the hydrological cycle sun et al 2021b it was also during this period that a large area of groundwater drawdown zones appeared therefore the hydrological cycle of this period 2000 2014 is very representative which can provide a baseline reference for the evaluation of water resource allocation schemes and has high research value 2 2 coupled mechanism of surface water and groundwater simulation the initial version of modcycle was a semi distributed hydrological model based on the spatial delineation of subwatersheds and hydrological response units hrus to improve the adaptability of the model in groundwater simulation of plain areas the groundwater flow numerical model based on the finite difference method was included so that the model had the ability to simulate groundwater level and flow in plain areas among the similar coupled models that have been reported menking et al 2003 galbiati et al 2006 kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 most of them adopt the spatial association and information interaction mechanism between hrus and grid cells gcs however to raise the simulation efficiency the building of a semi distributed hydrological model often deletes the hrus with small area proportion non dominant hrus and allocates them to other hrus dominant hrus because of the huge number of initial hrus or full hrus this merging will lead to the loss of spatial location attributes of hrus which conflicts with the above coupled method because the gcs need to be associated with spatially deterministic hrus therefore these coupled models have to use the full hrus to overlay with gcs and some models even take the pixels of the hru map as gcs of groundwater model kim et al 2008 which limit the efficiency of these models in the hydrological cycle simulation of large scale regions such as the sanjiang plain in view of the weakness of the above hru gc spatial association modcycle created a new spatial association mode between subwatersheds and gcs which can reduce a lot of workloads for processing of hru related data under the new mode hru can be merged at will which further expanded the advantages of the coupled model used in large scale regions fig 2 illustrates the spatial association between subwatersheds and gcs the spatial association between subwatersheds and gcs can be expressed as follows 1 a fr i j a i j a i where a fr i j is the area fraction of gc j in subwatershed i a i j is the overlapping area between subwatershed i and gc j l2 a i is the area of subwatershed i l2 when there is overlapping area between the subwatershed and gc a fr i j 0 on the contrary a fr i j 0 the semi distributed hydrological model and the groundwater numerical model realize joint simulation by transmitting necessary data to each other the source and sink data necessary for the groundwater numerical simulation such as precipitation and irrigation leakage recharge surface water seepage recharge groundwater exploitation base flow phreatic evaporation etc can be obtained from the hydrological simulation eq 2 the groundwater level simulated by the groundwater numerical model is transmitted to the hydrological model to assist the simulation of relevant hydrological processes including various sources and sinks required for the above groundwater simulation eq 3 2 q c e l j i 1 i r s u b i d s u b i a f r i j 3 h s u b i j 1 j h c e l j a f r i j where q cel j is the net flux of gc j the difference between recharge and discharge which is a positive value indicating that the gc is net recharge and a negative value indicating net discharge l3 t r sub i is the recharge of subwatershed i to the aquifer l3 t including precipitation and irrigation leakage surface water seepage etc d sub i is the groundwater discharge of subwatershed i from the aquifer l3 t including exploitation base flow phreatic evaporation etc h sub i is the groundwater level of subwatershed i l h cel j is the groundwater level of gc j l a fr i j is the area fraction of gc j in subwatershed i i and j are the total number of subwatersheds and gcs respectively the meaning of the eq 2 indicates that the sources and sinks of all subwatersheds overlapping with gc j are divided according to the area fraction of spatial association and summarized to form the net flux of gc j the meaning of the eq 3 is that the groundwater level of all gcs overlapping with subwatershed i is weighted and averaged according to the area fraction of spatial association to form the average groundwater level of subwatershed i 2 3 irrigation and drainage simulation for paddy fields the impact of paddy irrigation on the hydrological cycle in the sanjiang plain is very significant sun et al 2021b so it is necessary to accurately determine its water withdraw and irrigation processes in most hydrological models irrigation water quantity is input data which need to be investigated or predicted in advance rather than the simulated output data however the paddy irrigation processes are affected by precipitation evaporation transpiration infiltration water sources management and other factors if these processes are separated from the hydrological cycle and their quantities are calculated separately the accuracy is often insufficient especially in regions with large area and scattered distribution of paddy fields the spatial differences of various factors further increase the difficulty of irrigation evaluation such data used in hydrological model will affect the simulation accuracy therefore modcycle developed the automatic irrigation and drainage simulation function which can simulate the irrigation and drainage process of paddy water supply of water sources in different regions irrigation leakage recharge of groundwater etc in a word the model provides a powerful tool for the simulation of groundwater under different water resource allocation schemes and paddy areas fig 3 shows the flowchart of paddy irrigation and drainage in the model the model simulates the surface ponding depth of the paddy fields by considering precipitation evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff the simulated depth is compared with preset depth thresholds for paddy fields considering the suitable ponding depth range of different growth stages of rice by which the irrigation and drainage date is determined and the water quantity of irrigation for the paddy fields is calculated the penman monteith method is used to calculate the potential daily evapotranspiration rate of paddy fields the actual daily evapotranspiration of paddy fields is then calculated according to the constraints of conditions such as canopy interception surface ponding soil water content and rice growth status neitsch et al 2011 the green ampt equation is used to calculate the infiltration and runoff of paddy fields green and ampt 1911 which is modified considering ponding water depth in our study eq 4 4 i δ t i δ t s p n d δ t 1 where i δ t is the modified amount of precipitation and irrigation at the time step δ t mm i δ t is the total amount of precipitation and irrigation at the time step δ t mm s p n d δ t 1 is the ponding water depth at the end of the time step δ t 1 mm then the ponding water depth can be calculated by eq 5 5 s p n d δ t i δ t f inf δ t i δ t f inf δ t s p n d t h r s p n d t h r i δ t f inf δ t s p n d t h r where s p n d δ t is the ponding water depth at the end of the time step δ t mm f inf δ t is the infiltration amount modified according to i δ t at the time step δ t mm s p n d t h r is the maximum depth threshold of ponding water on the surface of paddy fields set by users mm thus runoff or drainage will appear when the ponding water depth exceeds the maximum depth threshold the model allows users to set different thresholds of appropriate ponding water depth according to the stages of rice growth in agricultural practice farmers often implement different ponding water depths at different growth stages to maximize production save irrigation water and cost and make full use of rainwater based on practical experience upper and lower thresholds of the ponding water depth can be input at each stage of rice growth if the ponding water depth calculated is less than the lower threshold irrigation will be carried out until the water depth reaches the upper threshold if the water depth is above the upper threshold drainage is carried out until the water depth falls to the upper threshold fig 3 the model can output the date and daily amount of paddy field irrigation and the annual irrigation amount through the above simulation which can be used for model calibration by compared with the measured irrigation amount from paddy irrigation experimental stations sun et al 2021b by adjusting the relevant parameters the accuracy of paddy field irrigation and drainage simulations can be improved the model draws water from different water sources to meet the daily water demand of paddy irrigation in different subregions users need to first determine the water sources corresponding to different subregions and then evaluate the water supply volume of each water source according to the investigation and statistics or predict the available water supply volume of each water source according to the relevant water planning when paddy fields in a subregion need irrigation the daily water demand is divided according to the proportion of water supply or available water supply volume of each corresponding water source and then the divided water volumes are extracted from water sources which finally enter paddy fields after evaporation and leakage losses are deducted along the way of water delivery and increase the ponding water depth to the threshold range fig 3 3 materials 3 1 study area the sanjiang plain is located in the eastern part of heilongjiang province the area where the heilong songhua and wusuli rivers meet it is bordered by the three major rivers xingkai lake and drainage divides with an area of approximately 105 700 km2 this region is composed of several small watersheds with similar climate hydrology topography geological conditions and agricultural patterns but is very different from other surrounding areas so it is often separated from heilongjiang province to carry out hydrological research water resources management and water engineering construction as a whole fig 4 the plain areas are the main social and economic activity region in the sanjiang plain and they are also the areas that cause the most serious disturbance to groundwater in the early period swamps and wetlands were widespread in the plains but after large scale reclamation they were gradually replaced by farmland in the 1980 s the use of paddies to control waterlogging was implemented and paddy area rose and became a major water consumer with the increase in paddy areas the problems due to backward surface water projects and insufficient irrigation facilities became prominent and groundwater became the main source of irrigation since 2000 the increase in paddy areas has accelerated from 9200 to 24 200 km2 in 2013 which has caused groundwater drawdown zones to expand year by year although the paddy area has stabilized since 2014 its impact on groundwater continues to increase sun et al 2021b to repair the overexploitation of groundwater curb the shrinking trend of wetlands increase the utilization rate of passing runoff improve paddy irrigation conditions and ensure grain production safety the sanjiang plain has conducted the planning and construction of many water resource allocation projects a number of which have already made important progress but it is still difficult to quantitatively evaluate the repair effects of various projects on the overexploitation of groundwater this is the focus of the present study 3 2 data the building of baseline model is the basis of this study which needs to collect and process sufficient basic spatial data and driving data of hydrological cycle due to the limited space this section briefly introduced the main basic spatial data of the model and the water resource allocation scheme data of prediction models 3 2 1 main basic spatial data the model first used digital elevation model dem and actual river network to delineate subwatersheds and generate main channels then to finely simulate the dynamics of groundwater in the plain areas the subwatersheds in the sanjiang plain were divided into plain and hilly subwatersheds in which the groundwater in plain subwatersheds was numerically simulated subwatersheds crossing hilly and plain areas were forcibly cut by the established mountain plain boundary and the corresponding main channels were also disconnected at the boundary so as to maintain the one to one correspondence between subwatersheds and main channels the whole region was delineated into 1705 subwatersheds with an average area of about 62 km2 fig 5a the model only carried out groundwater numerical simulation in the sanjiang low plain and the xingkai lake plain where aquifer consists of quaternary loose sediments with grain size between sand and gravel and no aquifuge the thickness of the quaternary aquifer is 50 300 m covered with 5 20 m clay layer in the eastern part of the sanjiang low plain which makes the groundwater under the clay layer confined in view of the above characteristics the quaternary aquifer was defined as a shallow aquifer and set as convertible aquifer in the model because groundwater heads may alternate between confined and unconfined conditions the model set a deep aquifer below the quaternary stratum which was virtual and did not participate in the hydrological cycle the shallow and deep aquifers were horizontally divided into 206 rows and 206 columns at an interval of 2 km there were 42 436 gcs in a single aquifer including 13 076 effective ones within the plain areas fig 5b compared with the pure groundwater numerical model one of the advantages of the coupled surface water and groundwater model is that the modeling process saves the work dealing with sources and sinks and boundary conditions artificially sources and sinks can be calculated by the hydrological model which can be calibrated and conform to the water balance so they are more accurate in the groundwater modeling of the sanjiang plain we only processed the aquifer and grid cell data necessary for the numerical model and did not set the sources and sinks and boundary conditions separately in the groundwater numerical simulation area the upstream boundaries of the aquifer are piedmont and the downstream boundaries are the heilong and wusuli rivers because the hydrological model and groundwater numerical model are coupled together the model did not simulate the lateral recharge from the piedmont to the aquifer but simulated the mountain runoff entering the plain and then leaking to recharge the aquifer therefore the upstream boundaries of the aquifer were set as no flow boundaries the model included the heilong and wusuli rivers into the river network system of the hydrological model which can simulate the interaction between the runoff of the two rivers and groundwater these rivers consequently were not set as head boundaries and the lateral flow of the downstream boundaries is 0 if the two rivers were not included in the river network system they can be set as head boundaries so that the lateral flow will not be 0 however doing so would increase the workload of river network system there would be many more small watersheds and outlets and boundary condition processing the model needed other spatial data such as land use soil and meteorological station distribution hydrogeological parameters initial conditions and other data for groundwater numerical simulation meteorological driven data such as precipitation air temperature wind speed radiation and air humidity human driven data such as agricultural irrigation water use reservoir control parameters water diversion groundwater exploitation and so on the groundwater numerical simulation did not need the source and sink data but the spatial association data of subwatersheds and gcs must be added 3 2 2 water resource allocation scheme data according to the relevant plan of the sanjiang plain by 2035 the paddy area was estimated to increase by an additional 6267 km2 and the demand for water resources would further increase if there was no corresponding water resource allocation project to solve the water supply problem it would further aggravate the situation of groundwater overexploitation and may lead to accelerated deterioration of the ecological environment to this end in the sanjiang plain two water diversion projects from major rivers was planned to supply water to 14 irrigation areas along the border river 14ia project and 29 on both sides of the songhua river 29ia project respectively which can cover most of the arable land in the sanjiang low plain and xingkai lake plain fig 6 based on the development prospects of paddy and the implementation progress of water diversion project planning we formed four schemes and established corresponding prediction models table 1 the current model was input the land use data including 23 773 km2 of paddy fields and the amount of surface water and groundwater supply in 2014 in 2035 the paddy area in the no water diversion model would be expanded to 30 040 km2 in proportion based on the current scheme however the two water diversion projects had not been completed and water would still be supplied according to the 2014 water resource allocation scheme in 2035 the partial water diversion scheme only allowed the 14ia project to supply water to the 14 irrigation areas the complete water diversion scheme in 2035 indicated that the two water diversion projects had reached the designed water supply capacity and supplied water to all 43 irrigation areas it should be noted that the water supply volume of various water sources in table 1 is the planned water supply target under each scheme and the corresponding model would simulate drawing water daily to paddy fields according to the water supply target proportion of water sources when the water supply from the water diversion projects and local surface water projects was shortage water would be pumped from the underground the final water amount pumped from underground may be greater than the groundwater supply target or even an exploitable amount the paddy area in the planning year was predicted by administrative region and irrigation area collectively referred to as subregion according to the plan the increased area of paddy fields would be transformed from dry land there was a set of hru data containing subwatershed number and subregion number in the input data of the current model including the paddy filed and dry land area in the current year this set of hru data was used to allocate the predicted paddy area to each subwatershed to form a new set of hru data for the prediction models 4 results the process of model calibration and verification can be found in the relevant literature sun et al 2021b so only part results were shown here the groundwater of the plain areas has the most significant response to the development utilization and allocation of water resources in the sanjiang plain the water use is little and the groundwater storage is stable relatively in the hill and valley plain areas therefore this study only analyzed the groundwater changes in the two large plains sanjiang low plain and xingkai lake plain 4 1 model calibration and verification according to the collected data the data from 2000 to 2008 was used for parameter calibration and that from 2009 to 2014 for model verification the calibration process adopted manual parameter adjustment the effect was evaluated by nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and determination coefficient r2 we collected long series of measured data of flow and groundwater level from 6 representative hydrological stations in the study area and 21 representative observation wells in the plain areas shown in fig 4 to fit the surface runoff and groundwater level simulated by the model respectively here shows nse and r2 by model calibration and verification and the key parameters used for hydrologic cycle and groundwater simulations at representative observation wells and hydrological stations tables 2 and 3 the fit effects of observed and simulated time series of flow and groundwater table at hydrological station s2 and observation well g20 are shown in fig 7 the simulated irrigation amount of paddy fields by the irrigation and drainage function of the model was also fitted with the measured irrigation amount from the experimental irrigation stations sun et al 2021b 4 2 main flux response of groundwater at present groundwater in the plain areas is the main water source for agricultural irrigation and paddy irrigation has the greatest impact on groundwater although the paddy area in the sanjiang plain has stabilized since 2014 as one of the main producing areas of high quality japonica rice there is still the possibility of further expansion for this reason increasing the utilization of passing runoff is an important way to meet the needs of paddy irrigation and alleviate the problem of groundwater overexploitation the impact of different paddy areas and water resource allocation patterns on groundwater is first reflected by the changes in groundwater exploitation fig 8a by 2035 the paddy area in the 43 irrigated areas will increase to 30 040 km2 if the current water resource allocation pattern is maintained the amount of groundwater exploitation will increase significantly with an average annual exploitation of 14 46 billion m3 table 4 even if partial water diversion is achieved i e the allocation of water resources in 14 irrigation areas has been completed the amount of groundwater exploitation will only have returned to the current level which will not help further repair groundwater overexploitation if the complete water resource allocation in all irrigation areas is achieved scheme d the amount of groundwater exploitation will be further reduced dropping to 8 20 billion m3 a table 4 which is lower than that of the current scheme groundwater overexploitation control will thus have a positive effect as a major water user in the sanjiang plain the expansion of paddy areas has increased water consumption and groundwater exploitation and also enhanced groundwater recharge fig 8b the paddy area under the current scheme scheme a is 23 773 km2 and the average annual groundwater recharge is 11 63 billion m3 in 2035 the paddy area will reach 30 040 km2 which will greatly increase groundwater recharge under various water resource allocation patterns and the rate of increase is roughly the same table 4 indicating that the main factor affecting groundwater recharge is the paddy area for a certain paddy area no matter how the water resource allocation pattern changes it is necessary to ensure the paddy irrigation demand otherwise it will lead to a reduction in rice yield therefore the amount of water recharged to the groundwater due to the leakage of paddy irrigation is basically the same baseflow is very sensitive to water resource allocation and it is closely related to the inter annual variation in precipitation fig 8c shows that under schemes a and b there is a difference in paddy area of 6267 km2 which has a great impact on the discharge and recharge of groundwater but has little impact on its baseflow the average baseflow is relatively similar under the two allocation schemes of partial and complete water diversion the baseflow increases significantly and the more surface water is introduced from major rivers the greater the baseflow the figure also shows that the baseflow under various schemes shows an increasing trend over time which should be related to the increasing trend of precipitation during the simulation period in the model except for meteorological data that change year by year other hydrological cycle driving data are fixed and do not change with time changes in hydrological processes within the region such as groundwater exploitation local surface water use and adjustment of agricultural planting structures have little impact on the baseflow of the plain areas only when the area is supplemented with water from the outside will a large change occur in the baseflow such as precipitation water diversion and the introduction of passing runoff phreatic evaporation is a small flux in groundwater discharge and its changes are also related to different water resource allocation schemes but have a certain correlation with paddy area as shown in fig 8d the inter annual changes and the differences due to different schemes in phreatic evaporation are similar to the change trends and differences in baseflow however compared to baseflow there are greater differences between schemes a and b in phreatic evaporation which indicate that local water resource development and utilization activities have a great impact on phreatic evaporation and the water resource allocation will further expand this impact 4 3 water balance response of groundwater from the perspective of water balance groundwater has been over exploited during 2000 2014 and its storage has been reduced by an average of 0 31 billion m3 per year table 4 if the paddy area and water resource allocation pattern of 2014 are still maintained scheme a then the annual average groundwater exploitation will further increase and storage will continue to decrease with an average annual deficit of 1 16 billion m3 which is much larger than the baseline 2000 2014 average level the paddy area increased annually from 2000 to 2014 the average annual paddy area in this period is smaller than the 2014 paddy area in scheme a and the dependence on groundwater in the early stage is relatively small although the intensity of groundwater exploitation increased in the later period it has not yet posed a particularly serious threat to groundwater as in scheme a by 2035 the paddy area will increase if the two water diversion projects in the plain areas are not completed the water resource allocation pattern is not improved scheme b and the paddy irrigation is still dominated by groundwater then the average annual reduction in groundwater storage will reach 2 54 billion m3 which is more than twice the current scheme and will have an unprecedented impact on water balance table 4 at this time if the partial water diversion in the plain areas can be realized that is the 14ia project currently under implementation reaches the designed water supply capacity scheme c then the severe overexploitation of groundwater in scheme b will be relieved to a large extent and the average annual reduction of groundwater storage will be reduced to 0 52 billion m3 if complete water diversion scheme can be achieved in the plain areas scheme d it will not only reduce groundwater exploitation but also increase groundwater recharge groundwater storage will turn from a deficit to surplus increasing by 0 85 billion m3 each year it can reverse the continuous overexploitation of groundwater and make up for the groundwater deficit accumulated in the plain before the completion of the water diversion projects from the perspective of the cumulative change of groundwater storage based on the storage at the beginning of the simulation period early 2000 there were completely different change trends in the cumulative storage change among the four schemes fig 9 the groundwater storage under the scheme a will be reduced by 17 48 billion m3 at the end of the simulation period if the current water allocation pattern is not improved by 2035 the large scale expansion of paddy will result in a cumulative decrease of 38 06 billion m3 in groundwater storage leading to serious overexploitation in the plain areas scheme b the 14ia project that reach the designed water supply capacity will effectively reduce groundwater overexploitation at the end of the simulation period the groundwater storage deficit will be 7 74 billion m3 the degree of overexploitation is significantly alleviated compared with that of the current plan but overall it is still in a state of overexploitation scheme c if the two water diversion projects can supply water to 43 irrigation areas groundwater storage will recover year by year and increase cumulatively by 12 80 billion m3 which can effectively compensate for the groundwater deficit before the supply water of the two projects and even recover the historical debts of groundwater overexploitation 4 4 groundwater level response changes in groundwater flux and water balance inevitably lead to corresponding changes in the groundwater level the spatial distribution of the final groundwater depth in the plain areas simulated by the model under four schemes is shown in fig 10 because all prediction models use the same initial groundwater level the final groundwater depth can reflect the effects of different schemes on the groundwater table at present large scale groundwater drawdown zones have formed in the northeast of the sanjiang low plain under the effect of the current paddy area and water resource allocation pattern groundwater drawdown zones will further expand and the groundwater depth will exceed 30 m however the depth of groundwater is less than 5 m in most other areas except for some areas where the terrain is high and the bedrock is exposed scheme b paddy area is further expanded but the construction of water resource allocation projects is lagging and groundwater overexploitation is intensified which will lead to the expansion of groundwater drawdown zones the area with groundwater depth of more than 30 m will spread to the central and southern sanjiang low plain the area with groundwater depth of less than 5 m will be greatly reduced if the 14ia project is put into operation the groundwater depth in the areas near the border rivers and the central and eastern regions of the sanjiang low plain will be restored to less than 5 m but there will be still some large drawdown zones in the central and southern regions if both projects supply water except for several areas with higher terrain and exposed bedrock the groundwater depth in most areas will be restored to less than 5 m which shows that the water diversion projects have positive effects on the control of groundwater overexploitation 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 discussion regional water resource allocation and its supporting projects play a key role in solving the mismatch between supply and demand of water resources the minimum ecological flow of river the water supply capacity of surface water project and the allowable exploitation of groundwater are the constraints of water resource allocation which are the premise not the purpose shen et al 2021 it is generally believed that the optimal allocation of water resources will maximize the benefits of water supply under the above constraints and the water resource allocation scheme is already the optimal scheme to realize the sustainable utilization of groundwater so there is no need to evaluate the groundwater response of the implementation of the optimal scheme conversely however in fact that the process of water supply from different water sources to water users is constantly changing especially to agriculture among the water resource allocation schemes of the sanjiang plain evaluated in this study the best scheme for groundwater restoration is the complete water diversion scheme which can gradually restore groundwater to the state before large scale exploitation and even groundwater overflow in some areas however this state may be not perfect too shallow groundwater depth may cause soil secondary salinization and groundwater overflow affects farmland cultivation and construction facilities therefore it is the best state to control the groundwater depth within a reasonable range if the groundwater level exceeds the upper limit it can be exploited for irrigation if the groundwater level is lower than the lower limit the external water can be used to irrigate the combined use of the two water sources can give play to their respective advantages and reduce the irrigation cost however this state is difficult to achieve only by water resource allocation and the formed allocation scheme may have many problems at this time evaluating the effect of water resource allocation schemes through model simulation will help decision makers understand the advantages and disadvantages of these schemes and support the further optimization of allocation schemes and the planning of related projects 5 2 conclusions based on the coupled surface water groundwater model of the sanjiang plain the response of groundwater was simulated and analyzed for different paddy scales and water resource allocation patterns and the following main conclusions were drawn 1 the water supply scale of the water diversion project in the plain areas directly affects the groundwater discharge flux but it is not the main influencing factor of groundwater recharge changes the larger the water supply scale and the wider the water supply range of the passing runoff in the sanjiang plain the higher the replacement ratio of groundwater irrigation amount and the lesser the groundwater exploitation the displacement of groundwater exploitation by the passing runoff can effectively increase the baseflow which plays a positive role in maintaining the ecological health of wetlands in the sanjiang plain the differences of groundwater recharge among all schemes are mainly caused by the change of paddy scale which has little correlation with the water resource allocation pattern 2 the comparative analysis of groundwater balance shows that the complete water diversion scheme can achieve a balance between groundwater discharge and recharge in the sanjiang plain and effectively compensate for the groundwater deficit before the completion of the water diversion projects in all types of water resource allocation schemes once two diversion projects reach the designed water supply capacity they will not only reduce groundwater exploitation but also increase groundwater recharge from external water groundwater storage will change from a deficit to surplus increasing by 853 million m3 per year which can gradually compensate for the historical debt of groundwater overexploitation while reaching the balance of groundwater 3 the water resource allocation based on the water diversion projects of major rivers will effectively improve the groundwater table drawdown problem caused by overexploitation in the sanjiang plain and ensure that the groundwater level is restored to a relatively reasonable range once the complete water diversion scheme is completed except for some areas with high terrain and bedrock exposed the groundwater depth in most areas can be restored to less than 5 m which will play an important role in maintaining the stability of wetland ecosystem in the sanjiang plain however too shallow groundwater depth may have many adverse effects so the complete water diversion scheme may need to be optimized the construction of water diversion projects in the sanjiang plain should be the core content of regional water resource allocation in the future which is of great significance to solve the problem of groundwater overexploitation repair the shrinking wetland ecology and ensure the safety of grain production the coupled surface water and groundwater model played an important role in our methodology we innovated the coupled mechanism of surface water and groundwater in the model which not only ensured the simulation accuracy of key areas but also improved the efficiency of model construction and running a new automatic irrigation and drainage simulation function was developed for the model which can simulate the irrigation amount of paddy field from different water sources according to the hydrological processes such as precipitation evaporation and infiltration these innovations strongly supported the groundwater response evaluation of water resource allocations subsequently we will consider adding a function that the model can control groundwater exploitation and surface water withdraw according to the reasonable thresholds of groundwater table and further optimizing the complete water diversion scheme to avoid the soil secondary salinization

7924,study region the study is carried out for northern tunisia study focus precipitations are often analysed via intensity or accumulation for a specified timescale e g annual seasonal etc we propose in this study to analyse regional rainfall variability by adopting a variable time step through the rain event concept this event based approach ensures the integration of information related to rain intermittency which is one of the fundamental properties of precipitations this study focuses essentially on wet spells characteristics derived from the aggregation of daily winter dataset over a 50 years period 1960 2009 the multivariate analysis based on the combination of two clustering approaches i e self organizing map and hierarchical clustering allows the identification of different rainfall regimes this study helps to understand rainfall variability patterns and to address rainfall regionalization and water use management issues new hydrological insights for the region the winter precipitations of northern tunisia are classified into 4 typical situations extremely dry seasons with a few short and weak rainfall events dry seasons with high frequency of weak events intermediate seasons with medium amount of rain and intermittent events and rainiest seasons with long and intense events the regionalization yields two geographical regions northern sector characterized by rainy seasons whereas the stations of the southern sector are mostly dry the temporal variability analysis shows that the dry season classes dominate extending over three consecutive decades from 1970 to 2000 graphical abstract ga1 keywords rain event self organizing map minimum inter event time hierarchical agglomerative clustering data image abbreviations som self organizing map hac hierarchical agglomerative clustering miet minimum inter event time djf december january february 1 introduction the precipitation pattern in the mediterranean area is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability this variability prominent between 30 n and 45 n is directly controlled by the subtropical high and mid latitude low pressure systems rysman et al 2013 these are at the origin of extreme events e g drought or extreme precipitation and can result in natural disasters such as loss of human lives and damage to infrastructure livestock and environment tunisia is situated in the northern tip of africa and extends between latitudes 30 38 n this latitude band is considered as a climatic transition zone between the temperate mid latitude zone north of the mediterranean and the north african subtropical zone slimani et al 2007 in addition to its latitudinal position the particular geography of the area including the topography and the proximity to the mediterranean sea affect the atmospheric circulation and can accentuate the rainfall variability in this region jebari et al 2007 with the observed current climate change and the increase in water needs there s a growing concern about the possibility of an increase in the likelihood of drought and or floods and their increasing and amplifying impacts norrant and douguedroit 2006 xoplaki et al 2006 tramblay et al 2013 2020 schilling et al 2020 analysing rainfall variability in tunisia potentially exposed to climate variability and change has been one of the most challenging subjects for hydrologists over the past 30 years kebaili bargaoui 1989 and bargaoui 1994 analysed annual rainfall series of the medjerda basin using the surplus deficit method runs and frequency analysis by means of the weibull distribution in order to identify drought years drought occurrence in tunisia over a period of 88 years was also investigated using annual rainfall series by benzarti and habaieb 2001 spatial regionalization of monthly precipitation in northern tunisia was analysed based on the station s topography indices jedidi et al 2008 and univariate frequency analysis benzarti 2003 merzougui and slimani 2012 tramblay et al 2019 analysed the variability of rainfall on five days resolution in tunisia with different interpolation methods a time dependent two state markov chain was calibrated for grand tunis region by bargaoui 1983 using copula approach gargouri ellouze and bargaoui 2009 analysed 5 minute resolution rainfall series to study the relationship between the intensity of the rainfall event and the hydrological response of the watershed as represented by infiltration index ghanmi et al 2013 2016 analysed rain series with high temporal resolution 5 min to build intensity duration frequency curves for several stations distributed in the north of tunisia using the multifractal approach in this paper we focus on northern tunisia a large data set of rain gauge measurements from a relatively large network 70 rain gauges in an area of about 28 000 km2 provides daily accumulation series over sufficiently long periods 50 years for the proposed study daily rainfall data are aggregated into rainy and no rainy spells during a given season this event based approach with a variable time step or the event duration ensures the integration of information related to the intermittency of precipitating processes in the other side a given monthly or seasonal accumulation may correspond to a multitude of low intensity events or to a single very intense event most of regional studies mentioned earlier based on rain gauge network observations provide hourly daily monthly yearly statistics with an estimation of intensity duration frequency curves idf or intensity duration area frequency curves idaf the choice of the times step is a critical point indeed precipitations are characterized by a high variability and intermittency in temporal or spatial domain verrier et al 2011 akrour et al 2015 when large time step is considered the distinction between the rainy period and the dry period is not possible and the cumulative precipitation values are strongly smoothed and do not reflect the natural variability of rainfall on the other hand a too fast sampling rate leads to sampling errors especially when using tipping bucket rain gauges the bucket volume of the tipping bucket rain gauge corresponds to an equivalent rain height h 0 2 or h 0 5 mm overall precipitations have a complex structure over a range of time and space scales that need to be equally highlighted at daily temporal resolution the day to day rainfall variability is characterized by dry and wet periods possessing different properties the extraction of rainfall event properties e g frequency duration and the intensity ensures a better characterization of the rainy season by taking into account additional rainfall aspects equally important rather than the amounts of precipitation for example the rainfall event number over a given season reflects the intermittent character which represents a fundamental property of precipitation in addition the average duration and average accumulation of rainfall events over the rainy season indicate the behavior of wet spells understanding the variability of rainfall event features is crucial for effective management of water resources especially when the economy of the region is highly dependent on agriculture production such as tunisia for the rainfed agriculture and depending to the season the rain event characteristics number intensity and duration may play an important role in determining the quality and quantity of crops the importance of event based rainfall analysis is not limited to the agriculture however the identification of the season typology and the characterization of rainfall event can have a direct influence on runoff processes horizontal flows infiltration and sol humidity moreover the proposed study may contribute in a future step to the establishment of a synoptic hydro climatic reference the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the study area and rain stations characteristics section 3 discusses the methodology used for clustering analysis section 4 provides results followed by the discussion in section 5 and a conclusion is given in the last section 2 study area and dataset description northern tunisia is located between 35 n and 38 n and covers a total area of about 28 641 km² fig 1 it is characterized by dry hot summers and moist cool winters we adopt emberger bioclimatic index emberger 1930 which is specific to bioclimatic classification in the mediterranean region and is based on the total annual rainfall as well as the daily average maximum temperature of the hottest month and the daily average minimum temperature of the coldest month marres 1972 accordingly northern tunisia is divided into three major bioclimatic regions humid h in the extreme northwest sub humid sh and semi arid sa in the other parts representing respectively 12 5 28 and 59 5 of the study area fig 1 in tunisia rainfall is influenced by general atmospheric circulation patterns the most important are 1 the icelandic depression 2 western mediterranean depressions the gulf of balearic depression and the gulf of genoa depression 3 eastern mediterranean depressions gulfs of syrtes depression and gabes depressions 4 the azores anticyclone and 5 the central european anticyclone merzougui and slimani 2012 in addition to regional factors rainfall is affected by local factors such as marine influences continentality topographic conditions and especially the reliefs indeed the general orientation of the reliefs tell atlas and saharan atlas fig 1 have an important role to weaken or strengthen storms coming from different directions slimani et al 2007 particularly the precipitation regime in northern tunisia is strongly influenced by northerly and especially northwesterly flow bringing winter storms and precipitation from the north ben boubaker 2003 xoplaki et al 2004 brandimarte et al 2011 and jelassi et al 2016 there is also the northeasterly flow which brings rainfall from the european continent daily rainfall series are used which are collected from 70 rainfall stations well distributed in the study region fig 1 over the period 1960 2009 the database is obtained from the general directorate of water resources of the agriculture and water resources ministry table 1 displays the rainfall stations characteristics including the geographic position elevation starting date of observations percentage of missing values december january february djf totals and the bioclimatic region the dataset consists of 3500 djf seasons 50 years of observations at 70 stations corresponding to 31 5910 observed days for a given year any missing value detected in the djf daily observations leads to the exclusion of the whole season from the analysis the number of considered seasons for each station is mentioned in table 1 in total the number of seasons without missing values is 3137 note that djf for year m corresponds to december of year m 1 and january february of year m 3 methodology the objective of the event based approach is to understand the rainfall structure and characterize its spatio temporal variability with respect to event spells descriptors estimating key descriptors of a rainfall season on the basis of rainfall spells may be prominent for specific applications e g agriculture ecology climate change erosion water resource management etc this study is limited to the winter season djf the choice of this season is motivated by the highest amount of precipitation recorded during the djf season and also by the cyclonic nature of winter rainfall which allows the definition of independent event in relation with cyclone lifecycle at a synoptic scale 3 1 definition of rainfall events and data transformation the definition of rainfall event is based on the separation of dry and wet spells there is not a unique way to achieve event delimitation in the literature researchers tend in general to choose a minimum inter event time miet which is the smallest duration of dry period separating two independent rainy periods dunkerley 2008 molina sanchis et al 2016 dilmi et al 2017 parchure and gedam 2019 this approach is adopted in the present study some studies consider the hydrological conditions e g the soil surface seals soil wetness and the event runoff to estimate the miet cattan et al 2006 joo et al 2014 moreover there are other statistical approaches based only on the rainfall time series such as the autocorrelation analysis or the exponential method wenzel and voorhees 1981 restrepo posada 1982 asquith et al 2005 the autocorrelation analysis is based on choosing the time lag on which the autocorrelation coefficient of the rainfall data set converges to zero this approach is used here to analyse the 50 year djf daily precipitations for each of the 70 stations note that all days with a rainfall amount greater than zero are considered a rainy day the minimum rainfall value recorded in the daily timeseries is 0 1 mm day unlike several studies e g jiang et al 2011 days with small rainfall amount or drizzles 1 mm day are not considered as dry days in our study indeed the inclusion of low rainfall events can provide a better characterization of the rainfall intermittency and the events typology over the season in addition and for the adopted event scale the same rainfall event may include a dry day or days with drizzles therefore fixing a threshold may affect the intra event variability and allows the split of the one single event into separate events as shown in fig 2 the blue and red curves represent respectively the median and the mean of autocorrelation values for 1 day lag to 5 day lags the two horizontal lines show the approximate 95 confidence intervals for a white noise process the two curves decrease and cut the horizontal line critical level between 2 and 3 days from 3 day lags and beyond the mean and the median are no longer significant therefore the miet is of the order of 2 3 days the proposed analysis is based on the use of a fixed miet for all stations thus we choose to fix miet to two days this choice avoids the creation of intensive intra event gaps of larger miet fig 3 illustrates an example in which a fictive 18 day period is separated into three events using the two day miet as shown in fig 3 this miet choice results in one event representing an isolated day event 1 another with several consecutive days event 2 and another consisting in several days with a one day break event 3 once the miet is defined six descriptors features are selected to characterize the analysed djf season table 2 the first three features are 1 the number of events per season ne 2 the number of rainy days per season nd and 3 the seasonal cumulative rainfall ct table 2 these three features help to identify the overall rainfall characteristics of the season considering the event scale on the basis of the event number per season we have defined 4 the average accumulation per event ca e and 5 the average event duration da e based on the number of rainy days for a given season we also defined 6 the average accumulation per rainy day per season ca d which is assumed as an indicator of the intensity of the season thus with these six features we enable characterization of the rain events type and the quality of rainfall during the season the transformed dataset is then presented in the form of an observation matrix where each row corresponds to a djf season in a given station and the columns are the adopted characteristics of rain events over the djf season these six variables have different units and therefore different scales in order to give equal weights to the data for the further analysis a normalisation is applied to yield zero mean and unit variance data 3 2 self organizing map som algorithm and parameters a multivariate data analysis using som method is proposed to divide the sample of djf rain event features observed on the stations network during 50 years into clusters in an unsupervised way som method is defined as a neural network algorithm well designed for pattern recognition clustering and dimensionality reduction kohonen 2013 the som algorithm has several advantages that make it a valuable tool in data mining the main one is that it combines the vector quantization and the vector projection the vector quantization divides a dataset into subsets of homogeneous data represented by a prototype vector the prototypes projection and visualization aim to understand the structure of the data to identify the possible clusters structure the som can be applied to a large and complex dataset moreover it is robust to missing data vatanen et al 2015 the som map or kohonen map is a grid of units neurons usually a two dimensional 2d grid where each neuron is associated to a reference vector prototype in the learning data set and thus corresponds to a cluster of rainfall events having common characteristics the neurons are connected and a topological relationship is defined among neighbourhood neurons the som algorithm preserves the topology of the data i e neighbour neurons on the som map are connected to neighbour cluster in the original space haykin 2009 kalteh et al 2008 hannachi 2021 the structure of the som map consists of two layers the input layer contains the prototype reference vector in the input space the output layer is the 2d grid of neurons to match the input vectors to the map neuron the som uses a competitive learning process like the more well known k means algorithm the som algorithm is an iterative two step algorithm the assignment and the update step the assignment step consists in associating each observation with the closest weight vector or best matching unit bmu then the bmu and its neighbors are updated som model is illustrated in fig 4 after the learning process the som mapping quality needs to be evaluated therefore two quantitative measures that are generally adopted are taken here the average quantization error qe and topographic error te the qe gives the average distance between the rainfall events and the prototype that represents them te evaluates the topology preservation indeed it is defined as the average geometric distance between the first and second best matching units in the som if the units are neighbors we consider that the topology has been preserved for the considered input otherwise it is an error te is given by dividing the total number of errors by the number of inputs som algorithm parameters especially map dimension neighborhood radius σ and iterations number must be chosen carefully because bad choices can lead to inconsistent results after studying the effect of changing these parameters on the map quality the adopted parameters for the training step are listed in table 3 in many cases when a high number of map units is used a second classification step is required to ensure an accurate delimitation of clusters on the som map vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 in the literature the hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac is commonly combined with som in different contexts for example gueye et al 2010 study the meteorological regime in senegal for the summer monsoon season on synoptic scales yahi et al 2013 cluster meteorological situations provided by meteorological model outputs during summers in the northern france region dilmi et al 2017 classify rain events observed at very high resolution in palaiseau region of paris el hourany et al 2021 provide a robust decomposition of mediterranean into bio regions using remote sensing observations this som hac procedure exposed in these different studies have shown the relevance of the combined som hac approach to extract information on spatial and temporal variability from multivariate datasets these studies in various application domains have in common to deal with data of geophysical nature and which present a significant natural hazard this two level approach som hac is equally adopted in this study indeed som ensures a first clustering and a visual inspection of the rainfall features as a first step this step reduces the djf season number where seasons with similar rainfall event properties are grouped and represented by a single more significant prototype season the hierarchical clustering is used to cluster the map units into a fewer number of classes see flowchart fig 5 3 3 hierarchical clustering analysis the hierarchical clustering procedure starts by calculating the interpoint matrix proximity between all singleton clusters vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 to merge two clusters different types of linkage criteria can be used ward s linkage distance ward 1963 is used here because of its ability to minimize the total within cluster variance or error sum square murtagh and legendre 2014 the hierarchical clustering produces a tree based representation named dendrogram that highlights the hierarchical links between different clusters the dendrogram is composed of root merging nodes and branches the root is linked to the whole dataset the merging node reflects the distance between the two merged clusters the height of the branches corresponds to the increase in the interclass inertia caused by the merger and the greater the branches height the more dissimilar are the merged clusters cutting the dendrogram at different levels gives a different partitioning husson et al 2010 in general we tend to cut the tree where the branches are longer sometimes and depending on dendrogram shape it is not obvious to make a decision about cluster number to ensure the robustness of the results we can use other visually based techniques or numerical criteria 3 4 data image several methods have been proposed in the literature to estimate the number of clusters such as the gap statistic tibshirani et al 2001 and the silhouette kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 here we use a different method based on data visualization known as data image ling 1973 minnotte and west 1999 data image is a visually based exploratory tool of clustering it consists on transforming a multivariate data set n observations x p variables into a two dimensional image indicating by colors or gray scale the magnitude of each variable for each observation martinez and martinez 2005 the data can also be visualized based on a similarity dissimilarity measure such as euclidean distance and transformed into an inter point distance matrix this matrix reflects the closeness within the original high dimensional space and can also be presented as a data image where each pixel represents the distance between any pair of observations the data can be rearranged in different ways to achieve better contrasts minnotte and west 1999 proposed several approaches of hierarchical clustering to reorder the columns and rows of the inter point distance matrix enabling clusters to emerge and be discerned along the diagonal of the data image hannachi et al 2011 used this method for an application to the stratospheric polar vortex and hannachi 2012 for jet stream analysis one of the main characteristic features of data image is that one can use the human natural skill of pattern recognition to determine the likely number of clusters the methodology proposed in this section is summarized in the flowchart in fig 5 4 results 4 1 descriptive statistics of djf rainfall features for each of the 3500 djf 50 years of observations at 70 stations the six features characteristic of rain events structure previously described table 2 are computed year by year boxplot visualization is adopted here to analyse the samples of the generated variables in fig 6 and fig 7 for a given year the singular realization or outlier is plotted as individual point presenting the observation outside 1 5 times the interquartile range above the 25th percentiles q 1 and below 75th percentile q 3 q 1 1 5 q 3 q 1 or q 3 1 5 q 3 q 1 for each feature the median green line and the interval μ 2 σ where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the variable are also plotted to identify the exceptional years seasons in fig 6a the boxplots of event number ne show a negative skewness median close to the third quartile the ne median varies from 5 to 12 events season and the lowest value is recorded in 1995 season moreover the outliers red crosses are not very frequent which reflect a low inter station variability of the event number variable in fig 6b the boxplots of nd show prominent positive skewness median close to the first quartile for this variable the significant number of outliers especially in the last decades indicates the high inter station variability the median of rainy days number shows non negligeable inter annual variability some years have medians particularly high close to the upper control limit μ 2 σ 40 days see for example 1973 and 2003 others have a number of rainy days particularly low close to μ 2 σ limit about 15 days e g 1977 1980 1988 1995 2002 there is also a weak signal of a 5 yr period however the analysis of the inter annual signal and its drivers is beyond the scope of this study the graph of seasonal accumulation ct fig 6c shows a median close to the first quartile for most years reflecting again positive skewness overall the ct median varies between about 100 and 300 mm the 25th and 75th percentiles vary respectively from 33 to 478 mm extremes outliers occur quite frequently in all seasons years without exception the ct boxplots allow to identify the wettest seasons e g 1964 1971 and 2003 where the median is close to the μ 2 σ limit about 400 mm and also the driest seasons e g 1960 1980 2000 and 2002 the boxplots of event structure variables the mean accumulation ca e and duration da e per event are represented respectively in fig 7a and fig 7b the mean event accumulation graph fig 7a shows positive skewness the median varies between 7 and 36 mm event for some stations average event accumulation exceeds 200 mm event see for example 2003 and 2009 the graph of the mean duration of event da e fig 8b shows a low inter annual variability where the median is mostly between 2 and 4 days event the singular values refer to stations with particular long events during the season where the mean event duration can reach 15 days event e g 1990 in the opposite case the seasonal mean duration can be very small 1 day event in some stations see for example the 1983 and 1992 years the analysis of the boxplots related to the average accumulation per rainy day ca d fig 7 c shows that the median varies from year to year between 3 7 and 10 2 mm day the highest medians are recorded in 1971 1985 2004 and 2006 with about 10 mm day some seasons have extremely low median below the lower control limit 5 mm day such as 1976 1986 2000 and 2002 one of the main conclusions that can be drawn from fig 6 and fig 7 is that the wettest seasons seems to result from a few long and intense rainy events rather than accumulation of a large number of weak events for example the high seasonal accumulation ct in 1964 and 2003 corresponds to a relatively high rainy days number and a medium events number otherwise there are a number of years with exceptionally high values of rainy days nd e g 1990 which exceeds 70 in a given station but without particularly exceptional seasonal accumulation ct i e frequent rains with very small amounts moreover the distribution shown in ct graph indicates that the majority of stations have low accumulated rainfall amounts and a large part of the study area is considered a little dry 4 2 kohonen map analysis to analyse the feature matrix previously obtained we first use som map fig 8 displays the mapping obtained by som using the parameters of table 3 and shows the projection of the 6 variables on the topological map and the corresponding u matrix fig 8a observation number by units fig 8b and the neurons classification fig 8c the fig 8b shows that after training the number of observations represented by each neuron is between 0 and 20 the color coverage in fig 8b reflects the number of observations by each neuron only 2 of the neurons are empty i e they don t represent any data from the feature space the u matrix fig 8a first row and column enables understanding and interpretation of the structure of the original data as it represents distances between adjacent neurons the green and yellow colored neurons represent high values and signify that the weight vectors of the units are distant from each other thus u matrix fig 8a shows a distinctive region located in the bottom right corner with higher values than in the other parts of the map the color contrasts in fig 8a reflect the values of the rainfall features at each neuron the analysis of prototype variables on the topological map shows that som map is organized along several lines directions a diagonal starting from the upper left corner lowest values to the bottom right corner highest values as shown for the values of ct and ca e a gradient going from top to bottom for the nd and da e a gradient going from left to right according to the average accumulation per rainy day ca d the number of events ne fig 8a row 1 column 2 on the other hand has a more complex structure note that the seasons with particularly high number of events are situated on the left hand side of the map and correspond to low values of the ca e fig 8a row 2 column 2 the average duration da e fig 8a row 3 column 1 of events for those seasons is also low these seasons are composed of frequent short events with a low rainfall intensity the seasons with particularly low number of events correspond to low number of rainy days nd and are located at the top of the nd map the average accumulation and the average duration per event for those seasons are also low these correspond precisely to dry seasons with few short and low intensity rainfall events the similarity between the seasonal accumulation ct and the average accumulation per event ca e indicates that the djf season is influenced more by the intensity of rainfall events than by their number the seasons with the highest event number do not necessarily correspond to the seasons with the highest rainfall accumulation the very high values for the number of rainy days nd at the bottom and slightly to the right of nd map fig 8a row1 column 3 correspond to rainfall patterns with low seasonal accumulation ct low average accumulation per rainy day ca d and low number of events ne but with particularly high average event duration da e fig 8a row 3 column 1 the seasons associated to these neurons are characterized by intermittency at the event scale and quite low daily rainfall the seasons represented by the neurons in the upper right corner of ca d map fig 8a row 2 column 3 are dry with respect to the map of ct and are characterized by a few short and intense events the average accumulation per rainy day ca d may have significant values in dry or wet seasons because it depends mainly on the number of rainy days nd in fact this part of the map represents seasons with seasonal accumulation ct between around 100 and 300 mm distributed over a very low number of rainy days nd less than about 10 days per season 4 3 hac and data image results the neurons are aggregated into a number of clusters using the hac the obtained dendrogram based on ward s algorithm is presented in fig 9a and shows the links between the 320 neurones the vertical axis represents the inertia or dissimilarity between vectors different numbers of clusters are obtained by cutting through the tree and the number of clusters corresponds to the number of branches cut the green black and red lines show different cutting levels in the dendrogram and yields respectively to 2 3 and 4 clusters the data image is applied to the dissimilarity matrix of the weight vectors fig 9b the colors refer to the pairwise distance between weight vectors where the dark blue color represents proximity closeness and red and brighter color represents distance remoteness fig 9b shows closeness and remoteness over the whole topological domain the main diagonal line is obvious in the figure and represents the zero value now the values positions in the dissimilarity matrix can be reordered after the application of a classification algorithm e g hierarchical clustering here and the different clusters appear as blocs on the main diagonal fig 9c fig 9d and fig 9e show the dissimilarity matrix organized into two three and four classes respectively the blocs observed along the diagonal of each image represent the clusters and their size reflects the clusters size the color contrasts outside the blocs represent the inter class distances and therefore the stronger the contrast the better the clustering note that in those three figures the axes are not labelled because the order is fixed by the clusters fig 9c shows two clusters with two blocs along the main diagonal with the bigger cluster located in the top left corner however for the smaller cluster a kind of heterogeneity still remains and can be observed when comparing the colour intensity between the two diagonal blocs this means that this cluster is not homogeneous and may contain elements that could belong to other groups in the three cluster hypothesis the small class in fig 9c is now split into two clusters of different size fig 9d in the assumption of four clusters shown in fig 9e the bigger cluster of fig 9c is now split into two clusters along the diagonal the four classes can be clearly distinguished even though the contrast between the two upper diagonal blocs and their off diagonal blocs is not very strong with the assumption of an extra cluster the five class model not shown results in splitting the bigger class of fig 9c into three clusters but these are no longer discerned in the data image with larger number of clusters the discernability is completely lost thus the combination of the dendrogram and the data image analysis favors a partition into three or four clusters although the three class model is equally likely given the good contrast obtained in fig 9d we will focus the discussion here on the four class model in order to take into account the nuance that exists in the large class of fig 9c the clusters can be easily identified on the topological map as the latter is based on proximity in fact fig 8c shows the repartition of the four clusters on the som map obtained by the hac 4 4 class control factors the conditional histograms of the six rainfall descriptors for each of the four previously selected classes are illustrated in fig 10 the mean and the standard deviation std of each feature are equally showed in the same figure note that the four clusters have not the same observation number the cluster identification is based on the observation of the colors of clusters neurons on each rainfall feature map mentioned in fig 8a in combination of distributions illustrated in fig 10 by histogram presentation cluster 1 shown in the top of the topological som map fig 8c is the most populated with about 47 of all seasons it is characterized by a low to medium number of rainy days nd low seasonal rainfall ct between about 100 and 200 mm and low average accumulation per event ca e fig 10 first column class 1 has the lowest mode for ne 8 events nd 20 days ct 100 mm and da e 2 days event this class is typical it represents dry seasons with short and weak rainfall events cluster 2 shown in the central left part of fig 8c is about 20 of all seasons fig 8c this class is characterized by a low average accumulation per rainy day ca d low number of rainy days nd and low mean event duration da e in addition it has low seasonal accumulation ct and low average accumulations per event ca e overall class 2 has almost similar statistics men and std in fig 10 to class 1 with a difference in the distribution in some features indeed class 2 has higher mode for ne 10 events nd 30 days ct 200 mm than class 1 the distribution of the features shows that this cluster is a representative of dry seasons with weak and intermittent events over the season cluster 3 fig 8c is about 25 of size the mean values of each features show that this class represents intermediate situations with a medium amount of rain and intermittent events it is characterized by medium to strong seasonal accumulation ct between about 200 and 500 mm and an average accumulation per event ca e between about 20 and 60 mm event which is considered to be medium to high compared to classes 1 and 2 fig 10 third column the average accumulation per rainy day ca d has a broad distribution the event number varies mostly between 8 and 12 but can reach 15 occasionally the number of rainy days nd for this class is also high between about 30 and 60 days with medium average event duration da e in general this class shares the intermittent character with class 2 which has the same mode for ne 10 events however it shows wetter conditions than the two first classes with higher mode for nd 35 days ca e 50 mm event ct 300 mm ca d 8 mm day and da e 4 days event cluster 4 situated in the lower right corner of the som map fig 8c is the less frequent with about 7 of all seasons it is characterized by a very high seasonal rainfall ct and also high average accumulation per event ca e the majority of the seasons in this class reaches a record seasonal rainfall ct between about 500 and 1000 mm and exceeds 1300 mm in some stations fig 10 last column it is also characterized by a medium event number and high number of rainy days nd the average event duration is high greater than 4 days per event and the average accumulation per rainy day is also high compared to the remaining classes as it exceeds 30 mm day this class represents the rainiest seasons with long and intense events this class is mainly located in the extreme northwestern part of the domain represented mostly by station s02 ain drahem if the three clusters hypothesis is adopted the very dry and the dry seasons clusters 1 and 2 merge into one single cluster with about 67 of all seasons those clusters share almost the same seasonal accumulation ct and average event accumulation ca e with a large difference in event frequency and intensity the clusters 3 and 4 remain unchanged 4 5 spatio temporal variability of classes fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the different classes for each station a pie chart is used showing the percentages of each class for the observed period the classes occurrence for each station shows a high variability between the north western part and the remaining parts of the region indeed all stations in humid region bleu and about 40 of stations from the sub humid region are dominated by classes 3 and 4 the percentage of wet class 3 very wet class 4 seasons exceeds 50 the occurrence of these classes is about 68 of the time on the other hand the southern sector is dominated by the dry and very dry classes i e classes 2 and 1 respectively approximately 88 of the time the very wet seasons with intense events of class 4 occur very rarely in this sector over the 50 years of the record the two regions are separated by the red dashed line in fig 11 in the remaining part of the paper we set out to analyse the temporal evolution of the cluster size in the two sectors separately the northwestern wet sector contains 18 stations dominated by classes 3 and 4 50 of the time fig 11 whereas the southern dry sector contains 52 stations dominated by classes 1 and 2 50 of the time fig 11 the temporal variability is analysed using non overlapping 10 year periods 5 decades table 4 shows the percentage of each class by sector in the non overlapping 10 year periods class 1 shows high percentage during the nineties for both sectors this period can be classified as a dry decade class 2 characterized by frequent events and low rainfall accumulation was quite frequent in the 1980 s in the southern sector and in the 1970 s for the north western sector class 3 populates mostly the northwestern sector it shows particularly high occurrence frequency in the 1960 s the last cluster which is the wettest is exclusively prominent in the north western sector this class was a little more frequent during the 2000 s the summarizing result of this cluster size variability shows that over the entire observation period the lack of enough rainfall remains the dominant aspect of the region which extends over about three consecutive decades from 1970 to 2000 also the inter decadal evolution of the rainfall regime between the two sectors is slightly different 5 discussion in the miet determination the significance of autocorrelation is evaluated consistent with the synoptic timescale in the latitudes of the mediterranean region indeed typical cyclone s life cycle growth maturity and decay of the mid latitude cyclones and their associated fronts is about 2 3 days in some favorable and special conditions cyclone can reach maturity in one day zappa et al 2015 however this rapid storm intensification is not very frequent also there are cyclones that persist longer than three days hakim and patoux 2018 because of the peculiar features of the mediterranean region such as its complex orography and topography and the high convective and mesoscale activity the lifecycle of the storm can be affected and reduced therefore smaller miet 2 days is more suitable to separate independent rain events in northern tunisia the large difference between the classes of the north and the south sectors could be explained by geographic and orographic factors indeed northern tunisia is located in the extension of the atlas mountain ranges with south west north east orientation the tell atlas extends over the northernmost coast of tunisia fig 1 and forms a kind of barrier against the westerly and especially the north westerly flow which brings most of the winter precipitation and generates more seasons of class 3 and class 4 ben boubaker 2003 merzougui and slimani 2012 thus the existing reliefs e g mogods and kroumirie mountains act to shadow the southern sector and reduce precipitation hence the dominance of class 1 and class 2 the continentality of the western part of the southern sector combined with its position between the tell atlas and saharan atlas fig 1 make the driest conditions with exceptional occurrence of class 1 in this region except some local variability due to high altitude of a number of stations such as s65 sakiet sidi youssef 803 m s66 ain zeligua 853 m s53 saadia bargou 524 m the stations located near the eastern coast show more variability compared to the western one class 3 and 2 are more frequent for the same sector indeed this region is influenced by the northeasterly flow coming from the european continent bringing moderate weak amount of precipitation ben boubaker 2003 overall the exposure of stations to different incoming flows combined with some local factors such as high altitude existing of forests and proximity to a moisture source generates more rainfall events hence relatively wet seasons 6 conclusions this paper investigates the temporal and spatial variability of a 50 year long data set of rainfall events in the winter season djf in northern tunisia the data used consist of observed rainfall time series taken from 70 rain gauge stations during djf 1960 2009 the analysis begins by changing daily rainfall to a sequence of djf rainfall events and then to seasonal djf features these features are clustered using a two level approach the som combined with hierarchical clustering the obtained clusters are identified and their space time regionalization is carried out each class characterizes the rain event types and take into account the rain intermittent character at both seasonal and event scales the rainfall regime was found overall to be dominated by classes describing drought lack of rain and intermittent weak events spatially each station is characterized by a specific distribution of the four clusters over the 50 year period the spatial regionalization showed that the study area is broadly divided into two sectors a wet sector in the north especially in the northwest and a dry sector in the south this result is in accordance with previous studies jebari et al 2007 merzougui and slimani 2012 fathalli et al 2018 the analysis carried out of the time variability of the cluster size for both sectors using non overlapping periods of 10 years shows that dry conditions dominate and extend over three consecutive decades from 1970 to 2000 however in the last decade 2000 2009 the winter season was particularly very wet with frequent rainy seasons especially in the northern sector the analysis of rainfall by considering intermittent phenomena and studying events structure enables a better understanding of the rainfall patterns this can also help identify the various types of seasons by taking into account other rainfall aspects such as the seasonal number of events their intensity and duration the method presented here is quite general as it is based on rainfall features and hence can be applied in other climatic regions such as the tropics or high latitudes further analysis is required to make the method more universal for instance the sensitivity to the choice of miet and equally the choice of threshold to define a rainy day and its impact are important topics for investigation this study must be complemented by a study of the relationship between the rainy season structure analysed here and the climate pattern the analysis of these complex and non linear relationships will make it possible to anticipate the impact of large scale climate variability on hydrology or agriculture the preliminary ongoing analysis gives some small but significant correlations between the rainfall features and climatic pattern over such as the arctic oscillation ao and the north atlantic oscillation nao indeed nao pattern is considered one of the recurrent and most prominent atmospheric patterns especially during the winter season that affects most of the northern hemisphere especially europe north africa and the mediterranean it is a see saw that acts to redistribute atmospheric mass between the icelandic region and the subtropical atlantic wanner et al 2001 during the negative nao phase the jet stream is positioned south of its climatological position and brings warmer and wetter than average conditions over the mediterranean and northern africa region during the positive phase the conditions are dryer and colder than average hurrell 1995 the correlation analysis is just preliminary results however the main objective of the research is to elaborate the relationships between the obtained typology of rainy seasons and the typology of climatic patterns credit authorship

7924,study region the study is carried out for northern tunisia study focus precipitations are often analysed via intensity or accumulation for a specified timescale e g annual seasonal etc we propose in this study to analyse regional rainfall variability by adopting a variable time step through the rain event concept this event based approach ensures the integration of information related to rain intermittency which is one of the fundamental properties of precipitations this study focuses essentially on wet spells characteristics derived from the aggregation of daily winter dataset over a 50 years period 1960 2009 the multivariate analysis based on the combination of two clustering approaches i e self organizing map and hierarchical clustering allows the identification of different rainfall regimes this study helps to understand rainfall variability patterns and to address rainfall regionalization and water use management issues new hydrological insights for the region the winter precipitations of northern tunisia are classified into 4 typical situations extremely dry seasons with a few short and weak rainfall events dry seasons with high frequency of weak events intermediate seasons with medium amount of rain and intermittent events and rainiest seasons with long and intense events the regionalization yields two geographical regions northern sector characterized by rainy seasons whereas the stations of the southern sector are mostly dry the temporal variability analysis shows that the dry season classes dominate extending over three consecutive

hac hierarchical agglomerative clustering miet minimum inter event time djf december january february 1 introduction the precipitation pattern in the mediterranean area is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability this variability prominent between 30 n and 45 n is directly controlled by the subtropical high and mid latitude low pressure systems rysman et al 2013 these are at the origin of extreme events e g drought or extreme precipitation and can result in natural disasters such as loss of human lives and damage to infrastructure livestock and environment tunisia is situated in the northern tip of africa and extends between latitudes 30 38 n this latitude band is considered as a climatic transition zone between the temperate mid latitude zone north of the mediterranean and the north african subtropical zone slimani et al 2007 in addition to its latitudinal position the particular geography of the area including the topography and the proximity to the mediterranean sea affect the atmospheric circulation and can accentuate the rainfall variability in this region jebari et al 2007 with the observed current climate change and the increase in water needs there s a growing concern about the possibility of an increase in the likelihood of drought and or floods and their increasing and amplifying impacts norrant and douguedroit 2006 xoplaki et al 2006 tramblay et al 2013 2020 schilling et al 2020 analysing rainfall variability in tunisia potentially exposed to climate variability and change has been one of the most challenging subjects for hydrologists over the past 30 years kebaili bargaoui 1989 and bargaoui 1994 analysed annual rainfall series of the medjerda basin using the surplus deficit method runs and frequency analysis by means of the weibull distribution in order to identify drought years drought occurrence in tunisia over a period of 88 years was also investigated using annual rainfall series by benzarti and habaieb 2001 spatial regionalization of monthly precipitation in northern tunisia was analysed based on the station s topography indices jedidi et al 2008 and univariate frequency analysis benzarti 2003 merzougui and slimani 2012 tramblay et al 2019 analysed the variability of rainfall on five days resolution in tunisia with different interpolation methods a time dependent two state markov chain was calibrated for grand tunis region by bargaoui 1983 using copula approach gargouri ellouze and bargaoui 2009 analysed 5 minute resolution rainfall series to study the relationship between the intensity of the rainfall event and the hydrological response of the watershed as represented by infiltration index ghanmi et al 2013 2016 analysed rain series with high temporal resolution 5 min to build intensity duration frequency curves for several stations distributed in the north of tunisia using the multifractal approach in this paper we focus on northern tunisia a large data set of rain gauge measurements from a relatively large network 70 rain gauges in an area of about 28 000 km2 provides daily accumulation series over sufficiently long periods 50 years for the proposed study daily rainfall data are aggregated into rainy and no rainy spells during a given season this event based approach with a variable time step or the event duration ensures the integration of information related to the intermittency of precipitating processes in the other side a given monthly or seasonal accumulation may correspond to a multitude of low intensity events or to a single very intense event most of regional studies mentioned earlier based on rain gauge network observations provide hourly daily monthly yearly statistics with an estimation of intensity duration frequency curves idf or intensity duration area frequency curves idaf the choice of the times step is a critical point indeed precipitations are characterized by a high variability and intermittency in temporal or spatial domain verrier et al 2011 akrour et al 2015 when large time step is considered the distinction between the rainy period and the dry period is not possible and the cumulative precipitation values are strongly smoothed and do not reflect the natural variability of rainfall on the other hand a too fast sampling rate leads to sampling errors especially when using tipping bucket rain gauges the bucket volume of the tipping bucket rain gauge corresponds to an equivalent rain height h 0 2 or h 0 5 mm overall precipitations have a complex structure over a range of time and space scales that need to be equally highlighted at daily temporal resolution the day to day rainfall variability is characterized by dry and wet periods possessing different properties the extraction of rainfall event properties e g frequency duration and the intensity ensures a better characterization of the rainy season by taking into account additional rainfall aspects equally important rather than the amounts of precipitation for example the rainfall event number over a given season reflects the intermittent character which represents a fundamental property of precipitation in addition the average duration and average accumulation of rainfall events over the rainy season indicate the behavior of wet spells understanding the variability of rainfall event features is crucial for effective management of water resources especially when the economy of the region is highly dependent on agriculture production such as tunisia for the rainfed agriculture and depending to the season the rain event characteristics number intensity and duration may play an important role in determining the quality and quantity of crops the importance of event based rainfall analysis is not limited to the agriculture however the identification of the season typology and the characterization of rainfall event can have a direct influence on runoff processes horizontal flows infiltration and sol humidity moreover the proposed study may contribute in a future step to the establishment of a synoptic hydro climatic reference the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the study area and rain stations characteristics section 3 discusses the methodology used for clustering analysis section 4 provides results followed by the discussion in section 5 and a conclusion is given in the last section 2 study area and dataset description northern tunisia is located between 35 n and 38 n and covers a total area of about 28 641 km² fig 1 it is characterized by dry hot summers and moist cool winters we adopt emberger bioclimatic index emberger 1930 which is specific to bioclimatic classification in the mediterranean region and is based on the total annual rainfall as well as the daily average maximum temperature of the hottest month and the daily average minimum temperature of the coldest month marres 1972 accordingly northern tunisia is divided into three major bioclimatic regions humid h in the extreme northwest sub humid sh and semi arid sa in the other parts representing respectively 12 5 28 and 59 5 of the study area fig 1 in tunisia rainfall is influenced by general atmospheric circulation patterns the most important are 1 the icelandic depression 2 western mediterranean depressions the gulf of balearic depression and the gulf of genoa depression 3 eastern mediterranean depressions gulfs of syrtes depression and gabes depressions 4 the azores anticyclone and 5 the central european anticyclone merzougui and slimani 2012 in addition to regional factors rainfall is affected by local factors such as marine influences continentality topographic conditions and especially the reliefs indeed the general orientation of the reliefs tell atlas and saharan atlas fig 1 have an important role to weaken or strengthen storms coming from different directions slimani et al 2007 particularly the precipitation regime in northern tunisia is strongly influenced by northerly and especially northwesterly flow bringing winter storms and precipitation from the north ben boubaker 2003 xoplaki et al 2004 brandimarte et al 2011 and jelassi et al 2016 there is also the northeasterly flow which brings rainfall from the european continent daily rainfall series are used which are collected from 70 rainfall stations well distributed in the study region fig 1 over the period 1960 2009 the database is obtained from the general directorate of water resources of the agriculture and water resources ministry table 1 displays the rainfall stations characteristics including the geographic position elevation starting date of observations percentage of missing values december january february djf totals and the bioclimatic region the dataset consists of 3500 djf seasons 50 years of observations at 70 stations corresponding to 31 5910 observed days for a given year any missing value detected in the djf daily observations leads to the exclusion of the whole season from the analysis the number of considered seasons for each station is mentioned in table 1 in total the number of seasons without missing values is 3137 note that djf for year m corresponds to december of year m 1 and january february of year m 3 methodology the objective of the event based approach is to understand the rainfall structure and characterize its spatio temporal variability with respect to event spells descriptors estimating key descriptors of a rainfall season on the basis of rainfall spells may be prominent for specific applications e g agriculture ecology climate change erosion water resource management etc this study is limited to the winter season djf the choice of this season is motivated by the highest amount of precipitation recorded during the djf season and also by the cyclonic nature of winter rainfall which allows the definition of independent event in relation with cyclone lifecycle at a synoptic scale 3 1 definition of rainfall events and data transformation the definition of rainfall event is based on the separation of dry and wet spells there is not a unique way to achieve event delimitation in the literature researchers tend in general to choose a minimum inter event time miet which is the smallest duration of dry period separating two independent rainy periods dunkerley 2008 molina sanchis et al 2016 dilmi et al 2017 parchure and gedam 2019 this approach is adopted in the present study some studies consider the hydrological conditions e g the soil surface seals soil wetness and the event runoff to estimate the miet cattan et al 2006 joo et al 2014 moreover there are other statistical approaches based only on the rainfall time series such as the autocorrelation analysis or the exponential method wenzel and voorhees 1981 restrepo posada 1982 asquith et al 2005 the autocorrelation analysis is based on choosing the time lag on which the autocorrelation coefficient of the rainfall data set converges to zero this approach is used here to analyse the 50 year djf daily precipitations for each of the 70 stations note that all days with a rainfall amount greater than zero are considered a rainy day the minimum rainfall value recorded in the daily timeseries is 0 1 mm day unlike several studies e g jiang et al 2011 days with small rainfall amount or drizzles 1 mm day are not considered as dry days in our study indeed the inclusion of low rainfall events can provide a better characterization of the rainfall intermittency and the events typology over the season in addition and for the adopted event scale the same rainfall event may include a dry day or days with drizzles therefore fixing a threshold may affect the intra event variability and allows the split of the one single event into separate events as shown in fig 2 the blue and red curves represent respectively the median and the mean of autocorrelation values for 1 day lag to 5 day lags the two horizontal lines show the approximate 95 confidence intervals for a white noise process the two curves decrease and cut the horizontal line critical level between 2 and 3 days from 3 day lags and beyond the mean and the median are no longer significant therefore the miet is of the order of 2 3 days the proposed analysis is based on the use of a fixed miet for all stations thus we choose to fix miet to two days this choice avoids the creation of intensive intra event gaps of larger miet fig 3 illustrates an example in which a fictive 18 day period is separated into three events using the two day miet as shown in fig 3 this miet choice results in one event representing an isolated day event 1 another with several consecutive days event 2 and another consisting in several days with a one day break event 3 once the miet is defined six descriptors features are selected to characterize the analysed djf season table 2 the first three features are 1 the number of events per season ne 2 the number of rainy days per season nd and 3 the seasonal cumulative rainfall ct table 2 these three features help to identify the overall rainfall characteristics of the season considering the event scale on the basis of the event number per season we have defined 4 the average accumulation per event ca e and 5 the average event duration da e based on the number of rainy days for a given season we also defined 6 the average accumulation per rainy day per season ca d which is assumed as an indicator of the intensity of the season thus with these six features we enable characterization of the rain events type and the quality of rainfall during the season the transformed dataset is then presented in the form of an observation matrix where each row corresponds to a djf season in a given station and the columns are the adopted characteristics of rain events over the djf season these six variables have different units and therefore different scales in order to give equal weights to the data for the further analysis a normalisation is applied to yield zero mean and unit variance data 3 2 self organizing map som algorithm and parameters a multivariate data analysis using som method is proposed to divide the sample of djf rain event features observed on the stations network during 50 years into clusters in an unsupervised way som method is defined as a neural network algorithm well designed for pattern recognition clustering and dimensionality reduction kohonen 2013 the som algorithm has several advantages that make it a valuable tool in data mining the main one is that it combines the vector quantization and the vector projection the vector quantization divides a dataset into subsets of homogeneous data represented by a prototype vector the prototypes projection and visualization aim to understand the structure of the data to identify the possible clusters structure the som can be applied to a large and complex dataset moreover it is robust to missing data vatanen et al 2015 the som map or kohonen map is a grid of units neurons usually a two dimensional 2d grid where each neuron is associated to a reference vector prototype in the learning data set and thus corresponds to a cluster of rainfall events having common characteristics the neurons are connected and a topological relationship is defined among neighbourhood neurons the som algorithm preserves the topology of the data i e neighbour neurons on the som map are connected to neighbour cluster in the original space haykin 2009 kalteh et al 2008 hannachi 2021 the structure of the som map consists of two layers the input layer contains the prototype reference vector in the input space the output layer is the 2d grid of neurons to match the input vectors to the map neuron the som uses a competitive learning process like the more well known k means algorithm the som algorithm is an iterative two step algorithm the assignment and the update step the assignment step consists in associating each observation with the closest weight vector or best matching unit bmu then the bmu and its neighbors are updated som model is illustrated in fig 4 after the learning process the som mapping quality needs to be evaluated therefore two quantitative measures that are generally adopted are taken here the average quantization error qe and topographic error te the qe gives the average distance between the rainfall events and the prototype that represents them te evaluates the topology preservation indeed it is defined as the average geometric distance between the first and second best matching units in the som if the units are neighbors we consider that the topology has been preserved for the considered input otherwise it is an error te is given by dividing the total number of errors by the number of inputs som algorithm parameters especially map dimension neighborhood radius σ and iterations number must be chosen carefully because bad choices can lead to inconsistent results after studying the effect of changing these parameters on the map quality the adopted parameters for the training step are listed in table 3 in many cases when a high number of map units is used a second classification step is required to ensure an accurate delimitation of clusters on the som map vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 in the literature the hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac is commonly combined with som in different contexts for example gueye et al 2010 study the meteorological regime in senegal for the summer monsoon season on synoptic scales yahi et al 2013 cluster meteorological situations provided by meteorological model outputs during summers in the northern france region dilmi et al 2017 classify rain events observed at very high resolution in palaiseau region of paris el hourany et al 2021 provide a robust decomposition of mediterranean into bio regions using remote sensing observations this som hac procedure exposed in these different studies have shown the relevance of the combined som hac approach to extract information on spatial and temporal variability from multivariate datasets these studies in various application domains have in common to deal with data of geophysical nature and which present a significant natural hazard this two level approach som hac is equally adopted in this study indeed som ensures a first clustering and a visual inspection of the rainfall features as a first step this step reduces the djf season number where seasons with similar rainfall event properties are grouped and represented by a single more significant prototype season the hierarchical clustering is used to cluster the map units into a fewer number of classes see flowchart fig 5 3 3 hierarchical clustering analysis the hierarchical clustering procedure starts by calculating the interpoint matrix proximity between all singleton clusters vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 to merge two clusters different types of linkage criteria can be used ward s linkage distance ward 1963 is used here because of its ability to minimize the total within cluster variance or error sum square murtagh and legendre 2014 the hierarchical clustering produces a tree based representation named dendrogram that highlights the hierarchical links between different clusters the dendrogram is composed of root merging nodes and branches the root is linked to the whole dataset the merging node reflects the distance between the two merged clusters the height of the branches corresponds to the increase in the interclass inertia caused by the merger and the greater the branches height the more dissimilar are the merged clusters cutting the dendrogram at different levels gives a different partitioning husson et al 2010 in general we tend to cut the tree where the branches are longer sometimes and depending on dendrogram shape it is not obvious to make a decision about cluster number to ensure the robustness of the results we can use other visually based techniques or numerical criteria 3 4 data image several methods have been proposed in the literature to estimate the number of clusters such as the gap statistic tibshirani et al 2001 and the silhouette kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 here we use a different method based on data visualization known as data image ling 1973 minnotte and west 1999 data image is a visually based exploratory tool of clustering it consists on transforming a multivariate data set n observations x p variables into a two dimensional image indicating by colors or gray scale the magnitude of each variable for each observation martinez and martinez 2005 the data can also be visualized based on a similarity dissimilarity measure such as euclidean distance and transformed into an inter point distance matrix this matrix reflects the closeness within the original high dimensional space and can also be presented as a data image where each pixel represents the distance between any pair of observations the data can be rearranged in different ways to achieve better contrasts minnotte and west 1999 proposed several approaches of hierarchical clustering to reorder the columns and rows of the inter point distance matrix enabling clusters to emerge and be discerned along the diagonal of the data image hannachi et al 2011 used this method for an application to the stratospheric polar vortex and hannachi 2012 for jet stream analysis one of the main characteristic features of data image is that one can use the human natural skill of pattern recognition to determine the likely number of clusters the methodology proposed in this section is summarized in the flowchart in fig 5 4 results 4 1 descriptive statistics of djf rainfall features for each of the 3500 djf 50 years of observations at 70 stations the six features characteristic of rain events structure previously described table 2 are computed year by year boxplot visualization is adopted here to analyse the samples of the generated variables in fig 6 and fig 7 for a given year the singular realization or outlier is plotted as individual point presenting the observation outside 1 5 times the interquartile range above the 25th percentiles q 1 and below 75th percentile q 3 q 1 1 5 q 3 q 1 or q 3 1 5 q 3 q 1 for each feature the median green line and the interval μ 2 σ where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the variable are also plotted to identify the exceptional years seasons in fig 6a the boxplots of event number ne show a negative skewness median close to the third quartile the ne median varies from 5 to 12 events season and the lowest value is recorded in 1995 season moreover the outliers red crosses are not very frequent which reflect a low inter station variability of the event number variable in fig 6b the boxplots of nd show prominent positive skewness median close to the first quartile for this variable the significant number of outliers especially in the last decades indicates the high inter station variability the median of rainy days number shows non negligeable inter annual variability some years have medians particularly high close to the upper control limit μ 2 σ 40 days see for example 1973 and 2003 others have a number of rainy days particularly low close to μ 2 σ limit about 15 days e g 1977 1980 1988 1995 2002 there is also a weak signal of a 5 yr period however the analysis of the inter annual signal and its drivers is beyond the scope of this study the graph of seasonal accumulation ct fig 6c shows a median close to the first quartile for most years reflecting again positive skewness overall the ct median varies between about 100 and 300 mm the 25th and 75th percentiles vary respectively from 33 to 478 mm extremes outliers occur quite frequently in all seasons years without exception the ct boxplots allow to identify the wettest seasons e g 1964 1971 and 2003 where the median is close to the μ 2 σ limit about 400 mm and also the driest seasons e g 1960 1980 2000 and 2002 the boxplots of event structure variables the mean accumulation ca e and duration da e per event are represented respectively in fig 7a and fig 7b the mean event accumulation graph fig 7a shows positive skewness the median varies between 7 and 36 mm event for some stations average event accumulation exceeds 200 mm event see for example 2003 and 2009 the graph of the mean duration of event da e fig 8b shows a low inter annual variability where the median is mostly between 2 and 4 days event the singular values refer to stations with particular long events during the season where the mean event duration can reach 15 days event e g 1990 in the opposite case the seasonal mean duration can be very small 1 day event in some stations see for example the 1983 and 1992 years the analysis of the boxplots related to the average accumulation per rainy day ca d fig 7 c shows that the median varies from year to year between 3 7 and 10 2 mm day the highest medians are recorded in 1971 1985 2004 and 2006 with about 10 mm day some seasons have extremely low median below the lower control limit 5 mm day such as 1976 1986 2000 and 2002 one of the main conclusions that can be drawn from fig 6 and fig 7 is that the wettest seasons seems to result from a few long and intense rainy events rather than accumulation of a large number of weak events for example the high seasonal accumulation ct in 1964 and 2003 corresponds to a relatively high rainy days number and a medium events number otherwise there are a number of years with exceptionally high values of rainy days nd e g 1990 which exceeds 70 in a given station but without particularly exceptional seasonal accumulation ct i e frequent rains with very small amounts moreover the distribution shown in ct graph indicates that the majority of stations have low accumulated rainfall amounts and a large part of the study area is considered a little dry 4 2 kohonen map analysis to analyse the feature matrix previously obtained we first use som map fig 8 displays the mapping obtained by som using the parameters of table 3 and shows the projection of the 6 variables on the topological map and the corresponding u matrix fig 8a observation number by units fig 8b and the neurons classification fig 8c the fig 8b shows that after training the number of observations represented by each neuron is between 0 and 20 the color coverage in fig 8b reflects the number of observations by each neuron only 2 of the neurons are empty i e they don t represent any data from the feature space the u matrix fig 8a first row and column enables understanding and interpretation of the structure of the original data as it represents distances between adjacent neurons the green and yellow colored neurons represent high values and signify that the weight vectors of the units are distant from each other thus u matrix fig 8a shows a distinctive region located in the bottom right corner with higher values than in the other parts of the map the color contrasts in fig 8a reflect the values of the rainfall features at each neuron the analysis of prototype variables on the topological map shows that som map is organized along several lines directions a diagonal starting from the upper left corner lowest values to the bottom right corner highest values as shown for the values of ct and ca e a gradient going from top to bottom for the nd and da e a gradient going from left to right according to the average accumulation per rainy day ca d the number of events ne fig 8a row 1 column 2 on the other hand has a more complex structure note that the seasons with particularly high number of events are situated on the left hand side of the map and correspond to low values of the ca e fig 8a row 2 column 2 the average duration da e fig 8a row 3 column 1 of events for those seasons is also low these seasons are composed of frequent short events with a low rainfall intensity the seasons with particularly low number of events correspond to low number of rainy days nd and are located at the top of the nd map the average accumulation and the average duration per event for those seasons are also low these correspond precisely to dry seasons with few short and low intensity rainfall events the similarity between the seasonal accumulation ct and the average accumulation per event ca e indicates that the djf season is influenced more by the intensity of rainfall events than by their number the seasons with the highest event number do not necessarily correspond to the seasons with the highest rainfall accumulation the very high values for the number of rainy days nd at the bottom and slightly to the right of nd map fig 8a row1 column 3 correspond to rainfall patterns with low seasonal accumulation ct low average accumulation per rainy day ca d and low number of events ne but with particularly high average event duration da e fig 8a row 3 column 1 the seasons associated to these neurons are characterized by intermittency at the event scale and quite low daily rainfall the seasons represented by the neurons in the upper right corner of ca d map fig 8a row 2 column 3 are dry with respect to the map of ct and are characterized by a few short and intense events the average accumulation per rainy day ca d may have significant values in dry or wet seasons because it depends mainly on the number of rainy days nd in fact this part of the map represents seasons with seasonal accumulation ct between around 100 and 300 mm distributed over a very low number of rainy days nd less than about 10 days per season 4 3 hac and data image results the neurons are aggregated into a number of clusters using the hac the obtained dendrogram based on ward s algorithm is presented in fig 9a and shows the links between the 320 neurones the vertical axis represents the inertia or dissimilarity between vectors different numbers of clusters are obtained by cutting through the tree and the number of clusters corresponds to the number of branches cut the green black and red lines show different cutting levels in the dendrogram and yields respectively to 2 3 and 4 clusters the data image is applied to the dissimilarity matrix of the weight vectors fig 9b the colors refer to the pairwise distance between weight vectors where the dark blue color represents proximity closeness and red and brighter color represents distance remoteness fig 9b shows closeness and remoteness over the whole topological domain the main diagonal line is obvious in the figure and represents the zero value now the values positions in the dissimilarity matrix can be reordered after the application of a classification algorithm e g hierarchical clustering here and the different clusters appear as blocs on the main diagonal fig 9c fig 9d and fig 9e show the dissimilarity matrix organized into two three and four classes respectively the blocs observed along the diagonal of each image represent the clusters and their size reflects the clusters size the color contrasts outside the blocs represent the inter class distances and therefore the stronger the contrast the better the clustering note that in those three figures the axes are not labelled because the order is fixed by the clusters fig 9c shows two clusters with two blocs along the main diagonal with the bigger cluster located in the top left corner however for the smaller cluster a kind of heterogeneity still remains and can be observed when comparing the colour intensity between the two diagonal blocs this means that this cluster is not homogeneous and may contain elements that could belong to other groups in the three cluster hypothesis the small class in fig 9c is now split into two clusters of different size fig 9d in the assumption of four clusters shown in fig 9e the bigger cluster of fig 9c is now split into two clusters along the diagonal the four classes can be clearly distinguished even though the contrast between the two upper diagonal blocs and their off diagonal blocs is not very strong with the assumption of an extra cluster the five class model not shown results in splitting the bigger class of fig 9c into three clusters but these are no longer discerned in the data image with larger number of clusters the discernability is completely lost thus the combination of the dendrogram and the data image analysis favors a partition into three or four clusters although the three class model is equally likely given the good contrast obtained in fig 9d we will focus the discussion here on the four class model in order to take into account the nuance that exists in the large class of fig 9c the clusters can be easily identified on the topological map as the latter is based on proximity in fact fig 8c shows the repartition of the four clusters on the som map obtained by the hac 4 4 class control factors the conditional histograms of the six rainfall descriptors for each of the four previously selected classes are illustrated in fig 10 the mean and the standard deviation std of each feature are equally showed in the same figure note that the four clusters have not the same observation number the cluster identification is based on the observation of the colors of clusters neurons on each rainfall feature map mentioned in fig 8a in combination of distributions illustrated in fig 10 by histogram presentation cluster 1 shown in the top of the topological som map fig 8c is the most populated with about 47 of all seasons it is characterized by a low to medium number of rainy days nd low seasonal rainfall ct between about 100 and 200 mm and low average accumulation per event ca e fig 10 first column class 1 has the lowest mode for ne 8 events nd 20 days ct 100 mm and da e 2 days event this class is typical it represents dry seasons with short and weak rainfall events cluster 2 shown in the central left part of fig 8c is about 20 of all seasons fig 8c this class is characterized by a low average accumulation per rainy day ca d low number of rainy days nd and low mean event duration da e in addition it has low seasonal accumulation ct and low average accumulations per event ca e overall class 2 has almost similar statistics men and std in fig 10 to class 1 with a difference in the distribution in some features indeed class 2 has higher mode for ne 10 events nd 30 days ct 200 mm than class 1 the distribution of the features shows that this cluster is a representative of dry seasons with weak and intermittent events over the season cluster 3 fig 8c is about 25 of size the mean values of each features show that this class represents intermediate situations with a medium amount of rain and intermittent events it is characterized by medium to strong seasonal accumulation ct between about 200 and 500 mm and an average accumulation per event ca e between about 20 and 60 mm event which is considered to be medium to high compared to classes 1 and 2 fig 10 third column the average accumulation per rainy day ca d has a broad distribution the event number varies mostly between 8 and 12 but can reach 15 occasionally the number of rainy days nd for this class is also high between about 30 and 60 days with medium average event duration da e in general this class shares the intermittent character with class 2 which has the same mode for ne 10 events however it shows wetter conditions than the two first classes with higher mode for nd 35 days ca e 50 mm event ct 300 mm ca d 8 mm day and da e 4 days event cluster 4 situated in the lower right corner of the som map fig 8c is the less frequent with about 7 of all seasons it is characterized by a very high seasonal rainfall ct and also high average accumulation per event ca e the majority of the seasons in this class reaches a record seasonal rainfall ct between about 500 and 1000 mm and exceeds 1300 mm in some stations fig 10 last column it is also characterized by a medium event number and high number of rainy days nd the average event duration is high greater than 4 days per event and the average accumulation per rainy day is also high compared to the remaining classes as it exceeds 30 mm day this class represents the rainiest seasons with long and intense events this class is mainly located in the extreme northwestern part of the domain represented mostly by station s02 ain drahem if the three clusters hypothesis is adopted the very dry and the dry seasons clusters 1 and 2 merge into one single cluster with about 67 of all seasons those clusters share almost the same seasonal accumulation ct and average event accumulation ca e with a large difference in event frequency and intensity the clusters 3 and 4 remain unchanged 4 5 spatio temporal variability of classes fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the different classes for each station a pie chart is used showing the percentages of each class for the observed period the classes occurrence for each station shows a high variability between the north western part and the remaining parts of the region indeed all stations in humid region bleu and about 40 of stations from the sub humid region are dominated by classes 3 and 4 the percentage of wet class 3 very wet class 4 seasons exceeds 50 the occurrence of these classes is about 68 of the time on the other hand the southern sector is dominated by the dry and very dry classes i e classes 2 and 1 respectively approximately 88 of the time the very wet seasons with intense events of class 4 occur very rarely in this sector over the 50 years of the record the two regions are separated by the red dashed line in fig 11 in the remaining part of the paper we set out to analyse the temporal evolution of the cluster size in the two sectors separately the northwestern wet sector contains 18 stations dominated by classes 3 and 4 50 of the time fig 11 whereas the southern dry sector contains 52 stations dominated by classes 1 and 2 50 of the time fig 11 the temporal variability is analysed using non overlapping 10 year periods 5 decades table 4 shows the percentage of each class by sector in the non overlapping 10 year periods class 1 shows high percentage during the nineties for both sectors this period can be classified as a dry decade class 2 characterized by frequent events and low rainfall accumulation was quite frequent in the 1980 s in the southern sector and in the 1970 s for the north western sector class 3 populates mostly the northwestern sector it shows particularly high occurrence frequency in the 1960 s the last cluster which is the wettest is exclusively prominent in the north western sector this class was a little more frequent during the 2000 s the summarizing result of this cluster size variability shows that over the entire observation period the lack of enough rainfall remains the dominant aspect of the region which extends over about three consecutive decades from 1970 to 2000 also the inter decadal evolution of the rainfall regime between the two sectors is slightly different 5 discussion in the miet determination the significance of autocorrelation is evaluated consistent with the synoptic timescale in the latitudes of the mediterranean region indeed typical cyclone s life cycle growth maturity and decay of the mid latitude cyclones and their associated fronts is about 2 3 days in some favorable and special conditions cyclone can reach maturity in one day zappa et al 2015 however this rapid storm intensification is not very frequent also there are cyclones that persist longer than three days hakim and patoux 2018 because of the peculiar features of the mediterranean region such as its complex orography and topography and the high convective and mesoscale activity the lifecycle of the storm can be affected and reduced therefore smaller miet 2 days is more suitable to separate independent rain events in northern tunisia the large difference between the classes of the north and the south sectors could be explained by geographic and orographic factors indeed northern tunisia is located in the extension of the atlas mountain ranges with south west north east orientation the tell atlas extends over the northernmost coast of tunisia fig 1 and forms a kind of barrier against the westerly and especially the north westerly flow which brings most of the winter precipitation and generates more seasons of class 3 and class 4 ben boubaker 2003 merzougui and slimani 2012 thus the existing reliefs e g mogods and kroumirie mountains act to shadow the southern sector and reduce precipitation hence the dominance of class 1 and class 2 the continentality of the western part of the southern sector combined with its position between the tell atlas and saharan atlas fig 1 make the driest conditions with exceptional occurrence of class 1 in this region except some local variability due to high altitude of a number of stations such as s65 sakiet sidi youssef 803 m s66 ain zeligua 853 m s53 saadia bargou 524 m the stations located near the eastern coast show more variability compared to the western one class 3 and 2 are more frequent for the same sector indeed this region is influenced by the northeasterly flow coming from the european continent bringing moderate weak amount of precipitation ben boubaker 2003 overall the exposure of stations to different incoming flows combined with some local factors such as high altitude existing of forests and proximity to a moisture source generates more rainfall events hence relatively wet seasons 6 conclusions this paper investigates the temporal and spatial variability of a 50 year long data set of rainfall events in the winter season djf in northern tunisia the data used consist of observed rainfall time series taken from 70 rain gauge stations during djf 1960 2009 the analysis begins by changing daily rainfall to a sequence of djf rainfall events and then to seasonal djf features these features are clustered using a two level approach the som combined with hierarchical clustering the obtained clusters are identified and their space time regionalization is carried out each class characterizes the rain event types and take into account the rain intermittent character at both seasonal and event scales the rainfall regime was found overall to be dominated by classes describing drought lack of rain and intermittent weak events spatially each station is characterized by a specific distribution of the four clusters over the 50 year period the spatial regionalization showed that the study area is broadly divided into two sectors a wet sector in the north especially in the northwest and a dry sector in the south this result is in accordance with previous studies jebari et al 2007 merzougui and slimani 2012 fathalli et al 2018 the analysis carried out of the time variability of the cluster size for both sectors using non overlapping periods of 10 years shows that dry conditions dominate and extend over three consecutive decades from 1970 to 2000 however in the last decade 2000 2009 the winter season was particularly very wet with frequent rainy seasons especially in the northern sector the analysis of rainfall by considering intermittent phenomena and studying events structure enables a better understanding of the rainfall patterns this can also help identify the various types of seasons by taking into account other rainfall aspects such as the seasonal number of events their intensity and duration the method presented here is quite general as it is based on rainfall features and hence can be applied in other climatic regions such as the tropics or high latitudes further analysis is required to make the method more universal for instance the sensitivity to the choice of miet and equally the choice of threshold to define a rainy day and its impact are important topics for investigation this study must be complemented by a study of the relationship between the rainy season structure analysed here and the climate pattern the analysis of these complex and non linear relationships will make it possible to anticipate the impact of large scale climate variability on hydrology or agriculture the preliminary ongoing analysis gives some small but significant correlations between the rainfall features and climatic pattern over such as the arctic oscillation ao and the north atlantic oscillation nao indeed nao pattern is considered one of the recurrent and most prominent atmospheric patterns especially during the winter season that affects most of the northern hemisphere especially europe north africa and the mediterranean it is a see saw that acts to redistribute atmospheric mass between the icelandic region and the subtropical atlantic wanner et al 2001 during the negative nao phase the jet stream is positioned south of its climatological position and brings warmer and wetter than average conditions over the mediterranean and northern africa region during the positive phase the conditions are dryer and colder than average hurrell 1995 the correlation analysis is just preliminary results however the main objective of the research is to elaborate the relationships between the obtained typology of rainy seasons and the typology of climatic patterns credit authorship
