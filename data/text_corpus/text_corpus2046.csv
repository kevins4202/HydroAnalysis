10230,intensively managed poplar plantations populus spp and their hybrids have the potential to provide large quantities of renewable biomass for bioenergy identifying clonal varieties that are productive on water limited marginal agricultural land unsuitable for food production with low land costs is key to realizing that potential carbon isotope discrimination δ13c is the current method of choice for selecting varieties able to maintain higher levels of production under moderate drought stress drought resistance however other physiological and morphological traits may be effective as selection criteria for drought stress and cost less to collect and analyze the objective of this study was to test the efficacy of δ13c along with alternative physiological and morphological traits in predicting drought resistance of hybrid poplar varieties the other traits considered were leaf mass per area lma petiole diameter pd petiole length pl individual leaf area la adaxial stomatal density adax abaxial stomatal density abax minor vein density mvd and chlorophyll content chlor we found that δ13c was a poor indicator of drought resistance and abax was the only single trait that was a statistically significant predictor of varietal performance under drought stress the best indicator of drought stress was a composite of all nine variables keywords drought tolerance drought resistance carbon isotope δ13c wue bioenergy 1 introduction intensively managed poplar plantations populus spp and their hybrids have the potential to provide substantial renewable biomass for energy production stanton et al 2020 torre ugarte et al 2003 according to the usda doe billion ton report the united states can produce or collect up to 1 2 billion tons of biomass annually from which transportation fuels can be produced in an amount equivalent to one third of the nation s current petroleum usage us department of energy 2016 approximately one quarter to one third of this biomass demand will be met with perennial energy crops worldwide the success of all poplar production systems has consistently been shown to depend on access to elite plantation varieties stanton 2000 stettler et al 1996 for poplar plantations to successfully contribute to the potential of perennial energy crops hybrid varieties with superior agronomic features that are also adapted to either marginal agricultural sites or able to maintain high levels of production with minimal inputs will be needed stanton et al 2020 this most often means establishing plantations on lands with limited available water water availability is likely to be the environmental issue that defines the success and widespread adoption of woody biomass plantations pfister and hellweg 2009 therefore water management of hybrid poplar plantations will be key to their success and depend upon selecting elite clonal varieties that are able to maintain high levels of production with lower water availability condon et al 2004 that is varieties with high drought resistance volaire 2018 since the success of hybrid poplar biomass plantations will likely depend on elite clonal varieties with high drought resistance methods for identifying drought resistant individuals for deployment and breeding is an essential component of water management in these systems however direct estimates of drought resistance require experimental manipulation of soil moisture which is often not feasible when testing large numbers of varieties in field conditions thus there is a need for indirect measures of drought resistance in hybrid poplar indirect measures should ideally be easy and inexpensive to measure because clonal improvement programs will routinely screen hundreds or thousands of individual genotypes further it is desirable that indirect methods for screening are generalizable across a broad genetic base since hybrid breeding programs work with multiple taxa and provenances within each parental species one trait that is closely related to drought resistance is water use efficiency wue which is the amount of biomass a plant produces per molar unit of water lost through transpiration hybrid poplar is relatively water use efficient among temperate woody energy crops in short rotation coppice biomass production systems process based models estimate poplar s water use efficiency at 9 5 g of biomass per kilogram of consumed water tallis et al 2013 one common proxy for wue in c3 plants is the discrimination against the 13c isotope in co2 assimilation in plant tissue integrated over the photosynthetic time period δ13c the δ13c of plant tissue reflects p i p a the partial pressure of co2 inside the leaf compared to the partial pressure of co2 in the ambient air integrated over the time of the growth of the plant tissue as p i p a decreases wue increases because of either increased photosynthetic capacity or decreased stomatal conductance farquhar et al 1989 the availability of high throughput labs for stable isotope analysis the time integrated nature of δ13c and the trait s relatively high heritability have made it the method of choice in selecting drought tolerant varieties in applied poplar improvement programs dillen et al 2008 marron et al 2005 hybrid poplar has multiple adaptive strategies for coping with low water availability which may not be captured by δ13c or could confound correlations between δ13c and drought resistance for example poplar clones could develop deep or adventitious roots pregitzer and friend 1996 tschaplinski and blake 1989 and therefore exhibit high discrimination low water use efficiency while still exhibiting high drought resistance likewise clones may limit the timing of photosynthetic activity to periods of favorable weather or limit leaf areas to maintain water losses per unit photosynthetic assimilation and therefore maintain high discrimination while potentially resisting drought adjustments in hydraulic conductance xylem cavitation and osmotic systems in hybrid poplar have also been documented gebre et al 1998 larchevêque et al 2011 sparks and black 1999 yin et al 2005 that may allow clones to maintain stomatal conductance and higher discrimination while maintaining drought resistance however leaf level drought resistance strategies that involve regulation of stomatal functioning bassman and zwier 1991 sparks and black 1999 and or increased assimilation rates due to greater leaf nitrogen should lead to increased photosynthetic assimilation for a given p i and lower carbon isotope discrimination higher water use efficiency the objective of this study was to test the efficacy of δ13c along with alternative physiological and morphological traits in predicting drought resistance of hybrid poplar varieties from multiple hybrid taxa the other traits considered were leaf mass per area lma petiole diameter pd petiole length pl individual leaf area la adaxial stomatal density adax abaxial stomatal density abax minor vein density mvd and chlorophyll content chlor these traits are all relatively easy and inexpensive to measure each of these traits is related to plant water use and has been suggested previously in the literature as an indicator of water use efficiency or a plant s ability to cope with drought stress varieties and populations of populus spp adapted to water stress have been shown to have lower lma than less adapted genotypes marron et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 the petiole connects the leaf to the body of the tree allowing for the transport of water and sugar between them the diameter and length of the petiole should influence resistance to water flow and therefore hydraulic conductivity if petiole properties are correlated with xylem properties hydraulic conductivity and wue have been linked to tree growth irrespective of site conditions brocious and hacke 2016 marron et al 2007 gebauer et al 2016 found that larger petiole areas in poplars were significantly correlated with the number of petiole vessels and total xylem cross sectional area in petioles increasing petiole length increases the path length for water transport potentially decreasing hydraulic conductance however the effect of path length can be mitigated by efficient xylem tapering west et al 1999 total leaf area is significantly correlated to aboveground biomass and has been shown to decrease with increasing drought stress in some genotypes but remains stable from wet to dry sites in other drought resistant genotypes bunn et al 2004 harrington et al 1997 monclus et al 2006 stomatal density is negatively correlated with growth and water use efficiency in drought experiments monclus et al 2006 wang et al 2016 but in other studies it is positively associated with growth al afas et al 2006 and drought adapted populus provenances pearce et al 2006 minor vein density may improve leaf hydraulic conductance and thus increase drought resistance in plants brodribb et al 2007 nardini et al 2012 2014 high chlorophyll content has been suggested as an explanation of how drought adapted populus varieties maintain relatively high photosynthetic rates under drought conditions guo et al 2010 identifying one or more of these easily quantified leaf parameters that correlate with drought resistance will expediate the selection of superior varietals in populus breeding programs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study description trials were conducted at greenwood resources inc boardman test site near boardman oregon usa 45 50 05 65 n 119 33 58 35 w the site elevation is 140 m above sea level on excessively well drained loamy fine textured sand of the quincy soil series originating from eolian sands with a deep water table 3 4 m according to a nearby monitoring well at a slightly lower elevation no restrictive features in the top 203 cm and a typical ph of 6 8 8 0 web soil survey n d mean annual precipitation is between 18 and 20 cm mean annual temperature is 11 12 c and typical annual frost free days range between 160 and 200 the site is xeric and characterized by a continental climate with very dry summers and most of the precipitation occurring in the late fall winter and early spring the site was formerly farmland and was converted to a research plot for hybrid poplar utilizing drip irrigation in the 1990s no fertilizers were applied to research trials and competitive vegetation was controlled prior to planting and periodically during trials using a combination of mechanical and chemical means 2 2 plant material selection in 2011 a trial was established with clonally replicated genotypes of the p deltoides p maximowiczii d m p canadensis d n and the p generosa d t inter specific taxa single ramet plots nested within taxon whole plots in six randomized complete blocks represented each genotype spacing was 3 05 m between rows and 1 07 m between trees in the row 3077 trees ha 1 the trial was managed with deficit irrigation i e 75 of normal rates during the latter part of the second growing season when foliage from the current height s increment was collected and sent to the university of california davis stable isotope laboratory for determination of ramet specific 13c values assuming atmospheric δ13c was 8 table 1 the taxon genotype within taxon and ramet within taxon effects account for 3 1 34 2 and 62 7 of the genetic variation in 13c respectively ignoring the taxon effect clonal repeatability equaled 0 63 indicative of good genotype selection opportunities eighteen genotypes composed of two selections representing the extremes and mean of δ13c values in each of the three taxa were selected from the 2011 study for a replicated deficit irrigation experiment planted in 2014 at the same site see table 2 we selected 18 genotypes from the three taxa with extreme and moderate δ13c values in order to include a wide range of genetic variation and potential drought resistance strategies in the study the wide range of variation was desirable to find indicators of drought resistance that would be generalizable across a breeding program to produce screening or ranking criteria that were effective for a large number of diverse genotypes being tested annually 2 3 trial design and data collection the field trial was a split plot design with 2011 trial δ13c categories assigned as subplots and irrigation treatments assigned as main plots with four complete replications the experimental units were 3 tree 3 tree clonal plots with 2 75 m between rows and 1 05 m separating trees within the rows 3463 trees ha 1 one row of border trees surrounded all irrigation treatments and an unirrigated space was left between treatments to discourage root exploration resulting in approximately 12 m separating trial trees receiving different rates of irrigation the irrigation treatments were established by using drip emitters with different rates and irrigating the entire trial for the same duration irrigation duration was adjusted uniformly for all treatments throughout the growing season to meet estimated plant demand for optimal growth with the highest rate emitter treatment plant demand for optimal growth was estimated by greenwood resources water and energy resource engineer for the boardman tree farm from historical poplar crop demand for similar age classes adjusted for crop density and extended local weather forecasts emitter rates were selected to achieve delivery of 100 2 31 lph 80 1 86 lph and 60 1 38 lph of plant demand irrigation rates by month and year are shown in table 3 with the exception of june 2014 and october 2015 in which irrigation was applied but duration data were not recorded these two months were at the beginning and end of the irrigation season respectively and would have had relatively small contributions to the annual irrigation balance in august of the first growing season two leaves between the 10th and 12th node from the terminal were removed from the closest living individual to the plot center placed in labeled sealable plastic bags with pre wetted paper towels and stored in a cooler with dry ice if the leaves between the 10th and 12th node were absent or severely damaged the nearest leaves were chosen instead in total leaves from 216 individual trees were collected for further analysis 18 genotypes 3 irrigation treatments 4 complete replicates these leaves were dried ground and samples were sent to the university of california davis stable isotope lab for determination of ramet specific δ13c values using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry and assuming atmospheric δ13c was 8 in early september of the second growing season tree height ht and diameter at breast height 1 37 m dbh of all trees were measured and an aboveground biomass index was calculated for each tree as dbh2 ht the leaf area index lai of the plot was measured between two ramets in two rows of each plot using a li cor lai 2200 lincoln ne usa plant canopy analyzer and averaged for each plot in addition more intensive measurements of two leaves from the second year s terminal height increment were made the leaves were selected following the same protocol as the prior year chlorophyll content chlor was estimated in situ using a konica minolta spad 502 chiyoda city tokyo japan chlorophyll meter leaves were scanned on a centimeter square grid and traced using imagej to determine individual leaf area la petiole length pl was measured from the petiole base to the leaf base with calipers petiole diameter pd was measured at the widest part of the petiole base where the petiole connects to the node with calipers to determine stomatal density adaxial adax and abaxial abax stomata peels were taken by applying approximately one cm2 of clear nail polish on a portion of the top and bottom of the leaf respectively after the nail polish was dried transparent tape was pressed lightly onto the nail polish and peeled off of the leaf tape peels were placed on a microscope slide and stoma were counted at 400 magnification in an area of 0 073 mm2 to determine minor vein density mvd four 2 cm diameter leaf punches two from each side of the major vein were taken from one leaf and put into 20 ml vials with 15 ml of 3 1 95 ethanol glacial acetic acid solution once leaf punches were transparent they were rinsed in water placed on microscope slides and photographed in zenimaging zeiss microscopy jena germany imagej schneider et al 2012 was calibrated to measure minor vein density in length area mm 5 mm2 an additional 2 cm diameter leaf punch was taken from each leaf oven dried weighed and expressed as leaf mass per area lma the average of lma for the two leaves was used in analysis δ13c data were originally intended to be collected in both years but were not collected in year two as planned because adequate resources were no longer available for sample analysis all values were averaged to the experimental unit level for analysis 2 4 analytical approach drought resistance is a complex trait that emerges from multiple plant adaptations and their interactions making it difficult to measure directly even biomass response to drought stress is an indirect measure of a plant s inherent resistance to drought under all but the narrowest conceptualizations of drought resistance however based on the literature each of the nine plant traits that were measured in this study were expected to contribute to drought resistance as described in section 1 however the three accepted methods for multiple trait selection in plant breeding tandem selection independent culling levels and index selection were not feasible for this study the first is not applicable to trees given the long generation intervals the second in inefficient as it does not account for trait covariances and the composition of our population disqualifies the application in index selection therefore we propose a novel method using structural equation modeling structural equation modeling sem is an analytical approach well suited to modeling the influence of unmeasured variables from a combination of measured variables when the measured variables are assumed to give rise to the unmeasured variable the unmeasured variable is called a composite and the measured variables are called indicators for our analysis we assumed drought resistance was a composite of the nine traits we measured δ13c chlor la pl pd abax adax mvd and lma sem was used in place of conventional index selection robinson et al 1951 because 1 varieties did not constitute random samples 2 genetic and phenotypic variances and covariances required for index selection were expected to vary among the taxa and 3 the error of estimating genetic parameters of each taxon was expected to be too large in view of the limited number of varieties representing each inter specific taxon we also assumed that the proportion of a clone s biomass index in 100 irrigation treatments that was achieved in deficit irrigation treatments biomprop was a function of the clone s drought resistance and the irrigation level modeling the data this way facilitates comparisons between the individual impact of the nine indicators on the composite and the composite s impact on biomprop further the impact of individual indicators on biomprop can be estimated this approach has the flexibility to test model variations including correlations between indicator variables and grouping by taxa there were substantial differences in mean values of indicator variables and lai under different irrigation treatments observed in our study see table 4 analysis of variance anova verified the irrigation induced differences in lai and abax were statistically significant to account for this variability we opted to use the values of indicators in the 100 treatment of each block as predictors in our modeling of the composite in the two deficit irrigation treatments this approach simulates the real world conditions where selections for drought resistance will need to be made from trials conducted under near ideal growing conditions which is the standard that poplar breeders commonly use structural equation models rely on the same statistical assumptions as multiple regression namely independence normal distribution and symmetrical residuals these assumptions were checked by visually inspecting the residual plots of independent linear regressions of each indicator on biomprop this exercise revealed skewing of residuals driven by a small number of outliers on closer inspection it was determined that there were three outliers where the biomprop was greater than 1 5 i e the average biomass index was more than 50 greater in deficit irrigation treatments than it was in the 100 treatment no consistent spatial or clonal pattern could be determined to explain the anomaly and it was assumed that clones in these subplots had possibly accessed groundwater reserves the depth of water table according to a monitoring well adjacent to the test site was around 3 m the combination of the young age of the plants and regular surface irrigation in the agricultural setting was expected to prevent rooting to that depth puri et al 1994 but evidence suggests some populus can access ground water at depths of 3 m or more zhu et al 2009 these three outliers were removed from the data for analysis visual inspection of residual plots without the outliers suggested that assumptions were satisfactorily met an additional assumption of the model is that the composite variable has no error in other words drought resistance as represented in the analysis is composed completely of the nine indicator variables thus it should be understood that drought resistance as modeled may be an incomplete representation of plants true drought resistance statistical analyses were carried out in r team 2017 the loadings for each of the indicator variables were determined using a linear mixed model lmm where biomprop was a function of the nine indicator variables δ13c chlor la pl pd abax adax mvd and lma as fixed effects and block and genotype within block as random effects the loading factors in the sem were manually set to the coefficients of the lmm in the lavaan r package rosseel 2012 which was used to test the model fit determine standardized coefficients and their statistical significance p 0 05 following lefcheck 2019 three alternative variations of the model that included correlations between indicator variables were also tested the first included correlations between indicators reported to have statistically significant pearson s correlation coefficients in the literature bonhomme et al 2008 brocious and hacke 2016 dillen et al 2008 marron et al 2007 monclus et al 2006 the second included correlations between indicator variables that had statistically significant coefficients greater than 0 5 in our data see fig 1 the third included all correlations between all pairs of indicator variables we also conducted multi group analysis to assess the impact of hybrid taxa 3 results 3 1 growth response to irrigation compared to the 100 irrigation treatment study wide average biomass index decreased by 22 0 and 37 7 in the 80 and 60 irrigation treatments respectively the average clonal decrease ranged from 6 to 36 and 6 51 in the 80 and 60 irrigation treatments respectively there were numerous changes in clonal rankings between irrigation treatments in both biomass index and biomprop the top six clones top third in biomprop under both the 60 and 80 irrigation treatment had individuals from the high mid and low δ13c categories based on the 2011 trial analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant level of interaction between δ13c categories and irrigation treatments p 0 05 data not presented the mean and standard deviation for each indicator value used in modeling can be found in table s1 for each clone the δ13c values and ranking of some clones did change relative to the 2011 trial however a wide range of variation in δ13c 19 2949 21 4516 was still observed indicating that we met our goal of testing a diverse group of clones so that generalizable indicators of drought resistance could be identified 3 2 model fitting the model in fig 1 was successfully fit to the data with a p value from the chi squared test of 0 97 indicating a good fit p values 0 05 are rejected as poor fit and an r squared of 0 19 in all cases forcing any correlations between indicator variables resulted in a poorly fit model chi squared p value 0 001 we also compared a model variation where the intercept and path coefficients could vary by taxa with a constrained version that fixed intercepts and path coefficients as the same for all taxa and found no statistical difference based on a chi squared difference test p value 0 80 the lack of statistical difference between the universal model and the model that allowed coefficients to vary by taxa indicated that a universal model explained the data as well as the taxa specific model with a higher level of parsimony thus a universal model that did not include grouping by taxa was used for final analysis 3 3 model results the only indicator variable with a statistically significant effect on the composite drought resistance was abax p value 0 02 abaxial stomatal density also had the largest path coefficient at 0 858 indicating that a one standard deviation change in abax is associated with a 0 858 standard deviation change in drought resistance the path coefficients for drought resistance and irrigation treatment were 0 301 and 0 314 respectively and both were statistically significant p value 0 001 the path coefficient for drought resistance can be interpreted the same as the indicator variable path coefficients a one standard deviation change in drought resistance is associated with a 0 301 standard deviation change in biomprop the interpretation of the path coefficient for irrigation treatment is slightly different it represents the standard deviation change in biomprop associated with the difference between the 60 irrigation level and the 80 irrigation level the impact of indicator variables on biomprop can be determined by multiplying their path coefficient to drought resistance by the path coefficient of drought resistance on biomprop thus a one standard deviation change in abax is associated with a 0 858 0 301 0 258 standard deviation change in biomprop the standard deviation of abax was 107 pores mm 2 and the standard deviation of biomprop was 0 28 so in real units the model suggests that an increase of 107 additional pores mm 2 on the abaxial side of the leaf is associated with an approximate 7 smaller decrease in biomass under water stress fig 2 to illustrate practical implications of the study on selecting varieties for use in plantations with less water availability or lower water inputs we compared the average biomprop of the six top and bottom ranked clones in terms of abax and the composite drought resistance to the trial population average table 5 the comparisons in table 5 suggest that the composite drought resistance is a superior selection criterion and that both drought resistance and abax are more effective as selection agents when water is more limited abax alone appears ineffective as a criterion to identify varieties that will perform better than the trial population under 80 irrigation in fact the six lowest ranked clones in abax outperform the population while the six highest ranked clones did worse the top six varieties in terms of drought resistance however substantially outperform the population average in drought response at both irrigation levels at the 60 irrigation level there was a 28 4 spread between the average of the bottom six and top six clones in drought tolerance and the top six clones averaged 19 higher biomprop than the trial population 4 discussion we found that the traits leaf chlorophyll content chlor minor vein density mvd and abaxial stomatal density abax had the largest impact on the composite drought resistance parameter however only abaxial stomatal density was statistically significant δ13c has the lowest impact and individuals across a range of δ13c displayed similar drought resistance the composite parameter drought resistance explained a statistically significant change in biomass index biomprop or the proportional growth in the drought treatments compared with the 100 irrigation treatment the drought resistance parameter performed well at predicting drought resistant vs drought sensitive clones at both the 80 irrigation level and 60 irrigation level however this parameter is a composite and therefore represents the combination of nine leaf physiological and morphological metrics abaxial stomatal density alone was able to adequately predict drought resistant vs drought sensitive clones at the high drought treatment 60 irrigation but performed poorly at the 80 irrigation treatment δ13c had little to no explanatory power in our composite drought resistance parameter similar results were found by monclus et al 2009 where δ13c was not correlated with drought tolerance in p deltoides p trichocarpa hybrids δ13c was predicted to have a significant explanatory effect on drought resistance given its correlation with leaf level water use efficiency or the amount of carbon assimilation per unit stomatal conductance occurring in the leaf factors including the use of stored carbon to produce leaf tissue as well as the use of respired carbon with a more negative atmospheric signature da silveira et al 1989 may complicate the use of δ13c to compare the water use efficiency across clones however young populus plantations derived from cuttings should exhibit less variability with regard to carbon sources due to potentially low stored carbon and a well mixed atmospheric source differences in mesophyll conductance also have the potential to affect δ13c due to its impact on the concentration of co2 at the chloroplast this effect is potentially independent of stomatal conductance or water losses from the leaf and therefore water use efficiency broeckx et al 2014 le roux et al 2001 soolanayakanahally et al 2009 warren and adams 2006 carbon isotope discrimination has been put forth in several studies as a promising leaf trait for the selection of clones with high water use efficiency bonhomme et al 2008 marron et al 2005 however our results show that δ13c may not yield the necessary information to make this determination given its lack of explanatory power in predicting drought resistance carbon isotope discrimination approximates photosynthetic assimilation per unit stomatal conductance or intrinsic water use efficiency however water losses from leaves transpiration also depend on atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd which could differ for the same stomatal conductance under differing environmental conditions seibt et al 2008 likewise differing stomatal conductance could result in the same transpiration rate high stomatal conductance at low vpd vs low stomatal conductance at high vpd potentially uncoupling δ13c from water use per unit photosynthesis while poplar clones planted in the same location likely experience similar atmospheric conditions and vpd differences in boundary layer conductance due to differing leaf sizes and crown characteristics could potentially affect relationships between stomatal conductance and transpiration rates across clones farquhar et al 1989 likewise whole tree water use efficiency biomass whole tree water use is potentially a more relevant trait compared with leaf level estimates of water use efficiency seibt et al 2008 for selecting individuals with high water use efficiency and drought resistance but is more difficult to estimate carbon isotopic discrimination may not have exhibited explanatory power in predicting drought resistance across clones because increasing water use efficiency is just one of a number of strategies that plants can employ to resist drought conditions monclus et al 2006 trees can also alter carbon allocation patterns to increase rooting depth and decrease leaf areas that need to be supported by water uptake indeed a few outliers in this study exhibited substantially higher biomass in the 60 irrigation treatment compared to 100 irrigation and this was considered evidence of access to groundwater at the particular location that they were planted in addition particularly for populus changes in leaf area represent an adaptive response to drought larchevêque et al 2011 and have potential as an indicator of drought resistance monclus et al 2006 found that the best predictor of drought resistance in p deltoides p nigra hybrids was the ratio of leaf area under optimal water versus drought conditions finally in the hot and dry growing conditions of this study water losses can serve the purpose of evaporative cooling to maintain leaf functioning mahan and upchurch 1988 marchin et al 2016 in addition to providing carbon dioxide for photosynthesis making increased water use efficiency a potential liability to overall plant productivity chaves et al 2016 abaxial stomatal density was found to be the only leaf parameter that had a significant effect on the composite drought tolerance parameter and was found to distinguish drought resistant and drought sensitive clones at the 60 irrigation level stomatal density has been found in other studies to exhibit high plasticity among leaf traits cao et al 2012 kassahun et al 2020 sack et al 2006 and its variability across leaves will affect gas exchange internal leaf co2 concentrations and leaf level water use efficiency cao et al 2012 franks et al 2015 because of the generally high correlation between stomatal size and density drake et al 2013 larger stomatal densities likely signify smaller stomata that have been shown to have faster response times quickly achieving optimal stomatal conductance during favorable conditions and quickly closing during unfavorable conditions drake et al 2013 monclus et al 2006 also identified stomatal density as a parameter of interest to select genotypes with high productivity and water use efficiency although they found that stomatal density exhibited a negative correlation with biomass and a positive correlation with δ13c leaf traits such as stomatal density lma vein density and carbon isotope discrimination are known to be highly variable depending on the position of the leaf along the stem axis and the microenvironment prevailing at the leaf position al afas et al 2007 although the leaf rank was normalized across genotypes to account for this variability as similar leaf rank may not necessarily reflect the same development age if genotypes display different growth rates the variation should have been further controlled by sampling leaves near the end of the growing season as plants were setting bud nonetheless leaf sampling variability may have contributed to the relatively low r squared value of the model our ability to manage water in these systems through varietal selection could be improved with future work that considers large populations and the degree to which drought resistance is under genetic control this could be done with traditional progeny trials with experimental drought treatments containing multiple families each with multiple individuals progeny trials will help determine the heritability or genetic basis of individual indicator variables and selection indices analogous to our composite variable can be developed to help advance breeding programs robinson et al 1951 molecular methods utilizing marker assisted selection for one or more traits are also likely to be beneficial in identifying drought resistance varieties for deployment and breeding in addition experiments that simulate periodic and stochastic water stress events more similar to natural water regimes may provide valuable insights that cannot be captured in trials with systematic irrigation reduction replicated studies that include more genotypes per hybrid taxa may reveal that different indicators are effective at predicting drought resistance in different taxa while the model in this study that allowed coefficients to vary by taxa was not statistically different than the universal model used for analysis it is possible the lack of difference was because the number of genotypes per taxa was too small to facilitate statistical detection given the variety of strategies populus spp can employ to resist drought the best predictor of drought resistance may vary from population to population however our results indicate abaxial stomatal density and the drought resistance composite have the potential to predict drought resistance across a broad range of taxa and drought resistance strategies making them potentially useful as selection criteria for hybrid poplar breeders working with numerous individuals from multiple populations and taxa 5 conclusion one of the greatest production challenges for widespread adoption of short rotation hybrid poplar for bioenergy is developing cropping methods for abandoned or marginal agricultural ground focusing plantation establishment on poorer quality land is a key strategy because it avoids direct competition with food production does not require replacement of existing native forests and can greatly reduce production costs for growers stanton et al 2020 the limiting factor for much of the available marginal agricultural land globally is water availability thus water management is a key challenge for short rotation hybrid poplar plantations a key component of water management in these systems is selection and deployment of elite clonal varieties that are able to maintain high levels of productivity under moderate water stress what volaire 2018 calls drought resistance while a number of selection criteria related to drought resistance have been suggested in recent years δ13c has come to prominence as the method of choice for selecting drought resistant varieties dillen et al 2008 marron et al 2005 however under the conditions of this study δ13c was a very poor predictor of drought resistance while abaxial stomatal density a much more cost effective sampling criteria proved adequate for selecting varieties that had higher drought resistance on average than the study population in more severe drought conditions the composite variable while more time consuming and costly to calculate was even better at discriminating varieties with relatively low and high drought resistance under multiple water availability regimes this suggests that δ13c may not be the best criterion for selecting drought resistant clones and that identifying varieties capable of high production in areas with limited water availability may require consideration of multiple plant traits simultaneously declaration of competing

statistically significant predictor of varietal performance under drought stress the best indicator of drought stress was a composite of all nine variables keywords drought tolerance drought resistance carbon isotope δ13c wue bioenergy 1 introduction intensively managed poplar plantations populus spp and their hybrids have the potential to provide substantial renewable biomass for energy production stanton et al 2020 torre ugarte et al 2003 according to the usda doe billion ton report the united states can produce or collect up to 1 2 billion tons of biomass annually from which transportation fuels can be produced in an amount equivalent to one third of the nation s current petroleum usage us department of energy 2016 approximately one quarter to one third of this biomass demand will be met with perennial energy crops worldwide the success of all poplar production systems has consistently been shown to depend on access to elite plantation varieties stanton 2000 stettler et al 1996 for poplar plantations to successfully contribute to the potential of perennial energy crops hybrid varieties with superior agronomic features that are also adapted to either marginal agricultural sites or able to maintain high levels of production with minimal inputs will be needed stanton et al 2020 this most often means establishing plantations on lands with limited available water water availability is likely to be the environmental issue that defines the success and widespread adoption of woody biomass plantations pfister and hellweg 2009 therefore water management of hybrid poplar plantations will be key to their success and depend upon selecting elite clonal varieties that are able to maintain high levels of production with lower water availability condon et al 2004 that is varieties with high drought resistance volaire 2018 since the success of hybrid poplar biomass plantations will likely depend on elite clonal varieties with high drought resistance methods for identifying drought resistant individuals for deployment and breeding is an essential component of water management in these systems however direct estimates of drought resistance require experimental manipulation of soil moisture which is often not feasible when testing large numbers of varieties in field conditions thus there is a need for indirect measures of drought resistance in hybrid poplar indirect measures should ideally be easy and inexpensive to measure because clonal improvement programs will routinely screen hundreds or thousands of individual genotypes further it is desirable that indirect methods for screening are generalizable across a broad genetic base since hybrid breeding programs work with multiple taxa and provenances within each parental species one trait that is closely related to drought resistance is water use efficiency wue which is the amount of biomass a plant produces per molar unit of water lost through transpiration hybrid poplar is relatively water use efficient among temperate woody energy crops in short rotation coppice biomass production systems process based models estimate poplar s water use efficiency at 9 5 g of biomass per kilogram of consumed water tallis et al 2013 one common proxy for wue in c3 plants is the discrimination against the 13c isotope in co2 assimilation in plant tissue integrated over the photosynthetic time period δ13c the δ13c of plant tissue reflects p i p a the partial pressure of co2 inside the leaf compared to the partial pressure of co2 in the ambient air integrated over the time of the growth of the plant tissue as p i p a decreases wue increases because of either increased photosynthetic capacity or decreased stomatal conductance farquhar et al 1989 the availability of high throughput labs for stable isotope analysis the time integrated nature of δ13c and the trait s relatively high heritability have made it the method of choice in selecting drought tolerant varieties in applied poplar improvement programs dillen et al 2008 marron et al 2005 hybrid poplar has multiple adaptive strategies for coping with low water availability which may not be captured by δ13c or could confound correlations between δ13c and drought resistance for example poplar clones could develop deep or adventitious roots pregitzer and friend 1996 tschaplinski and blake 1989 and therefore exhibit high discrimination low water use efficiency while still exhibiting high drought resistance likewise clones may limit the timing of photosynthetic activity to periods of favorable weather or limit leaf areas to maintain water losses per unit photosynthetic assimilation and therefore maintain high discrimination while potentially resisting drought adjustments in hydraulic conductance xylem cavitation and osmotic systems in hybrid poplar have also been documented gebre et al 1998 larchevêque et al 2011 sparks and black 1999 yin et al 2005 that may allow clones to maintain stomatal conductance and higher discrimination while maintaining drought resistance however leaf level drought resistance strategies that involve regulation of stomatal functioning bassman and zwier 1991 sparks and black 1999 and or increased assimilation rates due to greater leaf nitrogen should lead to increased photosynthetic assimilation for a given p i and lower carbon isotope discrimination higher water use efficiency the objective of this study was to test the efficacy of δ13c along with alternative physiological and morphological traits in predicting drought resistance of hybrid poplar varieties from multiple hybrid taxa the other traits considered were leaf mass per area lma petiole diameter pd petiole length pl individual leaf area la adaxial stomatal density adax abaxial stomatal density abax minor vein density mvd and chlorophyll content chlor these traits are all relatively easy and inexpensive to measure each of these traits is related to plant water use and has been suggested previously in the literature as an indicator of water use efficiency or a plant s ability to cope with drought stress varieties and populations of populus spp adapted to water stress have been shown to have lower lma than less adapted genotypes marron et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 the petiole connects the leaf to the body of the tree allowing for the transport of water and sugar between them the diameter and length of the petiole should influence resistance to water flow and therefore hydraulic conductivity if petiole properties are correlated with xylem properties hydraulic conductivity and wue have been linked to tree growth irrespective of site conditions brocious and hacke 2016 marron et al 2007 gebauer et al 2016 found that larger petiole areas in poplars were significantly correlated with the number of petiole vessels and total xylem cross sectional area in petioles increasing petiole length increases the path length for water transport potentially decreasing hydraulic conductance however the effect of path length can be mitigated by efficient xylem tapering west et al 1999 total leaf area is significantly correlated to aboveground biomass and has been shown to decrease with increasing drought stress in some genotypes but remains stable from wet to dry sites in other drought resistant genotypes bunn et al 2004 harrington et al 1997 monclus et al 2006 stomatal density is negatively correlated with growth and water use efficiency in drought experiments monclus et al 2006 wang et al 2016 but in other studies it is positively associated with growth al afas et al 2006 and drought adapted populus provenances pearce et al 2006 minor vein density may improve leaf hydraulic conductance and thus increase drought resistance in plants brodribb et al 2007 nardini et al 2012 2014 high chlorophyll content has been suggested as an explanation of how drought adapted populus varieties maintain relatively high photosynthetic rates under drought conditions guo et al 2010 identifying one or more of these easily quantified leaf parameters that correlate with drought resistance will expediate the selection of superior varietals in populus breeding programs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study description trials were conducted at greenwood resources inc boardman test site near boardman oregon usa 45 50 05 65 n 119 33 58 35 w the site elevation is 140 m above sea level on excessively well drained loamy fine textured sand of the quincy soil series originating from eolian sands with a deep water table 3 4 m according to a nearby monitoring well at a slightly lower elevation no restrictive features in the top 203 cm and a typical ph of 6 8 8 0 web soil survey n d mean annual precipitation is between 18 and 20 cm mean annual temperature is 11 12 c and typical annual frost free days range between 160 and 200 the site is xeric and characterized by a continental climate with very dry summers and most of the precipitation occurring in the late fall winter and early spring the site was formerly farmland and was converted to a research plot for hybrid poplar utilizing drip irrigation in the 1990s no fertilizers were applied to research trials and competitive vegetation was controlled prior to planting and periodically during trials using a combination of mechanical and chemical means 2 2 plant material selection in 2011 a trial was established with clonally replicated genotypes of the p deltoides p maximowiczii d m p canadensis d n and the p generosa d t inter specific taxa single ramet plots nested within taxon whole plots in six randomized complete blocks represented each genotype spacing was 3 05 m between rows and 1 07 m between trees in the row 3077 trees ha 1 the trial was managed with deficit irrigation i e 75 of normal rates during the latter part of the second growing season when foliage from the current height s increment was collected and sent to the university of california davis stable isotope laboratory for determination of ramet specific 13c values assuming atmospheric δ13c was 8 table 1 the taxon genotype within taxon and ramet within taxon effects account for 3 1 34 2 and 62 7 of the genetic variation in 13c respectively ignoring the taxon effect clonal repeatability equaled 0 63 indicative of good genotype selection opportunities eighteen genotypes composed of two selections representing the extremes and mean of δ13c values in each of the three taxa were selected from the 2011 study for a replicated deficit irrigation experiment planted in 2014 at the same site see table 2 we selected 18 genotypes from the three taxa with extreme and moderate δ13c values in order to include a wide range of genetic variation and potential drought resistance strategies in the study the wide range of variation was desirable to find indicators of drought resistance that would be generalizable across a breeding program to produce screening or ranking criteria that were effective for a large number of diverse genotypes being tested annually 2 3 trial design and data collection the field trial was a split plot design with 2011 trial δ13c categories assigned as subplots and irrigation treatments assigned as main plots with four complete replications the experimental units were 3 tree 3 tree clonal plots with 2 75 m between rows and 1 05 m separating trees within the rows 3463 trees ha 1 one row of border trees surrounded all irrigation treatments and an unirrigated space was left between treatments to discourage root exploration resulting in approximately 12 m separating trial trees receiving different rates of irrigation the irrigation treatments were established by using drip emitters with different rates and irrigating the entire trial for the same duration irrigation duration was adjusted uniformly for all treatments throughout the growing season to meet estimated plant demand for optimal growth with the highest rate emitter treatment plant demand for optimal growth was estimated by greenwood resources water and energy resource engineer for the boardman tree farm from historical poplar crop demand for similar age classes adjusted for crop density and extended local weather forecasts emitter rates were selected to achieve delivery of 100 2 31 lph 80 1 86 lph and 60 1 38 lph of plant demand irrigation rates by month and year are shown in table 3 with the exception of june 2014 and october 2015 in which irrigation was applied but duration data were not recorded these two months were at the beginning and end of the irrigation season respectively and would have had relatively small contributions to the annual irrigation balance in august of the first growing season two leaves between the 10th and 12th node from the terminal were removed from the closest living individual to the plot center placed in labeled sealable plastic bags with pre wetted paper towels and stored in a cooler with dry ice if the leaves between the 10th and 12th node were absent or severely damaged the nearest leaves were chosen instead in total leaves from 216 individual trees were collected for further analysis 18 genotypes 3 irrigation treatments 4 complete replicates these leaves were dried ground and samples were sent to the university of california davis stable isotope lab for determination of ramet specific δ13c values using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry and assuming atmospheric δ13c was 8 in early september of the second growing season tree height ht and diameter at breast height 1 37 m dbh of all trees were measured and an aboveground biomass index was calculated for each tree as dbh2 ht the leaf area index lai of the plot was measured between two ramets in two rows of each plot using a li cor lai 2200 lincoln ne usa plant canopy analyzer and averaged for each plot in addition more intensive measurements of two leaves from the second year s terminal height increment were made the leaves were selected following the same protocol as the prior year chlorophyll content chlor was estimated in situ using a konica minolta spad 502 chiyoda city tokyo japan chlorophyll meter leaves were scanned on a centimeter square grid and traced using imagej to determine individual leaf area la petiole length pl was measured from the petiole base to the leaf base with calipers petiole diameter pd was measured at the widest part of the petiole base where the petiole connects to the node with calipers to determine stomatal density adaxial adax and abaxial abax stomata peels were taken by applying approximately one cm2 of clear nail polish on a portion of the top and bottom of the leaf respectively after the nail polish was dried transparent tape was pressed lightly onto the nail polish and peeled off of the leaf tape peels were placed on a microscope slide and stoma were counted at 400 magnification in an area of 0 073 mm2 to determine minor vein density mvd four 2 cm diameter leaf punches two from each side of the major vein were taken from one leaf and put into 20 ml vials with 15 ml of 3 1 95 ethanol glacial acetic acid solution once leaf punches were transparent they were rinsed in water placed on microscope slides and photographed in zenimaging zeiss microscopy jena germany imagej schneider et al 2012 was calibrated to measure minor vein density in length area mm 5 mm2 an additional 2 cm diameter leaf punch was taken from each leaf oven dried weighed and expressed as leaf mass per area lma the average of lma for the two leaves was used in analysis δ13c data were originally intended to be collected in both years but were not collected in year two as planned because adequate resources were no longer available for sample analysis all values were averaged to the experimental unit level for analysis 2 4 analytical approach drought resistance is a complex trait that emerges from multiple plant adaptations and their interactions making it difficult to measure directly even biomass response to drought stress is an indirect measure of a plant s inherent resistance to drought under all but the narrowest conceptualizations of drought resistance however based on the literature each of the nine plant traits that were measured in this study were expected to contribute to drought resistance as described in section 1 however the three accepted methods for multiple trait selection in plant breeding tandem selection independent culling levels and index selection were not feasible for this study the first is not applicable to trees given the long generation intervals the second in inefficient as it does not account for trait covariances and the composition of our population disqualifies the application in index selection therefore we propose a novel method using structural equation modeling structural equation modeling sem is an analytical approach well suited to modeling the influence of unmeasured variables from a combination of measured variables when the measured variables are assumed to give rise to the unmeasured variable the unmeasured variable is called a composite and the measured variables are called indicators for our analysis we assumed drought resistance was a composite of the nine traits we measured δ13c chlor la pl pd abax adax mvd and lma sem was used in place of conventional index selection robinson et al 1951 because 1 varieties did not constitute random samples 2 genetic and phenotypic variances and covariances required for index selection were expected to vary among the taxa and 3 the error of estimating genetic parameters of each taxon was expected to be too large in view of the limited number of varieties representing each inter specific taxon we also assumed that the proportion of a clone s biomass index in 100 irrigation treatments that was achieved in deficit irrigation treatments biomprop was a function of the clone s drought resistance and the irrigation level modeling the data this way facilitates comparisons between the individual impact of the nine indicators on the composite and the composite s impact on biomprop further the impact of individual indicators on biomprop can be estimated this approach has the flexibility to test model variations including correlations between indicator variables and grouping by taxa there were substantial differences in mean values of indicator variables and lai under different irrigation treatments observed in our study see table 4 analysis of variance anova verified the irrigation induced differences in lai and abax were statistically significant to account for this variability we opted to use the values of indicators in the 100 treatment of each block as predictors in our modeling of the composite in the two deficit irrigation treatments this approach simulates the real world conditions where selections for drought resistance will need to be made from trials conducted under near ideal growing conditions which is the standard that poplar breeders commonly use structural equation models rely on the same statistical assumptions as multiple regression namely independence normal distribution and symmetrical residuals these assumptions were checked by visually inspecting the residual plots of independent linear regressions of each indicator on biomprop this exercise revealed skewing of residuals driven by a small number of outliers on closer inspection it was determined that there were three outliers where the biomprop was greater than 1 5 i e the average biomass index was more than 50 greater in deficit irrigation treatments than it was in the 100 treatment no consistent spatial or clonal pattern could be determined to explain the anomaly and it was assumed that clones in these subplots had possibly accessed groundwater reserves the depth of water table according to a monitoring well adjacent to the test site was around 3 m the combination of the young age of the plants and regular surface irrigation in the agricultural setting was expected to prevent rooting to that depth puri et al 1994 but evidence suggests some populus can access ground water at depths of 3 m or more zhu et al 2009 these three outliers were removed from the data for analysis visual inspection of residual plots without the outliers suggested that assumptions were satisfactorily met an additional assumption of the model is that the composite variable has no error in other words drought resistance as represented in the analysis is composed completely of the nine indicator variables thus it should be understood that drought resistance as modeled may be an incomplete representation of plants true drought resistance statistical analyses were carried out in r team 2017 the loadings for each of the indicator variables were determined using a linear mixed model lmm where biomprop was a function of the nine indicator variables δ13c chlor la pl pd abax adax mvd and lma as fixed effects and block and genotype within block as random effects the loading factors in the sem were manually set to the coefficients of the lmm in the lavaan r package rosseel 2012 which was used to test the model fit determine standardized coefficients and their statistical significance p 0 05 following lefcheck 2019 three alternative variations of the model that included correlations between indicator variables were also tested the first included correlations between indicators reported to have statistically significant pearson s correlation coefficients in the literature bonhomme et al 2008 brocious and hacke 2016 dillen et al 2008 marron et al 2007 monclus et al 2006 the second included correlations between indicator variables that had statistically significant coefficients greater than 0 5 in our data see fig 1 the third included all correlations between all pairs of indicator variables we also conducted multi group analysis to assess the impact of hybrid taxa 3 results 3 1 growth response to irrigation compared to the 100 irrigation treatment study wide average biomass index decreased by 22 0 and 37 7 in the 80 and 60 irrigation treatments respectively the average clonal decrease ranged from 6 to 36 and 6 51 in the 80 and 60 irrigation treatments respectively there were numerous changes in clonal rankings between irrigation treatments in both biomass index and biomprop the top six clones top third in biomprop under both the 60 and 80 irrigation treatment had individuals from the high mid and low δ13c categories based on the 2011 trial analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant level of interaction between δ13c categories and irrigation treatments p 0 05 data not presented the mean and standard deviation for each indicator value used in modeling can be found in table s1 for each clone the δ13c values and ranking of some clones did change relative to the 2011 trial however a wide range of variation in δ13c 19 2949 21 4516 was still observed indicating that we met our goal of testing a diverse group of clones so that generalizable indicators of drought resistance could be identified 3 2 model fitting the model in fig 1 was successfully fit to the data with a p value from the chi squared test of 0 97 indicating a good fit p values 0 05 are rejected as poor fit and an r squared of 0 19 in all cases forcing any correlations between indicator variables resulted in a poorly fit model chi squared p value 0 001 we also compared a model variation where the intercept and path coefficients could vary by taxa with a constrained version that fixed intercepts and path coefficients as the same for all taxa and found no statistical difference based on a chi squared difference test p value 0 80 the lack of statistical difference between the universal model and the model that allowed coefficients to vary by taxa indicated that a universal model explained the data as well as the taxa specific model with a higher level of parsimony thus a universal model that did not include grouping by taxa was used for final analysis 3 3 model results the only indicator variable with a statistically significant effect on the composite drought resistance was abax p value 0 02 abaxial stomatal density also had the largest path coefficient at 0 858 indicating that a one standard deviation change in abax is associated with a 0 858 standard deviation change in drought resistance the path coefficients for drought resistance and irrigation treatment were 0 301 and 0 314 respectively and both were statistically significant p value 0 001 the path coefficient for drought resistance can be interpreted the same as the indicator variable path coefficients a one standard deviation change in drought resistance is associated with a 0 301 standard deviation change in biomprop the interpretation of the path coefficient for irrigation treatment is slightly different it represents the standard deviation change in biomprop associated with the difference between the 60 irrigation level and the 80 irrigation level the impact of indicator variables on biomprop can be determined by multiplying their path coefficient to drought resistance by the path coefficient of drought resistance on biomprop thus a one standard deviation change in abax is associated with a 0 858 0 301 0 258 standard deviation change in biomprop the standard deviation of abax was 107 pores mm 2 and the standard deviation of biomprop was 0 28 so in real units the model suggests that an increase of 107 additional pores mm 2 on the abaxial side of the leaf is associated with an approximate 7 smaller decrease in biomass under water stress fig 2 to illustrate practical implications of the study on selecting varieties for use in plantations with less water availability or lower water inputs we compared the average biomprop of the six top and bottom ranked clones in terms of abax and the composite drought resistance to the trial population average table 5 the comparisons in table 5 suggest that the composite drought resistance is a superior selection criterion and that both drought resistance and abax are more effective as selection agents when water is more limited abax alone appears ineffective as a criterion to identify varieties that will perform better than the trial population under 80 irrigation in fact the six lowest ranked clones in abax outperform the population while the six highest ranked clones did worse the top six varieties in terms of drought resistance however substantially outperform the population average in drought response at both irrigation levels at the 60 irrigation level there was a 28 4 spread between the average of the bottom six and top six clones in drought tolerance and the top six clones averaged 19 higher biomprop than the trial population 4 discussion we found that the traits leaf chlorophyll content chlor minor vein density mvd and abaxial stomatal density abax had the largest impact on the composite drought resistance parameter however only abaxial stomatal density was statistically significant δ13c has the lowest impact and individuals across a range of δ13c displayed similar drought resistance the composite parameter drought resistance explained a statistically significant change in biomass index biomprop or the proportional growth in the drought treatments compared with the 100 irrigation treatment the drought resistance parameter performed well at predicting drought resistant vs drought sensitive clones at both the 80 irrigation level and 60 irrigation level however this parameter is a composite and therefore represents the combination of nine leaf physiological and morphological metrics abaxial stomatal density alone was able to adequately predict drought resistant vs drought sensitive clones at the high drought treatment 60 irrigation but performed poorly at the 80 irrigation treatment δ13c had little to no explanatory power in our composite drought resistance parameter similar results were found by monclus et al 2009 where δ13c was not correlated with drought tolerance in p deltoides p trichocarpa hybrids δ13c was predicted to have a significant explanatory effect on drought resistance given its correlation with leaf level water use efficiency or the amount of carbon assimilation per unit stomatal conductance occurring in the leaf factors including the use of stored carbon to produce leaf tissue as well as the use of respired carbon with a more negative atmospheric signature da silveira et al 1989 may complicate the use of δ13c to compare the water use efficiency across clones however young populus plantations derived from cuttings should exhibit less variability with regard to carbon sources due to potentially low stored carbon and a well mixed atmospheric source differences in mesophyll conductance also have the potential to affect δ13c due to its impact on the concentration of co2 at the chloroplast this effect is potentially independent of stomatal conductance or water losses from the leaf and therefore water use efficiency broeckx et al 2014 le roux et al 2001 soolanayakanahally et al 2009 warren and adams 2006 carbon isotope discrimination has been put forth in several studies as a promising leaf trait for the selection of clones with high water use efficiency bonhomme et al 2008 marron et al 2005 however our results show that δ13c may not yield the necessary information to make this determination given its lack of explanatory power in predicting drought resistance carbon isotope discrimination approximates photosynthetic assimilation per unit stomatal conductance or intrinsic water use efficiency however water losses from leaves transpiration also depend on atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd which could differ for the same stomatal conductance under differing environmental conditions seibt et al 2008 likewise differing stomatal conductance could result in the same transpiration rate high stomatal conductance at low vpd vs low stomatal conductance at high vpd potentially uncoupling δ13c from water use per unit photosynthesis while poplar clones planted in the same location likely experience similar atmospheric conditions and vpd differences in boundary layer conductance due to differing leaf sizes and crown characteristics could potentially affect relationships between stomatal conductance and transpiration rates across clones farquhar et al 1989 likewise whole tree water use efficiency biomass whole tree water use is potentially a more relevant trait compared with leaf level estimates of water use efficiency seibt et al 2008 for selecting individuals with high water use efficiency and drought resistance but is more difficult to estimate carbon isotopic discrimination may not have exhibited explanatory power in predicting drought resistance across clones because increasing water use efficiency is just one of a number of strategies that plants can employ to resist drought conditions monclus et al 2006 trees can also alter carbon allocation patterns to increase rooting depth and decrease leaf areas that need to be supported by water uptake indeed a few outliers in this study exhibited substantially higher biomass in the 60 irrigation treatment compared to 100 irrigation and this was considered evidence of access to groundwater at the particular location that they were planted in addition particularly for populus changes in leaf area represent an adaptive response to drought larchevêque et al 2011 and have potential as an indicator of drought resistance monclus et al 2006 found that the best predictor of drought resistance in p deltoides p nigra hybrids was the ratio of leaf area under optimal water versus drought conditions finally in the hot and dry growing conditions of this study water losses can serve the purpose of evaporative cooling to maintain leaf functioning mahan and upchurch 1988 marchin et al 2016 in addition to providing carbon dioxide for photosynthesis making increased water use efficiency a potential liability to overall plant productivity chaves et al 2016 abaxial stomatal density was found to be the only leaf parameter that had a significant effect on the composite drought tolerance parameter and was found to distinguish drought resistant and drought sensitive clones at the 60 irrigation level stomatal density has been found in other studies to exhibit high plasticity among leaf traits cao et al 2012 kassahun et al 2020 sack et al 2006 and its variability across leaves will affect gas exchange internal leaf co2 concentrations and leaf level water use efficiency cao et al 2012 franks et al 2015 because of the generally high correlation between stomatal size and density drake et al 2013 larger stomatal densities likely signify smaller stomata that have been shown to have faster response times quickly achieving optimal stomatal conductance during favorable conditions and quickly closing during unfavorable conditions drake et al 2013 monclus et al 2006 also identified stomatal density as a parameter of interest to select genotypes with high productivity and water use efficiency although they found that stomatal density exhibited a negative correlation with biomass and a positive correlation with δ13c leaf traits such as stomatal density lma vein density and carbon isotope discrimination are known to be highly variable depending on the position of the leaf along the stem axis and the microenvironment prevailing at the leaf position al afas et al 2007 although the leaf rank was normalized across genotypes to account for this variability as similar leaf rank may not necessarily reflect the same development age if genotypes display different growth rates the variation should have been further controlled by sampling leaves near the end of the growing season as plants were setting bud nonetheless leaf sampling variability may have contributed to the relatively low r squared value of the model our ability to manage water in these systems through varietal selection could be improved with future work that considers large populations and the degree to which drought resistance is under genetic control this could be done with traditional progeny trials with experimental drought treatments containing multiple families each with multiple individuals progeny trials will help determine the heritability or genetic basis of individual indicator variables and selection indices analogous to our composite variable can be developed to help advance breeding programs robinson et al 1951 molecular methods utilizing marker assisted selection for one or more traits are also likely to be beneficial in identifying drought resistance varieties for deployment and breeding in addition experiments that simulate periodic and stochastic water stress events more similar to natural water regimes may provide valuable insights that cannot be captured in trials with systematic irrigation reduction replicated studies that include more genotypes per hybrid taxa may reveal that different indicators are effective at predicting drought resistance in different taxa while the model in this study that allowed coefficients to vary by taxa was not statistically different than the universal model used for analysis it is possible the lack of difference was because the number of genotypes per taxa was too small to facilitate statistical detection given the variety of strategies populus spp can employ to resist drought the best predictor of drought resistance may vary from population to population however our results indicate abaxial stomatal density and the drought resistance composite have the potential to predict drought resistance across a broad range of taxa and drought resistance strategies making them potentially useful as selection criteria for hybrid poplar breeders working with numerous individuals from multiple populations and taxa 5 conclusion one of the greatest production challenges for widespread adoption of short rotation hybrid poplar for bioenergy is developing cropping methods for abandoned or marginal agricultural ground focusing plantation establishment on poorer quality land is a key strategy because it avoids direct competition with food production does not require replacement of existing native forests and can greatly reduce production costs for growers stanton et al 2020 the limiting factor for much of the available marginal agricultural land globally is water availability thus water management is a key challenge for short rotation hybrid poplar plantations a key component of water management in these systems is selection and deployment of elite clonal varieties that are able to maintain high levels of productivity under moderate water stress what volaire 2018 calls drought resistance while a number of selection criteria related to drought resistance have been suggested in recent years δ13c has come to prominence as the method of choice for selecting drought resistant varieties dillen et al 2008 marron et al 2005 however under the conditions of this study δ13c was a very poor predictor of drought resistance while abaxial stomatal density a much more cost effective sampling criteria proved adequate for selecting varieties that had higher drought resistance on average than the study population in more severe drought conditions the composite variable while more time consuming and costly to calculate was even better at discriminating varieties with relatively low and high drought resistance under multiple water availability regimes this suggests that δ13c may not be the best criterion for selecting drought resistant clones and that identifying varieties capable of high production in areas with limited water availability may require consideration of multiple plant traits simultaneously declaration of competing

10231,irrigated agriculture is the dominant user of world s fresh water which feeds the world s growing population conflicts between stakeholders incompatibility of economic social and environmental development and uncertainties in water supply and demand restrict the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture this study developed a multi scale multi objective programming model for simultaneous optimal allocation of irrigation water and cropland to balance conflicts between farmers income and sustainable development of irrigation districts reflected in economic social and environmental aspects consideration of the joint uncertainties of water supply and demand helps provide practical and indicative schemes for agricultural water and land allocation the developed model was applied to a real case study in an irrigation district in northeast china farmers income net economic benefit resources allocation equity and global warming potential were coordinated by optimally allocating limited water and cropland resources to different crops in different subareas under different combinational scenarios of water supply and demand the performance of the model was evaluated based on the concept of adaptability which can help realize the degree of ability of the irrigated agricultural system to adapt to changing environment the developed model can help plan irrigation

agricultural water and land resources are interactive and are connected to food security zeng et al 2018 the shortage of aiw has a knock on effect on cropland use this requires a simultaneous allocation of aiw and cropland to effectively mitigate water scarcity optimization modeling such as dynamic programming linear nonlinear programming intelligent programming methods and their combinations is effective to determine optimal allocations of aiw and cropland use patterns das et al 2015 gong et al 2020 li et al 2020d for example xie et al 2018 proposed an integrated model for irrigation water resources allocation and land resources utilization management considering the limited surface water and groundwater random effective rainfall and imprecise crop water requirements linker 2020 presented a model based optimization scheme for the allocation of cropping areas and water which can avoid repeated simulations of crop models with each crop model being used independently outside the main optimization procedure tang et al 2020 developed a remote sensing based multiobjective approach to formulate sustainable agricultural land and water resources management strategies at a grid scale these studies provided innovative approaches for optimally managing aiw and land resources the optimal allocation of aiw and cropland resources is a large system characterized by multiple scales e g farmland and regional scales in an irrigation district id jiang et al 2019 the decisions for aiw and cropland use patterns at different scales are mutually connected for example aiw and cropland resources at lower scale e g farmland scale will be allocated within the restrictions of water and land availability from the upper scale e g regional scale while aiw and cropland use patterns at the upper scale will be optimized on the basis of water requirement and crop yield production value from the lower scale to that end bi level optimization modeling for agricultural water and or land has recently been proposed for example jiang et al 2016 developed a process based regional economic optimization model for maximizing irrigation water use efficiency and economic benefit of an irrigation system the model is a two level optimization model with combined use of an agro hydrological model swap epic zhang et al 2019a b proposed a bi level programming model with the integration of nerlove supply response model and interval fuzzy credibility constraint for planning crop planting area which can be an effective way to plan agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions however the simultaneous allocation of aiw and cropland in an id is fraught with complexities in the conflicting use of aiw and cropland when stakeholders at different scales have incompatible interests jiang et al 2020 for example at the farmland scale the stakeholders are farmers who pursue higher earning to improve their living conditions while at the regional scale the stakeholders are always managers who are more interested in comprehensive benefit from economic social and environmental aspects to promote the sustainable development of the id aiw and cropland allocation patterns will be different at different scales for different purposes previous correlational studies did not either better identify and handle relations between benefit of farmers and sustainable development of ids in a large system or ignored the interrelation of aiw and cropland as a result it is deemed important to develop a comprehensive optimization model from a multi scale perspective to pursue a win win solution of farmers income and id s sustainable development by effectively allocating aiw and cropland use resources synchronously water supply and demand are two all important components that intensely dominate the patterns of aiw and cropland allocation the variations of water supply and demand have led to the sustainable development of an id that tends to be vulnerable li et al 2020b the annual fluctuations of weather conditions and human activities have resulted in variations in both water supply and water demand yu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 which will further generate various patterns of aiw and cropland allocation due to changing water budgets however the changing trends for water supply and demand are usually asynchronous in other words the wet or dry conditions for water supply and demand do not necessarily have a one to one correspondence this gives rise to questions such as how do awi and cropland use patterns respond to different combinations of wet and dry conditions of water supply and demand what are the corresponding occurrence probabilities of different patterns consideration of such uncertainties will promote the more realistic patterns of awi and cropland resources allocation however such consideration is limited to the patterns of awi and cropland allocation in a large scale system the re allocation of awi and cropland use needs to be evaluated to help realize how the changes of awi and cropland use patterns affect the performance of agricultural systems and thus help make informed decisions about awi and cropland use however this has often been ignored in previous studies on agricultural water and land allocation some indicators such as water resources carrying capacity systems synergy and sustainability are often used to evaluate the performance of water and land use in agricultural systems wang et al 2019 novoa et al 2019 li et al 2020c among them adaptability management can effectively deal with water shortage and identify the adaptability of aiw allocation and cropland use to the changing environment which will contribute to making more accurate decisions rong et al 2020 thereinto optimization based adaptive management evaluation through the connection of a series of indicators is a potential way to gain insights into the performance of the large scale optimization model for aiw and cropland resources allocation under uncertainty therefore to tackle the above complexities developing a comprehensive multi scale model framework to seek optimal aiw and cropland use patterns in order to promote farmers income and sustainable development of an id under uncertainties of water supply and demand is necessary and significant but has rarely been considered in the existing literature the main contributions of this study are the following 1 conflicts of interests of farmers and system s decision makers as well as conflicts between economy society and environment are simultaneously balanced which will help promote the sustainable development of an irrigation district 2 aiw and cropland use are jointly allocated to different crops in different regions considering uncertainties in both water supply and water demand which will contribute to the efficient use of agricultural water and land resources and how to cope with the changing environment 3 the adaptability evaluation was conducted to assess the performance of aiw allocation and cropland use patterns under uncertainty which will help realize how the changes of aiw and cropland use patterns affect the system s resistance stability and resilience and thus help choose the optimal aiw and cropland use patterns the developed model was then applied to a real world case study in jinxi id northeast china results provide insights into trade off among different stakeholders farmers and managers targets economic benefits social equity and farm environment and allocation of strategies of aiw and cropland use 2 methodology 2 1 system generalization we developed a two level large system optimization model for quantifying connections and balancing conflicts of water and land resources allocation between farmland scale and regional scale in an id the optimization model for each scale was established based on their respective goals and the two optimization models for each scale in the large system were interconnected uncertainties in water supply and demand were considered to help generate the aiw allocation and cropland use patterns that can cope with changing environment the adaptability evaluation for the patterns of water and land use based on the large system optimization model was done to help determine the performance of optimization in summary the following three parts constituted an integrated system for aiw and cropland allocation under uncertainty 1 establishment of the multi scale optimization model for the allocation of aiw and cropland resources 2 joint uncertainties of water supply and demand and 3 adaptability evaluation of allocation performance the content contained and the connections of the three parts are shown in fig 1 each part of the system is now discussed 2 2 multi scale optimization model the model contains two scales farmland and regional the objective of the farmland scale is to maximize farmers income while the objective of the regional scale is to promote sustainable development of an id for an irrigation system the sustainability can be considered in relation to socioeconomic development and the protection of natural resources liu et al 2008 in this study the sustainability was defined to balance the conflicts between economic social and environmental effects to the maximum for the harmonious use of agricultural water and land resources the aim of both scales is to optimize aiw and cropland resources farmland scale for different crops regional scale for different sub regions the two scales are coordinated through the exchange of information of water supply amount function of system economic benefit and water supply amount and function of ghg emissions and cropland use 2 2 1 farmland scale the objective of this scale is to maximize the total farmers income for each region which can be quantified by the difference between revenue from planting and costs of planting and water consumption

benefit social effect quantified as resources allocation equity and environmental effect quantified as greenhouse gas ghg emissions from planting a multi objective programming can help achieve this goal the objective functions can now be expressed as follows 1 economic effect this objective is to maximize the economic net benefit from irrigation which can be quantified by the difference between revenue and water management cost the revenue can be further quantified based on the function of economic benefit and irrigation water amount from the farmland scale feedback the objective can be expressed as follows 9 r s e c o n o m i c max i 1 i f i q i s u r q i g r o q i s u r q i g r o i 1 i δ s u r q i s u r i 1 n δ g r o q i g r o where r s e c o n o m i c is the objective function of economic effect at the regional scale yuan f i q i s u r q i g r o is the function of economic benefit and water supply both surface water and groundwater for the ith sub region yuan m3 and δ s u r

increase the satisfaction of water supply and stability of an id from a regional perspective the gini coefficient based on lorenz curve is effective to reflect resources allocation equity hu et al 2016 malakar et al 2018 the gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and the resources allocation can be more equal if it is closer to 0 this objective function can be expressed as follows 10 r s s o c i a

the regional scale dimensionless and p is the precipitation amount m3 3 environmental effect the ghg emissions are used to reflect the environmental effect as planting contributes much to global warming the global warming potential gwp is effective to quantify the combined effect of main ghg including co2 ch4 and n2o guillermo et al 2016 this objective is to minimize gwp and can be expressed as follows 11 r s e n v i r o n m e n t a l min g w p min i 1 i a i f i c o 2 a i j g r a i n a i k c a s h 44 12 f i c h 4 a i j r i c e g r a i n 16 12 21 f i n 2 o a i j g r a i n a i k c a s h 44

can refer to xiao et al 2019 and li et al 2020c the above objective function is subject to the following constraints 1 surface water availability surface water supply to all the sub regions should not exceed the total surface water availability from river flow 12 i 1 i q i s u r t q s u r where t q s u r is the total surface water availability m3 2 groundwater availability similarly groundwater

limitation 15 a i min a i a i max i where a i min and a i max are the minimum and maximum available croplands of the ith sub region ha 2 2 3 solution method the developed optimization model for aiw and cropland allocation patterns involves two scales thus the structure of the model is a two level large system model with the upper level corresponding to the regional scale and the lower level corresponding to the farmland scale the models of the two levels were solved independently and the decomposition coordination method shangguan et al 2002 was used to tackle the interaction between the two levels the detailed solution steps are summarized as follows step 1 give a set of initial values of water supply i e q i s u r and q i g r o and the total available cropland area a i q i s u r q i g r o and a i are coordinated variables then solve the optimization model of the farmland scale a linear programming model lp the optimal allocation of irrigation water surface water and groundwater cropland use for each crop in each sub region and the corresponding objective function values can be obtained based on these the feedback functions of f i q i s u r q i g r o and f i c o 2 a i j g r a i n a i k c a s h f i c h 4 a i j r i c e g r a i n and f i n 2 o a i j g r a i n a i k c a s h can be fitted which will be input into the regional level step 2 based on the output of step 1 solve the optimization model of the regional scale a multi objective non linear programming model monlp model the monlp model was transformed into a single objective nonlinear programming nlp model based on the integration of membership functions and satisfaction degree λ 0 λ 1 singh and yadav 2015 li et al 2020d then the optimal q i s u r q i g r o and a i can be obtained which will be transferred back to the farmland scale and new coordinated variables meanwhile the satisfaction degree λ which is the objective function of the transformed monlp model can be thus obtained step 3 with the feedback of updated q i s u r q i g r o and a i the model at the farmland scale was optimized once again and generated new feedback functions for driving the regional scale again then a new λ value was obtained this process would be repeatedly iterated until the following criterion was satisfied 16 λ m 1 λ m λ m ω where m is the number of iterations and ω is the maximum threshold of the difference between iterations and is set to 0 005 jiang et al 2016 to clarify lp in step 1 and nlp in step 2 are classical mathematical programming that can be directly solved by coding them in any mathematical programming software 2 3 uncertainties in water supply and demand water supply and water demand are random and their respective dry and wet conditions are in incomplete correspondence different dry and wet combinations of water supply and demand will result in different awi and cropland allocation patterns the aim of this section is to determine the occurrence probabilities of possible combinations of dry and wet conditions of water supply and demand the combinations are regarded as scenarios and thus generate a comprehensive awi and cropland allocation patterns considering all these scenarios which will be beneficial for decision makers to grasp the overall situation of agricultural water and land use copula functions were used to address such uncertainties which are capable of addressing the joint effect of two or more random variables zhang and singh 2012 candela et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 details for copula functions can be referred to li et al 2013 zhang et al 2019b wang et al 2020a b the determination of the copula function is based on the marginal distributions of the two random variables i e water supply and water demand and the determination of marginal distributions is dependent on the accuracy of parameter estimation of each type of hydrological distributions e g normal log normal gamma pearson ⅲ generalized extreme value logistic pareto weibull distributions etc in summary the uncertainties of water supply and demand can be quantified using the following steps step 1 determine water supply and water demand with long series data step 2 estimate parameters of various hydrologic distributions based on moment estimation me maximum likelihood estimation mle and principle of maximum entropy pme step 3 fit the theoretical frequency curve with actual data based on different parameter estimates and select the best fit curves of water supply and demand using ols and aic criterion kashani et al 2016 banks and joyner 2017 then regard them as marginal distributions step 4 build various types of copula functions and select the most appropriate copula function based on the squared euclidean distance dong et al 2015 step 5 assume both water supply and demand have three hydrological characteristics wet normal and dry conditions and use the cumulative probability to divide them into different segments step 6 determine the joint occurrence probabilities of different combinations of dry and wet conditions between water supply and demand based on the criterion from guo et al 2015 step 7 calculate the comprehensive aiw and cropland allocation pattern level using the formula ϑ s 1 s p s ϑ s p s is the joint occurrence probability of water supply and demand under scenario s and ϑ s is the aiw or cropland allocation amount under scenario s 2 4 adaptability assessment the adaptability assessment in this study was based on the principle of dynamic system for an open and complex system of agricultural water and land allocation the destabilization with certain strength from external environment will give rise to changes in the state of the system this change will cause the system to deviate from the existing state the aim of the adaptability assessment is to help decision makers realize the adaptive capacity of agricultural water and land allocation system in the changing environment i e variation of water supply and demand for this study the status trends of a system over time can be described as differential equation based on dynamic mechanism wang et al 2019 17 d x d t f t x g t x where x is the system s status variable d x d t is the changing rate of x f t x is the coping ability of self adjusting to the perturbation at time t and g t x is the driving force of perturbation from the changing environment at time t f t x contains three aspects including resistance stability and resilience while g t x can be further quantified by sensibility guo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 hence based on formula 19 the mathematical formulation of the adaptability assessment can be further expressed as 18 h a d p t a b i l i t y f s i r e s i s tan c e i s t a b i l i t y i r e s i l i e n c e 3 s where h a d p t a b i l i t y is the adaptability of the system f represents the ability to cope with the changing environment s is the sensibility i resistance i stability and i resilience are the resistance stability and resilience of the system respectively h a d p t a b i l i t y 1 represents the adaptability of the system which is larger smaller than the driving force of destabilization of the changing environment manifesting adaptability in adaptability the determination of adaptability is based on various indexes and the corresponding weights of i resistance i stability and i resilience according to the principles of manipulability comparability and hierarchy this study established an index system which included target layer criterion layer and index layer the criterion layer included four parts i e sensitivity stability resistance and resilience there are in total 12 indexes based on the results of optimization model details of the index system are shown in table 1 the weights were determined based on the entropy weight method delgado and romero 2016 3 application 3 1 study area jinxi id in heilongjiang province northeast china was chosen as the study area see fig 2 the geographical coordinates are 131 30 132 37 eastern longitude and 46 48 47 14 northern latitude jinxi id has continental monsoon climate characteristics the average temperature is 3 6 and the annual average relative humidity is 67 the total sunshine hours is 2151 h the average precipitation is 519 mm and evaporation is 750 mm there are four sub regions in jinxi id including songhuajiang jinshan huama and toulin sub regions with the total cultivated area being 1 01 105 ha agriculture is the main water user and irrigation water accounts for approximately 90 both surface water and groundwater are water supplies to ensure food production the surface water mainly comes from songhua river and groundwater in jinxi id is overdrawn as an important grain production base in heilongjiang province rice corn and soybean are the main crops there is also a certain proportion of cropland for planting vegetables and various melons 3 2 data collection the effective application of the developed framework was based on input parameters mainly including two parts i e hydrological parameters and social economic environmental parameters the surface water supply originated from songhua river and we used the long series runoff volume of songhua river at jiamusi hydrometric station from 1954 to 2015 to fit the copula function we also estimated crop evapotranspiration based on crop coefficient k c and reference evapotranspiration et 0 to fit the copula function et 0 was estimated on the basis of meteorological data including sunshine duration highest lowest and average temperatures average wind velocity and average relative humidity from 1954 to 2015 which were obtained from meteorological observations networks in china for details on calculating et 0 one can refer to allen et al 1998 the variation of runoff and et 0 is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the value of k c is in table s4 in the supplementary material the allowable groundwater withdrawal was 1 61 108 m3 based on engineering feasibility study report of jinxi irrigation district and water resources argumentation report of jinxi irrigation district the social economic environmental parameters were mainly from government reports such as engineering feasibility study report of jinxi irrigation district water resources verification report of jinxi irrigation district water resources argumentation report of jinxi irrigation district and engineering environmental impact report of jinxi irrigation district statistical yearbook of fujin city and published references shang et al 2015 li et al 2019 table s1 lists the input data related to different crops including crop market price crop production costs dosage of fertilizer pesticide diesel oil agricultural films irrigation electricity etc in this study crop production costs included costs for the utilization of fertilizer farm machinery pesticide irrigation and drainage facilities seed costs for labor and other costs the proportion of these costs is listed in table s2 in the supplementary material based on the statistic yearbook of fujin city table s3 lists data related to both crops and sub regions mainly including crop planting area and yield per unit area for both grain crops and cash crops thereinto the crop planting area included the maximum area and the minimum area for each crop to ensure the output of jinxi irrigation district and also to guarantee model boundary according to the engineering feasibility study report of jinxi irrigation district crop planting area of jinxi irrigation district would increase in 2030 hence the planed area for each crop was determined as the upper range threshold while the planting area for each crop under the status quo was determined as the lower range threshold some environmental parameters were needed to support the framework such as co2 emission coefficients were 8 2 12 1 3 7 and 22 7 kg co2 ep kg for the use of fertilizer pesticide diesel oil and agricultural films respectively and was 1 1 kg co2 ep kwh for the use of irrigation electricity the emission coefficient of ch4 was 80 2 kg ha and the emission coefficient of n2o for using fertilizer was 0 54 kg kg the n2o emission coefficient of soil for rice corn soybean vegetables and melons were 4 59 2 53 2 29 4 94 and 4 23 kg ha respectively the prices of using surface water and groundwater at the farmland scale were 0 102 and 0 29 yuan m3 respectively the costs for surface water supply and groundwater supply at the regional scale were 0 07 yuan m3 and 0 11 yuan m3 respectively the cost for water supply mainly included operating cost and depreciation expense the operating cost included engineering maintenance cost management cost pumping energy charge and insurance expenses for fixed assets details for these costs are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material 4 results and discussion 4 1 uncertainties in water supply and demand this study adopted frequently used normal extreme value pearson ⅲ logistic and pareto distributions to estimate distributions parameters using me mle and pme results of parameter estimation of streamflow from jiamusi hydrologic station and et 0 are shown in table s5 in the supplementary material based on table s5 in the supplementary material the appropriate hydrological distributions can be fitted and selected on the basis of ols and aic and the test results are shown in table 2 the ole and aic tests show that the pearson ⅲ had a good fit with actual conditions of both runoff and et 0 using me therefore this study selected pearson ⅲ distribution as the marginal distributions of runoff and et 0 the scale parameter α shape parameter β and location parameter γ of the distribution were 5 74 14 13 and 16 31 for runoff respectively and are 21 96 6 94 and 598 14 for et 0 then copula functions including gaussian copula t copula clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula and ali mikhail haq copula were fitted and the square euclidean distances d 2 for these copula functions were 0 0214 0 0210 0 2277 0 0212 0 2277 and 0 4057 it was obvious that d 2 for t copula was the smallest which was selected as the copula function in this study and the fitted function can be expressed as follows c u v t k 1 u t k 1 v 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 1 s 2 2 ρ s t t 2 k 1 ρ 2 d s d t where u represents the runoff and v represents the et 0 ρ 0 5666 k 13 7128 the joint occurrence probabilities of runoff and et 0 were obtained from the joint distribution shown in fig 3 there were in total nine scenarios i e nine combinations of wet and dry conditions of runoff and et 0 the occurrence probability of wet dry synchronization 3 scenarios was 32 16 among which the occurrence probability of scenario of runoff normal et 0 normal was 29 14 contributing to 90 6 while scenarios of runoff wet et 0 wet and runoff dry et 0 dry were basically the same and they contributed to 9 4 correspondingly the occurrence probability of wet dry asynchronization 6 scenarios was 67 84 and there was little difference in the value of occurrence probabilities for the corresponding combinations ranging from 10 43 to 13 06 these occurrence probabilities were important because they could further help decision makers realize what the possibility of different water shortage risks was combining with the following water allocation schemes in order to provide the corresponding solutions timely 4 2 agricultural irrigation water allocation at regional scale by solving the multi scale model awi allocations under different scenarios were obtained fig 4 shows the awi allocation at the regional scale under the 9 scenarios from the perspective of water supply it was obvious that water allocation under the wet condition was the most then was that under the normal condition and the least was that under the dry condition this indicates that allocating more water would present positive effects on the id s sustainable development there was a clear correspondence between awi allocation and water supply that is more water supply resulted in more awi allocation at the regional scale however the correspondence between awi allocation and water demand was irregular water supply was more sensitive to awi allocation than was water demand the most unfavorable condition was that water supply was in the dry condition and water demand was in the wet condition as seen from the figure the aiw allocation in such scenario was the least i e 3 01 108 m3 the managers of id should pay attention to this scenario as the occurrence probability of such an adverse condition for id s sustainable management was 13 for different sub regions under the most likely scenario i e sn dn the water allocation to huama sub region was the most accounting for 39 43 1 46 108 m3 the second largest water allocation sub region was toulin 1 25 108 m3 accounting for 33 62 the third was jinshan sub region 0 81 108 m3 accounting for 21 85 and the last was songhuajiang sub region 0 19 108 m3 accounting for only 5 1 based on water allocation amounts and the corresponding occurrence probabilities under each scenario the comprehensive water allocation was 3 73 108 m3 this value could be regarded as a planned value for irrigation water allocation this value was more accurate as it considered all possible changing conditions of water supply and water demand 4 3 agricultural irrigation water allocation at farmland scale based on water allocation to different sub regions water allocations from different sources surface water and groundwater to different crops were obtained as shown in fig 5 a grain crops and b cash crops for any crop surface water was the main source of water allocation in the current situation the groundwater was overdrawn to guarantee crop output this study adjusted the structure of water use by re allocating the surface water and groundwater using the developed model based on the formula in step 7 in section 2 3 the optimal total groundwater use for all the crops of the whole irrigation district was obtained the value of which was decreased by 23 compared with the current groundwater use based on water resources argumentation reports hence the re allocation of water resources helped alleviate the situation of groundwater overexploitation and thus would help raise the groundwater level which contributed to improving the groundwater environment moreover it should be noted that the water availabilities for both surface water and groundwater that were input to the model were the net values for agricultural irrigation in other words the ecological water industrial water domestic water use had already been removed from the total water availability and the last water from the total water availability was used for agricultural irrigation therefore the re allocation of the surface water and groundwater would not cause a drop in other water use sections for grain crops water allocation to rice was much more than other crops rice was a water intensive crop however as rice s output per unit area was higher than corn and soybean and the quality of rice in jinxi id was good irrigating rice was still with irrigation superiority for cash crops water allocation per unit area to vegetables and melons had no significant difference no matter the kind of crop surface water allocation varied substantially with different scenarios while groundwater changed little unlike water allocation at the regional scale water allocation at the farmland scale was more sensitive to water demand the water allocation amount increased as water demand increased however the fluctuation of water demand under different scenarios was not as large as water supply specifically the et 0 values under wet normal and dry conditions were 3 76 108 m3 3 70 108 m3 and 3 62 108 m3 respectively this led to the slight variation of the water allocation at the farmland scale water allocations to rice corn soybean vegetables and melons were 4166 4613 m3 ha 2040 2259 m3 ha 1768 1958 m3 ha 3287 3646 m3 ha and 3287 3645 m3 ha respectively 4 4 cropland use patterns besides water allocation cropland use for different crops in different sub regions was another decision variable that was optimized based on the multi scale model fig 6 shows the optimal results of cropland use under different scenarios affected by both water supply and water supply the cropland use for different crops in different sub regions varied it was quite clear that rice had substantial advantages for planting especially for songhuajiang subarea the cropland use for rice occupied 92 this value was obtained considering the weighted average value of all the cropland use under the 9 scenarios grain crops including rice corn and soybean occupied approximately 97 of all the cropland use while cash crop including vegetables and melons only occupied less than 3 on the whole the total cropland use increased as water supply increased for example taking rice and corn the top two crops in terms of cropland use as an example if we fixed water demand under the normal condition the cropland use of rice would increase 12 5 under the scenario of sn dn and 29 7 under the scenario of sw dn compared with the baseline of sd dn the cropland use of rice would increase 14 9 under the scenario of sn dn and 31 9 under the scenario of sw dn compared with the baseline of sd dn considering all the scenarios the total cropland use fluctuated from 8 4 104 14 104 ha 4 5 trade off between economic social and environmental aspects the objective of the regional scale of the model development was to comprehensively consider economic social and environmental effects the three objectives associated with economic social and environmental aspects were conflicting that called for trade off taking the sn dn scenario as an example the occurrence probability was the most of all the scenarios 29 14 and by comparing the results of comprehensively considering all the three objectives if only economic objective was considered the net economic net benefit would increase by 4 with the total water allocation amount increasing by 3 7 if the focus was on the social effect with the gini coefficient as the quantification index the net economic benefit would decrease 4 6 while if environmental effect was given priority the net economic would decrease by nearly 10 such results showed that the three objectives were contradictory economic development would affect social aspect and environment to some extent in other words social and environmental development would slow down the pace of economic development considering all the scenarios economic benefit ranged from 13 63 108 to 22 81 108 yuan and gini coefficient ranged from 0 38 to 0 39 indicating that water resources allocation was relatively uniform co2 emission ranged from 4 19 108 to 6 95 108 kg the developed model balanced the three conflicting objectives while collaboratively optimizing water and land resources at both regional scale and farmland scale this could promote the sustainable development of the irrigation district rather than focusing on the economic benefit only as a traditional management mode from another perspective the re allocation of aiw and cropland resources helped promote the sustainability of the system in this study the sustainability degree was used to reflect how the degree of coordination of the three conflicting objectives at the regional scale i e economic social and environmental objectives we used a bilinear average metric to formulate trade offs among different objectives and made a quantitative assessment and the details for calculating the sustainability degree could be referred to nie et al 2019 larger value of the sustainability degree means more harmony of the system considering all the nine scenarios the sustainability degree of the system was 0 81 increasing 33 compared with that of status quo 4 6 adaptability the adaptability assessment of awi and cropland was based on the index system table 1 in which each index could be determined based on the optimal results of the two level optimization model and related statistic information the weight of each index was determined based on the entropy weight method and the weights were 0 0793 0 0698 0 0702 0 0748 0 0748 0 0831 0 1112 0 0777 0 1045 0 073 0 1067 and 0 0748 respectively corresponding to the 12 indexes in table 1 the sensibility stability resistance and resilience of the system are shown in fig 7 the system s sensibility maintained an upward trend both lower water supply and water demand would increase the sensibility the stability and resistance of the system presented a declining trend in which the descending amplitude of the resistance was smooth larger water supply and lower water demand could increase system s stability and resistance there was a negative correlation between water deficit and system s stability and resistance the system resilience was significantly affected by water demand presenting an increasing trend while lower water supply promoted a declining trend with a small range by comprehensively considering the effects of all the four state variables i e sensibility stability resistance and resilience the changing trend of the system s adaptability is shown in fig 8 results showed that water supply was a key factor for the system s adaptability for the jinxi id only when water supply was in the wet condition the system could present adaptability among them under the scenario of sw dd the system s adaptability approached the peak this was because under such a scenario the sensitivity of the system was lower while the stability resistance and resilience of the system were at a higher level in other cases the system s adaptability value was less than 1 representing inadaptability especially when water supply was in the dry level while water demand was in the wet level the adaptability of the system reached a minimum such a case is dangerous for the development of the agricultural system so decision makers should provide alternatives for water resources utilization to reduce economic loss and ensure food security this assessment could help decision makers realize which awi and cropland allocation scheme was relatively robust and risk averse decision makers might tend to select such resources allocation schemes for lower risk taking although this might generate lower benefit accordingly 5 conclusion a multi scale model for irrigation water and cropland resources allocation considering uncertainties in water supply demand is developed the main novelties of this study are 1 agricultural water and land resources are optimized simultaneously considering their interrelations in a more harmonious way by developing a two level large system optimization model the harmonious is reflected in two aspects the first is that the contradictions between different stakeholders i e farmers and managers in an irrigation district are coordinated the second is that the contradictions between economic social and environmental aspects in the irrigated agriculture are coordinated both of them will contribute to promote the sustainable development of irrigation districts 2 joint random uncertainties of water supply and water demand are integrated in the model framework to help improve the capacities of the use of agricultural water and land resources for changing hydrological elements 3 an optimization evaluation framework is proposed with input output relationship to re allocate agricultural water and cropland resources and thus evaluate their use patterns to help decision makers realize the situations in which agricultural water and land use is the optimal or the least optimal case for the development of the whole irrigation district the developed model framework was applied to a real world case study in northeast china to demonstrate its performance the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 more water presented positive effects on the sustainable development of the irrigation district and 3 73 108 m3 water was recommended for irrigation water resource planning which was determined considering all the possible wet dry conditions of water supply and demand 2 surface water allocation varied substantially with different wet dry scenarios of water supply and demand while groundwater allocation was insensitive to the changing water supply and demand in terms of different scales water allocation at the regional scale was more sensitive to the changes of water supply while the water allocation at the farmland scale was more sensitive to the changes of water demand 3 grain crops occupied nearly 97 of all the cropland use while cash crops only occupied 3 and the total cropland use had a positive correlation with water supply 4 both economic benefit and ghg emissions were sensitive to agricultural water and land and there was a trade off between economic and environmental development aspects the re allocation made agricultural water and land resources use of jinxi id relatively uniform 5 when water supply was in the dry level and water demand was in the wet level the ability of the agricultural water and land system to cope with the changing environment was the weakest such a condition was extremely unfavorable to the system development with the occurrence probability being 13 this study makes an attempt to integrate multi scale multi objective non linear programming model copula functions adaptability assessment into a modeling framework for supporting better agricultural water and land allocation plans in a more sustainable and realistic manner the developed framework is portable to other predominantly agricultural basins with scarce water resources supply future works are still needed to improve the applicability of the developed approach for

10231,irrigated agriculture is the dominant user of world s fresh water which feeds the world s growing population conflicts between stakeholders incompatibility of economic social and environmental development and uncertainties in water supply and demand restrict the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture this study developed a multi scale multi objective programming model for simultaneous optimal allocation of irrigation water and cropland to balance conflicts between farmers income and sustainable development of irrigation districts reflected in economic social and environmental aspects consideration of the joint uncertainties of water supply and demand helps provide practical and indicative schemes for agricultural water and land allocation the developed model was applied to a real case study in an irrigation district in northeast china farmers income net economic benefit resources allocation equity and global warming potential were coordinated by optimally allocating limited water and cropland resources to different crops in different subareas under different combinational scenarios of water supply and demand the performance of the model was evaluated based on the concept of adaptability which can help realize the degree of ability of the irrigated agricultural system to adapt to changing environment the developed model can help plan irrigation water and cropland resources in a sustainable way and can be a reference for similar irrigation systems worldwide keywords agricultural water and land allocation optimization stakeholders sustainability changing environment 1 introduction recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in water scarcity which is more pronounced for agriculture due to population growth and climate change the potential to explore additional water resources for agriculture will be limited because of looming water security and disputes in different water users cao et al 2015 it is important to reduce the use of agricultural irrigation water aiw which is the principal part of agricultural water by optimally allocating limited available water resources elleuch et al 2019 li et al 2020a agricultural water and land resources are interactive and are connected to food security zeng et al 2018 the shortage of aiw has a knock on effect on cropland use this requires a simultaneous allocation of aiw and cropland to effectively mitigate water scarcity optimization modeling such as dynamic programming linear nonlinear programming intelligent programming methods and their combinations is effective to determine optimal allocations of aiw and cropland use patterns das et al 2015 gong et al 2020 li et al 2020d for example xie et al 2018 proposed an integrated model for irrigation water resources allocation and land resources utilization management considering the limited surface water and groundwater random effective rainfall and imprecise crop water requirements linker 2020 presented a model based optimization scheme for the allocation of cropping areas and water which can avoid repeated simulations of crop models with each crop model being used independently outside the main optimization procedure tang et al 2020 developed a remote sensing based multiobjective approach to formulate sustainable agricultural land and water resources management strategies at a grid scale these studies provided innovative approaches for optimally managing aiw and land resources the optimal allocation of aiw and cropland resources is a large system characterized by multiple scales e g farmland and regional scales in an irrigation district id jiang et al 2019 the decisions for aiw and cropland use patterns at different scales are mutually connected for example aiw and cropland resources at lower scale e g farmland scale will be allocated within the restrictions of water and land availability from the upper scale e g regional scale while aiw and cropland use patterns at the upper scale will be optimized on the basis of water requirement and crop yield production value from the lower scale to that end bi level optimization modeling for agricultural water and or land has recently been proposed for example jiang et al 2016 developed a process based regional economic optimization model for maximizing irrigation water use efficiency and economic benefit of an irrigation system the model is a two level optimization model with combined use of an agro hydrological model swap epic zhang et al 2019a b proposed a bi level programming model with the integration of nerlove supply response model and interval fuzzy credibility constraint for planning crop planting area which can be an effective way to plan agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions however the simultaneous allocation of aiw and cropland in an id is fraught with complexities in the conflicting use of aiw and cropland when stakeholders at different scales have incompatible interests jiang et al 2020 for example at the farmland scale the stakeholders are farmers who pursue higher earning to improve their living conditions while at the regional scale the stakeholders are always managers who are more interested in comprehensive benefit from economic social and environmental aspects to promote the sustainable development of the id aiw and cropland allocation patterns will be different at different scales for different purposes previous correlational studies did not either better identify and handle relations between benefit of farmers and sustainable development of ids in a large system or ignored the interrelation of aiw and cropland as a result it is deemed important to develop a comprehensive optimization model from a multi scale perspective to pursue a win win solution of farmers income and id s sustainable development by effectively allocating aiw and cropland use resources synchronously water supply and demand are two all important components that intensely dominate the patterns of aiw and cropland allocation the variations of water supply and demand have led to the sustainable development of an id that tends to be vulnerable li et al 2020b the annual fluctuations of weather conditions and human activities have resulted in variations in both water supply and water demand yu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 which will further generate various patterns of aiw and cropland allocation due to changing water budgets however the changing trends for water supply and demand are usually asynchronous in other words the wet or dry conditions for water supply and demand do not necessarily have a one to one correspondence this gives rise to questions such as how do awi and cropland use patterns respond to different combinations of wet and dry conditions of water supply and demand what are the corresponding occurrence probabilities of different patterns consideration of such uncertainties will promote the more realistic patterns of awi and cropland resources allocation however such consideration is limited to the patterns of awi and cropland allocation in a large scale system the re allocation of awi and cropland use needs to be evaluated to help realize how the changes of awi and cropland use patterns affect the performance of agricultural systems and thus help make informed decisions about awi and cropland use however this has often been ignored in previous studies on agricultural water and land allocation some indicators such as water resources carrying capacity systems synergy and sustainability are often used to evaluate the performance of water and land use in agricultural systems wang et al 2019 novoa et al 2019 li et al 2020c among them adaptability management can effectively deal with water shortage and identify the adaptability of aiw allocation and cropland use to the changing environment which will contribute to making more accurate decisions rong et al 2020 thereinto optimization based adaptive management evaluation through the connection of a series of indicators is a potential way to gain insights into the performance of the large scale optimization model for aiw and cropland resources allocation under uncertainty therefore to tackle the above complexities developing a comprehensive multi scale model framework to seek optimal aiw and cropland use patterns in order to promote farmers income and sustainable development of an id under uncertainties of water supply and demand is necessary and significant but has rarely been considered in the existing literature the main contributions of this study are the following 1 conflicts of interests of farmers and system s decision makers as well as conflicts between economy society and environment are simultaneously balanced which will help promote the sustainable development of an irrigation district 2 aiw and cropland use are jointly allocated to different crops in different regions considering uncertainties in both water supply and water demand which will contribute to the efficient use of agricultural water and land resources and how to cope with the changing environment 3 the adaptability evaluation was conducted to assess the performance of aiw allocation and cropland use patterns under uncertainty which will help realize how the changes of aiw and cropland use patterns affect the system s resistance stability and resilience and thus help choose the optimal aiw and cropland use patterns the developed model was then applied to a real world case study in jinxi id northeast china results provide insights into trade off among different stakeholders farmers and managers targets economic benefits social equity and farm environment and allocation of strategies of aiw and cropland use 2 methodology 2 1 system generalization we developed a two level large system optimization model for quantifying connections and balancing conflicts of water and land resources allocation between farmland scale and regional scale in an id the optimization model for each scale was established based on their respective goals and the two optimization models for each scale in the large system were interconnected uncertainties in water supply and demand were considered to help generate the aiw allocation and cropland use patterns that can cope with changing environment the adaptability evaluation for the patterns of water and land use based on the large system optimization model was done to help determine the performance of optimization in summary the following three parts constituted an integrated system for aiw and cropland allocation under uncertainty 1 establishment of the multi scale optimization model for the allocation of aiw and cropland resources 2 joint uncertainties of water supply and demand and 3 adaptability evaluation of allocation performance the content contained and the connections of the three parts are shown in fig 1 each part of the system is now discussed 2 2 multi scale optimization model the model contains two scales farmland and regional the objective of the farmland scale is to maximize farmers income while the objective of the regional scale is to promote sustainable development of an id for an irrigation system the sustainability can be considered in relation to socioeconomic development and the protection of natural resources liu et al 2008 in this study the sustainability was defined to balance the conflicts between economic social and environmental effects to the maximum for the harmonious use of agricultural water and land resources the aim of both scales is to optimize aiw and cropland resources farmland scale for different crops regional scale for different sub regions the two scales are coordinated through the exchange of information of water supply amount function of system economic benefit and water supply amount and function of ghg emissions and cropland use 2 2 1 farmland scale the objective of this scale is to maximize the total farmers income for each region which can be quantified by the difference between revenue from planting and costs of planting and water consumption the objective function can be expressed as follows 1 f s i f a r m e r i n c o m e max j 1 j p j g r a i n y a i j g r a i n a i j g r a i n k 1 k p k c a s h y a i j c a s h a i k c a s h j 1 j c j g

on groundwater for the jth grain crop and kth cash crop in the ith sub region respectively m3 ha and they are decision variables the above objective function is subject to the following constraints 1 surface water supply this constraint helps restrict the total irrigation water amount from surface water source for both grain crops and cash crops to be within the range of surface water supply 2 j 1

grain crops and cash crops to be within the range of groundwater supply 3 j 1 j i q i j g r a i n g r o a i j g r a i n k 1 k i q i k c a s h g r o a i k c a s h η g r o q i g r o i where q i g r o is the surface water supply for the ith sub region m3 and η g r o is the water efficiency of surface water irrigation 3 water demand irrigation water amount to both grain crops and cash crops should satisfy their minimum water requirement to guarantee crop growth and should not be larger than their maximum water requirement to avoid the wastage of water resources 4 w d i j g r a i n min i q i j g

demands for the kth cash crop in the ith sub region respectively m3 ha 4 cropland use the total cropland use for both grain crops and cash crops should be smaller than the planned area and the

ith sub region respectively ha 2 2 2 regional scale the objective of this scale is to promote id s sustainable development by balancing conflicts between economic effect quantified as net economic benefit social effect quantified as resources allocation equity and environmental effect quantified as greenhouse gas ghg emissions from planting a multi objective programming can help achieve this goal the objective functions can now be expressed as follows 1 economic effect this objective is to maximize the economic net benefit from irrigation which can be quantified by the difference between revenue and water management cost the revenue can be further quantified based on the function of economic benefit and irrigation water amount from the farmland scale feedback the objective can be expressed as follows 9 r s e c o n o m i c max i 1 i f i q i s u r q i g r o q i s u r q i g r o i 1 i δ s u r q i s u r i 1 n δ g r o q i g r o where r s e c o n o m i c is the objective function of economic effect at the regional scale yuan f i q i s u r q i g r o is the function of economic benefit and water supply both surface water and groundwater for the ith sub region yuan m3 and δ s u r and δ g r o are the water supply costs of surface water and groundwater respectively yuan m3 2 social effect this objective is to promote aiw allocation equity between different sub regions to increase the satisfaction of water supply and stability of an id from a regional perspective the gini coefficient based on lorenz curve is effective to reflect resources allocation equity hu et al 2016 malakar et al 2018 the gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and the resources allocation can be more equal if it is closer to 0 this objective function can be expressed as follows 10 r s s o c i a

warming the global warming potential gwp is effective to quantify the combined effect of main ghg including co2 ch4 and n2o guillermo et al 2016 this objective is to minimize gwp and can be expressed as follows 11 r s e n v i r o n m e n t a l min g w p min i 1 i a i f i c o 2 a i j g r a i n a i k c a s h 44 12 f i c h 4 a i j r i c e g r a i n 16 12 21 f i n 2 o a i j g r a i n a i k c a s h 44

can refer to xiao et al 2019 and li et al 2020c the above objective function is subject to the following constraints 1 surface water availability surface water supply to all the sub regions should not exceed the total surface water availability from river flow 12 i 1 i q i s u r t q s u r where t q s u r is the total surface water availability m3 2 groundwater availability similarly groundwater supply to all the sub regions should not exceed the total groundwater availability on the basis of groundwater extraction capacity 13 i 1 i q i g r o t q g r o where t q g r o is the total groundwater availability m3 3 water demand the total water allocation amount including both surface water and groundwater for each sub region should satisfy the minimum field water demand to guarantee crop growth and should not exceed the maximum field water demand to save water 14 w d i r e g i o n min q i s u r q i g r o w d i r e g i o n max i where w d i r e g i o n min and w d i r e g i o n max represent the minimum and maximum water demands for the ith sub region m3 respectively 4 cropland use for each sub region the cropland use should be within a range to keep in view the food requirement and land limitation 15 a i min a i a i max i where a i min and a i max are the minimum and maximum available croplands of the ith sub region ha 2 2 3 solution method the developed optimization model for aiw and cropland allocation patterns involves two scales thus the structure of the model is a two level large system model with the upper level corresponding to the regional scale and the lower level corresponding to the farmland scale the models of the two levels were solved independently and the decomposition coordination method shangguan et al 2002 was used to tackle the interaction between the two levels the detailed solution steps are summarized as follows step 1 give a set of initial values of water supply i e q i s u r and q i g r o and the total available cropland area a i q i s u r q i g r o and a i are coordinated variables then solve the optimization model of the farmland scale a linear programming model lp the optimal allocation of irrigation water surface water and groundwater cropland use for each crop in each sub region and the corresponding objective function values can be obtained based on these the feedback functions of f i q i s u r q i g r o and f i c o 2 a i j g r a

the farmland scale and new coordinated variables meanwhile the satisfaction degree λ which is the objective function of the transformed monlp model can be thus obtained step 3 with the feedback of updated q i s u r q i g r o and a i the model at the farmland scale was optimized once again and generated new feedback functions for driving the regional scale again then a new λ value was obtained this process would be repeatedly iterated until the following criterion was satisfied 16 λ m 1 λ m λ m ω where m is the number of iterations and ω is the maximum threshold of the difference between iterations and is set to 0 005 jiang et al 2016 to clarify lp in step 1 and nlp in step 2 are classical mathematical programming that can be directly solved by coding them in any mathematical programming software 2 3 uncertainties in water supply and demand water supply and water demand are random and their respective dry and wet conditions are in incomplete correspondence different dry and wet combinations of water supply and demand will result in different awi and cropland allocation patterns the aim of this section is to determine the occurrence probabilities of possible combinations of dry and wet conditions of water supply and demand the combinations are regarded as scenarios and thus generate a comprehensive awi and cropland allocation patterns considering all these scenarios which will be beneficial for decision makers to grasp the overall situation of agricultural water and land use copula functions were used to address such uncertainties which are capable of addressing the joint effect of two or more random variables zhang and singh 2012 candela et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 details for copula functions can be referred to li et al 2013 zhang et al 2019b wang et al 2020a b the determination of the copula function is based on the marginal distributions of the two random variables i e water supply and water demand and the determination of marginal distributions is dependent on the accuracy of parameter estimation of each type of hydrological distributions e g normal log normal gamma pearson ⅲ generalized extreme value logistic pareto weibull distributions etc in summary the uncertainties of water supply and demand can be quantified using the following steps step 1 determine water supply and water demand with long series data step 2 estimate parameters of various hydrologic distributions based on moment estimation me maximum likelihood estimation mle and principle of maximum entropy pme step 3 fit the theoretical frequency curve with actual data based on different parameter estimates and select the best fit curves of water supply and demand using ols and aic criterion kashani et al 2016 banks and joyner 2017 then regard them as marginal distributions step 4 build various types of copula functions and select the most appropriate copula function based on the squared euclidean distance dong et al 2015 step 5 assume both water supply and demand have three hydrological characteristics wet normal and dry conditions and use the cumulative probability to divide them into different segments step 6 determine the joint occurrence probabilities of different combinations of dry and wet conditions between water supply and demand based on the criterion from guo et al 2015 step 7 calculate the comprehensive aiw and cropland allocation pattern level using the formula ϑ s 1 s p s ϑ s p s is the joint occurrence probability of water supply and demand under scenario s and ϑ s is the aiw or cropland allocation amount under scenario s 2 4 adaptability assessment the adaptability assessment in this study was based on the principle of dynamic system for an open and complex system of agricultural water and land allocation the destabilization with certain strength from external environment will give rise to changes in the state of the system this change will cause the system to deviate from the existing state the aim of the adaptability assessment is to help decision makers realize the adaptive capacity of agricultural water and land allocation system in the changing environment i e variation of water supply and demand for this study the status trends of a system over time can be described as differential equation based on dynamic mechanism wang et al 2019 17 d x d t f t x g t x where x is the system s status variable d x d t is the changing rate of x f t x is the coping ability of self adjusting to the perturbation at time t and g t x is the driving force of perturbation from the changing environment at time t f t x contains three aspects including resistance stability and resilience while g t x can be further quantified by sensibility guo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 hence based on formula 19 the mathematical formulation of the adaptability assessment can be further expressed as 18 h a d p t a b i l i t y f s i r e s i s tan c e i s t a b i l i t y i r e s i l i e n c e 3 s where h a d p t a b i l i t y is the adaptability of the system f represents the ability to cope with the changing environment s is the sensibility i resistance i stability and i resilience are the resistance stability and resilience of the system respectively h a d p t a b i l i t y 1 represents the adaptability of the system which is larger smaller than the driving force of destabilization of the changing environment manifesting adaptability in adaptability the determination of adaptability is based on various indexes and the corresponding weights of i resistance i stability and i resilience according to the principles of manipulability comparability and hierarchy this study established an index system which included target layer criterion layer and index layer the criterion layer included four parts i e sensitivity stability resistance and resilience there are in total 12 indexes based on the results of optimization model details of the index system are shown in table 1 the weights were determined based on the entropy weight method delgado and romero 2016 3 application 3 1 study area jinxi id in heilongjiang province northeast china was chosen as the study area see fig 2 the geographical coordinates are 131 30 132 37 eastern longitude and 46 48 47 14 northern latitude jinxi id has continental monsoon climate characteristics the average temperature is 3 6 and the annual average relative humidity is 67 the total sunshine hours is 2151 h the average precipitation is 519 mm and evaporation is 750 mm there are four sub regions in jinxi id including songhuajiang jinshan huama and toulin sub regions with the total cultivated area being 1 01 105 ha agriculture is the main water user and irrigation water accounts for approximately 90 both surface water and groundwater are water supplies to ensure food production the surface water mainly comes from songhua river and groundwater in jinxi id is overdrawn as an important grain production base in heilongjiang province rice corn and soybean are the main crops there is also a certain proportion of cropland for planting vegetables and various melons 3 2 data collection the effective application of the developed framework was based on input parameters mainly including two parts i e hydrological parameters and social economic environmental parameters the surface water supply originated from songhua river and we used the long series runoff volume of songhua river at jiamusi hydrometric station from 1954 to 2015 to fit the copula function we also estimated crop evapotranspiration based on crop coefficient k c and reference evapotranspiration et 0 to fit the copula function et 0 was estimated on the basis of meteorological data including sunshine duration highest lowest and average temperatures average wind velocity and average relative humidity from 1954 to 2015 which were obtained from meteorological observations networks in china for details on calculating et 0 one can refer to allen et al 1998 the variation of runoff and et 0 is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the value of k c is in table s4 in the supplementary material the allowable groundwater withdrawal was 1 61 108 m3 based on engineering feasibility study report of jinxi irrigation district and water resources argumentation report of jinxi irrigation district the social economic environmental parameters were mainly from government reports such as engineering feasibility study report of jinxi irrigation district water resources verification report of jinxi irrigation district water resources argumentation report of jinxi irrigation district and engineering environmental impact report of jinxi irrigation district statistical yearbook of fujin city and published references shang et al 2015 li et al 2019 table s1 lists the input data related to different crops including crop market price crop production costs dosage of fertilizer pesticide diesel oil agricultural films irrigation electricity etc in this study crop production costs included costs for the utilization of fertilizer farm machinery pesticide irrigation and drainage facilities seed costs for labor and other costs the proportion of these costs is listed in table s2 in the supplementary material based on the statistic yearbook of fujin city table s3 lists data related to both crops and sub regions mainly including crop planting area and yield per unit area for both grain crops and cash crops thereinto the crop planting area included the maximum area and the minimum area for each crop to ensure the output of jinxi irrigation district and also to guarantee model boundary according to the engineering feasibility study report of jinxi irrigation district crop planting area of jinxi irrigation district would increase in 2030 hence the planed area for each crop was determined as the upper range threshold while the planting area for each crop under the status quo was determined as the lower range threshold some environmental parameters were needed to support the framework such as co2 emission coefficients were 8 2 12 1 3 7 and 22 7 kg co2 ep kg for the use of fertilizer pesticide diesel oil and agricultural films respectively and was 1 1 kg co2 ep kwh for the use of irrigation electricity the emission coefficient of ch4 was 80 2 kg ha and the emission coefficient of n2o for using fertilizer was 0 54 kg kg the n2o emission coefficient of soil for rice corn soybean vegetables and melons were 4 59 2 53 2 29 4 94 and 4 23 kg ha respectively the prices of using surface water and groundwater at the farmland scale were 0 102 and 0 29 yuan m3 respectively the costs for surface water supply and groundwater supply at the regional scale were 0 07 yuan m3 and 0 11 yuan m3 respectively the cost for water supply mainly included operating cost and depreciation expense the operating cost included engineering maintenance cost management cost pumping energy charge and insurance expenses for fixed assets details for these costs are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material 4 results and discussion 4 1 uncertainties in water supply and demand this study adopted frequently used normal extreme value pearson ⅲ logistic and pareto distributions to estimate distributions parameters using me mle and pme results of parameter estimation of streamflow from jiamusi hydrologic station and et 0 are shown in table s5 in the supplementary material based on table s5 in the supplementary material the appropriate hydrological distributions can be fitted and selected on the basis of ols and aic and the test results are shown in table 2 the ole and aic tests show that the pearson ⅲ had a good fit with actual conditions of both runoff and et 0 using me therefore this study selected pearson ⅲ distribution as the marginal distributions of runoff and et 0 the scale parameter α shape parameter β and location parameter γ of the distribution were 5 74 14 13 and 16 31 for runoff respectively and are 21 96 6 94 and 598 14 for et 0 then copula functions including gaussian copula t copula clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula and ali mikhail haq copula were fitted and the square euclidean distances d 2 for these copula functions were 0 0214 0 0210 0 2277 0 0212 0 2277 and 0 4057 it was obvious that d 2 for t copula was the smallest which was selected as the copula function in this study and the fitted function can be expressed as follows c u v t k 1 u t k 1 v 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 1 s 2 2 ρ s t t 2 k 1 ρ 2 d s d t where u represents the runoff and v represents the et 0 ρ 0 5666 k 13 7128 the joint occurrence probabilities of runoff and et 0 were obtained from the joint distribution shown in fig 3 there were in total nine scenarios i e nine combinations of wet and dry conditions of runoff and et 0 the occurrence probability of wet dry synchronization 3 scenarios was 32 16 among which the occurrence probability of scenario of runoff normal et 0 normal was 29 14 contributing to 90 6 while scenarios of runoff wet et 0 wet and runoff dry et 0 dry were basically the same and they contributed to 9 4 correspondingly the occurrence probability of wet dry asynchronization 6 scenarios was 67 84 and there was little difference in the value of occurrence probabilities for the corresponding combinations ranging from 10 43 to 13 06 these occurrence probabilities were important because they could further help decision makers realize what the possibility of different water shortage risks was combining with the following water allocation schemes in order to provide the corresponding solutions timely 4 2 agricultural irrigation water allocation at regional scale by solving the multi scale model awi allocations under different scenarios were obtained fig 4 shows the awi allocation at the regional scale under the 9 scenarios from the perspective of water supply it was obvious that water allocation under the wet condition was the most then was that under the normal condition and the least was that under the dry condition this indicates that allocating more water would present positive effects on the id s sustainable development there was a clear correspondence between awi allocation and water supply that is more water supply resulted in more awi allocation at the regional scale however the correspondence between awi allocation and water demand was irregular water supply was more sensitive to awi allocation than was water demand the most unfavorable condition was that water supply was in the dry condition and water demand was in the wet condition as seen from the figure the aiw allocation in such scenario was the least i e 3 01 108 m3 the managers of id should pay attention to this scenario as the occurrence probability of such an adverse condition for id s sustainable management was 13 for different sub regions under the most likely scenario i e sn dn the water allocation to huama sub region was the most accounting for 39 43 1 46 108 m3 the second largest water allocation sub region was toulin 1 25 108 m3 accounting for 33 62 the third was jinshan sub region 0 81 108 m3 accounting for 21 85 and the last was songhuajiang sub region 0 19 108 m3 accounting for only 5 1 based on water allocation amounts and the corresponding occurrence probabilities under each scenario the comprehensive water allocation was 3 73 108 m3 this value could be regarded as a planned value for irrigation water allocation this value was more accurate as it considered all possible changing conditions of water supply and water demand 4 3 agricultural irrigation water allocation at farmland scale based on water allocation to different sub regions water allocations from different sources surface water and groundwater to different crops were obtained as shown in fig 5 a grain crops and b cash crops for any crop surface water was the main source of water allocation in the current situation the groundwater was overdrawn to guarantee crop output this study adjusted the structure of water use by re allocating the surface water and groundwater using the developed model based on the formula in step 7 in section 2 3 the optimal total groundwater use for all the crops of the whole irrigation district was obtained the value of which was decreased by 23 compared with the current groundwater use based on water resources argumentation reports hence the re allocation of water resources helped alleviate the situation of groundwater overexploitation and thus would help raise the groundwater level which contributed to improving the groundwater environment moreover it should be noted that the water availabilities for both surface water and groundwater that were input to the model were the net values for agricultural irrigation in other words the ecological water industrial water domestic water use had already been removed from the total water availability and the last water from the total water availability was used for agricultural irrigation therefore the re allocation of the surface water and groundwater would not cause a drop in other water use sections for grain crops water allocation to rice was much more than other crops rice was a water intensive crop however as rice s output per unit area was higher than corn and soybean and the quality of rice in jinxi id was good irrigating rice was still with irrigation superiority for cash crops water allocation per unit area to vegetables and melons had no significant difference no matter the kind of crop surface water allocation varied substantially with different scenarios while groundwater changed little unlike water allocation at the regional scale water allocation at the farmland scale was more sensitive to water demand the water allocation amount increased as water demand increased however the fluctuation of water demand under different scenarios was not as large as water supply specifically the et 0 values under wet normal and dry conditions were 3 76 108 m3 3 70 108 m3 and 3 62 108 m3 respectively this led to the slight variation of the water allocation at the farmland scale water allocations to rice corn soybean vegetables and melons were 4166 4613 m3 ha 2040 2259 m3 ha 1768 1958 m3 ha 3287 3646 m3 ha and 3287 3645 m3 ha respectively 4 4 cropland use patterns besides water allocation cropland use for different crops in different sub regions was another decision variable that was optimized based on the multi scale model fig 6 shows the optimal results of cropland use under different scenarios affected by both water supply and water supply the cropland use for different crops in different sub regions varied it was quite clear that rice had substantial advantages for planting especially for songhuajiang subarea the cropland use for rice occupied 92 this value was obtained considering the weighted average value of all the cropland use under the 9 scenarios grain crops including rice corn and soybean occupied approximately 97 of all the cropland use while cash crop including vegetables and melons only occupied less than 3 on the whole the total cropland use increased as water supply increased for example taking rice and corn the top two crops in terms of cropland use as an example if we fixed water demand under the normal condition the cropland use of rice would increase 12 5 under the scenario of sn dn and 29 7 under the scenario of sw dn compared with the baseline of sd dn the cropland use of rice would increase 14 9 under the scenario of sn dn and 31 9 under the scenario of sw dn compared with the baseline of sd dn considering all the scenarios the total cropland use fluctuated from 8 4 104 14 104 ha 4 5 trade off between economic social and environmental aspects the objective of the regional scale of the model development was to comprehensively consider economic social and environmental effects the three objectives associated with economic social and environmental aspects were conflicting that called for trade off taking the sn dn scenario as an example the occurrence probability was the most of all the scenarios 29 14 and by comparing the results of comprehensively considering all the three objectives if only economic objective was considered the net economic net benefit would increase by 4 with the total water allocation amount increasing by 3 7 if the focus was on the social effect with the gini coefficient as the quantification index the net economic benefit would decrease 4 6 while if environmental effect was given priority the net economic would decrease by nearly 10 such results showed that the three objectives were contradictory economic development would affect social aspect and environment to some extent in other words social and environmental development would slow down the pace of economic development considering all the scenarios economic benefit ranged from 13 63 108 to 22 81 108 yuan and gini coefficient ranged from 0 38 to 0 39 indicating that water resources allocation was relatively uniform co2 emission ranged from 4 19 108 to 6 95 108 kg the developed model balanced the three conflicting objectives while collaboratively optimizing water and land resources at both regional scale and farmland scale this could promote the sustainable development of the irrigation district rather than focusing on the economic benefit only as a traditional management mode from another perspective the re allocation of aiw and cropland resources helped promote the sustainability of the system in this study the sustainability degree was used to reflect how the degree of coordination of the three conflicting objectives at the regional scale i e economic social and environmental objectives we used a bilinear average metric to formulate trade offs among different objectives and made a quantitative assessment and the details for calculating the sustainability degree could be referred to nie et al 2019 larger value of the sustainability degree means more harmony of the system considering all the nine scenarios the sustainability degree of the system was 0 81 increasing 33 compared with that of status quo 4 6 adaptability the adaptability assessment of awi and cropland was based on the index system table 1 in which each index could be determined based on the optimal results of the two level optimization model and related statistic information the weight of each index was determined based on the entropy weight method and the weights were 0 0793 0 0698 0 0702 0 0748 0 0748 0 0831 0 1112 0 0777 0 1045 0 073 0 1067 and 0 0748 respectively corresponding to the 12 indexes in table 1 the sensibility stability resistance and resilience of the system are shown in fig 7 the system s sensibility maintained an upward trend both lower water supply and water demand would increase the sensibility the stability and resistance of the system presented a declining trend in which the descending amplitude of the resistance was smooth larger water supply and lower water demand could increase system s stability and resistance there was a negative correlation between water deficit and system s stability and resistance the system resilience was significantly affected by water demand presenting an increasing trend while lower water supply promoted a declining trend with a small range by comprehensively considering the effects of all the four state variables i e sensibility stability resistance and resilience the changing trend of the system s adaptability is shown in fig 8 results showed that water supply was a key factor for the system s adaptability for the jinxi id only when water supply was in the wet condition the system could present adaptability among them under the scenario of sw dd the system s adaptability approached the peak this was because under such a scenario the sensitivity of the system was lower while the stability resistance and resilience of the system were at a higher level in other cases the system s adaptability value was less than 1 representing inadaptability especially when water supply was in the dry level while water demand was in the wet level the adaptability of the system reached a minimum such a case is dangerous for the development of the agricultural system so decision makers should provide alternatives for water resources utilization to reduce economic loss and ensure food security this assessment could help decision makers realize which awi and cropland allocation scheme was relatively robust and risk averse decision makers might tend to select such resources allocation schemes for lower risk taking although this might generate lower benefit accordingly 5 conclusion a multi scale model for irrigation water and cropland resources allocation considering uncertainties in water supply demand is developed the main novelties of this study are 1 agricultural water and land resources are optimized simultaneously considering their interrelations in a more harmonious way by developing a two level large system optimization model the harmonious is reflected in two aspects the first is that the contradictions between different stakeholders i e farmers and managers in an irrigation district are coordinated the second is that the contradictions between economic social and environmental aspects in the irrigated agriculture are coordinated both of them will contribute to promote the sustainable development of irrigation districts 2 joint random uncertainties of water supply and water demand are integrated in the model framework to help improve the capacities of the use of agricultural water and land resources for changing hydrological elements 3 an optimization evaluation framework is proposed with input output relationship to re allocate agricultural water and cropland resources and thus evaluate their use patterns to help decision makers realize the situations in which agricultural water and land use is the optimal or the least optimal case for the development of the whole irrigation district the developed model framework was applied to a real world case study in northeast china to demonstrate its performance the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 more water presented positive effects on the sustainable development of the irrigation district and 3 73 108 m3 water was recommended for irrigation water resource planning which was determined considering all the possible wet dry conditions of water supply and demand 2 surface water allocation varied substantially with different wet dry scenarios of water supply and demand while groundwater allocation was insensitive to the changing water supply and demand in terms of different scales water allocation at the regional scale was more sensitive to the changes of water supply while the water allocation at the farmland scale was more sensitive to the changes of water demand 3 grain crops occupied nearly 97 of all the cropland use while cash crops only occupied 3 and the total cropland use had a positive correlation with water supply 4 both economic benefit and ghg emissions were sensitive to agricultural water and land and there was a trade off between economic and environmental development aspects the re allocation made agricultural water and land resources use of jinxi id relatively uniform 5 when water supply was in the dry level and water demand was in the wet level the ability of the agricultural water and land system to cope with the changing environment was the weakest such a condition was extremely unfavorable to the system development with the occurrence probability being 13 this study makes an attempt to integrate multi scale multi objective non linear programming model copula functions adaptability assessment into a modeling framework for supporting better agricultural water and land allocation plans in a more sustainable and realistic manner the developed framework is portable to other predominantly agricultural basins with scarce water resources supply future works are still needed to improve the applicability of the developed approach for

10232,some hydrologic models oversimplify crop growth simulation although some studies coupled hydrologic models with crop models there are several hypotheses and unconsidered factors in these studies such as no irrigation to improve simulation of discharge soil moisture and evapotranspiration the variable infiltration capacity vic model was coupled with a crop growth model incorporating an improved evapotranspiration module based on the soil water stress method the new evapotranspiration module improved two water stress errors of the environmental policy integrated climate epic model considering the impact of agricultural irrigation and crop rotation regional crop growth and hydrology were simulated in the upstream watershed of the qingkou river in the east of china results of simulation by the coupled hydrology crop growth chc model were compared with observed discharge data measured soil moisture data and evapotranspiration data obtained from remote sensing inversion the daily nash efficiency coefficient was 0 78 for the calibration period from 1978 to 2008 and was 0 76 for the verification period from 2009 to 2016 the simulated soil moisture was found to be significantly correlated with observed soil moisture better than the simulation by the vic model alone the daily efficiency coefficient of the chc model simulation increased by 0 13 for the verification period compared with that of the vic model and the transpiration module of the chc model had the best simulation accuracy among the vic epic and chc transpiration modules combined with observed data the reason for the water stress error of the epic model reported by some references was found a parameter needs to be further adjusted combined with the actual condition instead of being constant thus the coupled hydrology and crop growth model improved the simulation of hydrological elements and can help guide the efficient use of water resources and adjustment of agricultural cropping practices keywords coupled hydrology and crop growth model improved evapotranspiration module crop rotation irrigation variable infiltration capacity soil water stress method crop influence 1 introduction with the development of geographic information system gis technology more and more models rely on remote sensing inversion data to simulate the dynamic process of the ground for example the hydrological model relies on input as land use data soil data precipitation data wu et al 2018 to simulate hydrological processes however the crop growth simulated by the hydrological model usually is relatively simple and the simplified crop growth simulation also affects the simulation accuracy of hydrological factors to this end some studies have tried to couple crop models with hydrological models which can obtain a higher accuracy of simulation 1 1 coupled hydrologic and crop growth models studies on coupled crop models and hydrological models stemmed from the need to consider the effect of vegetation including crops on simulating evapotranspiration some studies considered vegetation growth in some small scale hydrological models philip 1966 proposed the concept of soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in the 1960s improved crop growth models such as world food studies model wofost in the netherlands de wit et al 2019 and decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model in the united states jones et al 2003 were developed based on the spac concept considering temperature light moisture nitrogen and phosphorus these models use field scale hydrology models while hydrological processes are often simulated on a large scale these crop models are too fine to be applied for large scale simulations see appendices a 1 besides the main driving factor for the spatial heterogeneity of crop drought related yield loss is changes in available soil water anwar et al 2004 patil and sheelavantar 2004 shepherd et al 2002 available soil water is an important output of hydrological simulation but the crop model oversimplifies the simulation of hydrological processes eitzinger et al 2004 priesack et al 2006 siad et al 2019 therefore the coupling of crop models and hydrological models has been widely suggested casanova and judge 2008 li et al 2014 maruyama and kuwagata 2010 van den hoof et al 2011 on the other hand vegetation parameters in some hydrologic models remain constant throughout the entire or part of the simulation period tsarouchi et al 2014 ignoring the growth of crops during that period however accounting for dynamic crop growth in a land surface model will significantly improve the representation of soil and land surface processes as well as evapotranspiration et flux sensitivity lu et al 2015b tsarouchi et al 2014 hence it is necessary to introduce crop growth models into hydrological models siad et al 2019 tsarouchi et al 2014 at present research on the coupling of crop models and hydrological models is still in the early stage of development siad et al 2019 1 2 problems of coupled models the problems encountered when coupling crop models with hydrological models can be divided into three aspects model simulation and application coupling method and coupling model hypotheses 1 2 1 model simulation and application li et al 2014 coupled the wofost and hydrus 1d models to simulate wheat production in arid regions but the application area was small and they did not specify how to simulate crop irrigation nicola et al 2005 coupled dynamic vegetation model dvm and land surface model to simulate soil moisture and leaf area index lai but they used point scale data to verify simulation results and it is difficult to explain the rationality of area drought analysis fatichi et al 2012 applied an eco hydrological model to a region of smaller than 1 km2 the lai of crops in a single grid was spatially heterogeneous but only one value represented the lai of a single grid which affected the accuracy of the evapotranspiration model boegh et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 coupled a simple hydrological model with a crop model to simulate crop yields for agricultural drought assessment but with one point representing a city the application area was too large to summarize current coupled models are often used at small scales even at field scales it is therefore difficult to carry out long term crop growth simulations and drought analyses at a macroscopic large scale sawada et al 2014 tsarouchi et al 2014 1 2 2 coupling method tsarouchi et al 2014 coupled the joint uk land environment simulator jules model and the infocrop model to simulate the effect of underlying surface changes on the evaporation flux some studies have coupled land surface climate or hydrological models with crop growth models boegh et al 2004 lei et al 2010 li et al 2013 mo et al 2005 tsarouchi et al 2014 the present coupling procedures li et al 2014 tsarouchi et al 2014 mostly calculate potential evapotranspiration and vegetation water uptake in the hydrological model then pass it on to the crop model and simulate the crop growth process in the crop model in the simulation of crop growth the calculated state variables include leaf area index root depth and canopy height then the crop model passes these state variables back to the hydrological model however crop transpiration and water uptake can also be calculated in the crop model it is necessary to compare the evapotranspiration calculation accuracy between the crop model and hydrology model to illustrate the validity of the coupling scheme otherwise there will be system error in the transpiration module wang et al 2012 1 2 3 hypotheses of the coupled model there are several hypotheses and unconsidered factors in existing studies including 1 the root depth growth rate is constant until the maximum root depth is reached 2 there is not enough irrigation data vosselen et al 2005 and the effects of reservoirs and irrigation are not considered li et al 2016 osborne et al 2007 3 lack of data on vegetation interception of rain and 4 no accounting for the effect of different crop proportions and rotation patterns within a single grid liu et al 2018 osborne et al 2007 when studying the influence of only one factor on the corresponding state variable these assumptions will not affect the accuracy of results for example when studying the effect of drought on crop water uptake other influencing factors remain unchanged and the impact would be more distinct and clear supit et al 2010 however this may ignore the response of coupling affected by many factors at the same time which affects the simulated data if the measured data is used for verification a large error value will result to address the hypotheses problems of the coupled model the vic variable infiltration capacity model was coupled with the epic environmental policy integrated climate crop model and a grid routing model the crop rotation was considered in each merged grid and the irrigation module and reservoir module were embedded into the crop model and the routing model to account for the effect of irrigation on crop growth to address the problems in the model simulation and application the coupled hydrology crop growth model chc was constructed for the upstream watershed of the qingkou river at the heilin station combined with the observation data simulation results were verified and the causes of the errors were analyzed further the simulation results of the chc and vic models were compared to solve the transpiration problem about the coupling methods different transpiration modules from food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao hereinafter fao method epic and vic were compared 2 study area the study area is the upper watershed of qingkou river above the heilin station in the northern part of jiangsu province the watershed area is 182 km2 and is located at 118º44 17 118º55 10 e 34º59 37 35º9 37 n see fig 1 owing to the proximity to the ocean to the east the climate affected by both the mainland and the ocean is characterized by a warm and temperate monsoon region with a semi humid continental climate abundant sunshine humid and rainy summers and cold and dry winters the annual mean precipitation is 952 mm and the annual mean temperature is 14 2 the planting system brings in one or two harvests a year the crops that are mainly grown are rice corn wheat peanuts and a small number of economic crops such as vegetables and fruits among them peanuts constitute the largest proportion of the planting area 3 data the meteorological data including daily rainfall and air temperature data from 1976 to 2016 came from hydrological stations of heilin qingshuijian and zhubian the inverse distance weighted least squares interpolants franke and nielson 1980 were used to interpolate scattered precipitation values and the precipitation data of each merged grid were obtained because we only had the shortwave radiation longwave radiation vapor pressure wind speed and atmospheric pressure data for a fraction of the time the mtclim model bohn et al 2013 in the vic model was used to calculate the meteorological data based on daily rainfall and air temperature data the discharge data including daily flow data in the flood season from 1978 to 2016 came from heilin hydrological station located at the outlet of the study basin because there is no soil moisture monitoring station in the study area the nearest station doushan in shandong province was chosen for the soil water content data including the ten day soil moisture data from 2006 to 2016 around this area at an approximate distance of 1 9 km the soil moisture data were used for validation there is no published crop spatial distribution data so the data was obtained using a decision tree model based on landsat8 data see fig 2 with a resolution of 30 m the crop rotations included wheat peanut wheat corn and spring peanut the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis evapotranspiration products vermote 2015 comprised the evapotranspiration volume of the global 500 500 m grid every eight days and the average evapotranspiration volume of the study area in 2001 2016 was calculated the digital elevation model dem data came from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a resolution of 30 m farr and kobrick 2000 the water area data came from the 30 m resolution water area data product developed by the european commission joint research center pekel et al 2016 the grid vegetation type data was derived from the global 1 km land cover type database developed by the university of maryland the fraction of the merged grid covered by vegetation tile was computed using the land cover type database and crop spatial distribution data the leaf area index of vegetation other than crops was derived from the land data assimilation system ldas pisek and chen 2007 wiegand et al 1979 and the leaf area index of crops was simulated by the epic model the soil parameters of the vic model were calculated based on the global soil database and formulae of soil characteristic parameters reynolds et al 2000 saxton et al 1986 the characteristic parameters of different types of crops were obtained from the crop parameter library of the soil water assessment tool swat model the characteristic parameters include maximum leaf area index biomass energy ratio maximum canopy height harvest index and so on the hydrological model parameters were calibrated using the measured discharge data 4 methodology 4 1 coupling methods the vic model cannot simulate the crop growth process see appendices a 2 1 to increase the simulation accuracy of hydrologic elements it is necessary to couple the crop growth module with the vic model the epic model was chosen as a crop growth module see appendices a 3 which is more suitable for large scale simulation the epic model was embedded into the vic model the soil water content was calculated by the vic model using precipitation the soil water content was input into the crop model and thus the crop model simulated the crop growth next the soil evaporation and water consumption of the crop calculated by the crop model in different soil layers were input into the vic model and the vic model then calculated the soil water content at the beginning of the next period and so forth as a result a close coupling between the vic model and crop growth model was thus accomplished besides other plant evapotranspiration was simulated using the vic model to be specific when this fraction of land cover is a crop type the chc model calls the epic model to simulate the crop growth when this fraction of land cover belongs to other plant types the chc model calls the vic model to calculate the evapotranspiration since crops need irrigation during the growth process and water needs to be taken from groundwater rivers or reservoirs for irrigation the calculation of river and reservoir water volume is inseparable from river channel routing therefore it is necessary to couple the routing model reservoir module and irrigation module with the vic model see fig 3 the grid routing model liu 2017 lu et al 2015a was selected as the routing model see appendices a 2 2 and loose coupling was used between the vic model and the routing model the vic model transmits surface runoff and base flow of each grid to the routing model and the routing model performs the convergence calculation the reservoir module is closely coupled with the runoff and routing model the routing model transmits the river flow data to the reservoir module and the vic model transmits the evaporation data to the reservoir module the reservoir module calculates the water balance of the reservoir accordingly continuously simulating the reservoir water storage neitsch et al 2011 part of the irrigation module was coupled with the epic model and the irrigation water demand was calculated according to the soil water content neitsch et al 2011 another part of the irrigation module was coupled with the reservoir module and irrigation water demand was input to the reservoir module and the actual irrigation water volume was calculated see section 4 3 then the actual irrigation water volume was returned to the epic model which would increase soil moisture to simulate the growth process of the crop after irrigation to improve the calculation accuracy of runoff and irrigation water demand the evapotranspiration module was improved based on the water stress coefficient method recommended by the fao hereinafter fao method it was used to replace the original evapotranspiration module of the epic and provide the evapotranspiration data for the vic model and irrigation module the specific relationship between modules and the construction principle of the coupled model are shown in fig 3 several studies have assumed that only one flow direction is allowed in all coarse scale grids which neglect the flow heterogeneity in the large scale grid in this study the flexible location of waterways flow method yamazaki et al 2009 which considers the flow heterogeneity in a coarse grid was applied to delineate the river network map merge the catchment with the grid and obtain the merged grid as shown in fig 1 because the crop growth process was introduced into the vic hydrology model and the irrigation module and reservoir module were also introduced into the coupled model to consider the crop growth effect this coupled model can be named as coupled hydrology crop growth model chc 4 2 improved evapotranspiration module the main principle of the crop growth model was introduced in appendices a 3 to consider crop rotation effects crop rotation simulation was introduced into the crop growth model more than one crop could be planted in some grids in the calculation of the total plant water uptake as the water content of soil decreases the water in the soil becomes increasingly difficult for the plant to extract and the crop water uptake is expressed as neitsch et al 2011 1 w u p l y w u p l y exp 5 s w l y 0 25 a w c l y 1 s w l y 0 25 a w c l y w u p l y s w l y 0 25 a w c l y 2 w a c t u a l u p l y min w u p l y s w l y w p l y where w u p l y is the amount of water absorbed by crops from the soil of the ly th layer mm w u p l y is the amount of water absorbed by crops from the soil of the ly th layer before correction mm sw ly is the soil water content of the ly th layer mm awc ly is the available water capacity for layer ly mm w actualup ly is the actual water uptake for layer ly mm and wp ly is the water content of layer ly at wilting point mm however this model cannot fully simulate the effect of water stress in the study area because 0 25awc ly is smaller than the water content at a wilting point and the soil water cannot get to 0 25awc ly uniyal et al 2019 and marek et al 2016 indicated that errors in the plant stress functions led to larger et as a result the water stress effect cannot be considered in the simulation of crop growth an improved evapotranspiration module of the crop growth model would be illustrated below a great number of equations for estimating evapotranspiration et 0 have been reported in the literature gavilán et al 2006 but the penman monteith equation has been accepted as the most accurate formula abdul karim et al 2013 the transpiration of crops in the vic model is estimated according to the penman monteith equation liang et al 1994 the transpiration in different layers is combined with the root density to obtain the total transpiration however the root density in each layer of soil is constant during the whole of crop growth assuming that the root length is constant which is inconsistent with reality because the crop root depth is not the same at the seedling and maturity stages besides the vic is a large scale semi distributed hydrologic model and often ignores some details to simplify the calculation procedure for example it neglects soil evaporation when there is vegetation in one grid when the vegetation has a small lai the soil evaporation is also large but the vic does not calculate soil evaporation separately and thus the simulated evapotranspiration is not accurate in the epic model the transpiration of crops is also calculated by the penman monteith equation neitsch et al 2011 and the water uptake distribution by a plant in each layer of soil is described by a mathematical function this function includes the depth parameter of root development in the soil and the water uptake can consider the root development the transpiration ratio in each layer is variable in different growth periods additionally the epic model divides evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and canopy transpiration combined with the above ground biomass therefore the vegetation water uptake can be estimated more accurately by using the canopy transpiration however as shown in the previous paragraph it cannot calculate the water uptake accurately under the water stress condition it is necessary to refer to other model theories to improve the calculation method camargo and kemanian 2016 wang et al 2013 simulation dual kc simdualkc rosa et al 2016 uses the water stress coefficient method recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 to calculate crop evapotranspiration et c allen et al 1998 and evapotranspiration is separated into crop transpiration and soil evaporation therein crop transpiration is estimated using a crop coefficient k c multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration et 0 the actual k c k c act is calculated based on eq 3 abdul karim et al 2013 3 k c a c t k s k c b k e where k c act is the crop coefficient considering the effect of water stress k cb is the basal crop coefficient reflecting the variability of transpiration with types of crops k e is the soil evaporation coefficient and k s is the water stress coefficient 0 1 k s depends upon the soil moisture of the root zone 4 k s t a w d r t a w r a w t a w d r 1 p t a w d r r a w 1 d r r a w where taw and raw are respectively the total

for et c 5 mm day et c is the crop evapotranspiration p normal can be referred to allen et al 1998 it considers the influence of crop types and evapotranspiration and is more realistic therefore the transpiration module of the fao method was considered to improve the evapotranspiration module of the epic model hereinafter fao epic liu et al 2015 eq 1 was replaced by eq 6 to consider the effect of water stress on crop water consumption but the structure of layer by layer calculation of evapotranspiration remained 6 w u p l y w u p l y k s l y where k s ly is the water stress coefficient of the layer ly and was calculated by eq 4 4 3 irrigation module and reservoir module when the soil water content was below some threshold crops would experience water stress and crop transpiration would reduce accordingly if there was sufficient water for irrigation water would be applied by irrigation to the soil haddeland et al 2006 until the soil water content reached field capacity to simplify the calculation the simulated irrigation water is assumed to come only from rivers and reservoirs when the water in rivers and reservoirs is less than the water required for irrigation crops would be insufficiently irrigated to calculate the water in reservoirs the reservoir module was coupled with the grid routing model then the actual irrigation water was simulated based on formula 7 7 i a i r i r v v i r v where i a is the actual irrigation water mm and i r is the irrigation water demand mm and v is the water stored in the water body mm it was assumed in the irrigation module that the closer they are to rivers and reservoirs the more easily they are irrigated hence each merged grid was divided into irrigation area and non irrigation area according to the irrigation ratio data from yearbooks haddeland et al 2006 reservoir water volume is an important source for irrigation water in the irrigation module the following water balance equation was selected to build the reservoir module neitsch et al 2011 8 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p i a where v is the volume of water stored in the reservoir at the end of the period m3 v stored is the volume of water stored in the reservoir at the beginning of the period m3 v flowin is the volume of water entering the reservoir during the period m3 v flowout is the volume of water flowing out of the reservoir during the period m3 v pcp is the precipitation volume during the period m3 v evap is the evaporation of the reservoir during the period m3 v seep is the water lost from the reservoir by seepage during the period m3 when the calculated reservoir water volume was greater than the reservoir capacity v would equal the reservoir capacity there are too many reservoirs in each merged grids it is impossible to measure the reservoir capacities in all the grids to estimate the reservoir capacity the 30 m resolution water area data product pekel et al 2016 and eq 9 were used to calculate the reservoir capacity 9 s a β v e x p s a where sa is the surface area of the water body m2 β and expsa are coefficients and v is the reservoir capacity m3 4 4 performance evaluation of the chc model this study used percent bias pbias normalized root mean square error nrmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and pearson product moment correlation coefficient r to evaluate model performance the standard of evaluation cheng et al 2016 daggupati et al 2016 kim 2012 liu et al 2011 miller et al 2007 is shown below table 1 where f t is the model simulation value at time t t 1 2 t f is the average value of model simulation values at all times y t is the observed value at time t and y is the average value of the observed values at all times the parameter selection and model setup were introduced in appendices a 4 when calibrating model parameters a total of 12 model parameters see appendices a 5 were adjusted manually first so that the simulation flow of the basin outlet was as close as possible to the measured value after that the above parameters were locally adjusted by the rosenbrock method with the objective function of the daily efficiency coefficient nse the chc simulation was verified against the flow data not used in the calibration and model performance was evaluated based on eqs 10 13 meanwhile model performance was also validated using soil moisture data from observation stations evapotranspiration data from meteorological stations and evapotranspiration data from modis 5 results 1 flow validation at the basin outlet the warm up period calibration period and validation period were 1976 1977 1978 2008 and 2009 2016 respectively the nse of the calibration period was 0 78 and the relative error was 2 1 see fig 4 the nse of the verification period was 0 76 and the relative error was 11 1 see fig 5 according to table 1 the model performance belonged to a very good level and the correlation degree belonged to a high level the daily nse and relative error in the calibration period were better than those of most watersheds in daggupati et al 2016 and were also better than the nse and relative error in sawada et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 therefore the flow simulated by the chc model was regarded as reasonable from fig 4 and table 2 it can be seen that during the flood season especially at some flow peak positions the simulated flow was smaller than the measured flow which was related to the runoff module principle and precipitation input the vic model uses a runoff yield mechanism at natural storage and most of the watersheds often coexist with runoff yields at both the natural storage and excess infiltration bao 2009 during the flood season especially when rainfall intensity is high in summer runoff yield in excess of infiltration often accounts for a certain proportion of the total runoff yield if runoff yield in excess of infiltration is not considered the simulated flood peak will be smaller than the actual flood peak meanwhile the time resolution of precipitation data also affects the simulation results the input data of the vic model in the study was on a 6 hour scale when the meteorological forcing data was prepared the high intensity precipitation was averaged to the 6 hour scale which would decrease the runoff yield of the short term heavy rainfall during the flood season although the systematic error was minimized by increasing b when calibrating the parameters excessively increasing the b value would lead to a larger error when the flow was small besides another error source comes from the simulated evapotranspiration see appendices a 6 therefore the simulated flow would still be small at some flow peak positions 2 soil moisture validation the station with a long series of observed soil moisture data near the study site is doushan station in shandong province the station has average soil moisture data of wheat at depths of 10 cm and 20 cm of three observation points from 2006 to 2016 based on soil moisture data the soil moisture content of the wheat region simulated by the chc model was averaged and verified it can be seen from fig 6 that the correlation coefficient of soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm was 0 71 which is significantly correlated fang 2011 nrmse 16 3 and the correlation coefficient of soil moisture content at the depth of 20 cm was 0 59 which is also significantly correlated nrmse 15 0 see table 3 the swc variation of simulated and measured values at the depth of 10 cm and 20 cm soil water replenishment plant water uptake is shown in fig 7 the simulated soil moisture curve fitted the measured points well but in may there was a short distance between the points and curve in march and april there was more soil water replenishment than that in may and jun because there was more precipitation in the first two months see eq a 1 as a result the variation curve of water uptake and soil moisture fluctuated significantly in mar and apr according to eqs a 8 4 and a 2 3 weather station evaporation verification the grid closest to the meteorological site was selected to output the potential evapotranspiration of crops from 1987 to 2016 and the potential evapotranspiration was compared with water surface observation evaporation from the meteorological station see fig 8 the correlation coefficient r 0 75 shows a significant correlation the error evaluation results are shown in table 4 4 modis et product evaporation data verification the modis et products output the transpiration volume of the global 500 m 500 m grid every 8 days and the average transpiration volume of the study area from 2001 to 2016 was calculated the regional average transpiration volume simulated by the chc was then calculated the linear correlation coefficient of the two was calculated as 0 76 which is a significant correlation the error evaluation is shown in table 4 and fig 9 5 spatial validation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture to validate the spatial simulation of soil moisture and evapotranspiration the chc model was built around the study area and the modis et and soil moisture data of observation were compared with the simulated values the spatial diagram of correlation coefficients of evapotranspiration between simulation and modis and soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm between simulation and observation is shown in fig 10 the correlation coefficient of evapotranspiration in 98 of the area is greater than 0 64 and the correlation coefficient of soil moisture is greater than 0 54 at 3 4 of the sites therefore the correlation degree of simulation in the most area or observation points is significant based on table 1 which illustrates that evapotranspiration and soil moisture of simulation are justified the reason for this performance is that the chc model considers a certain spatial variability in the field at first the chc model was run on each merged grid and the parameters of each merged grid were different lu et al 2015a second each grid cell s land cover was subdivided into an arbitrary number of tiles each corresponding to the fraction of the cell covered by that particular land cover liang et al 1994 the crop model and the water balance calculation of the vic model were run in each fraction of cropland cover and each crop type corresponded to the different fractions of cropland cover as a result the chc model considered the heterogeneity of land cover in each merged grid third the vic model used the structure of the xinan jiang model liang et al 1994 the model considered the variability of the infiltration capacity and evaporation of soil within an area and a curve between the infiltration capacity or evaporation and the fraction of area was used to calculate the infiltration or evaporation amounts of soil within each fraction of land cover in each merged grid to sum up spatial variability in the field was considered in the chc model 6 comparison between the chc and vic model simulations to illustrate the improvement of the chc model relative to the vic model the difference in accuracy see tables 2 4 between the two models was analyzed overall the results of the chc model were better than those of the vic model the significant improvement in accuracy was in the discharge of the validation period and its nse increased by 0 13 which was consistent with the results of zhao et al 2017 who argued that nse increased significantly during the verification period when the dynamic change of leaf area was considered besides the nrmse of soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm reduced by 17 3 and the accuracy also improved 7 error comparison of evapotranspiration methods the evapotranspiration module of the chc model is an improvement of that in the epic model based on the fao method allen et al 1998 fao epic evapotranspiration is the sum of canopy transpiration and soil evaporation and its calculation considers the water stress difference among different crop types and evapotranspiration therefore the systematic error of evapotranspiration simulation is smaller luo et al 2008 improved the epic model and indicated that the coefficient in eq 1 is not appropriate hence this study also revised eq 1 and developed an improved transpiration method based on the epic model and luo et al 2008 hereinafter new epic besides the new epic evapotranspiration module modifies the available water volume for calculating soil surface evaporation in the model to the field water holding capacity neitsch et al 2011 marek et al 2016 pointed out that many documents lack validation of individual modules of the model to that end this study used method a method b and method c table 5 to calculate evapotranspiration discharge soil moisture of the study area method c is the original chc model which was proposed in this study the transpiration module of method c is an improved epic based on the fao method fao epic while the transpiration module of method a is an original epic model the model parameters of the three methods were calibrated again under the corresponding transpiration module condition the errors of different model simulations were calculated to illustrate the effect of improvement of the transpiration module see tables 6 8 the accuracy of transpiration simulation by methods a b and c was estimated based on the transpiration data from modis table 6 shows that the error of the chc model was similar when using different transpiration modules however in general the accuracy of discharge simulated by method c was higher than that of method a method b and the vic model simulation see table 7 however the above results are mixed with the simulation results of other land use types which cannot fully illustrate the improvement of the crop evapotranspiration module for this reason the soil water content data under wheat land use type was extracted from the model and compared with the measured soil water content data of wheat and the error indicators were calculated as shown in table 8 comparing with table 3 it can be found that the pbias and nrmse of the simulated transpiration volume of method a were worse than those of methods b and c and the improved effect was obvious particularly in the context of nrmse marshall et al 2013 the improved effect indicates the improved epic transpiration and fao method modules played a crucial role in improving the accuracy of calculation this conclusion is consistent with the findings of feng and burian 2016 it is worth mentioning that the correlation coefficient of soil water content simulated by method b was better than that simulated by method c but both pbias and nrmse of method b were worse than that of method c to specifically analyze the cause of simulation error of soil water content simulated and observed soil moisture was plotted in fig 11 and fig a 2 the chc model based on fao epic best fitted the observation points and had high reliability for simulating crop water consumption 6 discussion 6 1 discussion of difference between chc and vic model simulations the main difference between the chc and vic models is whether or not the crop growth process is considered the crop leaf area in the chc model is subject to dynamic change which directly affects the calculated soil evaporation and canopy transpiration the crop leaf area in the vic model remains constant throughout one month and does not change in response to varying environments the annual values of leaf area are also the same and these simplifications cause a systematic error of the transpiration volume and surface reflectivity simulation tsarouchi et al 2014 therefore lu et al 2015b emphasize that accounting for dynamic crop growth in a land surface model will significantly improve the representation of soil and land surface processes the above differences render the hydrological elements simulated by the chc and vic models different the improvement of coupled hydrology and crop growth model in tables 2 4 was consistent with tsarouchi et al 2014 who coupled the crop growth model with the land surface model and found that the accuracy of simulated transpiration improved the higher accuracy of the chc model was inseparable from the consideration of the crop growth process the land use type contains different crop rotation types and the leaf area can change dynamically every day nicola et al 2005 also found that the leaf area index calculated by the crop model responded to the effect of precipitation besides the chc model also takes the influence of irrigation into account the root depth also changes dynamically with the increase of crop biomass the proportion of water consumption of each soil layer changes when the leaf area is small the chc model can consider the evaporation from the soil surface these simulations improved the simulation accuracy of discharge and soil moisture the accuracy of discharge simulation by the vic model is lower than that of the chc model especially in some periods of figs 4 and 5 such as 1992 9 2 1993 8 6 1994 7 15 1995 8 23 2009 7 10 2010 9 1 2011 9 1 2013 8 1 this is related to small flows simulated by the vic model combined with fig a 1 a and small flows are related to large simulated evapotranspiration according to fig a 1 c combined with the actual transpiration of the same period it can be seen that although the actual transpiration of the chc model is also large it is closer to the modis evapotranspiration which makes water consumption smaller and runoff larger therefore the flow peak of the chc model simulation was closer to the measured value than that of the vic model the chc model distinguishes different crops for the calculation of evapotranspiration including wheat and peanuts in the vic model only corn is used for the evapotranspiration simulation for all crop land use types the corn leaf area is larger and its transpiration is larger than that of wheat or peanut lu et al 2015b also found that over generalization of the crop growth part by the land surface model caused the leaf area to be too large resulting in high total transpiration volume on the other hand the chc model distinguishes the growth processes of different crops considering the effect of soil water stress in the vic model evapotranspiration of the bottom soil layer is too large while the water content of the bottom layer is usually not lower than the wilting moisture content and this leads to a smaller effect of soil water stress which makes the transpiration of the vic model simulation larger these factors worsen the error indicators of the evapotranspiration of the vic model in comparison with those of the chc model in fig 11 and fig a 2 the soil moisture content simulated by the vic model is always larger than the measured value which is the main reason for the large error of soil water content the transpiration for the cropland use of the vic model was calculated using corn parameters although the evapotranspiration of corn is large the transpiration at the topsoil of the vic model is too small and the crop water consumption of the topsoil is small resulting in a larger value of the surface soil water content in the vic model than the corresponding measured value compared with peng 2004 the transpiration distribution proportion in different soil layers of the chc model is closer to the measured value than that of the vic model the vic model distributes the crop water absorption of each soil layer according to the root density after checking with gao et al 2016 the root density is inconsistent with the domestic measured value hence crop water consumption of each soil layer is redistributed according to the domestic measured root density values the moisture absorption proportions of soil layers of crops in the chc model are still closer to the measured values than those of the vic model in summary there is an obvious systematic error in the distribution of transpiration based on the root density in each soil layer and the systematic error of the transpiration distribution method adopted by the chc model is smaller than that of the vic model because the accuracy of the chc model is higher than that of the vic model the increase in the accuracy of the chc model illustrates the influence of the crop model therefore the comparison results partly reflect the error from each model although the crop model belongs to the field scale it is a simplified version of the epic model neitsch et al 2011 and it is appropriate to be applied at a large scale additionally the chc model considers the proportion of main crop rotation types within the merged grid therefore the regional crop growth can be simulated well 6 2 discussion of the improvement of transpiration some reasons render the low accuracy of method a method b and the vic model simulation compared with method c in table 7 the pbias of transpiration simulated by method a was larger which was related to the insufficient simulation of soil water stress uniyal et al 2019 luo et al 2008 marek et al 2016 2017 also mentioned that there were errors in the soil water stress calculation of the epic model the discharge simulation by the improved epic transpiration module had a higher calculation accuracy indicating that the errors may come from parameter 0 25 in eq 1 luo et al 2008 it needs to be further adjusted and combined with the actual condition instead of being constant in this study parameter 0 25 was adjusted to 1 5 on the other hand the crop available water content in the soil water stress formula of soil surface evaporation in the source code did not match the manual illustration neitsch et al 2011 which also increased the simulation error of soil water stress effect on the soil evaporation and the crop available water content needs to be modified to the water content at field capacity when the soil water stress code of the epic evapotranspiration module was modified as described above corresponding to method b the soil water stress effect increased and the absolute value of the relative error of discharge decreased which was close to the simulation accuracy of the chc model the decreasing error verified the rationality of the above explanation the negative deviation of discharge simulated by the vic model was also very large and was already close to the negative deviation of method a it is not a coincidence that both the vic model and method a had a large negative deviation because the insufficient soil water stress simulation of method a led to large evapotranspiration and all the crops of the vic model are assumed to be corn the big leaf area of which also leads to large evapotranspiration large evapotranspiration would increase water consumption at the study site the river flow would be small and the negative deviation of discharge would be large in fig 11 some reasons lead to simulation differences of these methods method a insufficiently considered the influence of soil water stress resulting in a large transpiration volume and the simulated soil moisture content was smaller than the measured value marek et al 2016 also mentioned that the epic simulated soil moisture content was small in the late stage of crop growth similar to the situation in the late stage of wheat growth in fig 11 method b simulated a larger influence of soil water stress than the actual influence resulting in a small transpiration volume and simulated soil moisture content was larger than the measured value method c considered a moderate influence of soil water stress which ensured that the simulated soil moisture content was closer to the measured value while the vic model had too small a distribution coefficient of surface evapotranspiration resulting in too large a soil moisture content in the surface layer in summary the error influence from the fao epic evapotranspiration module was small and the chc model based on the fao method had high reliability for simulating crop water consumption the parameters required for the transpiration module based on the fao method are listed in allen et al 1998 and it is suitable for the simulation of hundreds of different crops around the world considering the effect of evapotranspiration and crop types on the transpiration stress the physical mechanism of the fao method is more reasonable and it is also the calculation method recommended by fao therefore the fao method was selected as the evapotranspiration module of the chc model the increase of transpiration simulation accuracy is of great significance for the analysis of crop water consumption and agricultural drought assessment 7 conclusions this study couples the variable infiltration capacity vic and environmental policy integrated climate epic models based on the soil water stress method recommended by fao fao method the evapotranspiration module of the epic model improved and the reservoir module grid routing model and irrigation module were introduced and the coupled hydrology crop growth model chc was developed the crop rotation dynamic growth process was simulated based on the chc model taking the upstream watershed of the qingkou river at heilin station as a study area the chc model was verified and the causes of flow and soil water content simulation errors were analyzed the above errors were compared with the simulation errors of the vic model finally the errors of different transpiration modules were compared and analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the chc model s performance was evaluated using the measured data the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of the discharge simulated by the chc model is 0 78 in the calibration period from 1978 to 2008 and is 0 76 in the verification period from 2009 to 2016 the simulation results belong to a very good level the correlation coefficient of soil moisture content at the depth of 10 cm is 0 71 and the correlation coefficient between the simulated and modis evapotranspiration is 0 75 which are both significant 2 the small peak flow of the chc model simulation is mainly related to the large simulated transpiration volume and the simulated soil water content error is related to the soil water stress error by comparing the results of the chc and vic models the chc model simulation performance is better than that of the vic model and the obvious improvement is the efficiency coefficient in the verification period increased by 0 13 and nrmse of soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm reduced by 17 3 the better performance by coupling the crop model is consistent with the conclusions of tsarouchi et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 the improvement is mainly related to the growth simulation of leaves and roots in the crop model 3 the difference in simulation accuracies of different transpiration calculation methods was studied the chc model based on the fao method has the best simulation performance combined with the observed and simulated data the reason for a water stress error of the epic model reported by some references was found a parameter needs to be further adjusted and combined with the actual condition instead of being constant the soil water stress simulation of the soil evaporation module in the epic model also produces large errors resulting in low simulation accuracy the vic model has a smaller proportion of the surface soil layer in crop evapotranspiration which affects the accuracy of calculation the above comparison shows that the chc model based on the fao method is reliable for simulating crop evapotranspiration the crop model was developed based on the simplified physical mechanism and some parameters have clear physical meaning these parameters such as the leaf area index can be validated using the observation data however we did not measure the leaf area index in the study area the verification of crop state variables will help determine the error sources and will improve the coupled model it could be one of the important research directions in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

simulation model raza et al 2014 century oelbermann and voroney 2011 agricultural production systems simulator apsim nelson et al 1998 soil water atmosphere plant swap kroes et al 2000 these models are only suitable for field scale simulation and need more elementary data dssat does not provide one unified model to simulate different crops crop growth models such as apsim and cropsyst are either unsuitable for simulating rice or do not include a rice growth module confalonieri and bocchi 2005 keating et al 2003 the wofost and swap models are sophisticated in describing crop physiology thus need detailed input data monteith 1996 century is focused on element and material cycles and is more specifically designed for soil processes such as organic matter decomposition nitrification and denitrification liu et al 2007 zhang et al 2002 in this study the simplified environmental policy integrated climate epic model was developed from the soil water assessment tool swat model this simplified epic model can be adapted to large scale simulation the epic model uses a unified approach to simulate more than 100 types of crops and has been widely used there are rich data and documents about this model the data requirement is very small and it is easy to apply to large scale simulation a 2 hydrology model a 2 1 vic model the vic variable infiltration capacity model liang et al 1994 is a large scale semi distributed hydrologic model it shares several basic features with other land surface models lsms that are commonly coupled with global circulation models gcms the vic model has been used all over china for a long time and its hydrologic parameters have been calibrated lu et al 2015a mao et al 2016 the vic model is good at simulating soil moisture content as has been amply demonstrated meng and quiring 2008 pan et al 2016 in this study the variable infiltration curve in the vic model was used to obtain the infiltration amount wood et al 1992 and the arno model franchini and pacciani 1991 was used to obtain base flow the soil water replenishment was calculated based on the difference between the precipitation and surface runoff see eq a 1 then the soil water content was calculated by combining with the water balance eq a 2 and the available soil water content can be computed using the eq a 3 however the vic model does not consider plant growth simulation the seasonal variation of leaf area can only be generalized with a series of discrete values to simulate the transpiration in each month the leaf area in the same month does not change from year to year in the vic model the evapotranspiration of agricultural land only includes the net evaporation from canopy interception the transpiration of crops without soil evaporation therefore when the leaf area index of crops is low the simulated evapotranspiration would be lower than the actual evapotranspiration to increase the accuracy of evapotranspiration the crop model needs to be coupled with the vic model the crop model can calculate the evaporation from soil and the transpiration from the crop canopy because the crop model can simulate the growth of crops the lai can be updated every day while the vic retains one constant number of lai in one month therefore this can improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration of cropland in the vic model a 1 r p q d a 2 w 1 w 1 r q 12 e 1 i

basin has a significant impact on the simulation accuracy of large scale routing models therefore the flexible large scale hydrological routing model flash model liu 2017 lu et al 2015a was used in this study for flow routing from grid to grid the flexible location of waterways flow method yamazaki et al 2009 was applied to delineate topographic parameters and the river network map the kinematic wave eq a 4 and continuity eq a 5 were applied to the slope flow concentration within each grid and the diffusion wave eq a 6 was applied to the concentration of channel flow between grids of the watershed thus the flow process in each grid was modeled by this model a 4 a t d a d q q t a 5 q x a t 0 a 6 q t μ 2 q x 2 c q x where a is cross section area m2 q is discharge m3 s x is river length

transpiration of crops actual transpiration of crops actual soil evaporation plant height lai biomass root length and yield the simulation method can be referred to neitsch et al 2011 the epic can also simulate the effect of water stress on crop growth the effect of water stress is quantified by the ratio of actual and potential plant transpiration neitsch et al 2011 a 7 w s t r s 1 e t a c t e

accumulated for the plant on a given day in the initial period of plant growth l 1 and l 2 are shape coefficients here different plants have different parameters which distinguishes crop growth of different species the crop rotation method is diverse for a merged grid however the effect of the crop rotation method is not considered in the hydrological response unit of the epic model to take the diversity of crop rotation methods into account the crop rotation process was introduced based on the epic model and the influence of the proportion of different rotation methods on the simulation was considered in a single merged grid a 4 parameter selection and model setup the parameters include soil vegetation model crop irrigation routing reservoir parameters soil and vegetation parameters were introduced in the section of data crop parameters include the proportion of each type of crops in the merged grid planting time harvest time total number of heat units crop rotation parameters maximum conductance of a single leaf shape coefficients of eq a 11 normal depletion fraction of eq 5 plant uptake compensation factor epco and so on the proportion parameters were calculated using the crop spatial distribution map planting and harvest time were acquired from the ten day data set of crop growth and development and farmland soil moisture in china at china meteorological data service center wang 2015 the total number of heat units was calculated based on the planting time harvest time and temperature using eq a 12 crop rotation parameters are the planting sequence of crops in each merged grid these parameters were calculated based on two crop spatial distribution maps at different time values of maximum conductance of a single leaf shape coefficients of eq a 11 and some other crop parameters were chosen from the crop database of the swat2012 the plant uptake compensation factor was calibrated see appendices a 5 a 12 p h u d 1 m t d t b a s e where phu is the total heat units required for plant maturity d is the day number m is the number of days required for a plant to reach maturity t d is the mean daily temperature t base is the plant s base temperature for growth the study area was divided into 16 merged grids and then hydrological processes and crop growth were simulated at each merged grid and the flows of each merged grids were routed down to the watershed outlet for total river outflow because the irrigation in the crop growth model was influenced by the reservoir module and routing model at every time step and these models or modules were written in different programming languages the crop growth model vic model and grid routing model including irrigation module and reservoir module were run in parallel computation see fig 3 the parallel computation can help run the programs of different languages at the same time and transmit some data between two models and reduce running time a 5 calibration using streamflow the chc model for the watershed upstream of heilin station on the qingkou river was run with a resolution of 5 km and a daily time step and was calibrated for 1976 2008 using the year 1976 1977 as the warm up period a total of 12 parameters involving the vic model crop growth model routing model irrigation module and reservoir module are used for calibration table a 1 the selection of parameters and their initial parameter range were determined based on prior knowledge of the study area and the review of existing literature huang et al 2002 wu et al 2007 a trial and error method and auto optimization procedures were used based on mbonimpa et al 2015 and rosenbrock 1960 the optimization procedure uses eq 10 as the objective function a 6 cause of the chc model discharge error to explain the cause of error in the flow calculation results discharge potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration were plotted as in fig a 1 for analysis from april to october in 2008 as an example it can be seen from fig a 1 that the simulated flow of the chc and vic was small which is related to the potential transpiration and actual transpiration of the model simulation the decisive factor is the actual transpiration as potential transpiration is the intermediate variable for the calculation of actual transpiration combined with the actual transpiration of the same period it can be seen that the actual transpiration of the chc model was larger than the observation which resulted in a larger amount of water consumption and a smaller amount of runoff therefore the flow peak simulated by the chc model was smaller than the measured value a 7 soil moisture variation for a longer period to show more details about the evolution pattern of soil moisture for a longer period the evolution diagrams in 2007 2008 was shown in fig a 2 method c fitted the observation points better than method a method b and vic because method a insufficiently considered the influence of soil water stress method b simulated a larger influence of soil water stress than the actual influence and the vic model had too small a distribution coefficient of surface evapotranspiration these three diagrams in fig a 2 is very similar to fig 11 
10232,some hydrologic models oversimplify crop growth simulation although some studies coupled hydrologic models with crop models there are several hypotheses and unconsidered factors in these studies such as no irrigation to improve simulation of discharge soil moisture and evapotranspiration the variable infiltration capacity vic model was coupled with a crop growth model incorporating an improved evapotranspiration module based on the soil water stress method the new evapotranspiration module improved two water stress errors of the environmental policy integrated climate epic model considering the impact of agricultural irrigation and crop rotation regional crop growth and hydrology were simulated in the upstream watershed of the qingkou river in the east of china results of simulation by the coupled hydrology crop growth chc model were compared with observed discharge data measured soil moisture data and evapotranspiration data obtained from remote sensing inversion the daily nash efficiency coefficient was 0 78 for the calibration period from 1978 to 2008 and was 0 76 for the verification period from 2009 to 2016 the simulated soil moisture was found to be significantly correlated with observed soil moisture better than the simulation by the vic model alone the daily efficiency coefficient of the chc model simulation increased by 0 13 for the verification period compared with that of the vic model and the transpiration module of the chc model had the best simulation accuracy among the vic epic and chc transpiration modules combined with observed data the reason for the water stress error of the epic model reported by some references was found a parameter needs to be further adjusted combined with the actual condition instead of being constant thus the coupled hydrology and crop growth model improved the simulation of hydrological elements and can help guide the efficient use of water resources and adjustment of agricultural cropping practices keywords coupled hydrology and crop growth model improved evapotranspiration module crop rotation irrigation variable infiltration capacity soil water stress method crop influence 1 introduction with the development of geographic information system gis technology more and more models rely on remote sensing inversion data to simulate the dynamic process of the ground for example the hydrological model relies on input as land use data soil data precipitation data wu et al 2018 to simulate hydrological processes however the crop growth simulated by the hydrological model usually is relatively simple and the simplified crop growth simulation also affects the simulation accuracy of hydrological factors to this end some studies have tried to couple crop models with hydrological models which can obtain a higher accuracy of simulation 1 1 coupled hydrologic and crop growth models studies on coupled crop models and hydrological models stemmed from the need to consider the effect of vegetation including crops on simulating evapotranspiration some studies considered vegetation growth in some small scale hydrological models philip 1966 proposed the concept of soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in the 1960s improved crop growth models such as world food studies model wofost in the netherlands de wit et al 2019 and decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model in the united states jones et al 2003 were developed based on the spac concept considering temperature light moisture nitrogen and phosphorus these models use field scale hydrology models while hydrological processes are often simulated on a large scale these crop models are too fine to be applied for large scale simulations see appendices a 1 besides the main driving factor for the spatial heterogeneity of crop drought related yield loss is changes in available soil water anwar et al 2004 patil and sheelavantar 2004 shepherd et al 2002 available soil water is an important output of hydrological simulation but the crop model oversimplifies the simulation of hydrological processes eitzinger et al 2004 priesack et al 2006 siad et al 2019 therefore the coupling of crop models and hydrological models has been widely suggested casanova and judge 2008 li et al 2014 maruyama and kuwagata 2010 van den hoof et al 2011 on the other hand vegetation parameters in some hydrologic models remain constant throughout the entire or part of the simulation period tsarouchi et al 2014 ignoring the growth of crops during that period however accounting for dynamic crop growth in a land surface model will significantly improve the representation of soil and land surface processes as well as evapotranspiration et flux sensitivity lu et al 2015b tsarouchi et al 2014 hence it is necessary to introduce crop growth models into hydrological models siad et al 2019 tsarouchi et al 2014 at present research on the coupling of crop models and hydrological models is still in the early stage of development siad et al 2019 1 2 problems of coupled models the problems encountered when coupling crop models with hydrological models can be divided into three aspects model simulation and application coupling method and coupling model hypotheses 1 2 1 model simulation and application li et al 2014 coupled the wofost and hydrus 1d models to simulate wheat production in arid regions but the application area was small and they did not specify how to simulate crop irrigation nicola et al 2005 coupled dynamic vegetation model dvm and land surface model to simulate soil moisture and leaf area index lai but they used point scale data to verify simulation results and it is difficult to explain the rationality of area drought analysis fatichi et al 2012 applied an eco hydrological model to a region of smaller than 1 km2 the lai of crops in a single grid was spatially heterogeneous but only one value represented the lai of a single grid which affected the accuracy of the evapotranspiration model boegh et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 coupled a simple hydrological model with a crop model to simulate crop yields for agricultural drought assessment but with one point representing a city the application area was too large to summarize current coupled models are often used at small scales even at field scales it is therefore difficult to carry out long term crop growth simulations and drought analyses at a macroscopic large scale sawada et al 2014 tsarouchi et al 2014 1 2 2 coupling method tsarouchi et al 2014 coupled the joint uk land environment simulator jules model and the infocrop model to simulate the effect of underlying surface changes on the evaporation flux some studies have coupled land surface climate or hydrological models with crop growth models boegh et al 2004 lei et al 2010 li et al 2013 mo et al 2005 tsarouchi et al 2014 the present coupling procedures li et al 2014 tsarouchi et al 2014 mostly calculate potential evapotranspiration and vegetation water uptake in the hydrological model then pass it on to the crop model and simulate the crop growth process in the crop model in the simulation of crop growth the calculated state variables include leaf area index root depth and canopy height then the crop model passes these state variables back to the hydrological model however crop transpiration and water uptake can also be calculated in the crop model it is necessary to compare the evapotranspiration calculation accuracy between the crop model and hydrology model to illustrate the validity of the coupling scheme otherwise there will be system error in the transpiration module wang et al 2012 1 2 3 hypotheses of the coupled model there are several hypotheses and unconsidered factors in existing studies including 1 the root depth growth rate is constant until the maximum root depth is reached 2 there is not enough irrigation data vosselen et al 2005 and the effects of reservoirs and irrigation are not considered li et al 2016 osborne et al 2007 3 lack of data on vegetation interception of rain and 4 no accounting for the effect of different crop proportions and rotation patterns within a single grid liu et al 2018 osborne et al 2007 when studying the influence of only one factor on the corresponding state variable these assumptions will not affect the accuracy of results for example when studying the effect of drought on crop water uptake other influencing factors remain unchanged and the impact would be more distinct and clear supit et al 2010 however this may ignore the response of coupling affected by many factors at the same time which affects the simulated data if the measured data is used for verification a large error value will result to address the hypotheses problems of the coupled model the vic variable infiltration capacity model was coupled with the epic environmental policy integrated climate crop model and a grid routing model the crop rotation was considered in each merged grid and the irrigation module and reservoir module were embedded into the crop model and the routing model to account for the effect of irrigation on crop growth to address the problems in the model simulation and application the coupled hydrology crop growth model chc was constructed for the upstream watershed of the qingkou river at the heilin station combined with the observation data simulation results were verified and the causes of the errors were analyzed further the simulation results of the chc and vic models were compared to solve the transpiration problem about the coupling methods different transpiration modules from food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao hereinafter fao method epic and vic were compared 2 study area the study area is the upper watershed of qingkou river above the heilin station in the northern part of jiangsu province the watershed area is 182 km2 and is located at 118º44 17 118º55 10 e 34º59 37 35º9 37 n see fig 1 owing to the proximity to the ocean to the east the climate affected by both the mainland and the ocean is characterized by a warm and temperate monsoon region with a semi humid continental climate abundant sunshine humid and rainy summers and cold and dry winters the annual mean precipitation is 952 mm and the annual mean temperature is 14 2 the planting system brings in one or two harvests a year the crops that are mainly grown are rice corn wheat peanuts and a small number of economic crops such as vegetables and fruits among them peanuts constitute the largest proportion of the planting area 3 data the meteorological data including daily rainfall and air temperature data from 1976 to 2016 came from hydrological stations of heilin qingshuijian and zhubian the inverse distance weighted least squares interpolants franke and nielson 1980 were used to interpolate scattered precipitation values and the precipitation data of each merged grid were obtained because we only had the shortwave radiation longwave radiation vapor pressure wind speed and atmospheric pressure data for a fraction of the time the mtclim model bohn et al 2013 in the vic model was used to calculate the meteorological data based on daily rainfall and air temperature data the discharge data including daily flow data in the flood season from 1978 to 2016 came from heilin hydrological station located at the outlet of the study basin because there is no soil moisture monitoring station in the study area the nearest station doushan in shandong province was chosen for the soil water content data including the ten day soil moisture data from 2006 to 2016 around this area at an approximate distance of 1 9 km the soil moisture data were used for validation there is no published crop spatial distribution data so the data was obtained using a decision tree model based on landsat8 data see fig 2 with a resolution of 30 m the crop rotations included wheat peanut wheat corn and spring peanut the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis evapotranspiration products vermote 2015 comprised the evapotranspiration volume of the global 500 500 m grid every eight days and the average evapotranspiration volume of the study area in 2001 2016 was calculated the digital elevation model dem data came from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a resolution of 30 m farr and kobrick 2000 the water area data came from the 30 m resolution water area data product developed by the european commission joint research center pekel et al 2016 the grid vegetation type data was derived from the global 1 km land cover type database developed by the university of maryland the fraction of the merged grid covered by vegetation tile was computed using the land cover type database and crop spatial distribution data the leaf area index of vegetation other than crops was derived from the land data assimilation system ldas pisek and chen 2007 wiegand et al 1979 and the leaf area index of crops was simulated by the epic model the soil parameters of the vic model were calculated based on the global soil database and formulae of soil characteristic parameters reynolds et al 2000 saxton et al 1986 the characteristic parameters of different types of crops were obtained from the crop parameter library of the soil water assessment tool swat model the characteristic parameters include maximum leaf area index biomass energy ratio maximum canopy height harvest index and so on the hydrological model parameters were calibrated using the measured discharge data 4 methodology 4 1 coupling methods the vic model cannot simulate the crop growth process see appendices a 2 1 to increase the simulation accuracy of hydrologic elements it is necessary to couple the crop growth module with the vic model the epic model was chosen as a crop growth module see appendices a 3 which is more suitable for large scale simulation the epic model was embedded into the vic model the soil water content was calculated by the vic model using precipitation the soil water content was input into the crop model and thus the crop model simulated the crop growth next the soil evaporation and water consumption of the crop calculated by the crop model in different soil layers were input into the vic model and the vic model then calculated the soil water content at the beginning of the next period and so forth as a result a close coupling between the vic model and crop growth model was thus accomplished besides other plant evapotranspiration was simulated using the vic model to be specific when this fraction of land cover is a crop type the chc model calls the epic model to simulate the crop growth when this fraction of land cover belongs to other plant types the chc model calls the vic model to calculate the evapotranspiration since crops need irrigation during the growth process and water needs to be taken from groundwater rivers or reservoirs for irrigation the calculation of river and reservoir water volume is inseparable from river channel routing therefore it is necessary to couple the routing model reservoir module and irrigation module with the vic model see fig 3 the grid routing model liu 2017 lu et al 2015a was selected as the routing model see appendices a 2 2 and loose coupling was used between the vic model and the routing model the vic model transmits surface runoff and base flow of each grid to the routing model and the routing model performs the convergence calculation the reservoir module is closely coupled with the runoff and routing model the routing model transmits the river flow data to the reservoir module and the vic model transmits the evaporation data to the reservoir module the reservoir module calculates the water balance of the reservoir accordingly continuously simulating the reservoir water storage neitsch et al 2011 part of the irrigation module was coupled with the epic model and the irrigation water demand was calculated according to the soil water content neitsch et al 2011 another part of the irrigation module was coupled with the reservoir module and irrigation water demand was input to the reservoir module and the actual irrigation water volume was calculated see section 4 3 then the actual irrigation water volume was returned to the epic model which would increase soil moisture to simulate the growth process of the crop after irrigation to improve the calculation accuracy of runoff and irrigation water demand the evapotranspiration module was improved based on the water stress coefficient method recommended by the fao hereinafter fao method it was used to replace the original evapotranspiration module of the epic and provide the evapotranspiration data for the vic model and irrigation module the specific relationship between modules and the construction principle of the coupled model are shown in fig 3 several studies have assumed that only one flow direction is allowed in all coarse scale grids which neglect the flow heterogeneity in the large scale grid in this study the flexible location of waterways flow method yamazaki et al 2009 which considers the flow heterogeneity in a coarse grid was applied to delineate the river network map merge the catchment with the grid and obtain the merged grid as shown in fig 1 because the crop growth process was introduced into the vic hydrology model and the irrigation module and reservoir module were also introduced into the coupled model to consider the crop growth effect this coupled model can be named as coupled hydrology crop growth model chc 4 2 improved evapotranspiration module the main principle of the crop growth model was introduced in appendices a 3 to consider crop rotation effects crop rotation simulation was introduced into the crop growth model more than one crop could be planted in some grids in the calculation of the total plant water uptake as the water content of soil decreases the water in the soil becomes increasingly difficult for the plant to extract and the crop water uptake is expressed as neitsch et al 2011 1 w u p l y w u p l y exp 5 s w l y 0 25 a w c l y 1 s w l y 0 25 a w c l y w u p l y s w l y 0 25 a w c l y 2 w a c t u a l u p l y min w u p l y s w l y w p l y where w u p l y is the amount of water absorbed by crops from the soil of the ly th layer mm w u p l y is the amount of water absorbed by crops from the soil of the ly th layer before correction mm sw ly is the soil water content of the ly th layer mm awc ly is the available water capacity for layer ly mm w actualup ly is the actual water uptake for layer ly mm and wp ly is the water content of layer ly at wilting point mm however this model cannot fully simulate the effect of water stress in the study area because 0 25awc ly is smaller than the water content at a wilting point and the soil water cannot get to 0 25awc ly uniyal et al 2019 and marek et al 2016 indicated that errors in the plant stress functions led to larger et as a result the water stress effect cannot be considered in the simulation of crop growth an improved evapotranspiration module of the crop growth model would be illustrated below a great number of equations for estimating evapotranspiration et 0 have been reported in the literature gavilán et al 2006 but the penman monteith equation has been accepted as the most accurate formula abdul karim et al 2013 the transpiration of crops in the vic model is estimated according to the penman monteith equation liang et al 1994 the transpiration in different layers is combined with the root density to obtain the total transpiration however the root density in each layer of soil is constant during the whole of crop growth assuming that the root length is constant which is inconsistent with reality because the crop root depth is not the same at the seedling and maturity stages besides the vic is a large scale semi distributed hydrologic model and often ignores some details to simplify the calculation procedure for example it neglects soil evaporation when there is vegetation in one grid when the vegetation has a small lai the soil evaporation is also large but the vic does not calculate soil evaporation separately and thus the simulated evapotranspiration is not accurate in the epic model the transpiration of crops is also calculated by the penman monteith equation neitsch et al 2011 and the water uptake distribution by a plant in each layer of soil is described by a mathematical function this function includes the depth parameter of root development in the soil and the water uptake can consider the root development the transpiration ratio in each layer is variable in different growth periods additionally the epic model divides evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and canopy transpiration combined with the above ground biomass therefore the vegetation water uptake can be estimated more accurately by using the canopy transpiration however as shown in the previous paragraph it cannot calculate the water uptake accurately under the water stress condition it is necessary to refer to other model theories to improve the calculation method camargo and kemanian 2016 wang et al 2013 simulation dual kc simdualkc rosa et al 2016 uses the water stress coefficient method recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 to calculate crop evapotranspiration et c allen et al 1998 and evapotranspiration is separated into crop transpiration and soil evaporation therein crop transpiration is estimated using a crop coefficient k c multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration et 0 the actual k c k c act is calculated based on eq 3 abdul karim et al 2013 3 k c a c t k s k c b k e where k c act is the crop

for et c 5 mm day et c is the crop evapotranspiration p normal can be referred to allen et al 1998 it considers the influence of crop types and evapotranspiration and is more realistic therefore the transpiration module of the fao method was considered to improve the evapotranspiration module of the epic model hereinafter fao epic liu et al 2015 eq 1 was replaced by eq 6 to consider the effect of water stress on crop water consumption but the structure of layer by layer calculation of evapotranspiration remained 6 w u p l y w u p l y k s l y where k s ly is the water stress coefficient of the layer ly and was calculated by eq 4 4 3 irrigation module and reservoir module when the soil water content was below some threshold crops would experience water stress and crop transpiration would reduce accordingly if there was sufficient water for irrigation water would be applied by irrigation to the soil haddeland et al 2006 until the soil water content reached field capacity to simplify the calculation the simulated irrigation water is assumed to come only from rivers and reservoirs when the water in rivers and reservoirs is less than the water required for irrigation crops would be insufficiently irrigated to calculate the water in reservoirs the reservoir module was coupled with the grid routing model then the actual irrigation water was simulated based on formula 7 7 i a i r i r v v i r v where i a is the actual irrigation water mm and i r is the irrigation water demand mm and v is the water stored in the water body mm it was assumed in the irrigation module that the closer they are to rivers and reservoirs the more easily they are irrigated hence each merged grid was divided into irrigation area and non irrigation area according to the irrigation ratio data from yearbooks haddeland et al 2006 reservoir water volume is an important source for irrigation water in the irrigation module the following water balance equation was selected to build the reservoir module neitsch et al 2011 8 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p i a where v is the volume of water stored in the reservoir at the end of the period m3 v stored is

by seepage during the period m3 when the calculated reservoir water volume was greater than the reservoir capacity v would equal the reservoir capacity there are too many reservoirs in each merged grids it is impossible to measure the reservoir capacities in all the grids to estimate the reservoir capacity the 30 m resolution water area data product pekel et al 2016 and eq 9 were used to calculate the reservoir capacity 9 s a β v e x p s a where sa is the surface area of the water body m2 β and expsa are coefficients and v is the reservoir capacity m3 4 4 performance evaluation of the chc model this study used percent bias pbias normalized root mean square error nrmse the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and pearson product moment correlation coefficient r to evaluate model performance the standard of evaluation cheng et al 2016 daggupati et al 2016 kim 2012 liu et al 2011 miller et al 2007 is shown below table 1 where f t is the model simulation value at time t t 1 2 t f is the average value of model simulation values at all times y t is the observed value at time t and y is the average value of the observed values at all times the parameter selection and model setup were introduced in appendices a 4 when calibrating model parameters a total of 12 model parameters see appendices a 5 were adjusted manually first so that the simulation flow of the basin outlet was as close as possible to the measured value after that the above parameters were locally adjusted by the rosenbrock method with the objective function of the daily efficiency coefficient nse the chc simulation was verified against the flow data not used in the calibration and model performance was evaluated based on eqs 10 13 meanwhile model performance was also validated using soil moisture data from observation stations evapotranspiration data from meteorological stations and evapotranspiration data from modis 5 results 1 flow validation at the basin outlet the warm up period calibration period and validation period were 1976 1977 1978 2008 and 2009 2016 respectively the nse of the calibration period was 0 78 and the relative error was 2 1 see fig 4 the nse of the verification period was 0 76 and the relative error was 11 1 see fig 5 according to table 1 the model performance belonged to a very good level and the correlation degree belonged to a high level the daily nse and relative error in the calibration period were better than those of most watersheds in daggupati et al 2016 and were also better than the nse and relative error in sawada et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 therefore the flow simulated by the chc model was regarded as reasonable from fig 4 and table 2 it can be seen that during the flood season especially at some flow peak positions the simulated flow was smaller than the measured flow which was related to the runoff module principle and precipitation input the vic model uses a runoff yield mechanism at natural storage and most of the watersheds often coexist with runoff yields at both the natural storage and excess infiltration bao 2009 during the flood season especially when rainfall intensity is high in summer runoff yield in excess of infiltration often accounts for a certain proportion of the total runoff yield if runoff yield in excess of infiltration is not considered the simulated flood peak will be smaller than the actual flood peak meanwhile the time resolution of precipitation data also affects the simulation results the input data of the vic model in the study was on a 6 hour scale when the meteorological forcing data was prepared the high intensity precipitation was averaged to the 6 hour scale which would decrease the runoff yield of the short term heavy rainfall during the flood season although the systematic error was minimized by increasing b when calibrating the parameters excessively increasing the b value would lead to a larger error when the flow was small besides another error source comes from the simulated evapotranspiration see appendices a 6 therefore the simulated flow would still be small at some flow peak positions 2 soil moisture validation the station with a long series of observed soil moisture data near the study site is doushan station in shandong province the station has average soil moisture data of wheat at depths of 10 cm and 20 cm of three observation points from 2006 to 2016 based on soil moisture data the soil moisture content of the wheat region simulated by the chc model was averaged and verified it can be seen from fig 6 that the correlation coefficient of soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm was 0 71 which is significantly correlated fang 2011 nrmse 16 3 and the correlation coefficient of soil moisture content at the depth of 20 cm was 0 59 which is also significantly correlated nrmse 15 0 see table 3 the swc variation of simulated and measured values at the depth of 10 cm and 20 cm soil water replenishment plant water uptake is shown in fig 7 the simulated soil moisture curve fitted the measured points well but in may there was a short distance between the points and curve in march and april there was more soil water replenishment than that in may and jun because there was more precipitation in the first two months see eq a 1 as a result the variation curve of water uptake and soil moisture fluctuated significantly in mar and apr according to eqs a 8 4 and a 2 3 weather station evaporation verification the grid closest to the meteorological site was selected to output the potential evapotranspiration of crops from 1987 to 2016 and the potential evapotranspiration was compared with water surface observation evaporation from the meteorological station see fig 8 the correlation coefficient r 0 75 shows a significant correlation the error evaluation results are shown in table 4 4 modis et product evaporation data verification the modis et products output the transpiration volume of the global 500 m 500 m grid every 8 days and the average transpiration volume of the study area from 2001 to 2016 was calculated the regional average transpiration volume simulated by the chc was then calculated the linear correlation coefficient of the two was calculated as 0 76 which is a significant correlation the error evaluation is shown in table 4 and fig 9 5 spatial validation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture to validate the spatial simulation of soil moisture and evapotranspiration the chc model was built around the study area and the modis et and soil moisture data of observation were compared with the simulated values the spatial diagram of correlation coefficients of evapotranspiration between simulation and modis and soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm between simulation and observation is shown in fig 10 the correlation coefficient of evapotranspiration in 98 of the area is greater than 0 64 and the correlation coefficient of soil moisture is greater than 0 54 at 3 4 of the sites therefore the correlation degree of simulation in the most area or observation points is significant based on table 1 which illustrates that evapotranspiration and soil moisture of simulation are justified the reason for this performance is that the chc model considers a certain spatial variability in the field at first the chc model was run on each merged grid and the parameters of each merged grid were different lu et al 2015a second each grid cell s land cover was subdivided into an arbitrary number of tiles each corresponding to the fraction of the cell covered by that particular land cover liang et al 1994 the crop model and the water balance calculation of the vic model were run in each fraction of cropland cover and each crop type corresponded to the different fractions of cropland cover as a result the chc model considered the heterogeneity of land cover in each merged grid third the vic model used the structure of the xinan jiang model liang et al 1994 the model considered the variability of the infiltration capacity and evaporation of soil within an area and a curve between the infiltration capacity or evaporation and the fraction of area was used to calculate the infiltration or evaporation amounts of soil within each fraction of land cover in each merged grid to sum up spatial variability in the field was considered in the chc model 6 comparison between the chc and vic model simulations to illustrate the improvement of the chc model relative to the vic model the difference in accuracy see tables 2 4 between the two models was analyzed overall the results of the chc model were better than those of the vic model the significant improvement in accuracy was in the discharge of the validation period and its nse increased by 0 13 which was consistent with the results of zhao et al 2017 who argued that nse increased significantly during the verification period when the dynamic change of leaf area was considered besides the nrmse of soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm reduced by 17 3 and the accuracy also improved 7 error comparison of evapotranspiration methods the evapotranspiration module of the chc model is an improvement of that in the epic model based on the fao method allen et al 1998 fao epic evapotranspiration is the sum of canopy transpiration and soil evaporation and its calculation considers the water stress difference among different crop types and evapotranspiration therefore the systematic error of evapotranspiration simulation is smaller luo et al 2008 improved the epic model and indicated that the coefficient in eq 1 is not appropriate hence this study also revised eq 1 and developed an improved transpiration method based on the epic model and luo et al 2008 hereinafter new epic besides the new epic evapotranspiration module modifies the available water volume for calculating soil surface evaporation in the model to the field water holding capacity neitsch et al 2011 marek et al 2016 pointed out that many documents lack validation of individual modules of the model to that end this study used method a method b and method c table 5 to calculate evapotranspiration discharge soil moisture of the study area method c is the original chc model which was proposed in this study the transpiration module of method c is an improved epic based on the fao method fao epic while the transpiration module of method a is an original epic model the model parameters of the three methods were calibrated again under the corresponding transpiration module condition the errors of different model simulations were calculated to illustrate the effect of improvement of the transpiration module see tables 6 8 the accuracy of transpiration simulation by methods a b and c was estimated based on the transpiration data from modis table 6 shows that the error of the chc model was similar when using different transpiration modules however in general the accuracy of discharge simulated by method c was higher than that of method a method b and the vic model simulation see table 7 however the above results are mixed with the simulation results of other land use types which cannot fully illustrate the improvement of the crop evapotranspiration module for this reason the soil water content data under wheat land use type was extracted from the model and compared with the measured soil water content data of wheat and the error indicators were calculated as shown in table 8 comparing with table 3 it can be found that the pbias and nrmse of the simulated transpiration volume of method a were worse than those of methods b and c and the improved effect was obvious particularly in the context of nrmse marshall et al 2013 the improved effect indicates the improved epic transpiration and fao method modules played a crucial role in improving the accuracy of calculation this conclusion is consistent with the findings of feng and burian 2016 it is worth mentioning that the correlation coefficient of soil water content simulated by method b was better than that simulated by method c but both pbias and nrmse of method b were worse than that of method c to specifically analyze the cause of simulation error of soil water content simulated and observed soil moisture was plotted in fig 11 and fig a 2 the chc model based on fao epic best fitted the observation points and had high reliability for simulating crop water consumption 6 discussion 6 1 discussion of difference between chc and vic model simulations the main difference between the chc and vic models is whether or not the crop growth process is considered the crop leaf area in the chc model is subject to dynamic change which directly affects the calculated soil evaporation and canopy transpiration the crop leaf area in the vic model remains constant throughout one month and does not change in response to varying environments the annual values of leaf area are also the same and these simplifications cause a systematic error of the transpiration volume and surface reflectivity simulation tsarouchi et al 2014 therefore lu et al 2015b emphasize that accounting for dynamic crop growth in a land surface model will significantly improve the representation of soil and land surface processes the above differences render the hydrological elements simulated by the chc and vic models different the improvement of coupled hydrology and crop growth model in tables 2 4 was consistent with tsarouchi et al 2014 who coupled the crop growth model with the land surface model and found that the accuracy of simulated transpiration improved the higher accuracy of the chc model was inseparable from the consideration of the crop growth process the land use type contains different crop rotation types and the leaf area can change dynamically every day nicola et al 2005 also found that the leaf area index calculated by the crop model responded to the effect of precipitation besides the chc model also takes the influence of irrigation into account the root depth also changes dynamically with the increase of crop biomass the proportion of water consumption of each soil layer changes when the leaf area is small the chc model can consider the evaporation from the soil surface these simulations improved the simulation accuracy of discharge and soil moisture the accuracy of discharge simulation by the vic model is lower than that of the chc model especially in some periods of figs 4 and 5 such as 1992 9 2 1993 8 6 1994 7 15 1995 8 23 2009 7 10 2010 9 1 2011 9 1 2013 8 1 this is related to small flows simulated by the vic model combined with fig a 1 a and small flows are related to large simulated evapotranspiration according to fig a 1 c combined with the actual transpiration of the same period it can be seen that although the actual transpiration of the chc model is also large it is closer to the modis evapotranspiration which makes water consumption smaller and runoff larger therefore the flow peak of the chc model simulation was closer to the measured value than that of the vic model the chc model distinguishes different crops for the calculation of evapotranspiration including wheat and peanuts in the vic model only corn is used for the evapotranspiration simulation for all crop land use types the corn leaf area is larger and its transpiration is larger than that of wheat or peanut lu et al 2015b also found that over generalization of the crop growth part by the land surface model caused the leaf area to be too large resulting in high total transpiration volume on the other hand the chc model distinguishes the growth processes of different crops considering the effect of soil water stress in the vic model evapotranspiration of the bottom soil layer is too large while the water content of the bottom layer is usually not lower than the wilting moisture content and this leads to a smaller effect of soil water stress which makes the transpiration of the vic model simulation larger these factors worsen the error indicators of the evapotranspiration of the vic model in comparison with those of the chc model in fig 11 and fig a 2 the soil moisture content simulated by the vic model is always larger than the measured value which is the main reason for the large error of soil water content the transpiration for the cropland use of the vic model was calculated using corn parameters although the evapotranspiration of corn is large the transpiration at the topsoil of the vic model is too small and the crop water consumption of the topsoil is small resulting in a larger value of the surface soil water content in the vic model than the corresponding measured value compared with peng 2004 the transpiration distribution proportion in different soil layers of the chc model is closer to the measured value than that of the vic model the vic model distributes the crop water absorption of each soil layer according to the root density after checking with gao et al 2016 the root density is inconsistent with the domestic measured value hence crop water consumption of each soil layer is redistributed according to the domestic measured root density values the moisture absorption proportions of soil layers of crops in the chc model are still closer to the measured values than those of the vic model in summary there is an obvious systematic error in the distribution of transpiration based on the root density in each soil layer and the systematic error of the transpiration distribution method adopted by the chc model is smaller than that of the vic model because the accuracy of the chc model is higher than that of the vic model the increase in the accuracy of the chc model illustrates the influence of the crop model therefore the comparison results partly reflect the error from each model although the crop model belongs to the field scale it is a simplified version of the epic model neitsch et al 2011 and it is appropriate to be applied at a large scale additionally the chc model considers the proportion of main crop rotation types within the merged grid therefore the regional crop growth can be simulated well 6 2 discussion of the improvement of transpiration some reasons render the low accuracy of method a method b and the vic model simulation compared with method c in table 7 the pbias of transpiration simulated by method a was larger which was related to the insufficient simulation of soil water stress uniyal et al 2019 luo et al 2008 marek et al 2016 2017 also mentioned that there were errors in the soil water stress calculation of the epic model the discharge simulation by the improved epic transpiration module had a higher calculation accuracy indicating that the errors may come from parameter 0 25 in eq 1 luo et al 2008 it needs to be further adjusted and combined with the actual condition instead of being constant in this study parameter 0 25 was adjusted to 1 5 on the other hand the crop available water content in the soil water stress formula of soil surface evaporation in the source code did not match the manual illustration neitsch et al 2011 which also increased the simulation error of soil water stress effect on the soil evaporation and the crop available water content needs to be modified to the water content at field capacity when the soil water stress code of the epic evapotranspiration module was modified as described above corresponding to method b the soil water stress effect increased and the absolute value of the relative error of discharge decreased which was close to the simulation accuracy of the chc model the decreasing error verified the rationality of the above explanation the negative deviation of discharge simulated by the vic model was also very large and was already close to the negative deviation of method a it is not a coincidence that both the vic model and method a had a large negative deviation because the insufficient soil water stress simulation of method a led to large evapotranspiration and all the crops of the vic model are assumed to be corn the big leaf area of which also leads to large evapotranspiration large evapotranspiration would increase water consumption at the study site the river flow would be small and the negative deviation of discharge would be large in fig 11 some reasons lead to simulation differences of these methods method a insufficiently considered the influence of soil water stress resulting in a large transpiration volume and the simulated soil moisture content was smaller than the measured value marek et al 2016 also mentioned that the epic simulated soil moisture content was small in the late stage of crop growth similar to the situation in the late stage of wheat growth in fig 11 method b simulated a larger influence of soil water stress than the actual influence resulting in a small transpiration volume and simulated soil moisture content was larger than the measured value method c considered a moderate influence of soil water stress which ensured that the simulated soil moisture content was closer to the measured value while the vic model had too small a distribution coefficient of surface evapotranspiration resulting in too large a soil moisture content in the surface layer in summary the error influence from the fao epic evapotranspiration module was small and the chc model based on the fao method had high reliability for simulating crop water consumption the parameters required for the transpiration module based on the fao method are listed in allen et al 1998 and it is suitable for the simulation of hundreds of different crops around the world considering the effect of evapotranspiration and crop types on the transpiration stress the physical mechanism of the fao method is more reasonable and it is also the calculation method recommended by fao therefore the fao method was selected as the evapotranspiration module of the chc model the increase of transpiration simulation accuracy is of great significance for the analysis of crop water consumption and agricultural drought assessment 7 conclusions this study couples the variable infiltration capacity vic and environmental policy integrated climate epic models based on the soil water stress method recommended by fao fao method the evapotranspiration module of the epic model improved and the reservoir module grid routing model and irrigation module were introduced and the coupled hydrology crop growth model chc was developed the crop rotation dynamic growth process was simulated based on the chc model taking the upstream watershed of the qingkou river at heilin station as a study area the chc model was verified and the causes of flow and soil water content simulation errors were analyzed the above errors were compared with the simulation errors of the vic model finally the errors of different transpiration modules were compared and analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the chc model s performance was evaluated using the measured data the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of the discharge simulated by the chc model is 0 78 in the calibration period from 1978 to 2008 and is 0 76 in the verification period from 2009 to 2016 the simulation results belong to a very good level the correlation coefficient of soil moisture content at the depth of 10 cm is 0 71 and the correlation coefficient between the simulated and modis evapotranspiration is 0 75 which are both significant 2 the small peak flow of the chc model simulation is mainly related to the large simulated transpiration volume and the simulated soil water content error is related to the soil water stress error by comparing the results of the chc and vic models the chc model simulation performance is better than that of the vic model and the obvious improvement is the efficiency coefficient in the verification period increased by 0 13 and nrmse of soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm reduced by 17 3 the better performance by coupling the crop model is consistent with the conclusions of tsarouchi et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 the improvement is mainly related to the growth simulation of leaves and roots in the crop model 3 the difference in simulation accuracies of different transpiration calculation methods was studied the chc model based on the fao method has the best simulation performance combined with the observed and simulated data the reason for a water stress error of the epic model reported by some references was found a parameter needs to be further adjusted and combined with the actual condition instead of being constant the soil water stress simulation of the soil evaporation module in the epic model also produces large errors resulting in low simulation accuracy the vic model has a smaller proportion of the surface soil layer in crop evapotranspiration which affects the accuracy of calculation the above comparison shows that the chc model based on the fao method is reliable for simulating crop evapotranspiration the crop model was developed based on the simplified physical mechanism and some parameters have clear physical meaning these parameters such as the leaf area index can be validated using the observation data however we did not measure the leaf area index in the study area the verification of crop state variables will help determine the error sources and will improve the coupled model it could be one of the important research directions in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

simulation model raza et al 2014 century oelbermann and voroney 2011 agricultural production systems simulator apsim nelson et al 1998 soil water atmosphere plant swap kroes et al 2000 these models are only suitable for field scale simulation and need more elementary data dssat does not provide one unified model to simulate different crops crop growth models such as apsim and cropsyst are either unsuitable for simulating rice or do not include a rice growth module confalonieri and bocchi 2005 keating et al 2003 the wofost and swap models are sophisticated in describing crop physiology thus need detailed input data monteith 1996 century is focused on element and material cycles and is more specifically designed for soil processes such as organic matter decomposition nitrification and denitrification liu et al 2007 zhang et al 2002 in this study the simplified environmental policy integrated climate epic model was developed from the soil water assessment tool swat model this simplified epic model can be adapted to large scale simulation the epic model uses a unified approach to simulate more than 100 types of crops and has been widely used there are rich data and documents about this model the data requirement is very small and it is easy to apply to large scale simulation a 2 hydrology model a 2 1 vic model the vic variable infiltration capacity model liang et al 1994 is a large scale semi distributed hydrologic model it shares several basic features with other land surface models lsms that are commonly coupled with global circulation models gcms the vic model has been used all over china for a long time and its hydrologic parameters have been calibrated lu et al 2015a mao et al 2016 the vic model is good at simulating soil moisture content as has been amply demonstrated meng and quiring 2008 pan et al 2016 in this study the variable infiltration curve in the vic model was used to obtain the infiltration amount wood et al 1992 and the arno model franchini and pacciani 1991 was used to obtain base flow the soil water replenishment was calculated based on the difference between the precipitation and surface runoff see eq a 1 then the soil water content was calculated by combining with the water balance eq a 2 and the available soil water content can be computed using the eq a 3 however the vic model does not consider plant growth simulation the seasonal variation of leaf area can only be generalized with a series of discrete values to simulate the transpiration in each month the leaf area in the same month does not change from year to year in the vic model the evapotranspiration of agricultural land only includes the net evaporation from canopy interception the transpiration of crops without soil evaporation therefore when the leaf area index of crops is low the simulated evapotranspiration would be lower than the actual evapotranspiration to increase the accuracy of evapotranspiration the crop model needs to be coupled with the vic model the crop model can calculate the evaporation from soil and the transpiration from the crop canopy because the crop model can simulate the growth of crops the lai can be updated every day while the vic retains one constant number of lai in one month therefore this can improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration of cropland in the vic model a 1 r p q d a 2 w 1 w 1 r q 12 e 1 i

this study for flow routing from grid to grid the flexible location of waterways flow method yamazaki et al 2009 was applied to delineate topographic parameters and the river network map the kinematic wave eq a 4 and continuity eq a 5 were applied to the slope flow concentration within each grid and the diffusion wave eq a 6 was applied to the concentration of channel flow between grids of the

different species the crop rotation method is diverse for a merged grid however the effect of the crop rotation method is not considered in the hydrological response unit of the epic model to take the diversity of crop rotation methods into account the crop rotation process was introduced based on the epic model and the influence of the proportion of different rotation methods on the simulation was considered in a single merged grid a 4 parameter selection and model setup the parameters include soil vegetation model crop irrigation routing reservoir parameters soil and vegetation parameters were

units required for plant maturity d is the day number m is the number of days required for a plant to reach maturity t d is the mean daily temperature t base is the plant s base temperature for growth the study area was divided into 16 merged grids and then hydrological processes and crop growth were simulated at each merged grid and the flows of each merged grids were routed down to the watershed outlet for total river outflow because the irrigation in the crop growth model was influenced by the reservoir module and routing model at every time step and these models or modules were written in different programming languages the crop growth model vic model and grid routing model including irrigation module and reservoir module were run in parallel computation see fig 3 the parallel computation can help run the programs of different languages at the same time and transmit some data between two models and reduce running time a 5 calibration using streamflow the chc model for the watershed upstream of heilin station on the qingkou river was run with a resolution of 5 km and a daily time step and was calibrated for 1976 2008 using the year 1976 1977 as the warm up period a total of 12 parameters involving the vic model crop growth model routing model irrigation module and reservoir module are used for calibration table a 1 the selection of parameters and their initial parameter range were determined based on prior knowledge of the study area and the review of existing literature huang et al 2002 wu et al 2007 a trial and error method and auto optimization procedures were used based on mbonimpa et al 2015 and rosenbrock 1960 the optimization procedure uses eq 10 as the objective function a 6 cause of the chc model discharge error to explain the cause of error in the flow calculation results discharge potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration were plotted as in fig a 1 for analysis from april to october in 2008 as an example it can be seen from fig a 1 that the simulated flow of the chc and vic was small which is related to the potential transpiration and actual transpiration of the model simulation the decisive factor is the actual transpiration as potential transpiration is the intermediate variable for the calculation of actual transpiration combined with the actual transpiration of the same period it can be seen that the actual transpiration of the chc model was larger than the observation which resulted in a larger amount of water consumption and a smaller amount of runoff therefore the flow peak simulated by the chc model was smaller than the measured value a 7 soil moisture variation for a longer period to show more details about the evolution pattern of soil moisture for a longer period the evolution diagrams in 2007 2008 was shown in fig a 2 method c fitted the observation points better than method a method b and vic because method a insufficiently considered the influence of soil water stress method b simulated a larger influence of soil water stress than the actual influence and the vic model had too small a distribution coefficient of surface evapotranspiration these three diagrams in fig a 2 is very similar to fig 11 
10233,soil moisture in root zone is highly heterogeneous in space while its effect on water transport safety in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac remains poorly understood in this study we conducted vertical spilt root experiments in r pseudoacacia using loamy clay and sandy loam soils in greenhouse and measured the dynamics of midday transpiration rate predawn and midday leaf water potential with the lower root zone remaining drought and the upper root zone undergoing the drought rewatered drought process the plant supply demand hydraulic model was calibrated with the measured data indicating that the model could efficiently simulate spac water transport in r pseudoacacia under the condition of vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on this basis we set various combinations of soil moisture in the upper and lower root zones under different soil types and atmospheric evaporative demands in the model and simulated the variations of indicators describing water transport safety in spac including actual transpiration rate e the critical leaf transpiration rate at hydraulic failure e crit hydraulic safety margin hsm and percentage loss of soil plant hydraulic conductance plk the numerical simulations suggested that the water transport safety in spac varied substantially with vertical soil moisture heterogeneity and the responses were impacted by soil types and atmospheric evaporative demand with decreasing soil moisture in the upper root zone smcup e crit e and hsm remained steady at first and then decreased rapidly when smcup below a threshold while plk exhibited an opposite trend with decreasing soil moisture in the lower root zone smcdown the curves of e crit e and hsm presented a descending trend while the curve of plk went up water transport safety in spac declined with decreasing swcup and swcdown and became more sensitive to swcup with a lower swcdown swcdown had greater impact on water transport safety in spac under coarser textured soil with higher atmospheric evaporative demand the results were supplemental to the traditional analysis of soil water availability to plants under homogeneous condition and would be helpful for analyzing functional difference of water storage in different soil depths as well as for optimizing water resource management keywords soil moisture heterogeneity water transport safety soil plant atmosphere continuum plant hydraulic model 1 introduction the distribution of soil moisture in root zone varies strongly in time and space jia et al 2016 ryel et al 2008 xi et al 2013 which results in a marked impact on water transport in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac and other physiological metabolisms including nutrient uptake photosynthetic assimilation etc reich et al 2018 sperry and love 2015 yang et al 2017 in arid and semi arid area rooting depths of shrubs and trees usually exceed infiltration depth for precipitation fan et al 2017 schenk 2005 soil moisture in shallow root zone fluctuates rapidly and extremely due to infiltration soil evaporation and root water uptake however soil moisture in deeper root zone changes relatively more slowly with fewer roots and recharge events resulting in a pronounced vertical soil moisture heterogeneity in root zone fan et al 2017 xi et al 2018a in agricultural ecosystems some irrigation techniques including drip irrigation vertical partial root zone drying method etc could also induce vertical soil moisture heterogeneity in root zone for regulating plant water use and enhancing water use efficiency ma et al 2013 shu et al 2020 xi et al 2016 although plant response to soil water availability has been studied for decades most of the studies were under homogeneous soil moisture conditions wu et al 2011c yan et al 2017 effect of root zone soil moisture heterogeneity on plant eco physiological functions is still poorly understood despite its potential importance fan et al 2017 puértolas et al 2020 xi et al 2018b recently the response of plant water use to soil moisture heterogeneity has been studied with control experiments puértolas et al 2020 field observations gaines et al 2016 isotopic tracing method yang et al 2015 and numerical modeling xi et al 2016 accordingly plants can respond to soil moisture heterogeneity rapidly through hydraulic signals including leaf water potential hydraulic conductance etc and chemical signals including abscisic acid peptide etc huber et al 2015 reich et al 2018 takahashi et al 2018 huber et al 2015 proposed a mechanistic soil root water flow model r swms and examined the roles of hydraulic and chemical signals in regulating leaf water potential and transpiration under horizontal and vertical soil moisture heterogeneity in root zone their results supported that isohydric plant behavior originates from the combined control of hydraulic and chemical signals whereas anisohydric behavior emerges mainly from the control of chemical signals recent reports suggested that roots of some species can move water from moist to dry soil through hydraulic redistribution neumann and cardon 2012 prieto et al 2012 which can increase dry season transpiration and photosynthetic rates domec et al 2010 prolong the life span of fine roots bauerle et al 2008 and maintain root soil contact in dry soils caldwell et al 1998 domec et al 2004 hydraulic redistribution helps plants present as an efficient adaptability to heterogeneous soil moisture based on the physiological mechanism and experimental findings ryel et al 2008 proposed a conceptual model indicating that a growth pool is located in shallow soil layer and a maintenance pool is in deeper soil layer yang et al 2017 also found that deeper soil water contributes to drought avoidance and shallower soil water determines the growing rate of trees based on long term field observations according to the cohesion tension theory transpiration stream is pulled through porous media in soil and xylem conduits of plant as soil and atmosphere drought progressed more negative pressures increase flow resistance by causing cavitation in xylem conduits and draining of soil pores in rhizosphere thus endanger water transport safety in spac sperry and love 2015 water transport safety in spac plays a critical role in determining plant growth and survival during drought stress choat et al 2018 wolfe et al 2016 hence analyzing the response of water transport safety in spac to vertical soil moisture heterogeneity is essential in understanding plant water relationships and helps to optimize water resources management based on previous studies under homogeneous soil moisture conditions wu et al 2011a 2015 the responses of plant water uptake and loss in spac to soil water availability were affected by multiple factors including soil texture plant species atmospheric evaporative demand etc researchers have developed various mathematical models to examine the effect of these factors on the responses of plants to soil water availability huber et al 2015 novak et al 2005 in traditional spac models response of root water uptake and canopy transpiration to soil and atmospheric drought was generally described with prescribed empirical stress functions in numerous mathematical forms based on experiments damour et al 2010 feddes et al 1978 gharsallah et al 2013 the coupling between water uptake and loss in spac is loose and there is a lack of mechanisms for simulating spac water transport tai et al 2018 with the development of plant hydraulics more mechanistic based models were developed for coupling root water uptake and canopy loss in a more direct way huber et al 2015 sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2003 based on the similarity in soil and xylem water transport in physics sperry et al 1998 developed a resistance network model to describe water transport in soil plant system mechanistically sperry and love 2015 further developed the supply demand theory and upgraded soil plant model for simulating spac water transport by including the stomatal control of transpiration and leaf water potential abbreviated as sperry model based on soil water potential profile vapor pressure deficit vpd and hydraulic properties of soil and xylem sperry model could directly solve water flux canopy conductance and the distribution of water potential and hydraulic conductance in spac sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2016 thus this model serves as an efficient tool for analyzing the effect of vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac robinia pseudoacacia l black locust has been widely planted around the world it plays an essential role in improving environmental quality and reducing soil erosion li et al 2018 in loess plateau r pseudoacacia was commonly chosen as a pioneer afforestation species in revegetation and has been planted on over 10 million hectares of this area ma et al 2017 the groundwater level in the loess plateau generally varies from 30 to 100 m below land surface jia et al 2017 and water from precipitation is a sole source for water consumption of r pseudoacacia trees according to previous studies rooting depth of r pseudoacacia was generally deeper than 3 5 m wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 while mean annual infiltration depth ranged between 1 and 2 m chen et al 2008 hu et al 2011 it has been widely found that a dry soil layer with low soil moisture content below the infiltration depth was formed after r pseudoacacia trees grew more than eight years jia et al 2019 wang et al 2011 2013 the characteristics of dry soil layer are summarized as 1 locating at a certain soil depth mainly between 2 and 10 m below the soil surface wang et al 2013 2 soil moisture content ranges between permanent wilting point and stable field capacity which is generally considered to be equivalent to 60 of field capacity chen et al 2008 and 3 spatial and temporal persistence and hardly replenished by rainfall infiltration in a regular year dry soil layer has been regarded as a major potential threat to the sustainability of the revegetation project jia et al 2017 shangguan 2007 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 after the formation of dry soil layer soil moisture fluctuates heavily within infiltration depth but remains at a low level at deeper soil layer soil moisture heterogeneity would become more intensive in root zone and further affect spac water transport and other physiological properties shao et al 2016 wei et al 2018 xi et al 2018a therefore characterizing the effect of root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac would be helpful for evaluating and improving the sustainability of r pseudoacacia plantations jia et al 2020 the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the applicability of sperry model in simulating spac water transport under the condition of heterogeneous soil moisture induced by underlying dry soil layer 2 analyze the effect of heterogeneous soil moisture on water transport safety in spac under different environmental conditions using numerical simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 vertical spilt root experiments to evaluate sperry model for simulating spac water transport in r pseudoacacia under the condition of root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity we conducted vertical split root experiments with two soil types in greenhouse the greenhouse was located at northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province 34 27 n 108 07 e this site is characterized as a temperate and semi humid climate mean annual precipitation is 639 8 mm and mean annual temperature is 13 5 c the soils used in this study were two major soil types in loess plateau lou soil anthrosol and huangmian soil calcaric cambisol according to the fao classification system the texture of lou soil and huangmian soil is loamy clay and sandy loam respectively lou soil was collected from yangling and huangmian soil was collected from mizhi then the soils were passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove any large objects and packed into the acrylic columns 90 cm high 23 5 cm in diameter at a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 and 1 30 g cm 3 respectively physical properties of the two soil types were shown in table 1 soil particle sizes were measured using a particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england soil water retention curves were determined using centrifugation method and then they were fitted with the van genuchten model using retc program van genuchten 1992 the soil column was divided into upper and lower compartments 40 cm in depth for each compartment by a 3 4 cm thick quartzite gravel 4 8 mm particle diameter to prevent water capillarity between two compartments fig 1 soil surface was covered with 3 4 cm thick quartzite gravel to minimize water loss zhou et al 2016 a hole was punched in the wall of column at the top of lower compartment and the soil in lower compartment was irrigated by drip irrigation where water is allowed to drip into soils through the holes from pipe after the columns were packed two unbalanced three rod time domain reflectometry tdr probes campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were inserted horizontally into each compartment at 20 cm depth intervals to measure the soil moisture content before the experiments were carried out tdr probes were calibrated using gravimetric method during the period of experiment air circulation between the greenhouse and outside was facilitated by the window at roof and axial flow fan equipped at the side wall of greenhouse the dynamics of air temperature relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit during the experimental period were shown in fig 2 field capacity fc was determined using the modified wilcox method hanks et al 1954 permanent wilting point was determined by growing and wilting r pseudoacacia seedlings in each of the two soils wu et al 2015 in semi arid and arid areas like loess plateau soil moisture within infiltration depth fluctuates heavily due to rainfall events and evapotranspiration while soil moisture at the deeper soil cannot be recharged and stay at low moisture value after the formation of a dry soil layer in r pseudoacacia stands according to the soil moisture profile characteristics under natural conditions we designed a drought rewatered drought treatment at the upper compartment and the lower compartment was withheld water since 60 fc in this study in mid march 2019 20 two year old r pseudoacacia seedlings with similar growing status were transplanted from field to soil columns for seedling cultivation there were 10 plants in each soil type all plants were well watered to maintain 80 100 fc at both the upper and lower compartments for two months to allow natural establishment then 4 plants with similar whole plant leaf area in each soil type were chosen for subsequent experiments this method could decrease the experimental errors resulting from the difference in individual plants these plants were 138 3 5 8 cm in height 12 0 0 5 mm in basal diameter and 6247 7 328 7 cm2 in whole plant leaf area at the start of the experiment before the experiment both the upper and lower compartments were withheld water until the soil moisture content decreased to 60 fc then the upper compartment was irrigated to field capacity and then withheld water to start the first drought when predawn leaf water potential decreased to 2 5 2 mpa the upper compartment was rewatered to field capacity and then the second drought started fig 3 during the experiment soil moisture content at the upper and lower compartment was measured daily with tdr predawn and midday leaf water potentials were measured daily using pressure chamber pms instrument co corvallis or usa at 5 00 6 00 and 13 00 14 00 respectively the length ll cm and width lw cm of newly produced leaves were measured daily and incremental leaf area la cm2 was calculated with an empirical equation developed by zhang et al 2019 detached leaves for measuring leaf water potential and deciduous leaves were also collected scanned with a digital scanner canon lide 120 canon inc tokyo japan and leaf area was measured using an image processing program imagej http rsbweb nih gov ij index html at the end of the experiment all leaves were harvested and scanned and whole plant leaf area was measured using imagej therefore the dynamics of whole plant leaf area during the period of the experiment could be calculated based on final leaf area daily incremental and losing leaf area during the experiment sap flow was measured using flow32 1 k system dynamax inc houston texas usa gauge output was monitored every 60 s and recorded as 15 min averages with a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa leaf transpiration rate was calculated by dividing sap flow by whole plant leaf area after the experiment current year shoots were collected and xylem vulnerability curve was measured using the bench top dehydration method sperry et al 1988 wang et al 2014 and further fitted with weibull function 1 p l c 1 e ψ x y l e m b c where plc is the percentage loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity ψ xylem is xylem water potential and b and c are fitted parameters roots were separated from soil by flushing through a fine mesh bag 60 mesh fine roots diameter 2 mm were dried at 65 c to constant mass and fine root biomass at upper and lower compartment was then determined fig s1 2 2 sperry model the sperry model is a trait based soil plant atmosphere model sperry et al 2016 which solves water flux water potential and hydraulic conductance in spac at a given soil water potential profile and vapor pressure deficit complete details in sperry model can be found in previous literatures sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2016 and a brief summary of relevant equations is provided here the spac system is divided into leaf stem root and rhizosphere components in series the steady state flow rate through each component e i can be calculated by the integral transform of the component s vulnerability curve k ψ i 2 e i ψ down ψ up k ψ i d ψ where k ψ i quantifies the decline of hydraulic conductance k with decreasing water potential ψ for each component k decreases with decreasing ψ due to cavitation for xylem components which can be quantified using a two parameter weibull function b and c 3 k i k x max e ψ x b c where k x max is the maximum hydraulic conductance and ψ x is water potential of xylem components including leaf stem and root in rhizosphere components the decrease of k with decreasing ψ is caused by the displacement of water filled pore space by air as capillary forces fail which can be described using a van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 4 k i k s max v n 1 2 n 1 v n 1 n 1 2 5 v α ψ soil n 1 1 where k s max is the maximum hydraulic conductance of rhizosphere components and n and α are texture specific parameters the e ψ leaf supply function is calculated by solving leaf water potential ψ leaf as transpiration rate e increases from zero for the entire continuum increasing e is associated with decreases in ψ leaf and soil plant hydraulic conductance k p mathematically e reaches a maximum e crit as k p approached zero and ψ leaf decreased to the corresponding minimum value ψ crit which results in hydraulic failure in spac and thus plant cannot transport water sperry et al 1998 sperry and love 2015 as supposed by the supply demand theory canopy water demand is regulated in proportion to threat to supply posed by xylem cavitation and soil drying stomata are assumed to regulate the pressure drop between soil and leaf water potential ψ based on the fractional drop in soil plant hydraulic conductance from its maximum 6 δ ψ δ ψ d e d ψ leaf d e d ψ max where δ ψ is the unregulated pressure drop that is derived from supply function with unregulated transpiration rate e vpd g max where g max is maximum diffusive conductance therefore the regulated transpiration rate is given by ψ based on supply function root zone can be divided into multiple layers and each layer includes root and rhizosphere components maximum conductance values of root and rhizosphere were determined based on the proportions of root and rhizosphere resistances in the soil root system and they were partitioned into each layer according to fine root distribution the actual conductance of root and rhizosphere in each layer can be calculated based on the vulnerability curves root water uptake rate in each layer can be solved using the multidimensional newton raphson method sperry et al 2016 in the vertical spilt root experiment the distribution of fine root biomass was nearly homogeneous in the soil column fig s1 we divided the root and rhizosphere components into 2 compartments with equal roots in the modeling study the depth of each layer was set to be 40 cm as per the vertical spilt root experiment the parameters of vc were assumed to be the same for leaf stem and root maximum soil plant hydraulic conductance k max g max and average percentage of rhizosphere resistance in whole soil plant hydraulic resistance p rhiz are difficult to measure directly and are optimized by fitting the model to observed data sperry et al 2016 tai et al 2018 as suggested by sperry et al 2016 we estimated the parameters with the downhill simplex algorithm based on measured midday leaf transpiration rate e md and midday leaf water potential ψ md in the experiments each value was studentized by subtracting the respective measurement mean and dividing by the standard deviation to equalize weighting across e md and ψ md the absolute error averaged across the studentized e md and ψ md was minimized by adjusting k max g max and p rhiz with the downhill simplex algorithm to ensure global minimums to be obtained nelder and mead 1965 sperry et al 2016 according to the sensitivity analysis conducted by sperry et al 2016 the outputted e md is sensitivity to k max and g max while ψ md is sensitivity to k max g max and p rhiz major parameters and values used in this study are summarized in table 2 the hydraulic conductance was expressed per leaf area in this study to eliminate the difference of whole plant leaf area among individual plants sperry et al 1998 2 3 indicators of water transport safety and their responses to soil moisture heterogeneity e e crit hydraulic safety margin hsm and the percentage loss of soil plant hydraulic conductance plk were used as indicators to describe water transport safety in spac sperry et al 1998 sperry and love 2015 tai et al 2017 2018 hsm is defined as the difference between e crit and e sperry et al 1998 e crit was determined via an iteration algorithm as k p approached zero k max 2000 as defined in the model which enabled the estimated error of e crit less than 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 sperry et al 1998 2016 plk was calculated by 7 plk 1 k p k max obviously water transport safety in spac would be worse with increasing e and plk and decreasing e crit and hsm the indicators including e crit hsm and plk are difficult to measure directly which are only estimated by plant hydraulic model choat et al 2018 sperry et al 2016 therefore we focused on the model analysis in this study to quantify the response of water transport safety in spac to root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity we set a series of soil moisture contents at the upper and lower compartments in sperry model and examined the changes of e e crit hsm and plk with different soil water combinations at upper and lower compartments soil types were loamy clay and sandy loam the simulated soil moisture contents in upper and lower compartments were in the range of permanent wilting point and field capacity table 1 which is 0 15 0 28 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and 0 06 0 22 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam at the interval of 0 01 cm3 cm 3 respectively we also set different vpd to assess the effect of atmospheric factors on the response of water transport safety in spac to soil moisture heterogeneity three levels of vpd were set as 1 5 kpa low 3 0 kpa middle and 4 5 kpa high reflecting different atmospheric evaporate demand 2 4 statistical analysis the performance of sperry model was evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse rmse was calculated using the following equation 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 where o i and pi are observed and predicted values respectively in loam clay and sandy loam rmse and r 2 of each parameter were calculated based on 19 and 30 pairs of observed and predicted values respectively in numerical simulations we plotted the variation in e e crit hsm and plk with changing soil moisture content in upper layer smcup under different soil moisture content in lower layer smcdown we mainly focused on the minimum maximum and threshold values of different curves we fitted each curve with the logistic function 9 y c 1 c 2 1 exp smc up c 3 c 4 where y is the regressed indicator c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 are fitted parameters based on the regressed equations we calculated the threshold value of smcup for each indicator using the method of yan et al 2017 the threshold is defined as the corresponding smcup when the change of regressed indicator is greater than 5 of the difference between the maximum and minimum value as smcup decreases from field capacity 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the temporal variations in soil moisture content at upper and lower compartments are shown in fig 3 the experiment lasted for 19 d and 30 d in loamy clay and sandy loam soil respectively during the first drought smcup decreased quickly from field capacity before rewetting and smcdown exhibited a slow decrease from 60 fc at the same time the smcup and smcdown reached similar values before rewetting which was 0 154 cm3 cm 3 and 0 066 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and sandy loam respectively in both soil types smcup recovered to field capacity after rewetting and then decreased with time while smcdown remained relatively stable during the second drought the sperry model could well simulate the temporal variation in predawn leaf water potential ψ pd midday leaf water potential ψ md and midday leaf transpiration rate e md during the experimental period fig 4 during the first and second drought periods ψ pd varied between 0 3 0 2 mpa in the early period and then decreased quickly fig 4b e in loam clay the rmse and r 2 between observed and simulated e md were 0 388 mmol m 2 s 1 and 0 939 respectively the rmse and r 2 were 0 223 mpa and 0 915 for ψ pd 0 352 mpa and 0 892 for ψ md respectively there was larger variation between the simulated and observed values in sandy loam the prediction in sandy loam was slightly worse than that of the loamy clay the rmse and r 2 were 0 461 mmol m 2 s 1 and 0 702 for e md 0 325 mpa and 0 880 for ψ pd 0 373 mpa and 0 832 for ψ md respectively 3 2 responses of water transport safety to soil moisture heterogeneity under natural conditions the soil moisture content generally changed rapidly in shallow soil and was relatively stable in the deeper soil layer so the responses of the four indicators to different combinations of smcup and smcdown were simulated using the calibrated sperry model and the effects of vpd and soil textures on the indicators were analyzed with the same smcdown values there was little changes in e e crit and sme when smcup was higher than the thresholds then they decreased rapidly with decreasing smcup presenting as s shape curves figs 5 7 on the contrary plk exhibited a rapid increase when smcup was lower than the thresholds fig 8 all indicators had similar patterns in loamy clay and sandy loam soils as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum and minimum values of the curves were in the similar ranges for different soil types compared with loamy clay the threshold was lower and the indicators changed faster in sandy loam when smcup decreased below the threshold the combinations of soil moisture in upper and lower layers contained a series of homogeneous conditions from wet to dry for the simulations of e e crit and hsm the maximum soil moisture value was under the condition of homogeneous field capacity in root zone the minimum soil moisture value was under the condition of homogeneous permanent wilting point in root zone in each soil type with different atmosphere evaporative demands plk presented opposite trend 3 2 1 change of the e smcup curve with smcdown the e smcup curve showed a descending trend with decreasing smcdown fig 5 and the change of the e smcup curve with smcdown exhibited different patterns under different vpd under low vpd the threshold was similar among different curves ranged between 0 193 and 0 202 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and 0 085 0 087 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum value slightly differed among different curves 1 5 1 6 mmol m 2 s 1 while e dropped faster when smcup decreased below the threshold and the minimum value dropped from 1 01 to 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types under middle vpd the threshold increased from 0 209 to 0 227 mmol m 2 s 1 for loamy clay and from 0 101 to 0 116 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum value decreased from 2 99 to 2 22 mmol m 2 s 1 e decreased in similar rates when smcup decreased below the threshold and the minimum value decreased from 1 01 to 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 with decreasing smcdown under high vpd the threshold differed little among different curves it ranged between 0 221 and 0 229 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and 0 115 0 120 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam respectively the maximum value decreased from 3 26 to 2 22 mmol m 2 s 1 and the minimum value decreased from 1 00 to 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 with decreasing smcdown in the two soil types 3 2 2 change of the e crit smcup curve with smcdown the e crit smcup curve decreased with decreasing smcdown in both soils and was not affected by vpd fig 6 the threshold changed little and e crit decreased in a similar rate when smcup decreased below threshold among different curves as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the threshold of e crit smcup curve ranged between 0 223 and 0 227 cm3 cm 3 and 0 108 0 116 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and sandy loam respectively the maximum value decreased from 5 31 to 3 91 mmol m 2 s 1 and the minimum value decreased from 2 09 to 0 03 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types when smcdown decreasing from field capacity to permanent wilting point 3 2 3 change of the hsm smcup curve with smcdown as affected by e and e crit the hsm smcup curve dropped with decreasing smcdown in both soil types and the patterns were impacted by vpd fig 7 under low vpd the threshold was similar among different curves it ranged between 0 229 and 0 236 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and 0 118 0 125 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum value decreased from 3 43 to 2 39 mmol m 2 s 1 and the minimum value decreased from 0 91 to 0 02 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types under middle vpd the threshold of the hsm smcup curve decreased substantially from 0 243 to 0 216 cm3 cm 3 with decreasing smcdown for loamy clay and from 0 140 to 0 098 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam the maximum values of the hsm smcup curves decreased from 2 32 to 1 73 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types as the smcdown decreased these values were lower compared to those under low vpd meanwhile hsm dropped at higher rates when smcup decreased below the threshold under lower smcdown causing the minimum value decreased from 1 08 to 0 02 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types under high vpd the threshold fluctuated around 0 212 0 226 cm3 cm 3 in loamy clay and 0 098 0 110 cm3 cm 3 in sandy loam when smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum value of the curve decreased from 2 05 to 1 73 mmol m 2 s 1 hsm dropped faster when smcup decreased below the threshold and the minimum value decreased from 1 08 to 0 02 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types 3 2 4 change of the plk smcup curve with smcdown the plk smcup curve rose with decreasing smcdown in both soil types fig 8 without difference under different vpd the threshold was similar under different smcdown with range between 0 201 and 0 202 cm3 cm 3 in loamy clay and 0 061 0 065 cm3 cm 3 in sandy loam as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the minimum value varied slightly 0 8 plk increased faster when smcup dropped below the threshold and the maximum value increased from 32 to 96 in the two soil types 4 discussion plant water use characteristics at different soil depths are drawing the attention of researchers around the world with the increasing long term observations of soil moisture in deep soil profiles and the development of isotopic tracing method adams et al 2019 evaristo et al 2015 rossatto et al 2012 xi et al 2018a yang et al 2015 2017 on this basis the functional differences in shallow and deep soil water for plants are becoming more evident ryel et al 2008 yang et al 2017 characterizing plant response to root zone soil moisture heterogeneity is essential for better understanding soil water availability to plants puértolas et al 2020 with the help of mechanistically based models researchers are able to separate the influence of soil plant and atmospheric factors on plants and quantitatively assess these factors comprehensive effect which are difficult to analyze with experiments huber et al 2015 jackson et al 2000 novak et al 2005 sperry model explicitly simulates water transport through spac using the physics of flow through soil and xylem efficiently defines the response of plant water use to soil and atmospheric drought and calculates a series of unmeasurable hydraulic traits that reflects water transport safety sperry et al 2016 tai et al 2018 in this study we calibrated sperry model with the vertical spilt root experiments and verified the predictive accuracy of sperry model for simulating spac water transport we further analyzed the effect of root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac under different soil and atmospheric conditions these quantitative findings are helpful for understanding the functional difference in soil water at different depths and optimizing water management in plantation forest and other ecosystems hsm and plk are important indicators that reflect water transport safety in spac sperry et al 1998 sperry and love 2015 tai et al 2017 2018 both of which were strongly affected by the soil moisture content in the upper and lower compartments in root zone according to the numerical analysis hsm decreased rapidly as smcup decreased below the threshold fig 7 while plk exhibited the opposite trend fig 8 indicating that water transport safety was significantly reduced when smcup was lower than the threshold the hsm smcup curves descended and plk smcup curves elevated gradually with decreasing smcdown notably plk increased faster and the smcup had a greater impact on hsm under lower smcdown suggesting that water transport safety would be more sensitive to the variation in shallow soil water with decreasing soil water in deep soil this finding supported the concept proposed by ryel et al 2008 the results also have important implications for deep soil water management for improving water transport safety in spac in plantation forests and other ecosystems for instance in shallow water table areas the seasonal variation in water table depth can substantially influence the dependence of spac water transport safety on the shallow soil water rossatto et al 2012 tai et al 2018 in areas with deep water table such as loess plateau spac water transport can be limited frequently due to the fluctuation in shallow soil water with serious soil desiccation below the infiltration depth furthermore the growth decline and forest dying back induced by hydraulic dysfunction can happen easily which has been observed in r pseudoacacia plantations in loess plateau in the previous studies wang et al 2008 wei et al 2018 in this case the mitigation approaches include 1 reducing soil water consumption in both shallow and deep layers through pruning thinning and other methods ma et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and 2 enhancing water storage in deep soil by methods such as rain collection and infiltration system song et al 2017 etc in addition subsurface drip irrigation can be adopted for improving soil moisture content in deep soil in some irrigated plantations like orchards nurseries etc the response of water transport safety in spac to smcup and smcdown was also affected by soil texture and atmospheric evaporative demand compared with in loamy clay hsm and plk were more sensitive to the variation in soil moisture content in sandy loam since soil water potential and hydraulic conductivity decreased faster with decreasing soil moisture content in coarser textured soils van genuchten 1980 in loess plateau soil texture is coarser and climate is drier in the northern and western areas wang et al 2010 therefore water transport safety in spac would be more easily impacted by soil moisture fluctuation in upper and lower layers in r pseudoacacia plantations additionally the hsm smcup curves were strongly affected by vpd the hsm is defined as the difference between e crit and actual e in which e crit is determined mainly by soil water condition sperry and love 2015 whereas e varied strongly with vpd fig 5 transpiration response to soil water availability has been widely examined using experiments and modeling studies the result showed that e remained stable at first and then decreased rapidly with decreasing soil moisture content wu et al 2011b yan et al 2017 the relationship between e and soil moisture content or soil water potential can be quantified with a linear plateau or s shaped function and it is influenced by soil plant and atmospheric factors wu et al 2015 in this study the variation in e with smcup exhibited similar patterns fig 5 additionally there was an interaction between smcup and smcdown in influencing e since the e smcup curves gradually descended with decreasing smcdown under higher vpd the maximum value of e smcup curve was higher while e decreased substantially at higher smcup threshold indicating that e was more sensitive to the variation in soil moisture content in upper and lower compartments with decreasing smcdown hsm decreased in a similar speed under low vpd while hsm decreased faster under middle and high vpd when smcup decreased below the threshold this result suggested that the decrease in smcdown has a greater impact on water transport safety in spac under middle and high vpd meanwhile the threshold of e crit smcup and e smcup curves were lower in coarser textured soils thus hsm smcup curves have lower threshold and hsm decreased faster when smcup decreased below the threshold fig 7 on the other hand the numerical simulations showed that the response of plk to soil moisture content was not affected by vpd this finding was mainly attributed to the assumption in sperry model that stomatal aperture is regulated based on plk eq 2 the assumption should be examined with more studies especially for the species with complex interactions between hydraulic and chemical signals in regulating stomatal behavior huber et al 2015 torres ruiz et al 2015 5 conclusion sperry model could efficiently simulate spac water transport in r pseudoacacia under the condition of soil moisture heterogeneity presenting as an important tool for analyzing the effect of root zone soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac the numerical simulations indicated that water transport safety in spac became more sensitive to soil moisture in upper root zone with decreasing soil moisture in the lower root zone and strongly affected by the soil type and atmospheric evaporative demand the results highlighted the importance of deep soil water management for water transport safety in spac and encouraged further studies sperry model can be further adopted to analyze the effect of eco physiological properties of roots such as the hydraulic redistribution on the function of soil water at different depths besides sperry model could be integrated with other eco physiological processes including carbon assimilation plant growth leaf shedding etc to analyze more physiological functions in response to root zone soil moisture heterogeneity more control experiments especially the comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous soil moisture treatments in both short and long term experiments should be conducted in further

10233,soil moisture in root zone is highly heterogeneous in space while its effect on water transport safety in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac remains poorly understood in this study we conducted vertical spilt root experiments in r pseudoacacia using loamy clay and sandy loam soils in greenhouse and measured the dynamics of midday transpiration rate predawn and midday leaf water potential with the lower root zone remaining drought and the upper root zone undergoing the drought rewatered drought process the plant supply demand hydraulic model was calibrated with the measured data indicating that the model could efficiently simulate spac water transport in r pseudoacacia under the condition of vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on this basis we set various combinations of soil moisture in the upper and lower root zones under different soil types and atmospheric evaporative demands in the model and simulated the variations of indicators describing water transport safety in spac including actual transpiration rate e the critical leaf transpiration rate at hydraulic failure e crit hydraulic safety margin hsm and percentage loss of soil plant hydraulic conductance plk the numerical simulations suggested that the water transport safety in spac varied substantially with vertical soil moisture heterogeneity and the responses were impacted by soil types and atmospheric evaporative demand with decreasing soil moisture in the upper root zone smcup e crit e and hsm remained steady at first and then decreased rapidly when smcup below a threshold while plk exhibited an opposite trend with decreasing soil moisture in the lower root zone smcdown the curves of e crit e and hsm presented a descending trend while the curve of plk went up water transport safety in spac declined with decreasing swcup and swcdown and became more sensitive to swcup with a lower swcdown swcdown had greater impact on water transport safety in spac under coarser textured soil with higher atmospheric evaporative demand the results were supplemental to the traditional analysis of soil water availability to plants under homogeneous condition and would be helpful for analyzing functional difference of water storage in different soil depths as well as for optimizing water resource management keywords soil moisture heterogeneity water transport safety soil plant atmosphere continuum plant hydraulic model 1 introduction the distribution of soil moisture in root zone varies strongly in time and space jia et al 2016 ryel et al 2008 xi et al 2013 which results in a marked impact on water transport in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac and other physiological metabolisms including nutrient uptake photosynthetic assimilation etc reich et al 2018 sperry and love 2015 yang et al 2017 in arid and semi arid area rooting depths of shrubs and trees usually exceed infiltration depth for precipitation fan et al 2017 schenk 2005 soil moisture in shallow root zone fluctuates rapidly and extremely due to infiltration soil evaporation and root water uptake however soil moisture in deeper root zone changes relatively more slowly with fewer roots and recharge events resulting in a pronounced vertical soil moisture heterogeneity in root zone fan et al 2017 xi et al 2018a in agricultural ecosystems some irrigation techniques including drip irrigation vertical partial root zone drying method etc could also induce vertical soil moisture heterogeneity in root zone for regulating plant water use and enhancing water use efficiency ma et al 2013 shu et al 2020 xi et al 2016 although plant response to soil water availability has been studied for decades most of the studies were under homogeneous soil moisture conditions wu et al 2011c yan et al 2017 effect of root zone soil moisture heterogeneity on plant eco physiological functions is still poorly understood despite its potential importance fan et al 2017 puértolas et al 2020 xi et al 2018b recently the response of plant water use to soil moisture heterogeneity has been studied with control experiments puértolas et al 2020 field observations gaines et al 2016 isotopic tracing method yang et al 2015 and numerical modeling xi et al 2016 accordingly plants can respond to soil moisture heterogeneity rapidly through hydraulic signals including leaf water potential hydraulic conductance etc and chemical signals including abscisic acid peptide etc huber et al 2015 reich et al 2018 takahashi et al 2018 huber et al 2015 proposed a mechanistic soil root water flow model r swms and examined the roles of hydraulic and chemical signals in regulating leaf water potential and transpiration under horizontal and vertical soil moisture heterogeneity in root zone their results supported that isohydric plant behavior originates from the combined control of hydraulic and chemical signals whereas anisohydric behavior emerges mainly from the control of chemical signals recent reports suggested that roots of some species can move water from moist to dry soil through hydraulic redistribution neumann and cardon 2012 prieto et al 2012 which can increase dry season transpiration and photosynthetic rates domec et al 2010 prolong the life span of fine roots bauerle et al 2008 and maintain root soil contact in dry soils caldwell et al 1998 domec et al 2004 hydraulic redistribution helps plants present as an efficient adaptability to heterogeneous soil moisture based on the physiological mechanism and experimental findings ryel et al 2008 proposed a conceptual model indicating that a growth pool is located in shallow soil layer and a maintenance pool is in deeper soil layer yang et al 2017 also found that deeper soil water contributes to drought avoidance and shallower soil water determines the growing rate of trees based on long term field observations according to the cohesion tension theory transpiration stream is pulled through porous media in soil and xylem conduits of plant as soil and atmosphere drought progressed more negative pressures increase flow resistance by causing cavitation in xylem conduits and draining of soil pores in rhizosphere thus endanger water transport safety in spac sperry and love 2015 water transport safety in spac plays a critical role in determining plant growth and survival during drought stress choat et al 2018 wolfe et al 2016 hence analyzing the response of water transport safety in spac to vertical soil moisture heterogeneity is essential in understanding plant water relationships and helps to optimize water resources management based on previous studies under homogeneous soil moisture conditions wu et al 2011a 2015 the responses of plant water uptake and loss in spac to soil water availability were affected by multiple factors including soil texture plant species atmospheric evaporative demand etc researchers have developed various mathematical models to examine the effect of these factors on the responses of plants to soil water availability huber et al 2015 novak et al 2005 in traditional spac models response of root water uptake and canopy transpiration to soil and atmospheric drought was generally described with prescribed empirical stress functions in numerous mathematical forms based on experiments damour et al 2010 feddes et al 1978 gharsallah et al 2013 the coupling between water uptake and loss in spac is loose and there is a lack of mechanisms for simulating spac water transport tai et al 2018 with the development of plant hydraulics more mechanistic based models were developed for coupling root water uptake and canopy loss in a more direct way huber et al 2015 sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2003 based on the similarity in soil and xylem water transport in physics sperry et al 1998 developed a resistance network model to describe water transport in soil plant system mechanistically sperry and love 2015 further developed the supply demand theory and upgraded soil plant model for simulating spac water transport by including the stomatal control of transpiration and leaf water potential abbreviated as sperry model based on soil water potential profile vapor pressure deficit vpd and hydraulic properties of soil and xylem sperry model could directly solve water flux canopy conductance and the distribution of water potential and hydraulic conductance in spac sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2016 thus this model serves as an efficient tool for analyzing the effect of vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac robinia pseudoacacia l black locust has been widely planted around the world it plays an essential role in improving environmental quality and reducing soil erosion li et al 2018 in loess plateau r pseudoacacia was commonly chosen as a pioneer afforestation species in revegetation and has been planted on over 10 million hectares of this area ma et al 2017 the groundwater level in the loess plateau generally varies from 30 to 100 m below land surface jia et al 2017 and water from precipitation is a sole source for water consumption of r pseudoacacia trees according to previous studies rooting depth of r pseudoacacia was generally deeper than 3 5 m wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 while mean annual infiltration depth ranged between 1 and 2 m chen et al 2008 hu et al 2011 it has been widely found that a dry soil layer with low soil moisture content below the infiltration depth was formed after r pseudoacacia trees grew more than eight years jia et al 2019 wang et al 2011 2013 the characteristics of dry soil layer are summarized as 1 locating at a certain soil depth mainly between 2 and 10 m below the soil surface wang et al 2013 2 soil moisture content ranges between permanent wilting point and stable field capacity which is generally considered to be equivalent to 60 of field capacity chen et al 2008 and 3 spatial and temporal persistence and hardly replenished by rainfall infiltration in a regular year dry soil layer has been regarded as a major potential threat to the sustainability of the revegetation project jia et al 2017 shangguan 2007 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 after the formation of dry soil layer soil moisture fluctuates heavily within infiltration depth but remains at a low level at deeper soil layer soil moisture heterogeneity would become more intensive in root zone and further affect spac water transport and other physiological properties shao et al 2016 wei et al 2018 xi et al 2018a therefore characterizing the effect of root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac would be helpful for evaluating and improving the sustainability of r pseudoacacia plantations jia et al 2020 the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the applicability of sperry model in simulating spac water transport under the condition of heterogeneous soil moisture induced by underlying dry soil layer 2 analyze the effect of heterogeneous soil moisture on water transport safety in spac under different environmental conditions using numerical simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 vertical spilt root experiments to evaluate sperry model for simulating spac water transport in r pseudoacacia under the condition of root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity we conducted vertical split root experiments with two soil types in greenhouse the greenhouse was located at northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province 34 27 n 108 07 e this site is characterized as a temperate and semi humid climate mean annual precipitation is 639 8 mm and mean annual temperature is 13 5 c the soils used in this study were two major soil types in loess plateau lou soil anthrosol and huangmian soil calcaric cambisol according to the fao classification system the texture of lou soil and huangmian soil is loamy clay and sandy loam respectively lou soil was collected from yangling and huangmian soil was collected from mizhi then the soils were passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove any large objects and packed into the acrylic columns 90 cm high 23 5 cm in diameter at a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 and 1 30 g cm 3 respectively physical properties of the two soil types were shown in table 1 soil particle sizes were measured using a particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england soil water retention curves were determined using centrifugation method and then they were fitted with the van genuchten model using retc program van genuchten 1992 the soil column was divided into upper and lower compartments 40 cm in depth for each compartment by a 3 4 cm thick quartzite gravel 4 8 mm particle diameter to prevent water capillarity between two compartments fig 1 soil surface was covered with 3 4 cm thick quartzite gravel to minimize water loss zhou et al 2016 a hole was punched in the wall of column at the top of lower compartment and the soil in lower compartment was irrigated by drip irrigation where water is allowed to drip into soils through the holes from pipe after the columns were packed two unbalanced three rod time domain reflectometry tdr probes campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were inserted horizontally into each compartment at 20 cm depth intervals to measure the soil moisture content before the experiments were carried out tdr probes were calibrated using gravimetric method during the period of experiment air circulation between the greenhouse and outside was facilitated by the window at roof and axial flow fan equipped at the side wall of greenhouse the dynamics of air temperature relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit during the experimental period were shown in fig 2 field capacity fc was determined using the modified wilcox method hanks et al 1954 permanent wilting point was determined by growing and wilting r pseudoacacia seedlings in each of the two soils wu et al 2015 in semi arid and arid areas like loess plateau soil moisture within infiltration depth fluctuates heavily due to rainfall events and evapotranspiration while soil moisture at the deeper soil cannot be recharged and stay at low moisture value after the formation of a dry soil layer in r pseudoacacia stands according to the soil moisture profile characteristics under natural conditions we designed a drought rewatered drought treatment at the upper compartment and the lower compartment was withheld water since 60 fc in this study in mid march 2019 20 two year old r pseudoacacia seedlings with similar growing status were transplanted from field to soil columns for seedling cultivation there were 10 plants in each soil type all plants were well watered to maintain 80 100 fc at both the upper and lower compartments for two months to allow natural establishment then 4 plants with similar whole plant leaf area in each soil type were chosen for subsequent experiments this method could decrease the experimental errors resulting from the difference in individual plants these plants were 138 3 5 8 cm in height 12 0 0 5 mm in basal diameter and 6247 7 328 7 cm2 in whole plant leaf area at the start of the experiment before the experiment both the upper and lower compartments were withheld water until the soil moisture content decreased to 60 fc then the upper compartment was irrigated to field capacity and then withheld water to start the first drought when predawn leaf water potential decreased to 2 5 2 mpa the upper compartment was rewatered to field capacity and then the second drought started fig 3 during the experiment soil moisture content at the upper and lower compartment was measured daily with tdr predawn and midday leaf water potentials were measured daily using pressure chamber pms instrument co corvallis or usa at 5 00 6 00 and 13 00 14 00 respectively the length ll cm and width lw cm of newly produced leaves were measured daily and incremental leaf area la cm2 was calculated with an empirical equation developed by zhang et al 2019 detached leaves for measuring leaf water potential and deciduous leaves were also collected scanned with a digital scanner canon lide 120 canon inc tokyo japan and leaf area was measured using an image processing program imagej http rsbweb nih gov ij index html at the end of the experiment all leaves were harvested and scanned and whole plant leaf area was measured using imagej therefore the dynamics of whole plant leaf area during the period of the experiment could be calculated based on final leaf area daily incremental and losing leaf area during the experiment sap flow was measured using flow32 1 k system dynamax inc houston texas usa gauge output was monitored every 60 s and recorded as 15 min averages with a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa leaf transpiration rate was calculated by dividing sap flow by whole plant leaf area after the experiment current year shoots were collected and xylem vulnerability curve was measured using the bench top dehydration method sperry et al 1988 wang et al 2014 and further fitted with weibull function 1 p l c 1 e ψ x y l e m b c where plc is the percentage loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity ψ xylem is xylem water potential and b and c are fitted parameters roots were separated from soil by flushing through a fine mesh bag 60 mesh fine roots diameter 2 mm were dried at 65 c to constant mass and fine root biomass at upper and lower compartment was then determined fig s1 2 2 sperry model the sperry model is a trait based soil plant atmosphere model sperry et al 2016 which solves water flux water potential and hydraulic conductance in spac at a given soil water potential profile and vapor pressure deficit complete details in sperry model can be found in previous literatures sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2016 and a brief summary of relevant equations is provided here the spac system is divided into leaf stem root and rhizosphere components in series the steady state flow rate through each component e i can be calculated by the integral transform of the component s vulnerability curve k ψ i 2 e i ψ down ψ up k ψ i d ψ where k ψ i quantifies the decline of hydraulic conductance k with decreasing water potential ψ for each component k decreases with decreasing ψ due to cavitation for xylem components which can be quantified using a two parameter weibull function b and c 3 k i k x max e ψ x b c where k x max is the maximum hydraulic conductance and ψ x is water potential of xylem components including leaf stem and root in rhizosphere components the decrease of k with decreasing ψ is caused by the displacement of water filled pore space by air as capillary forces fail which can be described using a van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 4 k i k s max v n 1 2 n 1 v n 1 n 1 2 5 v α ψ soil n 1 1 where k s max is the maximum hydraulic conductance of rhizosphere components and n and α are texture specific parameters the e ψ leaf supply function is calculated by solving leaf water potential ψ leaf as transpiration rate e increases from zero for the entire continuum increasing e is associated with decreases in ψ leaf and soil plant hydraulic conductance k p mathematically e reaches a maximum e crit as k p approached zero and ψ leaf decreased to the corresponding minimum value ψ crit which results in hydraulic failure in spac and thus plant cannot transport water sperry et al 1998 sperry and love 2015 as supposed by the supply demand theory canopy water demand is regulated in proportion to threat to supply posed by xylem cavitation and soil drying stomata are assumed to regulate the pressure drop between soil and leaf water potential ψ based on the fractional drop in soil plant hydraulic conductance from its maximum 6 δ ψ δ ψ d e d ψ leaf d e d ψ max where δ ψ is the unregulated pressure drop that is derived from supply function with unregulated transpiration rate e vpd g max where g max is maximum diffusive conductance therefore the regulated transpiration rate is given by ψ based on supply function root zone can be divided into multiple layers and each layer includes root and rhizosphere components maximum conductance values of root and rhizosphere were determined based on the proportions of root and rhizosphere resistances in the soil root system and they were partitioned into each layer according to fine root distribution the actual conductance of root and rhizosphere in each layer can be calculated based on the vulnerability curves root water uptake rate in each layer can be solved using the multidimensional newton raphson method sperry et al 2016 in the vertical spilt root experiment the distribution of fine root biomass was nearly homogeneous in the soil column fig s1 we divided the root and rhizosphere components into 2 compartments with equal roots in the modeling study the depth of each layer was set to be 40 cm as per the vertical spilt root experiment the parameters of vc were assumed to be the same for leaf stem and root maximum soil plant hydraulic conductance k max g max and average percentage of rhizosphere resistance in whole soil plant hydraulic resistance p rhiz are difficult to measure directly and are optimized by fitting the model to observed data sperry et al 2016 tai et al 2018 as suggested by sperry et al 2016 we estimated the parameters with the downhill simplex algorithm based on measured midday leaf transpiration rate e md and midday leaf water potential ψ md in the experiments each value was studentized by subtracting the respective measurement mean and dividing by the standard deviation to equalize weighting across e md and ψ md the absolute error averaged across the studentized e md and ψ md was minimized by adjusting k max g max and p rhiz with the downhill simplex algorithm to ensure global minimums to be obtained nelder and mead 1965 sperry et al 2016 according to the sensitivity analysis conducted by sperry et al 2016 the outputted e md is sensitivity to k max and g max while ψ md is sensitivity to k max g max and p rhiz major parameters and values used in this study are summarized in table 2 the hydraulic conductance was expressed per leaf area in this study to eliminate the difference of whole plant leaf area among individual plants sperry et al 1998 2 3 indicators of water transport safety and their responses to soil moisture heterogeneity e e crit hydraulic safety margin hsm and the percentage loss of soil plant hydraulic conductance plk were used as indicators to describe water transport safety in spac sperry et al 1998 sperry and love 2015 tai et al 2017 2018 hsm is defined as the difference between e crit and e sperry et al 1998 e crit was determined via an iteration algorithm as k p approached zero k max 2000 as defined in the model which enabled the estimated error of e crit less than 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 sperry et al 1998 2016 plk was calculated by 7 plk 1 k p k max obviously water transport safety in spac would be worse with increasing e and plk and decreasing e crit and hsm the indicators including e crit hsm and plk are difficult to measure directly which are only estimated by plant hydraulic model choat et al 2018 sperry et al 2016 therefore we focused on the model analysis in this study to quantify the response of water transport safety in spac to root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity we set a series of soil moisture contents at the upper and lower compartments in sperry model and examined the changes of e e crit hsm and plk with different soil water combinations at upper and lower compartments soil types were loamy clay and sandy loam the simulated soil moisture contents in upper and lower compartments were in the range of permanent wilting point and field capacity table 1 which is 0 15 0 28 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and 0 06 0 22 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam at the interval of 0 01 cm3 cm 3 respectively we also set different vpd to assess the effect of atmospheric factors on the response of water transport safety in spac to soil moisture heterogeneity three levels of vpd were set as 1 5 kpa low 3 0 kpa middle and 4 5 kpa high reflecting different atmospheric evaporate demand 2 4 statistical analysis the performance of sperry model was evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse rmse was calculated using the following equation 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 where o i and pi are observed and predicted values respectively in loam clay and sandy loam rmse and r 2 of each parameter were calculated based on 19 and 30 pairs of observed and predicted values respectively in numerical simulations we plotted the variation in e e crit hsm and plk with changing soil moisture content in upper layer smcup under different soil moisture content in lower layer smcdown we mainly focused on the minimum maximum and threshold values of different curves we fitted each curve with the logistic function 9 y c 1 c 2 1 exp smc up c 3 c 4 where y is the regressed indicator c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 are fitted parameters based on the regressed equations we calculated the threshold value of smcup for each indicator using the method of yan et al 2017 the threshold is defined as the corresponding smcup when the change of regressed indicator is greater than 5 of the difference between the maximum and minimum value as smcup decreases from field capacity 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the temporal variations in soil moisture content at upper and lower compartments are shown in fig 3 the experiment lasted for 19 d and 30 d in loamy clay and sandy loam soil respectively during the first drought smcup decreased quickly from field capacity before rewetting and smcdown exhibited a slow decrease from 60 fc at the same time the smcup and smcdown reached similar values before rewetting which was 0 154 cm3 cm 3 and 0 066 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and sandy loam respectively in both soil types smcup recovered to field capacity after rewetting and then decreased with time while smcdown remained relatively stable during the second drought the sperry model could well simulate the temporal variation in predawn leaf water potential ψ pd midday leaf water potential ψ md and midday leaf transpiration rate e md during the experimental period fig 4 during the first and second drought periods ψ pd varied between 0 3 0 2 mpa in the early period and then decreased quickly fig 4b e in loam clay the rmse and r 2 between observed and simulated e md were 0 388 mmol m 2 s 1 and 0 939 respectively the rmse and r 2 were 0 223 mpa and 0 915 for ψ pd 0 352 mpa and 0 892 for ψ md respectively there was larger variation between the simulated and observed values in sandy loam the prediction in sandy loam was slightly worse than that of the loamy clay the rmse and r 2 were 0 461 mmol m 2 s 1 and 0 702 for e md 0 325 mpa and 0 880 for ψ pd 0 373 mpa and 0 832 for ψ md respectively 3 2 responses of water transport safety to soil moisture heterogeneity under natural conditions the soil moisture content generally changed rapidly in shallow soil and was relatively stable in the deeper soil layer so the responses of the four indicators to different combinations of smcup and smcdown were simulated using the calibrated sperry model and the effects of vpd and soil textures on the indicators were analyzed with the same smcdown values there was little changes in e e crit and sme when smcup was higher than the thresholds then they decreased rapidly with decreasing smcup presenting as s shape curves figs 5 7 on the contrary plk exhibited a rapid increase when smcup was lower than the thresholds fig 8 all indicators had similar patterns in loamy clay and sandy loam soils as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum and minimum values of the curves were in the similar ranges for different soil types compared with loamy clay the threshold was lower and the indicators changed faster in sandy loam when smcup decreased below the threshold the combinations of soil moisture in upper and lower layers contained a series of homogeneous conditions from wet to dry for the simulations of e e crit and hsm the maximum soil moisture value was under the condition of homogeneous field capacity in root zone the minimum soil moisture value was under the condition of homogeneous permanent wilting point in root zone in each soil type with different atmosphere evaporative demands plk presented opposite trend 3 2 1 change of the e smcup curve with smcdown the e smcup curve showed a descending trend with decreasing smcdown fig 5 and the change of the e smcup curve with smcdown exhibited different patterns under different vpd under low vpd the threshold was similar among different curves ranged between 0 193 and 0 202 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and 0 085 0 087 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum value slightly differed among different curves 1 5 1 6 mmol m 2 s 1 while e dropped faster when smcup decreased below the threshold and the minimum value dropped from 1 01 to 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types under middle vpd the threshold increased from 0 209 to 0 227 mmol m 2 s 1 for loamy clay and from 0 101 to 0 116 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the maximum value decreased from 2 99 to 2 22 mmol m 2 s 1 e decreased in similar rates when smcup decreased below the threshold and the minimum value decreased from 1 01 to 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 with decreasing smcdown under high vpd the threshold differed little among different curves it ranged between 0 221 and 0 229 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and 0 115 0 120 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam respectively the maximum value decreased from 3 26 to 2 22 mmol m 2 s 1 and the minimum value decreased from 1 00 to 0 01 mmol m 2 s 1 with decreasing smcdown in the two soil types 3 2 2 change of the e crit smcup curve with smcdown the e crit smcup curve decreased with decreasing smcdown in both soils and was not affected by vpd fig 6 the threshold changed little and e crit decreased in a similar rate when smcup decreased below threshold among different curves as smcdown decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the threshold of e crit smcup curve ranged between 0 223 and 0 227 cm3 cm 3 and 0 108 0 116 cm3 cm 3 for loamy clay and sandy loam respectively the maximum value decreased from 5 31 to 3 91 mmol m 2 s 1 and the minimum value decreased from 2 09 to 0 03 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types when smcdown decreasing from field capacity to permanent wilting point 3 2 3 change of the hsm smcup curve with smcdown as affected by e and e crit the hsm smcup curve dropped with decreasing smcdown in both soil types and the patterns were impacted by vpd fig 7 under low vpd the threshold was similar among different curves it ranged between 0

decreasing smcdown for loamy clay and from 0 140 to 0 098 cm3 cm 3 for sandy loam the maximum values of the hsm smcup curves decreased from 2 32 to 1 73 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types as the smcdown decreased these values were lower compared to those under low vpd meanwhile hsm dropped at higher rates when smcup decreased below the threshold under lower smcdown causing the minimum value decreased from 1 08 to 0 02 mmol m 2 s 1 in the two soil types under high vpd the threshold fluctuated around 0 212 0 226 cm3 cm 3 in loamy clay and 0 098 0 110 cm3 cm 3 in sandy loam when smcdown

decreased from field capacity to permanent wilting point the minimum value varied slightly 0 8 plk increased faster when smcup dropped below the threshold and the maximum value increased from 32 to 96 in the two soil types 4 discussion plant water use characteristics at different soil depths are drawing the attention of researchers around the world with the increasing long term observations of soil moisture in deep soil profiles and the development of isotopic tracing method adams et al 2019 evaristo et al 2015 rossatto et al 2012 xi et al 2018a yang et al 2015 2017 on this basis the functional differences in shallow and deep soil water for plants are becoming more evident ryel et al 2008 yang et al 2017 characterizing plant response to root zone soil moisture heterogeneity is essential for better understanding soil water availability to plants puértolas et al 2020 with the help of mechanistically based models researchers are able to separate the influence of soil plant and atmospheric factors on plants and quantitatively assess these factors comprehensive effect which are difficult to analyze with experiments huber et al 2015 jackson et al 2000 novak et al 2005 sperry model explicitly simulates water transport through spac using the physics of flow through soil and xylem efficiently defines the response of plant water use to soil and atmospheric drought and calculates a series of unmeasurable hydraulic traits that reflects water transport safety sperry et al 2016 tai et al 2018 in this study we calibrated sperry model with the vertical spilt root experiments and verified the predictive accuracy of sperry model for simulating spac water transport we further analyzed the effect of root zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac under different soil and atmospheric conditions these quantitative findings are helpful for understanding the functional difference in soil water at different depths and optimizing water management in plantation forest and other ecosystems hsm and plk are important indicators that reflect water transport safety in spac sperry et al 1998 sperry and love 2015 tai et al 2017 2018 both of which were strongly affected by the soil moisture content in the upper and lower compartments in root zone according to the numerical analysis hsm decreased rapidly as smcup decreased below the threshold fig 7 while plk exhibited the opposite trend fig 8 indicating that water transport safety was significantly reduced when smcup was lower than the threshold the hsm smcup curves descended and plk smcup curves elevated gradually with decreasing smcdown notably plk increased faster and the smcup had a greater impact on hsm under lower smcdown suggesting that water transport safety would be more sensitive to the variation in shallow soil water with decreasing soil water in deep soil this finding supported the concept proposed by ryel et al 2008 the results also have important implications for deep soil water management for improving water transport safety in spac in plantation forests and other ecosystems for instance in shallow water table areas the seasonal variation in water table depth can substantially influence the dependence of spac water transport safety on the shallow soil water rossatto et al 2012 tai et al 2018 in areas with deep water table such as loess plateau spac water transport can be limited frequently due to the fluctuation in shallow soil water with serious soil desiccation below the infiltration depth furthermore the growth decline and forest dying back induced by hydraulic dysfunction can happen easily which has been observed in r pseudoacacia plantations in loess plateau in the previous studies wang et al 2008 wei et al 2018 in this case the mitigation approaches include 1 reducing soil water consumption in both shallow and deep layers through pruning thinning and other methods ma et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and 2 enhancing water storage in deep soil by methods such as rain collection and infiltration system song et al 2017 etc in addition subsurface drip irrigation can be adopted for improving soil moisture content in deep soil in some irrigated plantations like orchards nurseries etc the response of water transport safety in spac to smcup and smcdown was also affected by soil texture and atmospheric evaporative demand compared with in loamy clay hsm and plk were more sensitive to the variation in soil moisture content in sandy loam since soil water potential and hydraulic conductivity decreased faster with decreasing soil moisture content in coarser textured soils van genuchten 1980 in loess plateau soil texture is coarser and climate is drier in the northern and western areas wang et al 2010 therefore water transport safety in spac would be more easily impacted by soil moisture fluctuation in upper and lower layers in r pseudoacacia plantations additionally the hsm smcup curves were strongly affected by vpd the hsm is defined as the difference between e crit and actual e in which e crit is determined mainly by soil water condition sperry and love 2015 whereas e varied strongly with vpd fig 5 transpiration response to soil water availability has been widely examined using experiments and modeling studies the result showed that e remained stable at first and then decreased rapidly with decreasing soil moisture content wu et al 2011b yan et al 2017 the relationship between e and soil moisture content or soil water potential can be quantified with a linear plateau or s shaped function and it is influenced by soil plant and atmospheric factors wu et al 2015 in this study the variation in e with smcup exhibited similar patterns fig 5 additionally there was an interaction between smcup and smcdown in influencing e since the e smcup curves gradually descended with decreasing smcdown under higher vpd the maximum value of e smcup curve was higher while e decreased substantially at higher smcup threshold indicating that e was more sensitive to the variation in soil moisture content in upper and lower compartments with decreasing smcdown hsm decreased in a similar speed under low vpd while hsm decreased faster under middle and high vpd when smcup decreased below the threshold this result suggested that the decrease in smcdown has a greater impact on water transport safety in spac under middle and high vpd meanwhile the threshold of e crit smcup and e smcup curves were lower in coarser textured soils thus hsm smcup curves have lower threshold and hsm decreased faster when smcup decreased below the threshold fig 7 on the other hand the numerical simulations showed that the response of plk to soil moisture content was not affected by vpd this finding was mainly attributed to the assumption in sperry model that stomatal aperture is regulated based on plk eq 2 the assumption should be examined with more studies especially for the species with complex interactions between hydraulic and chemical signals in regulating stomatal behavior huber et al 2015 torres ruiz et al 2015 5 conclusion sperry model could efficiently simulate spac water transport in r pseudoacacia under the condition of soil moisture heterogeneity presenting as an important tool for analyzing the effect of root zone soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac the numerical simulations indicated that water transport safety in spac became more sensitive to soil moisture in upper root zone with decreasing soil moisture in the lower root zone and strongly affected by the soil type and atmospheric evaporative demand the results highlighted the importance of deep soil water management for water transport safety in spac and encouraged further studies sperry model can be further adopted to analyze the effect of eco physiological properties of roots such as the hydraulic redistribution on the function of soil water at different depths besides sperry model could be integrated with other eco physiological processes including carbon assimilation plant growth leaf shedding etc to analyze more physiological functions in response to root zone soil moisture heterogeneity more control experiments especially the comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous soil moisture treatments in both short and long term experiments should be conducted in further studies for better understanding the effect of soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in spac declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of

10234,precipitation is the major cause of crop yield variation in rainfed agriculture production on the loess plateau as overfertilization is economically and environmentally undesirable and crop yield and the resulting returns for n input are uncertain when rainfall variability is high optimizing n management according to the precipitation of fallow season is vital for efficient crop water use and high yield in dryland rainfed farming systems thus this study established a reference range describing wheat cultivation year types based on fallow season precipitation over 37 years we conducted an 8 year field experiment using seven different n input rates to focus on soil water content and its vertical distribution in the 0 300 cm soil layers and to assess the relationship between soil water utilization and yield formation the final objective was to evaluate how the optimal n input affects crop water consumption with the aim of maximizing yields eight experimental years 2009 2017 were classified as dry and normal years four of each with optimum n application rates of 150 and 180 kg nha 1 respectively compared with that used by farmers 210 kg nha 1 optimum n input saved 26 8 and 12 3 of n fertilizer increased grain yield by 5 0 and 5 2 and improved crop water productivity cwp by 6 1 and 8 5 in dry and normal years respectively optimized n inputs reduced soil water consumption before the jointing stage and increased the soil water available for grain yield production soil water depletion occurred from deeper soil layers with crop development and soil water storage sws at 80 240 and 200 300 cm depth played an important role in increasing spike number and grain filling respectively furthermore soil water conservation treatment increasing rainwater storage via deep plowing at start of the summer fallow season was unable to eliminate the variability in soil water storage at sowing and as drought at sowing effects on yield were more adverse than drought in growing season effects in dryland systems our results indicate that adjusting n fertilizer inputs based on summer rainfall variation could enhance wheat yield and cwp in the rainfed farming system keywords grain yield loess plateau nitrogen input summer fallow soil water storage 1 introduction rainfed agriculture is practiced on nearly 80 of cultivated land supplying 60 of the world s grain production unesco 2009 with wheat being the most important staple crop worldwide furthermore wheat yield must continue to increase to accommodate the demands of a growing population wei et al 2016 in dryland farming producing more food while reducing water consumption and improving water use efficiency wue is a challenge liang et al 2019 xue et al 2019 for the past thousand years the main crop rotation system in the loess plateau a hilly arid semi arid region in china has been rainfed winter wheat and summer fallow xue et al 2019 cropping areas on the loess plateau severely constrain production because of low moisture availability erratic precipitation distribution high climatic variability and lack of irrigation facilities tang et al 2019 thus the region depends on precipitation as its sole water source approximately 60 of precipitation on the loess plateau is confined to the winter wheat fallow season sun et al 2018 therefore wheat must cope with drought stress during the late growth stages as precipitation before sowing increases potential grain yield in rainfed regions and narrows yield variability in the subsequent crops the amount of precipitation during the fallow season may in fact be a more influential determinant of crop yield than the amount of precipitation during the growing season unger et al 2006 sun et al 2018 on the loess plateau soil organic matter content is 1 1 tang et al 2019 therefore fertilizer input is required to enhance yield potential guo et al 2012 n input improves drought tolerance by promoting root growth which facilitates water absorption from deeper soil and augments water utilization efficiency zhong and shangguan 2014 in addition the usual fertilizer application rates exceed 200 kg n ha 1 with an average grain yield of only 4000 kg ha 1 guo et al 2005 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2014 however excessive n application increases the risks of nitrate leaching and nox emissions fang et al 2006 schindler and hecky 2009 yang et al 2019 wheat crop responses to n input depend on soil water status basso et al 2010 and vary among years majrashi et al 2019 in general fertilizer and water synergistically determine high grain yield with soil moisture deficiency reducing the positive effects of n fertilizer on wheat production in contrast high rainfall and irrigation cause n leaching which also lowers yield fu et al 2014 high soil n levels from fertilizer application or mineralization can accelerate plant growth which could deplete water reserves although wheat may produce large numbers of seeds the grains might not fill owing to the lack of soil water passioura 2006 basso et al 2010 according to fu et al 2014 to achieve the highest yields and wue the n input must be adjusted according to water status precipitation levels and soil organic content in rainfed areas thus the interactions among fertilization precipitation and soil water consumption in rainfed dryland areas must be evaluated to optimize n management and crop soil water use reduce risk costs and environmental pollution and maintain grain yield nielsen et al 2005 moreover management practice optimization could improve wue grain yield and production sustainability owing to the lack of irrigation in the rainfed region of loess plateau smallholders generally apply fertilizer once at planting with no topdressing xue et al 2019 farmers usually employ a variety of measures to store more fallow season precipitation such as rotary tillage subsoiling and deep plowing straw turnover and straw mulching during the summer fallow which can increase soil water storage reduce soil erosion and improve fertilizer use efficiency cai et al 2006 sun et al 2018 ren et al 2019 facing the only fertilizer management chance matching the optimal n input rate with precipitation levels is a major challenge in dryland farming sadras et al 2016 cao et al 2017 calculated fertilizer rates according to fallow season precipitation and reported no yield loss after reducing n and p inputs by 24 and 37 respectively thus n input optimization directly based on fallow season precipitation could be feasible and practicable for loess plateau smallholder farmers and enable them to achieve target grain yields in this study we tried to build the reference range for summer rainfall to define wheat cultivation years as dry normal or wet based on fallow season precipitation over 37 years in the loess plateau over an 8 year period we focused on soil water content and its vertical distribution in the 0 300 cm soil layers assessed which growth stage and depth of soil water utilization correlated with yield formation and evaluated the effect of optimal n input on crop water consumption with the aim of maximizing yields thus the objectives of this work were i to establish a reference range for summer rainfall describing wheat cultivation year types based on fallow season precipitation ii to assess the responses to n fertilization rate of grain yield spatio temporal dynamics in soil water storage cwp and fallow season precipitation use rate in dry land winter wheat under varying rainfall conditions and iii to determine the optimal n input rates for each year type to realize maximum grain yield and cwp 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of experimental site a field experiment was conducted at the wheat agriculture station 35 20 n 111 17 e in wenxi county shanxi province china from 2009 to 2017 the experimental area was located in the southeastern loess plateau this site has a typical semi arid warm temperate climate köppen classification with 486 8 mm average annual precipitation the sum of fallow season and growth period precipitation 12 9 c average daily temperature and 2242 h of annual sunshine the main crop rotation system is rainfed winter wheat summer fallow winter wheat was sowed in late september or early october and harvested in early to late june of the following year the summer fallow is the period from harvest in the previous growing season early mid june every year to sowing in the next growing season late september early october approximately 60 of the annual precipitation occurs between july and september during the summer fallow season and no irrigation system long term rainfall data 1980 2017 for this region were collected to analyze and classify the year types the precipitation pattern during the summer fallow season and different wheat growth stages were listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management an entire terraced field was divided into eight parts to avoid n buildup a different field was used each year seeds of the winter wheat cultivar yunhan 20410 were obtained from the wenxi agriculture bureau wenxi china n in the form of 46 wt wt urea was applied before sowing at the rates of 0 90 120 150 180 210 and 240 kg nha 1 n0 n90 n120 n150 n180 n210 and n240 respectively based on our previous farmers survey sample size n 420 the smallholder farmers in the area apply fertilizers once before sowing according we set n210 at a single fertilization rate of 210 kg nha 1 before planting farmers survey showed an average n input was 205 24 kg n ha 1 fig s1 which is typical for the study region the low n treatments n90 n120 n150 and n180 were designed to explore the potential for an optimal n fertilizer rate whereas the higher n treatment n240 was included to ensure achieving maximum grain yield the experiment had a single factor randomized block design each treatment was performed in triplicate p2o5 and k2o 38 and 75 kg ha 1 respectively were also applied no fertilizers were applied during the growing seasons seeds were sown at a density of 225 104 ha 1 in rows 20 cm apart between september 27 and october 1 from 2009 to 2017 each plot was 5 10 m a soil water conservation treatment was conducted approximately 20 30 cm of the post harvest stubble was left intact to increase soil organic carbon and reduce evaporation and the remaining wheat stubble 20 30 cm was plowed to a 25 30 cm depth using a rotavator at the beginning to middle of july by deep plowing as described by sun et al 2018 table 2 irrigation was not applied at any time over the course of the experiment the soil type was classified as aridic and loamy containing 24 clay 0 002 mm 10 5 caco3 6 5 g organic c kg 1 0 80 g total n kg 1 and 200 mg nh4oac extractable k kg 1 at a 0 20 cm

2010 guo et al 2012 the information on land preparation field management and operation procedures were presented in table 2 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 yield and yield components at maturity 50 plants from each plot were randomly sampled from the inner rows to determine yield components such as spike number grain number per spike and thousand grain weight plot grain yield was determined by harvesting all plants in an area of 20 m2 located at the center of the plot to eliminate marginal effects shelling using machine and air drying the grain before grain yield determination 2 3 2 soil moisture at sowing jointing anthesis and maturity soil samples were collected down to 3 m depth with a soil drill soil water storage sws was calculated as follows sun et al 2018 1 sws bd ρ w swc h

the method of sun et al 2018 2 3 3 crop water productivity and total evapotranspiration crop water productivity kg grain yield ha 1 mm 1 et was calculated as follows 2 cwp y et where y is the grain yield kgha 1 and et mm is the total evapotranspiration during the wheat growth period from sowing to maturity et was calculated using the water balance equation for the loess plateau according to xue

arranged on flat farmland surrounded by high ridges that prevented surface runoff and dwp mm represented deep water percolation in the study region the soil had a large water holding capacity the upper 3 m of loess soil can store the entire annual rainfall ren et al 2019 lin et al 2019 thus there was minimal drainage below the measurement depth during the growing season hence the field water

distribution was extremely uneven in the dry wheat area of the loess plateau with rainfall in the wheat fallow period of july september accounting for 52 of the annual total fig 1 long term precipitation was used as a control to compare the precipitation during 1980 2017 with that in each year and years were classified as wet dry or normal fig 2 among them 13 and 7 years with total precipitation 50 mm lower and higher than the long term average were considered dry and wet respectively the remaining 17 years were considered to have normal precipitation the average annual distribution of precipitation in 1980 2017 i e fallow precipitation total precipitation fp tp was 52 according to fp tp 11 dry years 85 were below the average annual fp tp in 1980 2017 whereas 13 normal years 76 and five wet years 71 were above the average annual fp tp fig 2 the dry years with below average annual fp tp were considered non extreme while the others were considered extreme the normal and wet years with above average annual fp tp were considered non extreme while the others were considered extreme for the non extreme dry normal and wet years the annual fallow precipitation was 81 5 220 7 average 160 2 mm coefficient of variation cv 26 262 5 380 3 average 312 5 mm cv 11 and 346 2 439 7 mm average 391 3 mm cv 12 respectively fig 3 thus the upper fallow season precipitation limit for dry years was 220 7 mm and the lower limit for wet years was 346 2 mm meanwhile years with fallow season precipitation of 220 7 346 2 mm were rated normal years fig 3 notably wet dry and normal years only represent those with a high low and medium amount of fallow rainfall respectively which could not describe and predict the following wheat growth season according to the fallow season precipitation the eight experimental years were classified into different year types 2009 2010 2012 2013 2015 2017 were classified as dry years while 2010 2011 and 2013 2015 were considered normal years with mean grain yields of 3 82 4 28 and 4 68 5 2 tha 1 respectively table s1 fig 4 the year 2011 2012 was classified as wet and had mean grain yield of 5 11 tha 1 however considering that only 2011 2012 was a wet year this was also considered as a normal year in this study 3 2 soil moisture condition at sowing per year type the sws at sowing in dry and normal years was 392 3 494 6 and 489 1 585 7 mm respectively with sowing water condition being better in normal than dry years benefiting from the deep plowing in fallow season wse in the 8 years was higher than 43 9 reaching the highest value 67 2 in 2011 2012 however wse varied among year types table 3 although the sws at sowing increased in normal years 217 8 mm i e significantly more than that in dry years 87 9 mm the mean wse of normal years 61 3 was not significantly different from that in dry years 55 8 table 3 3 3 determining optimal nitrogen input rate based on year type grain yield was significantly affected by n application rate it initially increased with n input rate and maintained or decreased thereafter fig 5 the optimum n rate input resulting in maximum yield varied with year fig 5 supporting information table s1 in 2009 2010 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the maximum grain yield in n150 was 4 35 4 86 tha 1 and it was not significantly different from those in n180 n210 and n240 fig 5 in 2012 2013 the maximum yield in n150 was 4 50 tha 1 being significantly higher than that with other n input rates and considering the precipitation during anthesis to maturity 43 7 mm table 1 the lowest post anthesis precipitation of 8 years may have caused water deficiency in high n conditions overall the optimal n input rate for the four dry years was 150 kg nha 1 in 2011 2012 the maximum grain yield with n180 was 5 61 tha 1 not significantly different from those with n210 and n240 fig 5 in 2010 2011 and 2014 2015 the maximum yield with n180 was 5 56 5 75 tha 1 significantly higher than those under other n treatments which may also be caused by the low post anthesis precipitation in high n rates 63 7 and 68 9 mm table 1 it is interesting to note that 2013 2014 showed the highest yield with n150 5 25 tha 1 although it was not significantly different from those with n180 n210 and n240 fig 5 it was also the only year when both fallow season and post anthesis precipitation exceeded 300 and 90 mm respectively table 1 which may explain n150 earning a high yield in normal years hence further exploring the possibility of reasonable rainfall distribution to reduce n is meaningful to dryland wheat overall the optimal n input rate for normal years was 180 kg nha 1 compared to the farmer practice n input 205 kg nha 1 supporting information fig s1 the optimal n input rate was 55 and 25 kg nha 1 lower in dry and normal years respectively the optimal n application rate determined by yield criterion was different in dry and normal years i e 150 and 180 kg nha 1 respectively and both of them were lower than the farmer practice n treatment n210 hence it is necessary to clarify the water use and yield difference between the optimal n input rate between dry and normal years and with the farmers n application rate 3 4 effects of optimal n input rate on spike number and grain yield spike number was 22 1 higher under n180 in normal years 621 104 ha 1 than under n150 in dry year 509 104 ha 1 moreover spike number under the optimal n input rate in normal and dry years were 5 6 and 7 6 significantly higher than the corresponding farmer practice n210 respectively fig 6b supporting information table s2 a similar trend was also observed for grain yield grain yield was 24 9 higher under n180 in normal years 5 73 tha 1 than under n150 in dry year 4 59 tha 1 moreover grain yield under the optimal n input rate in normal and dry years were 5 0 and 5 2 significantly higher than the corresponding farmer practice n210 respectively fig 6a notably the grain number per spike and thousand grains weight showed a different trend in dry and normal years they showed no significant difference among n150 n180 and n210 additionally there was no significant difference in each variable across year types fig 6c d considering the growing season precipitation we found that varying growing season precipitation within year type table 1 caused the lack of difference in mean grain number per spike and thousand grains weight within year type a multiple variance analysis showed that year type had the greatest impact on grain yield and its components followed by n application rate and the interaction between year type and n application rate had a small effect table 4 as spike number and grain yield were positively correlated a regression analysis was conducted between spike number and yield results showed that the grain yield increase was significantly highly correlated with spike number in dry and normal years supporting information fig s2 these results indicated that the increase in grain yield owing to the optimal n input rate largely resulted from the enhanced spike number in dry and normal years 3 5 effects of optimal n input rate on crop water productivity year type had the largest effect on cwp while n rates had a minor effect fig 6e cwp was 33 3 higher under n180 in normal years 14 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 than under n150 in dry year 10 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 moreover cwp under the optimal n input rate in normal and dry years were 8 5 and 6 1 respectively significantly higher than the corresponding farmer practice n210 fig 6e hence the optimal n rate could slightly increase cwp in both dry and normal years fig 6e these results showed that a sufficient fallow season precipitation in combination with optimized n input could improve the cwp a multiple variance analysis showed that year type had the greatest impact on grain cwp followed by that of n application rate however there was no interaction effect on cwp between year and n application rate table 4 3 6 effect of n input rate and year type on fallow season precipitation use rate there was no significant difference between year types and n rates in pfur fig 6f in dry years pfur ranged from 43 9 to 64 3 cv 13 5 table 5 and it was not differ among n input rates this owing to the low soil water storage during fallow season which unable to meet the growth needs of crops d δswss m table 5 in normal years pfur ranged from 37 1 to 68 7 cv 14 7 in 2010 2011 and 2013 2014 normal years as d also unable to meet the growth needs of crops d δswss m pfur values were similar among n input rates table 5 however in some specific cases such as 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 normal years we could observe that d was higher than δswss m and pfur increased with n input rates table 5 aiming to explore the relationship between pfur and grain yield a regression analysis was conducted between pfur and grain yield only using 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 data results showed that the exponential rise of grain yield was significantly highly correlated with pfur in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 supporting information fig s3 interestingly we found that d acted different roles in different year types in dry years such as 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 d could supply water for crop growth between jointing and anthesis fig 7a d however in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 it could only supply water for crop growth until the jointing stage fig 7g h in normal years like 2010 2011 d could supply water for crop growth during anthesis to maturity fig 7b and in 2013 2014 d could supply water for crop growth until anthesis fig 7e in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 d supported the crop throughout the whole growth period fig 7c f a multiple variance analysis showed that year type had the greatest impact on pfur while n application rate had no significant impact there was no interaction effect between year and n application rate on pfur table 4 these results indicated that the influence of d on grain yield was not consistent and there was a great difference between year types however the 8 year experiment found that d could supply water for crop growth at least until jointing in dry years at least until anthesis in normal years 3 7 effects of optimized n rates on soil water consumption at different growth stages and soil depths the overall sws of 0 300 cm depth was slightly reduced 6 6 18 1 in all n treatments and year types from sowing to jointing and largely reduced 12 27 2 from jointing to flowering supporting information table s3 a further reduction at maturity was observed in both dry and normal years resulting in a total reduction of 16 4 30 4 supporting information table s3 spatio temporal dynamics in the sws of 0 300 cm depth varied with n rate developmental stage and year types but was generally similar in normal and dry years figs 8 10 among normal years the differential of sws in n treatments appeared at 60 200 80 200 60 200 and 20 200 cm at the jointing stage in 2010 2011 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 respectively fig 8b c e f then it moved to 80 220 80 200 and 120 220 at the anthesis stage fig 9b e f and further downwards to 200 300 220 300 and 200 300 at maturity stage in 2010 2011 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 respectively fig 10b e f notably in 2011 2012 sws showed no obvious differences among soil layers between n180 and n210 at anthesis and maturity stage figs 9c 10c which might be caused by the abundant rainfall during the crop growth period in 2011 2012 table 1 in the four dry years the differential of sws under n treatments was at 60 180 20 200 40 160 and 60 160 cm in the jointing stage fig 8a d g h and then it moved to 80 220 80 220 80 240 and 80 200 at anthesis stage fig 9a d g h in 2009 2010 2012 2013 2015 2016 and 2014 2015 respectively at maturity stage differential of sws further moved downwards to 220 300 220 300 and 220 300 cm in 2009 2010 2012 2013 and 2015 2017 respectively fig 10a d g h the vertical movement of differential soil water storage with plant development was broadly similar between dry and normal years figs 8 10 to show whether the differences observed in the differential soil layers among n rates and year types were significant the amount of sws in the differential soil layers was calculated considering that the differential of soil layers differed from year to year we chose the maximum range of year types for the average calculation i e 20 200 80 240 and 200 300 cm for the jointing anthesis and maturity stage respectively fig 11 to compare the general differences of vertical movement in optimal n input rate between year types at jointing stage the sws in the 20 220 cm layer significantly decreased with increasing n rate in the normal and dry years fig 11a notably sws in the 20 220 cm layer under n180 in normal years and n150 in dry years was 17 and 26 mm higher respectively than that under farmer practice n210 in the corresponding year moreover that under n180 in normal years was 63 3 mm higher than that under n150 in dry years fig 11a at the anthesis stage sws in the 80 240 cm layers under n180 in normal years and n150 in dry years was about 8 6 and 15 mm lower respectively than that under farmer practice n210 in the corresponding year moreover that under n180 in normal years was 53 6 mm higher than that under n150 in dry years fig 11b at maturity stage the sws in the 200 300 cm layer under n180 in normal years and n150 in dry years was about 8 7 and 11 mm lower respectively than that under farmer practice n210 in the corresponding year moreover it was 36 4 mm higher under n180 in normal years than under n150 in dry years fig 11c results showed that the optimal n input rate could reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage leading to more soil water available for the plant at later growth stages moreover after jointing stage the plants treated with the optimal n input rate also consumed more soil water for more productive tiller and grain filling these results revealed that differential of sws moved from above 80 240 cm at anthesis down to 200 300 cm depth at maturity in normal and dry years indicating the importance of sws in the deep soil layers for high yield production in addition the overall sws in the 0 300 cm layer at maturity under n210 was lower than that under optimal n input rate in both dry and normal years except for 2009 2011 supporting information table s3 indicating that higher n rate reduced the overall sws by the end of crop season which may be one of the reasons for the unstable production in dryland wheat 3 8 correlation of water consumption at different depths with yield at different stages and year types from jointing to anthesis stage soil water consumption from the 80 240 cm layer under n210 was 28 2 55 8 mm and lower than that under n180 in the normal years 62 5 84 9 mm supporting information table s4 in the dry years n210 consumed 28 2 50 7 mm water from the 80 240 cm soil layers and was lower than that under n150 73 8 80 2 mm supporting information table s4 soil water consumption from the 200 300 cm layer under n210 in the normal years was 46 1 78 3 mm and over 43 7 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth while n180 in the normal years was 54 9 79 6 mm and over 58 5 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth supporting information table s4 in the dry years n150 consumed 70 87 1 mm water from the 200 300 cm soil layer while n210 consumed 51 7 63 3 mm accounting for over 61 3 of the total consumption at 0 300 cm depth supporting information table s4 notably the cumulative precipitation during last two weeks of may in 2012 2017 was much higher than 2009 2012 supporting information fig s5 resulted in the negative values of soil water consumption from 0 200 cm 2012 2016 supporting information table s4 but all n treatments also consumed 49 2 87 1 mm soil water from the 200 300 cm soil layers despite of the higher precipitation during the late may in 2012 2017 moreover water consumption 200 300 cm at n150 in the dry years was 12 lower than that under n180 in normal years supporting information table s4 these results showed that a substantial proportion of water consumption was derived from the deep soil during grain filling especially in dry years implying that the water consumption from deep soil could be vital for grain yield regression analysis showed that 80 240 cm soil water consumption from jointing to anthesis was linearly correlated with spike number fig 12c d and that from 200 300 cm post anthesis was linearly correlated with yield in both normal and dry years fig 12a b suggesting that the soil water consumptions from the middle and deep soil play an important role in yield formation 4 discussion 4 1 describing year types and matching optimal n input based on the fallow season precipitation is feasible and economical for dryland wheat production on the loess plateau wheat production depends on precipitation as the sole water source because groundwater level is low and there is a lack of irrigation resources ren et al 2019 and as most precipitation occurs during the winter wheat fallow season wheat production depends upon precipitation water stored in the soil during the fallow period as well as that received during the growth period unger et al 2006 he et al 2016 guo et al 2012 in mediterranean regions winter wheat grain yield is positively correlated with precipitation during the growth stages lópez bellido et al 1996 contrastingly in the loess plateau region winter wheat grain yield is highly dependent on fallow season precipitation cao et al 2017 sun et al 2018 as precipitation rates are highly variable accurate grain yield prediction is difficult however fallow season precipitation rates and variations are easy to record guo et al 2012 significant pearson s correlation was observed between fallow season and total annual precipitation in the southeastern loess plateau r 0 83 p 0 01 guo et al 2012 thus a year may be defined as normal wet or dry based on fallow season precipitation and appropriate n application rates may be determined according to this parameter here the 37 year mean annual precipitation was 486 8 mm and the mean fallow season to annual precipitation ratio was 52 with percentages of 35 46 and 19 in dry normal and wet years respectively in the study region we classified these study years as extreme or non extreme types in terms of their fallow season precipitation fig 2 and the reference range used to define specific year types was formulated based on the predominant non extreme years years with fallow precipitation 220 7 mm upper limit were classified as dry those with fallow precipitation 346 2 mm lower limit were rated wet and those with fallow precipitation in the range of 220 7 346 2 mm were considered normal fig 3 this classification system could reasonably predict the year type and help select feasible n fertilization rates based on pre sowing fallow season precipitation which substantially influences wheat grain yield guo et al 2012 cao et al 2017 among the 37 years 8 were considered extreme years i e the probability of extreme years was 21 6 and we have an approximately 80 chance of managing n accurately by fallow season precipitation in these uncontrollable extreme years only conservative n application strategies can be adopted for economic efficiency and agricultural sustainability our 8 year field experiment 2009 2017 classified four dry years and three normal years fig 4 and considered that only 2011 2012 was a wet year which did not reveal much more information about wet years thus we just regarded 2011 2012 as a normal year based on the principle of high yield and low n input results showed that the optimum n application rates were 150 and 180 kg nha 1 in dry and normal years respectively fig 5 while the grain yield with optimal n input was 5 0 and 5 2 higher respectively than that under farmer practice fig 6a compared with the farmer practice n input 205 kg nha 1 supporting information fig s1 the optimal n input rate saved 26 8 and 12 3 n fertilizer input so this approach may be more economical and less risky than smallholder practice management similar results were reported for rainfed agriculture on the loess plateau but the amplitude of the n reduction ratio differed cao et al 2017 guo et al 2012 in that region low precipitation rates dramatically inhibit winter wheat production and high grain yields are usually obtained during years with elevated fallow season precipitation ren et al 2019 the n input recommendations are only practicable for smallholders if the treatment cost is lower than the net profit acquired either by lowering n input or by increasing grain yield lobell 2007 ju et al 2016 accordingly n fertilizer rate optimization incurs low costs especially on the loess plateau in china ju and christie 2011 4 2 soil water storage at sowing varied with the summer rainfall and recommended n input optimized the utilization of soil water storage plants are usually subjected to sustained drought during early spring a critical water consumption stage for vegetative growth in the semi arid and rain fed farming area of loess plateau sun et al 2018 ren et al 2019 jin et al 2007 to address these obstacles several advanced farming practices targeted to improve water availability through retaining precipitation in fallow season have been innovated and applied over the last decades such as conservation tillage either reduced tillage or zero tillage subsoiling and deep plowing chen et al 2009 hou et al 2012 sun et al 2018 however their effects will be directly affected by the amount of summer rainfall this study showed that the soil water storage at sowing increased 217 8 mm in normal years by deep plowing and was significantly higher than that in dry years 87 9 mm table 3 these results indicated that even though we conducted the advanced farming practices to improve water availability in fallow season the soil water storage at sowing also varied with summer rainfall thus the n input strategy needs to match the differences in moisture conditions and fallow season precipitation is the feasible reference for smallholder farmers in the loess plateau the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage revealed that n rates had a significant impact on the utilization of soil water storage in dry and normal years the differential soil water consumption under different n rates took place at different depths during different growth stages compared to farmer practice n210 the optimal n treatment in the normal and dry years n180 and n150 respectively used less soil water storage up to the jointing stage in differential soil layers but more soil water storage was depleted from jointing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity stage figs 8 10 as the optimized n input could reduce water consumption at the early stage of plant development it could provide soil water for consumption increasing productive tiller and grain filling fig 12 leading to higher grain yield fig 6 root growth increases in depth with plant development and follows water availability in soil feng et al 2017 xu et al 2016 which implies that the differential soil water storage observed in soil layers among n rates is a result of the water uptake activity from roots moreover roots in the deep soil play an important role in the uptake of soil water after flowering in wheat li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 compared with that of the optimal n treatment in dry years n150 the higher grain yield with the optimized n input in normal years achieved higher cwp fig 6e the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage were similar between optimal n of dry and normal years figs 8 10 as the grain yield was largely determined by et table 5 the more sensible strategy of water utilization with the optimized n played a key role in the higher grain yield production therefore leading to higher cwp than farmer practice n input fig 6e interestingly comparison of cwp difference between n input rates each year indicated that the maximal cwp could be obtained with optimal n input rate in all dry years but not in normal years table 5 this means that the effects of optimal n levels on cwp are more effective in the low rainfall years 4 3 optimized soil water storage utilization by recommended n input increased the spike number and yield optimized n input could maximize the utilization of soil water storage increasing spike number and grain yield our results showed that soil water storage from fallow season precipitation by wheat was utilized at least until jointing stage fig 7 and optimal n input rate used less soil water storage up to the jointing stage in differential soil layers but more soil water storage was depleted from jointing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity stage figs 8 10 similar results were reported by ren et al 2019 as the jointing and post jointing stage is the key time for more productive tillers and determining the spike number fan et al 2019 song et al 2018 the optimal n input rate can build numerous strong productive tillers by improving adequate soil water storage laying the foundation for high yields sun et al 2018 xue et al 2019 ren et al 2019 notably we found that the high n rate n210 consumed a large amount of soil water before jointing and caused varying degrees of water deficit at maturity stage in several years the soil water storage in 0 300 cm at maturity under optimal n input rate was 2 3 12 1 higher than that under n210 2011 2017 supporting information table s3 this indicated that excessive n application consumed a lot of soil deep water and was not sustainable long term nitrogen over application may leading to the dried soil layers which would hinder and disrupt the water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere system which in turn would have a negative impact on the development of the vegetation li et al 2008 shangguan 2007 thus adjusting the n fertilizer rate in accordance with fallow season precipitation is imperative in the rain fed winter wheat farming systems we expected pfur fallow season precipitation use rate to be the index that directly represented the situation of summer fallow rainfall use and reflected if optimal n input rate can adjust the fallow rainfall utilization by dryland wheat unfortunately our data showed that pfur was 37 1 68 7 in 8 years but was the same among n rates in most years table 5 the main reason was that the soil water storage from summer rainfall d was usually consumed out before crop maturity fig 7 table 5 thus pfur was equal to wse except in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 in years with total precipitation above 500 mm 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 pfur increased with n input rate but the maximal pfur could not be obtained under optimal n treatment table 5 supporting information fig s3 thus pfur could not provide additional information about the fallow precipitation utilization by wheat nonetheless the proportion of et which contributed from fallow rainfall was 13 8 58 data not showed which implied that water from fallow rainfall played an important role in crop water consumption similar results were reported in the semi arid region of loess plateau regarding the 0 100 cm soil depth deng et al 2010 found that 5 35 crop water consumption comes from fallow rainfall in gansu china while jia et al 2017 reported that 13 8 32 3 crop water consumption comes from fallow rainfall in four experiment sites in gansu the upper limit of our conclusion may be higher than these values owing to the deeper soil water layers 0 300 cm than those in previous studies further research needs to accurately measure soil evaporation and crop transpiration and clarify the fallow precipitation utilization by wheat peng et al 2020 or follow isotope tracer techniques from a macroscopic perspective previous research directly calculated the yield increase by amount of soil water at sowing nielsen et al 2005 calculated a wheat yield response of 9 5 kg ha 1 for every mm of stored soil water for kansas usa in colorado usa wheat yields increased by around 4 kg ha 1 for every mm of soil water at sowing in dry years while in average and wet years this increase was 14 kg ha 1 nielsen et al 2005 it could be expected that rainfall stored in the soil prior to sowing would be less important for the productivity of winter crops grown in environments where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year or where winter rainfall dominates however kirkegaard et al 2001 reported a yield response of 18 kg ha 1 per mm of available soil water at sowing for wheat grown in southern new south wales australia where rainfall is strongly seasonal similarly in mediterranean type environments of southern australia increased yield potential has been reported as 6 8 kg ha 1 for each additional mm stored soil water at sowing french 1978 sadras 2002 similar results have been found in arid and semi arid areas of the loess plateau where cao et al 2017 reported a yield response of 3 89 11 89 kg ha 1 per mm of fallow rainfall with fallow rainfall between 300 500 mm our results showed that soil water storage during fallow season d response of 0 7 mm per mm of fallow season precipitation supporting information fig s4a and average grain yield increased 6 1 kg ha 1 for each additional mm stored soil water at sowing supporting information fig s4b these results indicated that the water utilization by wheat from soil water storage from fallow season precipitation is vital for wheat productivity in arid and semi arid region 4 4 improving the capacity of fallow season precipitation storage and matching n input is essential for dry land wheat production admittedly our year classification method had some flaws the criterion of year classification based on fallow season precipitation could not reflect the soil water condition during the growing season thus dry year in our criterion system may have a large amount of growing season precipitation among our experiment years 2016 2017 was rated as dry year owing to the limited fallow season rainfall 153 3 mm but the growing season precipitation was sufficient 253 mm table 1 contrastingly 2010 2011 was a normal year that had sufficient fallow precipitation 325 5 mm and low growing season precipitation 126 6 mm table 1 interestingly total precipitation in those years was 452 1 and 406 3 mm with less than 50 mm difference table 1 but the difference of soil water storage at sowing was over 100 mm 506 1 and 393 3 mm in 2010 2011 and 2016 2017 respectively table 3 our results showed that the mean spike number and grain number per spike in 2010 2011 was higher than that in 2016 2017 but the mean thousand grain weight was lower in 2010 2011 than 2016 2017 supporting information table s2 and the mean yield in 2010 2011 was 21 5 higher than that in 2016 2017 supporting information table s1 thus we presume that drought at sowing effects are more adverse to yield than those of drought in growing season because the water stress at sowing will reduce the seeding emergence rate and further affect the spike number which is not conducive to the establishment of a high quality wheat population and forming yield however although the drought in growing season will adversely affect the grain yield this soil water stress may be alleviated by deep soil water usage by deep roots feng et al 2017 xu et al 2016 hence improving the capacity of fallow season precipitation storage especially deep soil water storage by matching n input to optimize soil water storage utilization adjusting and controlling the spike number for higher yield is vital for dry land wheat production 5 conclusion a reference range was built to define wheat cultivation years as dry normal or wet based on fallow season precipitation rates over 37 years 1981 2017 eight experimental years 2009 2017 were classified into dry and normal years four of each the field results show that the optimum n application rates was 150 and 180 kg nha 1 in dry and normal years respectively compared to surveyed farmers n application rate these optimum n inputs saved 26 8 and 12 3 n fertilizer increased grain yield by 5 0 and 5 2 and improved cwp by 6 1 and 8 5 in dry and normal years respectively the optimized n inputs could reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage and increase the amount of soil water available for grain yield production regarding spatio temporal dynamics soil water depletion occurred from deeper soil layers with crop development and soil water storage at the 80 240 and 200 300 cm soil depths played an important role in improving spike number and grain filling respectively furthermore the soil water conservation treatment could not change the fact that the soil water storage at sowing varies with summer rainfall and that drought at sowing has more adverse effect on yield than drought in the growing season thus small holders need to adjust n inputs based on the fallow season precipitation to improve yield and

10234,precipitation is the major cause of crop yield variation in rainfed agriculture production on the loess plateau as overfertilization is economically and environmentally undesirable and crop yield and the resulting returns for n input are uncertain when rainfall variability is high optimizing n management according to the precipitation of fallow season is vital for efficient crop water use and high yield in dryland rainfed farming systems thus this study established a reference range describing wheat cultivation year types based on fallow season precipitation over 37 years we conducted an 8 year field experiment using seven different n input rates to focus on soil water content and its vertical distribution in the 0 300 cm soil layers and to assess the relationship between soil water utilization and yield formation the final objective was to evaluate how the optimal n input affects crop water consumption with the aim of maximizing yields eight experimental years 2009 2017 were classified as dry and normal years four of each with optimum n application rates of 150 and 180 kg nha 1 respectively compared with that used by farmers 210 kg nha 1 optimum n input saved 26 8 and 12 3 of n fertilizer increased grain yield by 5 0 and 5 2 and improved crop water productivity cwp by 6 1 and 8 5 in dry and normal years respectively optimized n inputs reduced soil water consumption before the jointing stage and increased the soil water available for grain yield production soil water depletion occurred from deeper soil layers with crop development and soil water storage sws at 80 240 and 200 300 cm depth played an important role in increasing spike number and grain filling respectively furthermore soil water conservation treatment increasing rainwater storage via deep plowing at start of the summer fallow season was unable to eliminate the variability in soil water storage at sowing and as drought at sowing effects on yield were more adverse than drought in growing season effects in dryland systems our results indicate that adjusting n fertilizer inputs based on summer rainfall variation could enhance wheat yield and cwp in the rainfed farming system keywords grain yield loess plateau nitrogen input summer fallow soil water storage 1 introduction rainfed agriculture is practiced on nearly 80 of cultivated land supplying 60 of the world s grain production unesco 2009 with wheat being the most important staple crop worldwide furthermore wheat yield must continue to increase to accommodate the demands of a growing population wei et al 2016 in dryland farming producing more food while reducing water consumption and improving water use efficiency wue is a challenge liang et al 2019 xue et al 2019 for the past thousand years the main crop rotation system in the loess plateau a hilly arid semi arid region in china has been rainfed winter wheat and summer fallow xue et al 2019 cropping areas on the loess plateau severely constrain production because of low moisture availability erratic precipitation distribution high climatic variability and lack of irrigation facilities tang et al 2019 thus the region depends on precipitation as its sole water source approximately 60 of precipitation on the loess plateau is confined to the winter wheat fallow season sun et al 2018 therefore wheat must cope with drought stress during the late growth stages as precipitation before sowing increases potential grain yield in rainfed regions and narrows yield variability in the subsequent crops the amount of precipitation during the fallow season may in fact be a more influential determinant of crop yield than the amount of precipitation during the growing season unger et al 2006 sun et al 2018 on the loess plateau soil organic matter content is 1 1 tang et al 2019 therefore fertilizer input is required to enhance yield potential guo et al 2012 n input improves drought tolerance by promoting root growth which facilitates water absorption from deeper soil and augments water utilization efficiency zhong and shangguan 2014 in addition the usual fertilizer application rates exceed 200 kg n ha 1 with an average grain yield of only 4000 kg ha 1 guo et al 2005 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2014 however excessive n application increases the risks of nitrate leaching and nox emissions fang et al 2006 schindler and hecky 2009 yang et al 2019 wheat crop responses to n input depend on soil water status basso et al 2010 and vary among years majrashi et al 2019 in general fertilizer and water synergistically determine high grain yield with soil moisture deficiency reducing the positive effects of n fertilizer on wheat production in contrast high rainfall and irrigation cause n leaching which also lowers yield fu et al 2014 high soil n levels from fertilizer application or mineralization can accelerate plant growth which could deplete water reserves although wheat may produce large numbers of seeds the grains might not fill owing to the lack of soil water passioura 2006 basso et al 2010 according to fu et al 2014 to achieve the highest yields and wue the n input must be adjusted according to water status precipitation levels and soil organic content in rainfed areas thus the interactions among fertilization precipitation and soil water consumption in rainfed dryland areas must be evaluated to optimize n management and crop soil water use reduce risk costs and environmental pollution and maintain grain yield nielsen et al 2005 moreover management practice optimization could improve wue grain yield and production sustainability owing to the lack of irrigation in the rainfed region of loess plateau smallholders generally apply fertilizer once at planting with no topdressing xue et al 2019 farmers usually employ a variety of measures to store more fallow season precipitation such as rotary tillage subsoiling and deep plowing straw turnover and straw mulching during the summer fallow which can increase soil water storage reduce soil erosion and improve fertilizer use efficiency cai et al 2006 sun et al 2018 ren et al 2019 facing the only fertilizer management chance matching the optimal n input rate with precipitation levels is a major challenge in dryland farming sadras et al 2016 cao et al 2017 calculated fertilizer rates according to fallow season precipitation and reported no yield loss after reducing n and p inputs by 24 and 37 respectively thus n input optimization directly based on fallow season precipitation could be feasible and practicable for loess plateau smallholder farmers and enable them to achieve target grain yields in this study we tried to build the reference range for summer rainfall to define wheat cultivation years as dry normal or wet based on fallow season precipitation over 37 years in the loess plateau over an 8 year period we focused on soil water content and its vertical distribution in the 0 300 cm soil layers assessed which growth stage and depth of soil water utilization correlated with yield formation and evaluated the effect of optimal n input on crop water consumption with the aim of maximizing yields thus the objectives of this work were i to establish a reference range for summer rainfall describing wheat cultivation year types based on fallow season precipitation ii to assess the responses to n fertilization rate of grain yield spatio temporal dynamics in soil water storage cwp and fallow season precipitation use rate in dry land winter wheat under varying rainfall conditions and iii to determine the optimal n input rates for each year type to realize maximum grain yield and cwp 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of experimental site a field experiment was conducted at the wheat agriculture station 35 20 n 111 17 e in wenxi county shanxi province china from 2009 to 2017 the experimental area was located in the southeastern loess plateau this site has a typical semi arid warm temperate climate köppen classification with 486 8 mm average annual precipitation the sum of fallow season and growth period precipitation 12 9 c average daily temperature and 2242 h of annual sunshine the main crop rotation system is rainfed winter wheat summer fallow winter wheat was sowed in late september or early october and harvested in early to late june of the following year the summer fallow is the period from harvest in the previous growing season early mid june every year to sowing in the next growing season late september early october approximately 60 of the annual precipitation occurs between july and september during the summer fallow season and no irrigation system long term rainfall data 1980 2017 for this region were collected to analyze and classify the year types the precipitation pattern during the summer fallow season and different wheat growth stages were listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management an entire terraced field was divided into eight parts to avoid n buildup a different field was used each year seeds of the winter wheat cultivar yunhan 20410 were obtained from the wenxi agriculture bureau wenxi china n in the form of 46 wt wt urea was applied before sowing at the rates of 0 90 120 150 180 210 and 240 kg nha 1 n0 n90 n120 n150 n180 n210 and n240 respectively based on our previous farmers survey sample size n 420 the smallholder farmers in the area apply fertilizers once before sowing according we set n210 at a single fertilization rate of 210 kg nha 1 before planting farmers survey showed an average n input was 205 24 kg n ha 1 fig s1 which is typical for the study region the low n treatments n90 n120 n150 and n180 were designed to explore the potential for an optimal n fertilizer rate whereas the higher n treatment n240 was included to ensure achieving maximum grain yield the experiment had a single factor randomized block design each treatment was performed in triplicate p2o5 and k2o 38 and 75 kg ha 1 respectively were also applied no fertilizers were applied during the growing seasons seeds were sown at a density of 225 104 ha 1 in rows 20 cm apart between september 27 and october 1 from 2009 to 2017 each plot was 5 10 m a soil water conservation treatment was conducted approximately 20 30 cm of the post harvest stubble was left intact to increase soil organic carbon and reduce evaporation and the remaining wheat stubble 20 30 cm was plowed to a 25 30 cm depth using a rotavator at the beginning to middle of july by deep plowing as described by sun et al 2018 table 2 irrigation was not applied at any time over the course of the experiment the soil type was classified as aridic and loamy containing 24 clay 0 002 mm 10 5 caco3 6 5 g organic c kg 1 0 80 g total n kg 1 and 200 mg nh4oac extractable k kg 1 at a 0 20 cm

2010 guo et al 2012 the information on land preparation field management and operation procedures were presented in table 2 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 yield and yield components at maturity 50 plants from each plot were randomly sampled from the inner rows to determine yield components such as spike number grain number per spike and thousand grain weight plot grain yield was determined by harvesting all plants in an area of 20 m2 located at the center of the plot to eliminate marginal effects shelling using machine and air drying the grain before grain yield determination 2 3 2 soil moisture at sowing jointing anthesis and maturity soil samples were collected down to 3 m depth with a soil drill soil water storage sws was calculated as follows sun et al 2018 1 sws bd ρ w swc h where sws bd swc h and ρw represented the soil water storage mm bulk density gcm 3 water content g water g 1 dry soil depth mm and water density respectively bd and swc were calculated according to the method of sun et al 2018 2 3 3 crop water productivity and total evapotranspiration crop water productivity kg grain yield ha 1 mm 1 et was calculated as follows 2 cwp y et where y is the grain yield kgha 1 and et mm is the total evapotranspiration during the wheat growth period from sowing to maturity et was calculated using the water balance equation for the loess plateau according to xue

arranged on flat farmland surrounded by high ridges that prevented surface runoff and dwp mm represented deep water percolation in the study region the soil had a large water holding capacity the upper 3 m of loess soil can store the entire annual rainfall ren et al 2019 lin et al 2019 thus there was minimal drainage below the measurement depth during the growing season hence the field water balance equation was simplified to 4 et p δ sws s m 2 3 4 water storage efficiency water storage efficiency wse in fallow season was calculated as follows 5 wse d r 100 where soil water storage during

were previously defined eq 5 in dryland as et p δswss m p is the only water source during the wheat growing period while δswss m is assumed to come from fallow season precipitation and is almost always positive sun et al 2018 2 4 precipitation type precipitation type was defined as follows zhang et al 2008 7 wet p pm 0 33 δ normal pm 0 33 δ p pm 0 33 δ dry p p m 0 33 δ where p was the total precipitation of the summer fallow winter wheat growth year i e july previous year to june following year p m was the long term average p 1980 2017 486 8 mm and δ was the standard deviation of p 151 52 mm therefore 50 mm 0 33 δ lower than the long term average were considered dry and 50 mm 0 33 δ more than the long term average were considered wet 2 5 statistical analysis sas v 9 2 sas institute

input rates p 0 05 by lsd 3 results 3 1 year classification based on the fallow season precipitation in 1980 2017 the average annual precipitation at the site was 486 8 mm table 1 annual rainfall distribution was extremely uneven in the dry wheat area of the loess plateau with rainfall in the wheat fallow period of july september accounting for 52 of the annual total fig 1 long term precipitation was used as a control to compare the precipitation during 1980 2017 with that in each year and years were classified as wet dry or normal fig 2 among them 13 and 7 years with total precipitation 50 mm lower and higher than the long term average were considered dry and wet respectively the remaining 17 years were considered to have normal precipitation the average annual distribution of precipitation in 1980 2017 i e fallow precipitation total precipitation fp tp was 52 according to fp tp 11 dry years 85 were below the average annual fp tp in 1980 2017 whereas 13 normal years 76 and five wet years 71 were above the average annual fp tp fig 2 the dry years with below average annual fp tp were considered non extreme while the others were considered extreme the normal and wet years with above average annual fp tp were considered non extreme while the others were considered extreme for the non extreme dry normal and wet years the annual fallow precipitation was 81 5 220 7 average 160 2 mm coefficient of variation cv 26 262 5 380 3 average 312 5 mm cv 11 and 346 2 439 7 mm average 391 3 mm cv 12 respectively fig 3 thus the upper fallow season precipitation limit for dry years was 220 7 mm and the lower limit for wet years was 346 2 mm meanwhile years with fallow season precipitation of 220 7 346 2 mm were rated normal years fig 3 notably wet dry and normal years only represent those with a high low and medium amount of fallow rainfall respectively which could not describe and predict the following wheat growth season according to the fallow season precipitation the eight experimental years were classified into different year types 2009 2010 2012 2013 2015 2017 were classified as dry years while 2010 2011 and 2013 2015 were considered normal years with mean grain yields of 3 82 4 28 and 4 68 5 2 tha 1 respectively table s1 fig 4 the year 2011 2012 was classified as wet and had mean grain yield of 5 11 tha 1 however considering that only 2011 2012 was a wet year this was also considered as a normal year in this study 3 2 soil moisture condition at sowing per year type the sws at sowing in dry and normal years was 392 3 494 6 and 489 1 585 7 mm respectively with sowing water condition being better in normal than dry years benefiting from the deep plowing in fallow season wse in the 8 years was higher than 43 9 reaching the highest value 67 2 in 2011 2012 however wse varied among year types table 3 although the sws at sowing increased in normal years 217 8 mm i e significantly more than that in dry years 87 9 mm the mean wse of normal years 61 3 was not significantly different from that in dry years 55 8 table 3 3 3 determining optimal nitrogen input rate based on year type grain yield was significantly affected by n application rate it initially increased with n input rate and maintained or decreased thereafter fig 5 the optimum n rate input resulting in maximum yield varied with year fig 5 supporting information table s1 in 2009 2010 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the maximum grain yield in n150 was 4 35 4 86 tha 1 and it was not significantly different from those in n180 n210 and n240 fig 5 in 2012 2013 the maximum yield in n150 was 4 50 tha 1 being significantly higher than that with other n input rates and considering the precipitation during anthesis to maturity 43 7 mm table 1 the lowest post anthesis precipitation of 8 years may have caused water deficiency in high n conditions overall the optimal n input rate for the four dry years was 150 kg nha 1 in 2011 2012 the maximum grain yield with n180 was 5 61 tha 1 not significantly different from those with n210 and n240 fig 5 in 2010 2011 and 2014 2015 the maximum yield with n180 was 5 56 5 75 tha 1 significantly higher than those under other n treatments which may also be caused by the low post anthesis precipitation in high n rates 63 7 and 68 9 mm table 1 it is interesting to note that 2013 2014 showed the highest yield with n150 5 25 tha 1 although it was not significantly different from those with n180 n210 and n240 fig 5 it was also the only year when both fallow season and post anthesis precipitation exceeded 300 and 90 mm respectively table 1 which may explain n150 earning a high yield in normal years hence further exploring the possibility of reasonable rainfall distribution to reduce n is meaningful to dryland wheat overall the optimal n input rate for normal years was 180 kg nha 1 compared to the farmer practice n input 205 kg nha 1 supporting information fig s1 the optimal n input rate was 55 and 25 kg nha 1 lower in dry and normal years respectively the optimal n application rate determined by yield criterion was different in dry and normal years i e 150 and 180 kg nha 1 respectively and both of them were lower than the farmer practice n treatment n210 hence it is necessary to clarify the water use and yield difference between the optimal n input rate between dry and normal years and with the farmers n application rate 3 4 effects of optimal n input rate on spike number and grain yield spike number was 22 1 higher under n180 in normal years 621 104 ha 1 than under n150 in dry year 509 104 ha 1 moreover spike number under the optimal n input rate in normal and dry years were 5 6 and 7 6 significantly higher than the corresponding farmer practice n210 respectively fig 6b supporting information table s2 a similar trend was also observed for grain yield grain yield was 24 9 higher under n180 in normal years 5 73 tha 1 than under n150 in dry year 4 59 tha 1 moreover grain yield under the optimal n input rate in normal and dry years were 5 0 and 5 2 significantly higher than the corresponding farmer practice n210 respectively fig 6a notably the grain number per spike and thousand grains weight showed a different trend in dry and normal years they showed no significant difference among n150 n180 and n210 additionally there was no significant difference in each variable across year types fig 6c d considering the growing season precipitation we found that varying growing season precipitation within year type table 1 caused the lack of difference in mean grain number per spike and thousand grains weight within year type a multiple variance analysis showed that year type had the greatest impact on grain yield and its components followed by n application rate and the interaction between year type and n application rate had a small effect table 4 as spike number and grain yield were positively correlated a regression analysis was conducted between spike number and yield results showed that the grain yield increase was significantly highly correlated with spike number in dry and normal years supporting information fig s2 these results indicated that the increase in grain yield owing to the optimal n input rate largely resulted from the enhanced spike number in dry and normal years 3 5 effects of optimal n input rate on crop water productivity year type had the largest effect on cwp while n rates had a minor effect fig 6e cwp was 33 3 higher under n180 in normal years 14 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 than under n150 in dry year 10 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 moreover cwp under the optimal n input rate in normal and dry years were 8 5 and 6 1 respectively significantly higher than the corresponding farmer practice n210 fig 6e hence the optimal n rate could slightly increase cwp in both dry and normal years fig 6e these results showed that a sufficient fallow season precipitation in combination with optimized n input could improve the cwp a multiple variance analysis showed that year type had the greatest impact on grain cwp followed by that of n application rate however there was no interaction effect on cwp between year and n application rate table 4 3 6 effect of n input rate and year type on fallow season precipitation use rate there was no significant difference between year types and n rates in pfur fig 6f in dry years pfur ranged from 43 9 to 64 3 cv 13 5 table 5 and it was not differ among n input rates this owing to the low soil water storage during fallow season which unable to meet the growth needs of crops d δswss m table 5 in normal years pfur ranged from 37 1 to 68 7 cv 14 7 in 2010 2011 and 2013 2014 normal years as d also unable to meet the growth needs of crops d δswss m pfur values were similar among n input rates table 5 however in some specific cases such as 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 normal years we could observe that d was higher than δswss m and pfur increased with n input rates table 5 aiming to explore the relationship between pfur and grain yield a regression analysis was conducted between pfur and grain yield only using 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 data results showed that the exponential rise of grain yield was significantly highly correlated with pfur in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 supporting information fig s3 interestingly we found that d acted different roles in different year types in dry years such as 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 d could supply water for crop growth between jointing and anthesis fig 7a d however in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 it could only supply water for crop growth until the jointing stage fig 7g h in normal years like 2010 2011 d could supply water for crop growth during anthesis to maturity fig 7b and in 2013 2014 d could supply water for crop growth until anthesis fig 7e in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 d supported the crop throughout the whole growth period fig 7c f a multiple variance analysis showed that year type had the greatest impact on pfur while n application rate had no significant impact there was no interaction effect between year and n application rate on pfur table 4 these results indicated that the influence of d on grain yield was not consistent and there was a great difference between year types however the 8 year experiment found that d could supply water for crop growth at least until jointing in dry years at least until anthesis in normal years 3 7 effects of optimized n rates on soil water consumption at different growth stages and soil depths the overall sws of 0 300 cm depth was slightly reduced 6 6 18 1 in all n treatments and year types from sowing to jointing and largely reduced 12 27 2 from jointing to flowering supporting information table s3 a further reduction at maturity was observed in both dry and normal years resulting in a total reduction of 16 4 30 4 supporting information table s3 spatio temporal dynamics in the sws of 0 300 cm depth varied with n rate developmental stage and year types but was generally similar in normal and dry years figs 8 10 among normal years the differential of sws in n treatments appeared at 60 200 80 200 60 200 and 20 200 cm at the jointing stage in 2010 2011 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 respectively fig 8b c e f then it moved to 80 220 80 200 and 120 220 at the anthesis stage fig 9b e f and further downwards to 200 300 220 300 and 200 300 at maturity stage in 2010 2011 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 respectively fig 10b e f notably in 2011 2012 sws showed no obvious differences among soil layers between n180 and n210 at anthesis and maturity stage figs 9c 10c which might be caused by the abundant rainfall during the crop growth period in 2011 2012 table 1 in the four dry years the differential of sws under n treatments was at 60 180 20 200 40 160 and 60 160 cm in the jointing stage fig 8a d g h and then it moved to 80 220 80 220 80 240 and 80 200 at anthesis stage fig 9a d g h in 2009 2010 2012 2013 2015 2016 and 2014 2015 respectively at maturity stage differential of sws further moved downwards to 220 300 220 300 and 220 300 cm in 2009 2010 2012 2013 and 2015 2017 respectively fig 10a d g h the vertical movement of differential soil water storage with plant development was broadly similar between dry and normal years figs 8 10 to show whether the differences observed in the differential soil layers among n rates and year types were significant the amount of sws in the differential soil layers was calculated considering that the differential of soil layers differed from year to year we chose the maximum range of year types for the average calculation i e 20 200 80 240 and 200 300 cm for the jointing anthesis and maturity stage respectively fig 11 to compare the general differences of vertical movement in optimal n input rate between year types at jointing stage the sws in the 20 220 cm layer significantly decreased with increasing n rate in the normal and dry years fig 11a notably sws in the 20 220 cm layer under n180 in normal years and n150 in dry years was 17 and 26 mm higher respectively than that under farmer practice n210 in the corresponding year moreover that under n180 in normal years was 63 3 mm higher than that under n150 in dry years fig 11a at the anthesis stage sws in the 80 240 cm layers under n180 in normal years and n150 in dry years was about 8 6 and 15 mm lower respectively than that under farmer practice n210 in the corresponding year moreover that under n180 in normal years was 53 6 mm higher than that under n150 in dry years fig 11b at maturity stage the sws in the 200 300 cm layer under n180 in normal years and n150 in dry years was about 8 7 and 11 mm lower respectively than that under farmer practice n210 in the corresponding year moreover it was 36 4 mm higher under n180 in normal years than under n150 in dry years fig 11c results showed that the optimal n input rate could reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage leading to more soil water available for the plant at later growth stages moreover after jointing stage the plants treated with the optimal n input rate also consumed more soil water for more productive tiller and grain filling these results revealed that differential of sws moved from above 80 240 cm at anthesis down to 200 300 cm depth at maturity in normal and dry years indicating the importance of sws in the deep soil layers for high yield production in addition the overall sws in the 0 300 cm layer at maturity under n210 was lower than that under optimal n input rate in both dry and normal years except for 2009 2011 supporting information table s3 indicating that higher n rate reduced the overall sws by the end of crop season which may be one of the reasons for the unstable production in dryland wheat 3 8 correlation of water consumption at different depths with yield at different stages and year types from jointing to anthesis stage soil water consumption from the 80 240 cm layer under n210 was 28 2 55 8 mm and lower than that under n180 in the normal years 62 5 84 9 mm supporting information table s4 in the dry years n210 consumed 28 2 50 7 mm water from the 80 240 cm soil layers and was lower than that under n150 73 8 80 2 mm supporting information table s4 soil water consumption from the 200 300 cm layer under n210 in the normal years was 46 1 78 3 mm and over 43 7 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth while n180 in the normal years was 54 9 79 6 mm and over 58 5 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth supporting information table s4 in the dry years n150 consumed 70 87 1 mm water from the 200 300 cm soil layer while n210 consumed 51 7 63 3 mm accounting for over 61 3 of the total consumption at 0 300 cm depth supporting information table s4 notably the cumulative precipitation during last two weeks of may in 2012 2017 was much higher than 2009 2012 supporting information fig s5 resulted in the negative values of soil water consumption from 0 200 cm 2012 2016 supporting information table s4 but all n treatments also consumed 49 2 87 1 mm soil water from the 200 300 cm soil layers despite of the higher precipitation during the late may in 2012 2017 moreover water consumption 200 300 cm at n150 in the dry years was 12 lower than that under n180 in normal years supporting information table s4 these results showed that a substantial proportion of water consumption was derived from the deep soil during grain filling especially in dry years implying that the water consumption from deep soil could be vital for grain yield regression analysis showed that 80 240 cm soil water consumption from jointing to anthesis was linearly correlated with spike number fig 12c d and that from 200 300 cm post anthesis was linearly correlated with yield in both normal and dry years fig 12a b suggesting that the soil water consumptions from the middle and deep soil play an important role in yield formation 4 discussion 4 1 describing year types and matching optimal n input based on the fallow season precipitation is feasible and economical for dryland wheat production on the loess plateau wheat production depends on precipitation as the sole water source because groundwater level is low and there is a lack of irrigation resources ren et al 2019 and as most precipitation occurs during the winter wheat fallow season wheat production depends upon precipitation water stored in the soil during the fallow period as well as that received during the growth period unger et al 2006 he et al 2016 guo et al 2012 in mediterranean regions winter wheat grain yield is positively correlated with precipitation during the growth stages lópez bellido et al 1996 contrastingly in the loess plateau region winter wheat grain yield is highly dependent on fallow season precipitation cao et al 2017 sun et al 2018 as precipitation rates are highly variable accurate grain yield prediction is difficult however fallow season precipitation rates and variations are easy to record guo et al 2012 significant pearson s correlation was observed between fallow season and total annual precipitation in the southeastern loess plateau r 0 83 p 0 01 guo et al 2012 thus a year may be defined as normal wet or dry based on fallow season precipitation and appropriate n application rates may be determined according to this parameter here the 37 year mean annual precipitation was 486 8 mm and the mean fallow season to annual precipitation ratio was 52 with percentages of 35 46 and 19 in dry normal and wet years respectively in the study region we classified these study years as extreme or non extreme types in terms of their fallow season precipitation fig 2 and the reference range used to define specific year types was formulated based on the predominant non extreme years years with fallow precipitation 220 7 mm upper limit were classified as dry those with fallow precipitation 346 2 mm lower limit were rated wet and those with fallow precipitation in the range of 220 7 346 2 mm were considered normal fig 3 this classification system could reasonably predict the year type and help select feasible n fertilization rates based on pre sowing fallow season precipitation which substantially influences wheat grain yield guo et al 2012 cao et al 2017 among the 37 years 8 were considered extreme years i e the probability of extreme years was 21 6 and we have an approximately 80 chance of managing n accurately by fallow season precipitation in these uncontrollable extreme years only conservative n application strategies can be adopted for economic efficiency and agricultural sustainability our 8 year field experiment 2009 2017 classified four dry years and three normal years fig 4 and considered that only 2011 2012 was a wet year which did not reveal much more information about wet years thus we just regarded 2011 2012 as a normal year based on the principle of high yield and low n input results showed that the optimum n application rates were 150 and 180 kg nha 1 in dry and normal years respectively fig 5 while the grain yield with optimal n input was 5 0 and 5 2 higher respectively than that under farmer practice fig 6a compared with the farmer practice n input 205 kg nha 1 supporting information fig s1 the optimal n input rate saved 26 8 and 12 3 n fertilizer input so this approach may be more economical and less risky than smallholder practice management similar results were reported for rainfed agriculture on the loess plateau but the amplitude of the n reduction ratio differed cao et al 2017 guo et al 2012 in that region low precipitation rates dramatically inhibit winter wheat production and high grain yields are usually obtained during years with elevated fallow season precipitation ren et al 2019 the n input recommendations are only practicable for smallholders if the treatment cost is lower than the net profit acquired either by lowering n input or by increasing grain yield lobell 2007 ju et al 2016 accordingly n fertilizer rate optimization incurs low costs especially on the loess plateau in china ju and christie 2011 4 2 soil water storage at sowing varied with the summer rainfall and recommended n input optimized the utilization of soil water storage plants are usually subjected to sustained drought during early spring a critical water consumption stage for vegetative growth in the semi arid and rain fed farming area of loess plateau sun et al 2018 ren et al 2019 jin et al 2007 to address these obstacles several advanced farming practices targeted to improve water availability through retaining precipitation in fallow season have been innovated and applied over the last decades such as conservation tillage either reduced tillage or zero tillage subsoiling and deep plowing chen et al 2009 hou et al 2012 sun et al 2018 however their effects will be directly affected by the amount of summer rainfall this study showed that the soil water storage at sowing increased 217 8 mm in normal years by deep plowing and was significantly higher than that in dry years 87 9 mm table 3 these results indicated that even though we conducted the advanced farming practices to improve water availability in fallow season the soil water storage at sowing also varied with summer rainfall thus the n input strategy needs to match the differences in moisture conditions and fallow season precipitation is the feasible reference for smallholder farmers in the loess plateau the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage revealed that n rates had a significant impact on the utilization of soil water storage in dry and normal years the differential soil water consumption under different n rates took place at different depths during different growth stages compared to farmer practice n210 the optimal n treatment in the normal and dry years n180 and n150 respectively used less soil water storage up to the jointing stage in differential soil layers but more soil water storage was depleted from jointing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity stage figs 8 10 as the optimized n input could reduce water consumption at the early stage of plant development it could provide soil water for consumption increasing productive tiller and grain filling fig 12 leading to higher grain yield fig 6 root growth increases in depth with plant development and follows water availability in soil feng et al 2017 xu et al 2016 which implies that the differential soil water storage observed in soil layers among n rates is a result of the water uptake activity from roots moreover roots in the deep soil play an important role in the uptake of soil water after flowering in wheat li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 compared with that of the optimal n treatment in dry years n150 the higher grain yield with the optimized n input in normal years achieved higher cwp fig 6e the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage were similar between optimal n of dry and normal years figs 8 10 as the grain yield was largely determined by et table 5 the more sensible strategy of water utilization with the optimized n played a key role in the higher grain yield production therefore leading to higher cwp than farmer practice n input fig 6e interestingly comparison of cwp difference between n input rates each year indicated that the maximal cwp could be obtained with optimal n input rate in all dry years but not in normal years table 5 this means that the effects of optimal n levels on cwp are more effective in the low rainfall years 4 3 optimized soil water storage utilization by recommended n input increased the spike number and yield optimized n input could maximize the utilization of soil water storage increasing spike number and grain yield our results showed that soil water storage from fallow season precipitation by wheat was utilized at least until jointing stage fig 7 and optimal n input rate used less soil water storage up to the jointing stage in differential soil layers but more soil water storage was depleted from jointing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity stage figs 8 10 similar results were reported by ren et al 2019 as the jointing and post jointing stage is the key time for more productive tillers and determining the spike number fan et al 2019 song et al 2018 the optimal n input rate can build numerous strong productive tillers by improving adequate soil water storage laying the foundation for high yields sun et al 2018 xue et al 2019 ren et al 2019 notably we found that the high n rate n210 consumed a large amount of soil water before jointing and caused varying degrees of water deficit at maturity stage in several years the soil water storage in 0 300 cm at maturity under optimal n input rate was 2 3 12 1 higher than that under n210 2011 2017 supporting information table s3 this indicated that excessive n application consumed a lot of soil deep water and was not sustainable long term nitrogen over application may leading to the dried soil layers which would hinder and disrupt the water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere system which in turn would have a negative impact on the development of the vegetation li et al 2008 shangguan 2007 thus adjusting the n fertilizer rate in accordance with fallow season precipitation is imperative in the rain fed winter wheat farming systems we expected pfur fallow season precipitation use rate to be the index that directly represented the situation of summer fallow rainfall use and reflected if optimal n input rate can adjust the fallow rainfall utilization by dryland wheat unfortunately our data showed that pfur was 37 1 68 7 in 8 years but was the same among n rates in most years table 5 the main reason was that the soil water storage from summer rainfall d was usually consumed out before crop maturity fig 7 table 5 thus pfur was equal to wse except in 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 in years with total precipitation above 500 mm 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 pfur increased with n input rate but the maximal pfur could not be obtained under optimal n treatment table 5 supporting information fig s3 thus pfur could not provide additional information about the fallow precipitation utilization by wheat nonetheless the proportion of et which contributed from fallow rainfall was 13 8 58 data not showed which implied that water from fallow rainfall played an important role in crop water consumption similar results were reported in the semi arid region of loess plateau regarding the 0 100 cm soil depth deng et al 2010 found that 5 35 crop water consumption comes from fallow rainfall in gansu china while jia et al 2017 reported that 13 8 32 3 crop water consumption comes from fallow rainfall in four experiment sites in gansu the upper limit of our conclusion may be higher than these values owing to the deeper soil water layers 0 300 cm than those in previous studies further research needs to accurately measure soil evaporation and crop transpiration and clarify the fallow precipitation utilization by wheat peng et al 2020 or follow isotope tracer techniques from a macroscopic perspective previous research directly calculated the yield increase by amount of soil water at sowing nielsen et al 2005 calculated a wheat yield response of 9 5 kg ha 1 for every mm of stored soil water for kansas usa in colorado usa wheat yields increased by around 4 kg ha 1 for every mm of soil water at sowing in dry years while in average and wet years this increase was 14 kg ha 1 nielsen et al 2005 it could be expected that rainfall stored in the soil prior to sowing would be less important for the productivity of winter crops grown in environments where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year or where winter rainfall dominates however kirkegaard et al 2001 reported a yield response of 18 kg ha 1 per mm of available soil water at sowing for wheat grown in southern new south wales australia where rainfall is strongly seasonal similarly in mediterranean type environments of southern australia increased yield potential has been reported as 6 8 kg ha 1 for each additional mm stored soil water at sowing french 1978 sadras 2002 similar results have been found in arid and semi arid areas of the loess plateau where cao et al 2017 reported a yield response of 3 89 11 89 kg ha 1 per mm of fallow rainfall with fallow rainfall between 300 500 mm our results showed that soil water storage during fallow season d response of 0 7 mm per mm of fallow season precipitation supporting information fig s4a and average grain yield increased 6 1 kg ha 1 for each additional mm stored soil water at sowing supporting information fig s4b these results indicated that the water utilization by wheat from soil water storage from fallow season precipitation is vital for wheat productivity in arid and semi arid region 4 4 improving the capacity of fallow season precipitation storage and matching n input is essential for dry land wheat production admittedly our year classification method had some flaws the criterion of year classification based on fallow season precipitation could not reflect the soil water condition during the growing season thus dry year in our criterion system may have a large amount of growing season precipitation among our experiment years 2016 2017 was rated as dry year owing to the limited fallow season rainfall 153 3 mm but the growing season precipitation was sufficient 253 mm table 1 contrastingly 2010 2011 was a normal year that had sufficient fallow precipitation 325 5 mm and low growing season precipitation 126 6 mm table 1 interestingly total precipitation in those years was 452 1 and 406 3 mm with less than 50 mm difference table 1 but the difference of soil water storage at sowing was over 100 mm 506 1 and 393 3 mm in 2010 2011 and 2016 2017 respectively table 3 our results showed that the mean spike number and grain number per spike in 2010 2011 was higher than that in 2016 2017 but the mean thousand grain weight was lower in 2010 2011 than 2016 2017 supporting information table s2 and the mean yield in 2010 2011 was 21 5 higher than that in 2016 2017 supporting information table s1 thus we presume that drought at sowing effects are more adverse to yield than those of drought in growing season because the water stress at sowing will reduce the seeding emergence rate and further affect the spike number which is not conducive to the establishment of a high quality wheat population and forming yield however although the drought in growing season will adversely affect the grain yield this soil water stress may be alleviated by deep soil water usage by deep roots feng et al 2017 xu et al 2016 hence improving the capacity of fallow season precipitation storage especially deep soil water storage by matching n input to optimize soil water storage utilization adjusting and controlling the spike number for higher yield is vital for dry land wheat production 5 conclusion a reference range was built to define wheat cultivation years as dry normal or wet based on fallow season precipitation rates over 37 years 1981 2017 eight experimental years 2009 2017 were classified into dry and normal years four of each the field results show that the optimum n application rates was 150 and 180 kg nha 1 in dry and normal years respectively compared to surveyed farmers n application rate these optimum n inputs saved 26 8 and 12 3 n fertilizer increased grain yield by 5 0 and 5 2 and improved cwp by 6 1 and 8 5 in dry and normal years respectively the optimized n inputs could reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage and increase the amount of soil water available for grain yield production regarding spatio temporal dynamics soil water depletion occurred from deeper soil layers with crop development and soil water storage at the 80 240 and 200 300 cm soil depths played an important role in improving spike number and grain filling respectively furthermore the soil water conservation treatment could not change the fact that the soil water storage at sowing varies with summer rainfall and that drought at sowing has more adverse effect on yield than drought in the growing season thus small holders need to adjust n inputs based on the fallow season precipitation to improve yield and
