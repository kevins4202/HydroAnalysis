10320,the simulation of stored water in various parts of fruit trees under drought stress could be described in detail by the application of mathematical modeling under drought stress tissue water storage provides information on water status water demand pattern and water regulation capacity by each part of the tree in the present study the potted peach prunus persica l batsch tree was used as the test material and the water operation model of each part of the tree was constructed based on the resistance capacitance rc model by analyzing transpiration rate water potential and stored water during a drying cycle we found that the water potential in different organs of the potted peach trees were all decreased with the increase in transpiration rate but showing an opposite trend to the transpiration in the daytime the stored water flowed out from various tissues and at night the water runs into the tissues via root absorption with the worsening of drought the regulation capacity of tissue water storage kept decreasing there was a big difference in the trend of water storage change among different parts the difference also existed in the amount of tissue stored water entering the transpiration and the amount of water absorption at night among different parts with an adequate soil water supply the water storage change of trunk including the main root accounted for 42 3 of the total water storage change followed by 20 6 15 4 15 3 and 6 7 by the root system fruits branches and leaves respectively this difference was a result of cooperative actions of both water storage resistance and capacity estimated the total of absorbed water of tissue at night were approximately 10 of the daily total transpiration and it could go above 20 for severely dry soil keywords peach water storage water potential drought transpiration 1 introduction in depth studies on the water operation and drought tolerance mechanisms and improving water use efficiency of crops have become urgent challenges that need to be addressed in the current agricultural development moriana et al 2012 in the past the resistance models of water transport were generally used to depict the movement of sap flow in plants garcía tejera et al 2017 with the persistent research it was found that the water storage in plants especially woody plants played an essential role in water operation and in improving the drought tolerance inside the plants huang et al 2017 kumagai 2001 vergeynst et al 2015 previously researchers mainly studied the regulation of stored water to forest trees and there were few foci on fruit trees these research works were mainly concern the trunk stored water kumagai 2001 kravka et al 1999 stratton et al 2000 hardly there were modeling the changes of stored water in the root system and fruits gao et al 2019 actually for fruit trees the changes of stored water in the plants especially the status of stored water in the fruits have a direct influence the fruit weight and quality iwasaki et al 2019 in this paper the peach prunus persica l batsch tree was used as the study material by constructing the resistance capacitance rc circuit model of water transport the dynamic changes of water storage of different parts of the peach tree roots trunks branches fruits and leaves under drought stress were systematically simulated targeting the aim for providing a new theoretical reference for water physiology research and water saving irrigation of fruit trees 2 materials and methods this study was carried out in the experimental farm of beijing vocational college of agriculture 116 21 n 39 69 e china in 2018 the experimental material was five year old peach trees planted in pots p persica var nectarina maxim the experiments were set up in single plant plots with 50 replicates having favorable soil water and nutrient conditions as well as consistent cultivation management measures the sizes of canopies and bottom stems of the replicates were roughly the same before the experiments all potted peach trees were well irrigated and then the drought cycle was implement from may 22 to june 10 in 1018 after full irrigation each pot was wrapped with silver reflective film to prevent the loss of water in the pot at the same time rain shelter was built to prevent the influence of rainfall to the experimental in the middle and early ripening stages late may and early june the leaves branches fruits trunks including the main roots and root systems of the peach trees were sampled three times to determine the p v pressure volume curves and time constants of various tissues the water content of each part were calculated by the p v curves hunt et al 1987 where the water contents of the trunks and branches were substituted by the water contents of the main branches three years old and the water contents of the main roots were substituted by those of the lateral roots the water storage resistance was determined by water content and time constant nobel and jordan 1983 the sap flow was measured with a heat pulse sap flow meter probe12 dynamax dauzat et al 2001 and the sap flow changes of all 50 trees were calculated of which the results of 30 trees with the same size and regular variation were used to calculate the daily sap flow variations the main roots ψrs and the leaves ψl water potentials were measured by the water potential meter schollander from may 22 to june 10 when measuring the trunk water potential first the branches at the base of the trunk were wrapped with plastic for 2 h then ψl of the leaves was measured to substitute the trunk water potential abrisqueta et al 2015 simonin et al 2015 the radial root water potential was measured by water potential meter and the ψrs was substituted by radial root water potential which was connected the main root the water potential of root systems was substituted by ψrs 2 hunt and nobel 1987 nobel and jordan 1983 the canopy transpiration rate tr was simulated by the p m equation which modified by caspari et al 1993 the stomatal conductance gst was simulated by the empirical equation proposed by jarvis 1976 the flow rate q of stored water per unit volume of each part was hunt and nobel 1987 lhomme et al 2001 1 q j c j d ψ j d t 2 ψ j e j 1 e t r j c j where ψj is the water potential of the part j qj is the storage or de storage water flow of part j cj is the hydraulic capacitance at the part j ej is the difference of water potential from the soil to part j t is the time that the water potential varied and rj is the resistance of stored water at the part j limited by the performance of the instrument it was difficult to accurately measure the water absorption at night therefore we assumed it the same as the water running and stored into each part furthermore we calculated the percentage of stored water changes of each part at different times of the day in the total sap flow at the same time the dry weight of each part of these 30 trees was measured the dry weights and the samples for p v curves were used to estimate the saturated water content of each part 3 results 3 1 transpiration rate simulation the rate of canopy transpiration tr of potted peach tree exhibited a sinusoidal like pattern during a day 24 h with a peak before noon and slightly fluctuation at noon presumably related to the noon break phenomenon of stoma fig 1 when the soil water potential decreased tr decreased accordingly when the ψsoil soil water potential dropped to 2 0 mpa the daily transpiration was less than 20 of the initial value later tr declined even more severely mainly for the sharp decrease of the severe soil drought fig 1 at the same time the lower the soil water potential the earlier the peak of tr and the more significant the noon break phenomenon and the decrease of tr in the afternoon it can be seen from fig 2 that the soil water potential did not change much in the early stage of water control but was decreased rapidly with the loss of water in the later stage this is related to the characteristic curve of soil moisture that the soil water potential is determined by soil moisture content when the water content is reduced the soil water potential decreases rapidly as the water content decreases 3 2 simulating changes of water potential in different parts it can be seen from fig 2 that during a day the tissue water potentials of various parts of the peach tree were all decreased with the increase of transpiration and were increased with the decrease of transpiration changing oppositely with respect to transpiration however large variations were seen among different tissues the water potential changed most dramatically in leaves due to their small storage resistance while the changes in trunks and root systems were smaller and the changes in fruits were the smallest these differences were caused by different water storage resistance in various parts the tissue water potentials of various parts of the peach tree were also decreased when the soil drought is serious and the diurnal variation kept decreasing this is related to the decline of transpiration rate because the water potential difference is calculated by the transpiration rate and water transport resistance the recharge and discharge flux in tissue water storage were caused by water potential changes and the change range became narrower as the water potential difference became smaller under actual drought the hydraulic resistance from the soil to roots kept increasing with the drought ongoing and the variations of tissue water potential were also increased with the increase of the drought due to the elevated root hydraulic resistance it was highly likely that the range of changes in stored water under actual drought was larger than simulation that is as the drought worsened the capacity to adjust the tissue water storage also evolved in addition the tissue water potential was decreased under drought stress and its water absorption capacity at night was stronger than under normal circumstances 3 3 simulating change of stored water in different parts as shown in fig 3 the stored water flowed out of various tissues during the day negative values indicate flowing out of the tissues and at night it went to the tissues via root absorbed water as the drought worsening the amount of tissue stored water that flowed in and out would decrease gradually about 10 o clock the discharge flux of tissue water reached the peak very soon then dropped rapidly and reached an equilibrium around sunset the variations of stored water in various parts behaved very differently the stored water in leaf tissues fluctuated closely following the transpiration fluctuation because of the small storage resistance neither were the peak times of the stored water outflow in various parts the same the water outflow peak time of the leaves branches and roots trunk and fruits were around 8 00 9 30 10 30 and 12 30 am respectively nevertheless the peak time for water absorption at night was approximately the same roughly around 7 30 pm there were also big differences in the capacities of stored water entering transpiration as well as water absorption at night among various tissues with an adequate soil water supply the trunk including the main root could account for at most 42 3 of the total water storage change followed by the root system 20 6 fruits 15 4 branches 15 3 and leaves 6 7 this difference was a result of cooperative actions of water storage capacity and storage resistance when the soil water supply was sufficient the total absorbed water at night accounted for approximately 10 of the daily total sap flow and it could be more than 20 of the total sap flow given severely dry soil it indicated that the tissue absorption at night could effectively improve the water supply capacity during the day and regulate the plant physiological processes 3 4 model test in the process of drought stress the simulated values of transpiration of potted peach trees were consistent with the measured values r 0 8627 trend of daily transpiration was basically the same but the simulated values were slightly higher under moderate stress fig 4 it thus indicating that the proposed model could accurately simulate the transpiration dynamics under various soil moisture conditions however the daily maximal measured transpiration generally appeared around 11 00 am about 2 h earlier than the simulated values and the noon break was more obvious fig 4 too which may be caused by the water storage regulation of the tree it can be seen from figs 5 and 6 that under progressive drought stress the simulated and measured values of both ψleaf and ψsoil matched with correlation coefficients of rleaf 0 9263 and rsoil 0 9263 it indicated that the tissue water storage of potted peach trees and the tissue water exchange could be calculated by the proposed model although the changes in simulated ψleaf were consistent with the measured changes the actual ψleaf were lower than the simulated values in the late stage fig 5 presumably it was because the resistance of the roots to water absorption was increasing as the drought worsened however we did not take it into account 4 discussion on the basis of previous research gao et al 2019 this study added a soil water limitation into the model to simulate the dynamic changes of the flux water within potted peach trees under drought stress most spac soil plant atmosphere continuum models do not consider water storage influence on transpiration green et al 2006 however for woody plants they absorb water in the night and store it in the roots branches and trunks and release it for leaf transpiration during the day this mechanism is essential for regulating the dynamics of transpiration green et al 1989 found that 20 of the kiwi leaf transpiration came from the nighttime water absorption by roots previous studies have shown that during rapid transpiration or under dry conditions the xylem conduits displayed a cavitation phenomenon irvine et al 1998 which could increase the resistance of water transport and reduce the transpiration rate by regulating tissue water storage the occurrence of cavitation may be relieved our simulation results showed that the water storage adjustment of potted peach trees could account for 9 7 of the daily total transpiration while the adjustment was more significant under dry conditions and could exceed 20 of the daily total transpiration nevertheless we did not consider the changes of the flow resistance during water operation under drought stress which might reduce the transpiration rate of the leaves numerical simulations showed that the more severe the drought stress the smaller the amount of water regulated by the water storage but the greater the relative ratio to the transpiration fig 3 the amount of water regulated by peach trees at different times of the day was different as well mainly caused by differences in water potential and sap flow the relative water regulation capacity among different parts was significantly different too with the largest for the trunk followed by roots and branches and the smallest for leaves and this is determined by the water content storage resistance and volume waring et al 1979 showed that 30 50 of daily transpiration of scots pines came from the tree trunk water storage according to loustau et al 1996 with worsened drought the proportion of trunk water storage to total transpiration could be increased from 12 to 25 this finding is similar to the conclusion of our study in addition some researchers thought that different types of plants had different uses for water storage while the effect of water storage was not significant for smaller plants carlson and lynn 1991 in the past researchers usually used the p v curves of leaves to compare the water regulation capacities under different conditions or of different plants lenz et al 2006 from the above analysis we could see that the regulation capacity of the water storage of the leaves was even less than 5 of the total water storage regulation therefore the above mentioned method was not actually scientific the present study was conducted only with pot experiments and did not include field verification so it needs to be further improved by carrying out experiments at field level leaf water potential is the best indicator to characterize the water status of the plant santesteban et al 2019 at noon the potential transpiration of the plant is the highest and the leaves are under the most severe water stress loveys et al 2008 therefore the leaf water potential at noon could better elucidate the water status of the plant by simulating and measuring the water potential of pot peach leaves at noon under drought stress it was found that with a sufficient water supply at the early stage or when drought stress just started the leaf water potential at noon did not vary widely however under later severe drought stress the leaf water potential dropped sharply fig 5 previous studies have also shown that a proper water control had little effects on the growth of fruit trees gucci et al 2019 and could promote the increase of the flower buds and the improvement of fruit quality to a certain extent intrigliolo and castel 2010 abrisqueta et al 2008 found that a proper drought treatment could limit the root system of peach trees and post harvest water saving treatment had a less impact on peach fruits than pre harvest treatment the study conducted by gasque et al 2016 on citrus also demonstrated that under appropriate drought conditions ψsoil 2 mpa water saving irrigation had no significant effect on fruit yield or quality our study systematically monitored the water status and the regulation capacities of water storage of various parts of the peach tree under progressive drought stress and provided a new theoretical reference for deeper understanding of the drought resistance mechanism and water saving irrigation of fruit trees 5 conclusions the proposed model in the paper can be used to simulate the dynamic changes of stored water in various parts of peach trees under drought stress this model uses simple parameters which can be measured by conventional physiological instruments and it can be conveniently used for the study of tissue water storage of other fruit trees under drought conditions too in the daytime the tissue water potential of potted peach trees decreased with the increase of transpiration changing oppositely with respect to the transpiration however with gradually worsened drought the tissue water potential also declined and the daily variation range was narrowed accordingly there were large differences in the capacities of tissue water storage to regulate the transpiration in different parts of peach trees with the trunks including the root systems the most capable one followed by the root systems fruits branches and leaves the regulation capacity of tissue water storage was increased with the worsening of soil drought which was around 10 with moist soil and could be more than 20 with severe

10321,understanding the evolution characteristics of regional drought is crucial to the sustainable development of ecology and social economy especially in typical water limited area however the exploring the spatial temporal dynamics of agricultural drought in the loess plateau lp under global warming and regional vegetation restoration project is still insufficient and its potential causes remain unresolved to this end in this study the standardized soil moisture index ssmi was constructed based on the root soil moisture data of the global land data assimilation system and their suitability in monitoring agricultural drought in the lp was evaluated in addition it is proposed to describe the spatial temporal dynamics of agricultural drought with the migration of drought centroid and to further analyze the influencing factors of agricultural drought results show that 1 the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the lp is approximately 9 months mainly with existence of moderate drought and drought coverage nearly 10 25 and the probability of exceptionally drought in a short time is low 2 from 1982 to 2015 the spatial distribution of drought frequency in the lp gradually increased from southeast to northwest and the agricultural drought in the northwest has the characteristics of frequent occurrence short duration and weak intensity with no significant trend of longer duration and weaker intensity 3 among the 7 droughts screened out by the drought migration model the migration direction of drought centroids are mainly east west concentrated in the middle of the lp in the early and late stage of drought drought migration trends to have a longer path and faster speed while in the middle it is shorter and denser 4 significant increasing precipitation p 0 01 in the lp has not alleviated agricultural drought whereas significant increasing temperature p 0 01 is the direct factor inducing agricultural drought and the implementation of vegetation restoration project further aggravates the risk of agricultural drought this study not only provides scientific guidance for agricultural drought early warning prevention and mitigation of drought losses in the lp from the perspective of time and space but also offers a valuable reference for understanding the impact of large scale vegetation restoration projects keywords agriculture drought gldas standardized soil moisture index climate change spatial temporal dynamics 1 introduction drought has a direct impact on china s food security and social stability especially the frequent occurrence of drought under the changing environment which brings great challenges to china s sustainable economic and social development and ecological health zhao et al 2011 hao et al 2012 jiang et al 2019 guo et al 2019 from 1990 to 2014 the annual average grain loss caused by drought in china reached 25 9 billion kg ministry of water resources 2014 which was close to the annual demand of 60 million people qin et al 2015 the summer drought in china in 2011 alone affected more than 30 million people and caused an economic loss of about 2 4 billion us dollars yuan et al 2015 although it is very important to monitor and understand agricultural drought to reduce the loss and impact of disasters people know little about it agricultural drought is the imbalance of water supply and demand which hinders the normal growth of crops due to the lack of soil moisture during the growth of crops crow et al 2012 among many agricultural drought evaluation indexes the standardized soil moisture index ssmi can sensitively reflect the dynamic balance of precipitation groundwater supply and evapotranspiration and has the advantages of simple calculation and considering the characteristics of data distribution zhou et al 2019 based on the historical time series data mishra et al 2015 used standardized soil moisture index to analyze the local scale agricultural drought in detail by combining soil moisture data from satellite and land surface model the ssmi developed by xu et al 2018 has been verified to be effective and sensitive to detecting agricultural drought over large areas although soil moisture is the main variable to define and identify agricultural drought the surface soil moisture is sensitive to the impact of temperature and precipitation and can t effectively identify drought events especially in arid areas in recent years soil moisture data provided by the global land data assimilation system gldas based on satellite land surface model and ground observation data jointly released by nasa and noaa have been widely used in the world syed et al 2008 chen et al 2013 long et al 2015 khan et al 2018 more importantly the gldas data capture soil moisture anomalies and their variability taking into account regional and seasonal dependences showing correspondence with other proxies used to characterize soil states these results are believed to support the use of gldas as an indicator of soil moisture status and can be used to develop new soil moisture monitoring indicators spennemann et al 2015 in addition the soil moisture data provided by gldas includes 4 depth layers and 0 100 cm soil layer is the most effective part of soil moisture in the root zone of vegetation in general the water required by the crop is supplied to the crop by the soil moisture in the root zone martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 moreover the surface soil moisture is seriously disturbed by precipitation and temperature which cannot accurately reflect the state of deep soil moisture thereby the root soil moisture data is more suitable for agricultural drought monitoring than that of a fixed depth mishra et al 2015 more importantly drought is not only a complex natural phenomenon but a regional phenomenon often covering large areas world meteorological organization wmo 2006 describing the spatial evolution of drought path direction etc not only helps to gain knowledge about its drivers and processes but also further improves the way drought is monitored thereby reducing its impact diaz et al 2019 however the current research on the spatial evolution of drought mainly focuses on meteorological drought for instance the spatial drought tracking algorithm s track proposed by diaz et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 proposed a method to study meteorological drought migration based on topological spatial relations although the two methods are widely used in large scale and small watershed analysis they are often limited by parameter and conditional assumptions therefore we propose the concept of unconditional hypothesis and nonparametric drought migration centroid to characterize the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of agricultural drought attributes the spatiotemporal dynamics of agricultural drought is characterized by the track path direction and speed of gravity migration in order to further understand the dynamic evolution of agricultural drought the loess plateau lp is the transition zone from semi humid climate area to semi arid and arid climate area it is also the most important agricultural production area in northwest china however the frequent occurrence of drought in the region especially the frequent extreme climate events caused by global climate change increases the risk of natural disasters and has a more serious impact on the ecological environment and agricultural production further the revegetation plan implemented in china since 1999 is the largest ecological restoration plan in a developing country feng et al 2016 only in 2018 china completed 7 07 million hectares of afforestation and the lp accounted for about 40 of the total area of afforestation office of the national greening committee 2019 at the same time a large number of studies zhang et al 2006 zheng et al 2019 have shown that large scale revegetation measures in the lp have significantly changed the surface material and energy balance such as erosion sediment significantly reduced watershed water production decreased soil drying intensified and regional climate change meanwhile climate change and land use conversion may change the water cycle system of the whole region thus complicating the situation of drought cui et al 2018 chen et al 2020 wu et al 2020 furthermore the study of drought on the lp is mainly concerned with meteorology and hydrology liu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 shi et al 2020 and only focuses on a single catchment area in the region zhao et al 2014 therefore there may be a lack of important drought information based on these a comprehensive analysis of the main factors affecting agricultural drought is essential to ensure food security and drought early warning the main purpose of this study is to explore the spatial temporal evolution characteristics of agricultural drought to explore the main factors affecting agricultural drought dynamics 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the lp is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river basin the plateau is the most concentrated and largest loess area on the earth covering an area of about 640 000 km2 spanning seven provinces autonomous regions of china fig 1 huang et al 2020 the region is named because of the loess transported from the northwestern gobi desert by wind and mainly deposited in the lp with the depth exceeding 50 m since the early quaternary fang et al 2019 surrounded by the qinling mountain helan mountains yinshan mountain and taihang mountain in the south west north and east respectively the plateau region has a warm or temperate continental monsoon climate with mean annual temperature ranging from 4 to 14 c and mean annual precipitation ranging from 200 mm in the northwest to 800 mm in the southeast su and fu 2013 over the past decades the lp has been facing a series of ecological and environmental problems such as desertification soil erosion runoff reduction and so on chen et al 2015 in response to these eco environmental problems the chinese government launched a series of scientific programs in the 1980s and the well known grain for green project or vegetation restoration project largely contributed to maintaining soil and water conservation fu et al 2017 in 1999 intensive vegetation restoration and project construction plan were implemented in the lp wang et al 2011 2 2 gldas data gldas products include forcing data e g precipitation near surface air temperature downward shortwave and longwave radiation specific humidity wind speed and surface pressure land surface states e g soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff flux data e g evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux and available online http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings in this study gldas version 1 noah land surface model product gldas noah10 m from 1979 to 2015 was used including precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and four layers of soil moisture including 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm with spatial and temporal resolutions of 1 0 and month respectively 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index and crop damage area we used gridded monthly ndvi from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms the gimms dataset tucker et al 2005 compiles ndvi images acquired by the advanced very higher solution radiometer avhrr sensor aboard national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa satellites the dataset provides a long term global data set with a monthly value at 1 12 1 12 spatial resolution 1982 2016 moreover we acquired 1 0 grid values of ndvi in the lp 1982 2015 by bilinear interpolation which were consistent with the time and spatial distribution of gldas the annual data of crop damage area 1982 2015 can be obtained from the ministry agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2 4 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the global spei database offers long time robust information on the drought conditions at the global scale with a 0 5 spatial resolution and a monthly time resolution the spei expresses as a standardized variate mean zero and unit variance the deviations of the current climatic balance precipitation minus evapotranspiration potential with respect to the long term balance calculation of the evapotranspiration potential in speibase is based on the fao 56 penman monteith method for a detailed introduction to spei see vicente serrano et al 2010 and beguería et al 2014 moreover we obtained the 1 0 grid value of spei in lp using bilinear interpolation method 3 methods 3 1 standardized soil moisture index the ssmi was estimated as a standardized anomaly in remotely sensed soil moisture for 1982 2015 we used root soil moisture from the gldas to calculate ssmi to characterize agriculture drought 1 s s m i i j s m i j s m j σ j where i is year ranging from 1982 to 2015 j is month ranging from january to december and s m j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of soil moisture in month j respectively the ssmi is a dimensionless quantity used to detect drought events table 1 detailed grading can be found in zhao et al 2017 3 2 drought frequency drought frequency df can be defined as the number of occurrences of drought event exceeding a certain threshold per unit time blenkinsop and fowler 2007 spinoni et al 2013 we expressed df on a yearly scale given by the total number of qualifying drought events ssmi 0 8 divided by the total number years as 2 f r m n where n is the number of years considered in this study and m is the number of drought events with ssmi 0 8 3 3 drought coverage drought coverage dc is defined as the extent of drought occurring in the study area in a certain period of time in this study we use a 1 0 grid to represent the scope of the study area the ratio of the number of grids to the total number of droughts in the current month is used to express 3 d c m t d 100 where m represents the number of grids in which drought occurred during the month and td represents the total number of grids in the lp the larger the dc value is the larger the drought area is besides the range of drought coverage is shown in table 2 3 4 wavelet transformation wavelet analysis can give information about the time evolution of the spectral properties of a quantity its use is now becoming increasingly more common in climatology oh et al 2003 wavelet transform can be described as labat 2008 4 c a τ 1 a f t ψ t τ a d t where c a τ is the wavelet coefficient as a function of time scale a and time shift τ f t is the original function of time t ψ is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function ψ which roles as the convolution kernel wavelet is a group of functions that can be real or complex wavelet selection depends on the characteristics of the original time series c a τ represents the conditional correlation between the wavelet function ψ and time signal series f t 3 5 drought migration model the application of centroid to study the migration of matter and energy is an important method in the study of geological distribution moshe and friedman 1976 the centroid can represent the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the elements and the distance of centroid moving reflects the spatial difference of the change amplitude of the elements therefore in this study we proposed to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural drought by using the migration of drought centroid the drought migration model includes the following four steps 1 identify complete drought events 2 screening of the grid 3 determining the location of the drought centroid 4 connecting centroids step 1 identify complete drought events on the time scale the mean ssmi of the study area is less than or equal to the threshold to determine whether drought occurs in the current month besides identify the drought events which lasted more than 3 months in a row because the migration change of a drought event can be recorded completely step 2 screening of the grid on the spatial scale because every 1 0 grid in the study area recorded the current month s ssmi information when the ssmi is below or equal to the selected threshold 1 is used to indicate that the grid is in drought otherwise the value of 0 is used eq 5 further screen out the grid that represents the drought in the current month 5 d s t 0 i f s s m i 0 8 1 i f s s m i 0 8 where ds is the drought state i e drought or not drought and formula 1 is applied to each grid of each month t step 3 determining the location of the drought centroid the area of drought is determined by a grid assigned a value of 1 at the same time in order to consider the different weight of ssmi information recorded by each drought grid the centroid was used to represent the geometric center of the drought event in the month eq 6 6 x y x i 1 n p i x i i 1 n p i y i 1 n p i y i i 1 n p i where x and y respectively represent the longitude and latitude of the agricultural drought centroid in the study area x i and y i respectively represent the longitude and latitude of the i th grid center p i represents the ssmi of the i th grid step 4 connecting centroids by connecting centroids of drought event the track path length direction and velocity characteristics of the drought event can be completely recorded 4 results 4 1 identification and variation characteristics of agriculture drought fig 2 shows that there were several agriculture droughts in the lp from 1982 to 2015 and the duration and intensity of the droughts were generally severe after 2000 the agriculture drought in the lp was less than that before 2000 but the occurrence frequency was increased the droughts in 1987 1998 and 2007 were particularly severe which was consistent with the research results of sun and ma 2015 in addition we calculated the damage area of crops in shaanxi shanxi province and ningxia autonomous region and found that in the year of agricultural drought the damage area of crops had an obvious upward trend furthermore we compared the annual mean value of ssmi with the disaster area and found that the correlation was 0 42 p 0 05 indicating that ssmi can capture the change of agricultural drought in lp meanwhile to further verify the reliability of ssmi we compare it with spei 1 2 24 are compared respectively it was found that the pearson correlation between ssmi and spei 9 was the highest reaching 0 6 indicating that the response time of agricultural in the lp to meteorological drought is approximately 9 months this was consistent with the response time of hydrological drought in the southwest and east of the lp to meteorological drought from 6 to 12 months huang et al 2017 the reliability that ssmi can identify agricultural drought in lp is further verified 4 2 temporal evolution characteristics of agricultural drought in the loess plateau 4 2 1 the seasonal evolution of agricultural drought on the seasonal scale the ssmi of the lp shows obvious seasonal characteristics fig 3 the soil moisture in autumn and winter is always in a deficit state especially in winter the soil moisture is the lowest compared with other seasons it can be found from the seasonal scale of each year that when there is drought in autumn the winter and spring of the next year are also mostly dry periods besides there is no significant decline trend of soil moisture in all seasons and the decline range in summer and autumn is evidently smaller than that in other seasons indicating that agricultural drought in the lp is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn furthermore the soil moisture in summer is more abundant than that in other seasons because the rainy season of the lp is mainly concentrated in june to september however the increase of precipitation in summer and autumn didn t increase soil moisture but showed an obvious downward trend indicating that there were other factors besides precipitation that affected agricultural drought 4 2 2 evolution of drought coverage it can be seen from the change of dc under different agricultural drought that moderate drought is the main drought in the lp and dc is mainly concentrated in about 10 25 fig 4 the exceptionally droughts that broke out in 1988 1992 and 1998 covered a wider area and had more severe consequences after entering the 21st century the number of droughts in the lp has increased significantly mainly concentrated in moderate drought and other levels of drought decreased in addition except for the drought in 1998 the different levels of drought have obvious progressive trend in time the results show that the agricultural drought in the lp is gradually evolved from moderate drought and the probability of sudden exceptionally drought in a short time is low this provides a long time for early warning and prevention from the beginning of drought to the time before it becomes exceptionally drought which helps to reduce the harm of drought 4 2 3 cyclical evolution characteristics of agricultural drought the variation of soil moisture often shows the vibration characteristics of multi frequency and quasi period aghakouchak 2014 therefore the characteristics of soil moisture change on time scale can be analyzed by wavelet transformation fig 5 the agricultural drought in the lp has 9 alternations of high and low in the scale of 50 80 months the oscillation in the whole series is divided into two stages the period from 1982 to 1999 is about 50 months and the period after 2000 is obviously increased in 1987 1992 1995 1998 2002 and 2007 the lp experienced severe agricultural drought especially the drought around 1987 which was obviously stronger than the drought in other periods in terms of duration and intensity meanwhile according to the abundant shock formed from 2011 to 2015 the ssmi after 2015 will enter dry shock and the risk of agricultural drought will increase 4 3 spatial evolution characteristics of agricultural drought in the loess plateau 4 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of drought frequency it can be seen from fig 6a that the spatial distribution of df in the lp gradually increased from southeast to northwest during 1982 2015 the df is the highest near the two irrigation areas reaching once a year which is consistent with the conclusions of many related studies zhang et al 2012 as hetao irrigation and ningxia irrigation area are the main grain producing areas in the lp which may cause great damage to agricultural production besides it can be found from the seasonal characteristics of drought outbreak fig 6b that drought mainly occurs in summer and the least in winter which is similar to the seasonal characteristics of drought outbreak in north china feng et al 2016 on the seasonal scale the outbreak of drought mainly occurred in the northwest of the lp with the increase of latitude the df decreased in spring but in winter it was the opposite as the latitudes rise and precipitation decreases significantly the onset of the rainy season is delayed moreover due to underlying surface factors water and heat redistribution tends to make regional drought difference obvious which showing its spatial heterogeneity 4 3 2 spatial evolution characteristics of agricultural drought seven drought events were screened out from 1982 to 2015 by the drought migration model these include three exceptionally droughts in 1986 1991 and 1996 three extremely droughts in 2001 2006 and 2015 and a severe drought in 2002 fig 7 in terms of the migration direction of drought centroids the seven droughts were mainly concentrated in the middle of the lp and the migration direction is along the east west direction in the migration path the seven droughts have a long path at the beginning of the formation and the end of the drought while in the middle of the drought the path is relatively short and dense moreover since drought migration is on the monthly scale the longer the migration path is the faster the migration at the beginning and the end of the drought period because of the increase and decrease of ssmi there is often more rapid migration speed in the middle of the drought period ssmi reaches the peak and the migration speed slows down obviously in addition it can be found in fig 7 that among the droughts with a long duration droughts usually reach the most serious situation in winter and spring and begin to lighten and disappear with the coming of rainy season in the next summer 4 3 3 evolution characteristics of agricultural drought duration and intensity furthermore we use drought intensity and drought duration to quantitatively characterize and evaluate the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of drought fig 8 in the 34 years from 1982 to 2015 the agricultural drought in the lp lasted for 87 2 97 8 months the areas with higher duration are mainly in the east west and middle of the lp while the areas with the highest df are in the northwest with shorter duration fig 8a fig 8b shows the spatial variation trend of drought duration in 1982 2015 the drought duration of the lp has a significant decreasing trend in the northeast but not a significant increasing trend in the whole fig 8c shows the intensity of drought in the study period indicating that the drought in the lp is relatively serious and involves a wide range drought intensity is relatively low in the central and northwestern parts of the lp compared with the duration of drought the spatial variation of drought intensity is obviously different fig 8d there is a slight increasing trend in the west and northwest and a decreasing trend in the northeast and south especially in the northwest where drought occurs frequently the trend of drought intensity decreasing is the biggest in general drought events occurred frequently in the past 34 years in the lp and experienced a long term strong agricultural drought the agricultural drought in northwest china has the characteristics of frequent occurrence short duration and weak intensity and it is accompanied by the trend of increasing duration and decreasing intensity it is important that with the impact of global warming the drought disasters in these drought prone areas may become more and more serious 4 4 main factors affecting agricultural drought in the loess plateau to study the spatial effects of various factors on agricultural drought more reasonably further analysis will be made on the monthly and annual scales fig 9 shows the spatial correlation distribution of the factors in monthly scale and annual scale with ssmi on the monthly scale fig 9a precipitation and evaporation are positively correlated with ssmi and the highest correlation in the northwest of the lp is 0 4 r 0 45 p 0 01 on the contrary ndvi and temperature were negatively correlated with ssmi on the whole except for the positive correlation between ndvi and ssmi in the northwest of lp in addition the negative correlation between air temperature and ndvi in the middle was 0 05 r 0 03 the results show that each factor has an effect on agricultural drought on the monthly scale and there are significant spatial differences compared with the monthly scale each factor and ssmi have similar spatial distribution on the annual scale but the correlation is more obvious fig 9b the correlation of evapotranspiration showed negative correlation in the middle temperature in most areas showed a significant negative correlation of 0 7 r 0 5 p 0 01 the significant negative correlation between ndvi and ssmi was 0 7 r 0 5 in the central region while there is no significant positive correlation was found in the northern region it is worth noting that the main area of the vegetation restoration project of the lp is located in the middle of the region the rapid increase of vegetation coverage undoubtedly intensifies the consumption of local water resources and the increase of temperature not only promotes the rapid growth of vegetation but increases the evapotranspiration resulting in the reduction of soil moisture and the intensification of agricultural drought it is further indicated that the influence of various factors on agricultural drought is more obvious on the annual scale 5 discussion due to the soil moisture plays an important role for drought research in the absence of nationwide long term consistent soil moisture observations at any scale assimilation data product is a useful alternative in the research related to soil moisture gldas products have good performance in tibet plateau chen et al 2013 and northeast asia cho et al 2015 especially liu 2018 used the observation data of soil moisture of meteorological stations in the lp from 2008 to 2014 and compared with a variety of assimilated products and found that gldas can better simulate the soil moisture characteristics and has a significant advantage in resolution gldas has a good ability to describe the spatial characteristics of soil moisture in the region and can be used for regional scale soil moisture research furthermore because the lp is in the transition zone of semi arid and semi humid the spatial difference of drought is significant it is worth noting that the northwest of the lp 1971 2010 is a region with frequent droughts zhang et al 2012 which is consistent with our research results fig 10 the difference is that the agricultural df in 1982 2015 is significantly higher at the same time it can be found from the spatial variation trend of ssmi that except the northern part of the lp all of them show a downward trend as a result the places where soil moisture decline more quickly tend to have higher drought duration and stronger drought intensity fig 8 on the other hand since the beginning of the 21st century the precipitation and temperature in the lp have shown a significant growth trend which has resulted in the positive and negative correlation changes between the northern and central regions of the lp and various factors fig 9 it is further clarified that besides climate change affecting agricultural drought vegetation restoration is also another major factor from 1982 to 2015 the ssmi of the lp showed an insignificant downward trend while the temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and ndvi showed a significant increase trend p 0 01 however with the rise of temperature in 1987 1991 and 1996 the decrease of precipitation is undoubtedly the main factor leading to the significant reduction of soil moisture caused by the outbreak of exceptionally drought in the lp fig 11 more importantly with the implementation of vegetation restoration project in 1999 abundant water and heat provide suitable conditions for the rapid growth of vegetation generally water condition is an important factor that affects and restricts the growth and development of vegetation climate factors such as temperature and precipitation directly affect soil moisture through water cycle and then affect the growth of vegetation noy meir 1973 rosenzweig et al 2001 furthermore artificial vegetation only consumes more soil moisture under photosynthesis than natural vegetation which requires more water in the early growth process in turn excessive soil moisture consumption will cause the decrease of soil moisture and even agricultural drought zhai et al 2018 in general the implementation of vegetation restoration project accelerates the consumption of soil moisture in the lp while the water cycle is intensified due to climate warming as a result the temporal and spatial evolution of agricultural drought is more complex the difference is more obvious and there is an increasing risk trend 6 conclusion in this paper the ssmi was constructed by using the root soil moisture data of gldas by comparing with spei and agricultural drought disaster data the suitability of using ssmi to monitor agricultural drought in the lp was evaluated besides it is proposed to describe the spatial temporal dynamics of agricultural drought with the migration of drought centroid and to further analyze the influencing factors of agricultural drought the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the lp is approximately 9 months mainly with existence of moderate drought and drought coverage nearly 10 25 and the probability of exceptionally drought in a short time is low except for the drought in 1998 the agricultural drought in the lp has evolved gradually from moderate drought and the probability of exceptionally drought in a short time is low this provides people with a long time for early warning and prevention which helps to reduce the harm of drought from 1982 to 2015 the spatial distribution of drought frequency in the lp gradually increased from southeast to northwest and the agricultural drought in the northwest has the characteristics of frequent occurrence short duration and weak intensity with no significant trend of longer duration and weaker intensity moreover among the 7 droughts screened out by the drought migration model the migration direction of drought centroids are mainly east west concentrated in the middle of the lp in the early and late stage of drought drought migration trends to have a longer path and faster speed while in the middle it is shorter and denser however with the impact of global climate change among the potential factors affecting agricultural drought in the lp the significant increasing precipitation p 0 01 has not alleviated agricultural drought whereas significant increasing temperature p 0 01 is the direct factor inducing agricultural drought and the implementation of vegetation restoration project further aggravates the risk of agricultural drought declaration of competing interest the

10321,understanding the evolution characteristics of regional drought is crucial to the sustainable development of ecology and social economy especially in typical water limited area however the exploring the spatial temporal dynamics of agricultural drought in the loess plateau lp under global warming and regional vegetation restoration project is still insufficient and its potential causes remain unresolved to this end in this study the standardized soil moisture index ssmi was constructed based on the root soil moisture data of the global land data assimilation system and their suitability in monitoring agricultural drought in the lp was evaluated in addition it is proposed to describe the spatial temporal dynamics of agricultural drought with the migration of drought centroid and to further analyze the influencing factors of agricultural drought results show that 1 the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the lp is approximately 9 months mainly with existence of moderate drought and drought coverage nearly 10 25 and the probability of exceptionally drought in a short time is low 2 from 1982 to 2015 the spatial distribution of drought frequency in the lp gradually increased from southeast to northwest and the agricultural drought in the northwest has the characteristics of frequent occurrence short duration and weak intensity with no significant trend of longer duration and weaker intensity 3 among the 7 droughts screened out by the drought migration model the migration direction of drought centroids are mainly east west concentrated in the middle of the lp in the early and late stage of drought drought migration trends to have a longer path and faster speed while in the middle it is shorter and denser 4 significant increasing precipitation p 0 01 in the lp has not alleviated agricultural drought whereas significant increasing temperature p 0 01 is the direct factor inducing agricultural drought and the implementation of vegetation restoration project further aggravates the risk of agricultural drought this study not only provides scientific guidance for agricultural drought early warning prevention and mitigation of drought losses in the lp from the perspective of time and space but also offers a valuable reference for understanding the impact of large scale vegetation restoration projects keywords agriculture drought gldas standardized soil moisture index climate change spatial temporal dynamics 1 introduction drought has a direct impact on china s food security and social stability especially the frequent occurrence of drought under the changing environment which brings great challenges to china s sustainable economic and social development and ecological health zhao et al 2011 hao et al 2012 jiang et al 2019 guo et al 2019 from 1990 to 2014 the annual average grain loss caused by drought in china reached 25 9 billion kg ministry of water resources 2014 which was close to the annual demand of 60 million people qin et al 2015 the summer drought in china in 2011 alone affected more than 30 million people and caused an economic loss of about 2 4 billion us dollars yuan et al 2015 although it is very important to monitor and understand agricultural drought to reduce the loss and impact of disasters people know little about it agricultural drought is the imbalance of water supply and demand which hinders the normal growth of crops due to the lack of soil moisture during the growth of crops crow et al 2012 among many agricultural drought evaluation indexes the standardized soil moisture index ssmi can sensitively reflect the dynamic balance of precipitation groundwater supply and evapotranspiration and has the advantages of simple calculation and considering the characteristics of data distribution zhou et al 2019 based on the historical time series data mishra et al 2015 used standardized soil moisture index to analyze the local scale agricultural drought in detail by combining soil moisture data from satellite and land surface model the ssmi developed by xu et al 2018 has been verified to be effective and sensitive to detecting agricultural drought over large areas although soil moisture is the main variable to define and identify agricultural drought the surface soil moisture is sensitive to the impact of temperature and precipitation and can t effectively identify drought events especially in arid areas in recent years soil moisture data provided by the global land data assimilation system gldas based on satellite land surface model and ground observation data jointly released by nasa and noaa have been widely used in the world syed et al 2008 chen et al 2013 long et al 2015 khan et al 2018 more importantly the gldas data capture soil moisture anomalies and their variability taking into account regional and seasonal dependences showing correspondence with other proxies used to characterize soil states these results are believed to support the use of gldas as an indicator of soil moisture status and can be used to develop new soil moisture monitoring indicators spennemann et al 2015 in addition the soil moisture data provided by gldas includes 4 depth layers and 0 100 cm soil layer is the most effective part of soil moisture in the root zone of vegetation in general the water required by the crop is supplied to the crop by the soil moisture in the root zone martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 moreover the surface soil moisture is seriously disturbed by precipitation and temperature which cannot accurately reflect the state of deep soil moisture thereby the root soil moisture data is more suitable for agricultural drought monitoring than that of a fixed depth mishra et al 2015 more importantly drought is not only a complex natural phenomenon but a regional phenomenon often covering large areas world meteorological organization wmo 2006 describing the spatial evolution of drought path direction etc not only helps to gain knowledge about its drivers and processes but also further improves the way drought is monitored thereby reducing its impact diaz et al 2019 however the current research on the spatial evolution of drought mainly focuses on meteorological drought for instance the spatial drought tracking algorithm s track proposed by diaz et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 proposed a method to study meteorological drought migration based on topological spatial relations although the two methods are widely used in large scale and small watershed analysis they are often limited by parameter and conditional assumptions therefore we propose the concept of unconditional hypothesis and nonparametric drought migration centroid to characterize the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of agricultural drought attributes the spatiotemporal dynamics of agricultural drought is characterized by the track path direction and speed of gravity migration in order to further understand the dynamic evolution of agricultural drought the loess plateau lp is the transition zone from semi humid climate area to semi arid and arid climate area it is also the most important agricultural production area in northwest china however the frequent occurrence of drought in the region especially the frequent extreme climate events caused by global climate change increases the risk of natural disasters and has a more serious impact on the ecological environment and agricultural production further the revegetation plan implemented in china since 1999 is the largest ecological restoration plan in a developing country feng et al 2016 only in 2018 china completed 7 07 million hectares of afforestation and the lp accounted for about 40 of the total area of afforestation office of the national greening committee 2019 at the same time a large number of studies zhang et al 2006 zheng et al 2019 have shown that large scale revegetation measures in the lp have significantly changed the surface material and energy balance such as erosion sediment significantly reduced watershed water production decreased soil drying intensified and regional climate change meanwhile climate change and land use conversion may change the water cycle system of the whole region thus complicating the situation of drought cui et al 2018 chen et al 2020 wu et al 2020 furthermore the study of drought on the lp is mainly concerned with meteorology and hydrology liu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 shi et al 2020 and only focuses on a single catchment area in the region zhao et al 2014 therefore there may be a lack of important drought information based on these a comprehensive analysis of the main factors affecting agricultural drought is essential to ensure food security and drought early warning the main purpose of this study is to explore the spatial temporal evolution characteristics of agricultural drought to explore the main factors affecting agricultural drought dynamics 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the lp is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river basin the plateau is the most concentrated and largest loess area on the earth covering an area of about 640 000 km2 spanning seven provinces autonomous regions of china fig 1 huang et al 2020 the region is named because of the loess transported from the northwestern gobi desert by wind and mainly deposited in the lp with the depth exceeding 50 m since the early quaternary fang et al 2019 surrounded by the qinling mountain helan mountains yinshan mountain and taihang mountain in the south west north and east respectively the plateau region has a warm or temperate continental monsoon climate with mean annual temperature ranging from 4 to 14 c and mean annual precipitation ranging from 200 mm in the northwest to 800 mm in the southeast su and fu 2013 over the past decades the lp has been facing a series of ecological and environmental problems such as desertification soil erosion runoff reduction and so on chen et al 2015 in response to these eco environmental problems the chinese government launched a series of scientific programs in the 1980s and the well known grain for green project or vegetation restoration project largely contributed to maintaining soil and water conservation fu et al 2017 in 1999 intensive vegetation restoration and project construction plan were implemented in the lp wang et al 2011 2 2 gldas data gldas products include forcing data e g precipitation near surface air temperature downward shortwave and longwave radiation specific humidity wind speed and surface pressure land surface states e g soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff flux data e g evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux and available online http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings in this study gldas version 1 noah land surface model product gldas noah10 m from 1979 to 2015 was used including precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and four layers of soil moisture including 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm with spatial and temporal resolutions of 1 0 and month respectively 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index and crop damage area we used gridded monthly ndvi from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms the gimms dataset tucker et al 2005 compiles ndvi images acquired by the advanced very higher solution radiometer avhrr sensor aboard national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa satellites the dataset provides a long term global data set with a monthly value at 1 12 1 12 spatial resolution 1982 2016 moreover we acquired 1 0 grid values of ndvi in the lp 1982 2015 by bilinear interpolation which were consistent with the time and spatial distribution of gldas the annual data of crop damage area 1982 2015 can be obtained from the ministry agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2 4 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the global spei database offers long time robust information on the drought conditions at the global scale with a 0 5 spatial resolution and a monthly time resolution the spei expresses as a standardized variate mean zero and unit variance the deviations of the current climatic balance precipitation minus evapotranspiration potential with respect to the long term balance calculation of the evapotranspiration potential in speibase is based on the fao 56 penman monteith method for a detailed introduction to spei see vicente serrano et al 2010 and beguería et al 2014 moreover we obtained the 1 0 grid value of spei in lp using bilinear interpolation method 3 methods 3 1 standardized soil moisture index the ssmi was estimated as a standardized anomaly in remotely sensed soil moisture for 1982 2015 we used root soil moisture from the gldas to calculate ssmi to characterize agriculture drought 1 s s m i i j s m i j s m j σ j where i is year ranging from 1982 to 2015 j is month ranging from january to december and s m j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of soil moisture in month j respectively the ssmi is a dimensionless quantity used to detect drought events table 1 detailed grading can be found in zhao et al 2017 3 2 drought frequency drought frequency df can be defined as the number of occurrences of drought event exceeding a certain threshold per unit time blenkinsop and fowler 2007 spinoni et al 2013 we expressed df on a yearly scale given by the total number of qualifying drought events ssmi 0 8 divided by the total number years as 2 f r m n where n is the number of years considered in this study and m is the number of drought events with ssmi 0 8 3 3 drought coverage drought coverage dc is defined as the extent of drought occurring in the study area in a certain period of time in this study we use a 1 0 grid to represent the scope of the study area the ratio of the number of grids to the total number of droughts in the current month is used to express 3 d c m t d 100 where m represents the number of grids in which drought occurred during the month and td represents the total number of grids in the lp the larger the dc value is the larger the drought area is besides the range of drought coverage is shown in table 2 3 4 wavelet transformation wavelet analysis can give information about the time evolution of the spectral properties of a quantity its use is now becoming increasingly more common in climatology oh et al 2003 wavelet transform can be described as labat 2008 4 c a τ 1 a f t ψ t τ a d t where c a τ is the wavelet coefficient as a function of time scale a and time shift τ f t is the original function of time t ψ is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function ψ which roles as the convolution kernel wavelet is a group of functions that can be real or complex wavelet selection depends on the characteristics of the original time series c a τ represents the conditional correlation between the wavelet function ψ and time signal series f t 3 5 drought migration model the application of centroid to study the migration of matter and energy is an important method in the study of geological distribution moshe and friedman 1976 the centroid can represent the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the elements and the distance of centroid moving reflects the spatial difference of the change amplitude of the elements therefore in this study we proposed to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural drought by using the migration of drought centroid the drought migration model includes the following four steps 1 identify complete drought events 2 screening of the grid 3 determining the location of the drought centroid 4 connecting centroids step 1 identify complete drought events on the time scale the mean ssmi of the study area is less than or equal to the threshold to determine whether drought occurs in the current month besides identify the drought events which lasted more than 3 months in a row because the migration change of a drought event can be recorded completely step 2 screening of the grid on the spatial scale because every 1 0 grid in the study area recorded the current month s ssmi information when the ssmi is below or equal to the selected threshold 1 is used to indicate that the grid is in drought otherwise the value of 0 is used eq 5 further screen out the grid that represents the drought in the current month 5 d s t 0 i f s s m i 0 8 1 i f s s m i 0 8 where ds is the drought state i e drought or not drought and formula 1 is applied to each grid of each month t step 3 determining the location of the drought centroid the area of drought is determined by a grid assigned a value of 1 at the same time in order to consider the different weight of ssmi information recorded by each drought grid the centroid was used to represent the geometric center of the drought event in the month eq 6 6 x y x i 1 n p i x i i 1 n p i y i 1 n p i y i i 1 n p i where x and y respectively represent the longitude and latitude of the agricultural drought centroid in the study area x i and y i respectively represent the longitude and latitude of the i th grid center p i represents the ssmi of the i th grid step 4 connecting centroids by connecting centroids of drought event the track path length direction and velocity characteristics of the drought event can be completely recorded 4 results 4 1 identification and variation characteristics of agriculture drought fig 2 shows that there were several agriculture droughts in the lp from 1982 to 2015 and the duration and intensity of the droughts were generally severe after 2000 the agriculture drought in the lp was less than that before 2000 but the occurrence frequency was increased the droughts in 1987 1998 and 2007 were particularly severe which was consistent with the research results of sun and ma 2015 in addition we calculated the damage area of crops in shaanxi shanxi province and ningxia autonomous region and found that in the year of agricultural drought the damage area of crops had an obvious upward trend furthermore we compared the annual mean value of ssmi with the disaster area and found that the correlation was 0 42 p 0 05 indicating that ssmi can capture the change of agricultural drought in lp meanwhile to further verify the reliability of ssmi we compare it with spei 1 2 24 are compared respectively it was found that the pearson correlation between ssmi and spei 9 was the highest reaching 0 6 indicating that the response time of agricultural in the lp to meteorological drought is approximately 9 months this was consistent with the response time of hydrological drought in the southwest and east of the lp to meteorological drought from 6 to 12 months huang et al 2017 the reliability that ssmi can identify agricultural drought in lp is further verified 4 2 temporal evolution characteristics of agricultural drought in the loess plateau 4 2 1 the seasonal evolution of agricultural drought on the seasonal scale the ssmi of the lp shows obvious seasonal characteristics fig 3 the soil moisture in autumn and winter is always in a deficit state especially in winter the soil moisture is the lowest compared with other seasons it can be found from the seasonal scale of each year that when there is drought in autumn the winter and spring of the next year are also mostly dry periods besides there is no significant decline trend of soil moisture in all seasons and the decline range in summer and autumn is evidently smaller than that in other seasons indicating that agricultural drought in the lp is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn furthermore the soil moisture in summer is more abundant than that in other seasons because the rainy season of the lp is mainly concentrated in june to september however the increase of precipitation in summer and autumn didn t increase soil moisture but showed an obvious downward trend indicating that there were other factors besides precipitation that affected agricultural drought 4 2 2 evolution of drought coverage it can be seen from the change of dc under different agricultural drought that moderate drought is the main drought in the lp and dc is mainly concentrated in about 10 25 fig 4 the exceptionally droughts that broke out in 1988 1992 and 1998 covered a wider area and had more severe consequences after entering the 21st century the number of droughts in the lp has increased significantly mainly concentrated in moderate drought and other levels of drought decreased in addition except for the drought in 1998 the different levels of drought have obvious progressive trend in time the results show that the agricultural drought in the lp is gradually evolved from moderate drought and the probability of sudden exceptionally drought in a short time is low this provides a long time for early warning and prevention from the beginning of drought to the time before it becomes exceptionally drought which helps to reduce the harm of drought 4 2 3 cyclical evolution characteristics of agricultural drought the variation of soil moisture often shows the vibration characteristics of multi frequency and quasi period aghakouchak 2014 therefore the characteristics of soil moisture change on time scale can be analyzed by wavelet transformation fig 5 the agricultural drought in the lp has 9 alternations of high and low in the scale of 50 80 months the oscillation in the whole series is divided into two stages the period from 1982 to 1999 is about 50 months and the period after 2000 is obviously increased in 1987 1992 1995 1998 2002 and 2007 the lp experienced severe agricultural drought especially the drought around 1987 which was obviously stronger than the drought in other periods in terms of duration and intensity meanwhile according to the abundant shock formed from 2011 to 2015 the ssmi after 2015 will enter dry shock and the risk of agricultural drought will increase 4 3 spatial evolution characteristics of agricultural drought in the loess plateau 4 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of drought frequency it can be seen from fig 6a that the spatial distribution of df in the lp gradually increased from southeast to northwest during 1982 2015 the df is the highest near the two irrigation areas reaching once a year which is consistent with the conclusions of many related studies zhang et al 2012 as hetao irrigation and ningxia irrigation area are the main grain producing areas in the lp which may cause great damage to agricultural production besides it can be found from the seasonal characteristics of drought outbreak fig 6b that drought mainly occurs in summer and the least in winter which is similar to the seasonal characteristics of drought outbreak in north china feng et al 2016 on the seasonal scale the outbreak of drought mainly occurred in the northwest of the lp with the increase of latitude the df decreased in spring but in winter it was the opposite as the latitudes rise and precipitation decreases significantly the onset of the rainy season is delayed moreover due to underlying surface factors water and heat redistribution tends to make regional drought difference obvious which showing its spatial heterogeneity 4 3 2 spatial evolution characteristics of agricultural drought seven drought events were screened out from 1982 to 2015 by the drought migration model these include three exceptionally droughts in 1986 1991 and 1996 three extremely droughts in 2001 2006 and 2015 and a severe drought in 2002 fig 7 in terms of the migration direction of drought centroids the seven droughts were mainly concentrated in the middle of the lp and the migration direction is along the east west direction in the migration path the seven droughts have a long path at the beginning of the formation and the end of the drought while in the middle of the drought the path is relatively short and dense moreover since drought migration is on the monthly scale the longer the migration path is the faster the migration at the beginning and the end of the drought period because of the increase and decrease of ssmi there is often more rapid migration speed in the middle of the drought period ssmi reaches the peak and the migration speed slows down obviously in addition it can be found in fig 7 that among the droughts with a long duration droughts usually reach the most serious situation in winter and spring and begin to lighten and disappear with the coming of rainy season in the next summer 4 3 3 evolution characteristics of agricultural drought duration and intensity furthermore we use drought intensity and drought duration to quantitatively characterize and evaluate the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of drought fig 8 in the 34 years from 1982 to 2015 the agricultural drought in the lp lasted for 87 2 97 8 months the areas with higher duration are mainly in the east west and middle of the lp while the areas with the highest df are in the northwest with shorter duration fig 8a fig 8b shows the spatial variation trend of drought duration in 1982 2015 the drought duration of the lp has a significant decreasing trend in the northeast but not a significant increasing trend in the whole fig 8c shows the intensity of drought in the study period indicating that the drought in the lp is relatively serious and involves a wide range drought intensity is relatively low in the central and northwestern parts of the lp compared with the duration of drought the spatial variation of drought intensity is obviously different fig 8d there is a slight increasing trend in the west and northwest and a decreasing trend in the northeast and south especially in the northwest where drought occurs frequently the trend of drought intensity decreasing is the biggest in general drought events occurred frequently in the past 34 years in the lp and experienced a long term strong agricultural drought the agricultural drought in northwest china has the characteristics of frequent occurrence short duration and weak intensity and it is accompanied by the trend of increasing duration and decreasing intensity it is important that with the impact of global warming the drought disasters in these drought prone areas may become more and more serious 4 4 main factors affecting agricultural drought in the loess plateau to study the spatial effects of various factors on agricultural drought more reasonably further analysis will be made on the monthly and annual scales fig 9 shows the spatial correlation distribution of the factors in monthly scale and annual scale with ssmi on the monthly scale fig 9a precipitation and evaporation are positively correlated with ssmi and the highest correlation in the northwest of the lp is 0 4 r 0 45 p 0 01 on the contrary ndvi and temperature were negatively correlated with ssmi on the whole except for the positive correlation between ndvi and ssmi in the northwest of lp in addition the negative correlation between air temperature and ndvi in the middle was 0 05 r 0 03 the results show that each factor has an effect on agricultural drought on the monthly scale and there are significant spatial differences compared with the monthly scale each factor and ssmi have similar spatial distribution on the annual scale but the correlation is more obvious fig 9b the correlation of evapotranspiration showed negative correlation in the middle temperature in most areas showed a significant negative correlation of 0 7 r 0 5 p 0 01 the significant negative correlation between ndvi and ssmi was 0 7 r 0 5 in the central region while there is no significant positive correlation was found in the northern region it is worth noting that the main area of the vegetation restoration project of the lp is located in the middle of the region the rapid increase of vegetation coverage undoubtedly intensifies the consumption of local water resources and the increase of temperature not only promotes the rapid growth of vegetation but increases the evapotranspiration resulting in the reduction of soil moisture and the intensification of agricultural drought it is further indicated that the influence of various factors on agricultural drought is more obvious on the annual scale 5 discussion due to the soil moisture plays an important role for drought research in the absence of nationwide long term consistent soil moisture observations at any scale assimilation data product is a useful alternative in the research related to soil moisture gldas products have good performance in tibet plateau chen et al 2013 and northeast asia cho et al 2015 especially liu 2018 used the observation data of soil moisture of meteorological stations in the lp from 2008 to 2014 and compared with a variety of assimilated products and found that gldas can better simulate the soil moisture characteristics and has a significant advantage in resolution gldas has a good ability to describe the spatial characteristics of soil moisture in the region and can be used for regional scale soil moisture research furthermore because the lp is in the transition zone of semi arid and semi humid the spatial difference of drought is significant it is worth noting that the northwest of the lp 1971 2010 is a region with frequent droughts zhang et al 2012 which is consistent with our research results fig 10 the difference is that the agricultural df in 1982 2015 is significantly higher at the same time it can be found from the spatial variation trend of ssmi that except the northern part of the lp all of them show a downward trend as a result the places where soil moisture decline more quickly tend to have higher drought duration and stronger drought intensity fig 8 on the other hand since the beginning of the 21st century the precipitation and temperature in the lp have shown a significant growth trend which has resulted in the positive and negative correlation changes between the northern and central regions of the lp and various factors fig 9 it is further clarified that besides climate change affecting agricultural drought vegetation restoration is also another major factor from 1982 to 2015 the ssmi of the lp showed an insignificant downward trend while the temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and ndvi showed a significant increase trend p 0 01 however with the rise of temperature in 1987 1991 and 1996 the decrease of precipitation is undoubtedly the main factor leading to the significant reduction of soil moisture caused by the outbreak of exceptionally drought in the lp fig 11 more importantly with the implementation of vegetation restoration project in 1999 abundant water and heat provide suitable conditions for the rapid growth of vegetation generally water condition is an important factor that affects and restricts the growth and development of vegetation climate factors such as temperature and precipitation directly affect soil moisture through water cycle and then affect the growth of vegetation noy meir 1973 rosenzweig et al 2001 furthermore artificial vegetation only consumes more soil moisture under photosynthesis than natural vegetation which requires more water in the early growth process in turn excessive soil moisture consumption will cause the decrease of soil moisture and even agricultural drought zhai et al 2018 in general the implementation of vegetation restoration project accelerates the consumption of soil moisture in the lp while the water cycle is intensified due to climate warming as a result the temporal and spatial evolution of agricultural drought is more complex the difference is more obvious and there is an increasing risk trend 6 conclusion in this paper the ssmi was constructed by using the root soil moisture data of gldas by comparing with spei and agricultural drought disaster data the suitability of using ssmi to monitor agricultural drought in the lp was evaluated besides it is proposed to describe the spatial temporal dynamics of agricultural drought with the migration of drought centroid and to further analyze the influencing factors of agricultural drought the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the lp is approximately 9 months mainly with existence of moderate drought and drought coverage nearly 10 25 and the probability of exceptionally drought in a short time is low except for the drought in 1998 the agricultural drought in the lp has evolved gradually from moderate drought and the probability of exceptionally drought in a short time is low this provides people with a long time for early warning and prevention which helps to reduce the harm of drought from 1982 to 2015 the spatial distribution of drought frequency in the lp gradually increased from southeast to northwest and the agricultural drought in the northwest has the characteristics of frequent occurrence short duration and weak intensity with no significant trend of longer duration and weaker intensity moreover among the 7 droughts screened out by the drought migration model the migration direction of drought centroids are mainly east west concentrated in the middle of the lp in the early and late stage of drought drought migration trends to have a longer path and faster speed while in the middle it is shorter and denser however with the impact of global climate change among the potential factors affecting agricultural drought in the lp the significant increasing precipitation p 0 01 has not alleviated agricultural drought whereas significant increasing temperature p 0 01 is the direct factor inducing agricultural drought and the implementation of vegetation restoration project further aggravates the risk of agricultural drought declaration of competing interest the

10322,spatial and temporal variability of soil properties irrigation schedules and fertilization management play an important role in crop growth and yield in agricultural systems however how to improve and accurately predict crop yield in different management zones mzs within a large scale field are important but rarely discussed in this study coefficient of variation linear correlations partial least squares discriminant analysis and quantile regression were used to quantify relationships between crop and soil properties and determine key explanatory factors of yield and to identify suitable ways to improve crop yield among mzs at the temporal scale coefficients of variation of crop growth parameters lai and biomass and correlations of crop growth parameters with soil water content and available nitrogen varied during crop growth stages in mzs across years crop soil correlations varied with time and were most pronounced in heading and filling stages when lai and biomass approached maximum values respectively at the spatial scale 22 explanatory factors belonging to four categories soil physical properties initial soil properties soil water and nitrogen dynamics and topography were compared results showed that among the four categories initial soil properties had the greatest influence on yield across the whole field whereas soil water and nitrogen dynamics were the most influential for individual mzs key explanatory factors of yield varied across mzs in 2017 and 2018 although key explanatory factors varied across years within a mz some remained unchanged especially soil physical properties based on the quantile regression results the same key explanatory factors might appear in mzs but the reference ranges were different for more sustainable and efficient agricultural production distributed integrated management including soil amelioration before sowing and irrigation and n fertilization scheduling during the crop growth period should be implemented in mzs based on the spatial temporal variability of soil properties keywords crop soil correlation distributed integrated management management zones quantile regression spatial and temporal variability 1 introduction with the growth of the world population food demand is also increasing baudron and giller 2014 however the shortage of water resources has restricted the development of agriculture especially in arid regions müller et al 2016 in recent decades large scale agricultural production has developed rapidly in china with mechanization intensification and excessive irrigation and nitrogen application delineation of management zones mzs is an effective way to achieve the goal of more efficient management of large scale fields supporting the optimization of planting dates tillage systems irrigation and fertilization schedules and insecticide applications albornoz et al 2017 rattalino edreira et al 2017 mzs are relatively uniform homogeneous areas within the field which can guide agricultural management to improve yield and input efficiency breunig et al 2020 however methods to make distributed integrated management decisions including soil amelioration before sowing and irrigation and n fertilization scheduling during the crop growth period according to the actual situation of mzs are rarely reported spatial variability of crop yield is affected by heterogeneous soil properties within a field under the same management conditions xu et al 2019 maestrini and basso 2018 whereas spatio temporal variation of leaf area index lai and biomass accumulation are ultimately reflected in yield variation hakojärvi et al 2013 soil texture and initial properties e g apparent electrical conductivity ph and soil nutrients correlate with yield peralta et al 2015 wang et al 2018 and are the bases for delineating mzs albornoz et al 2017 after delineation the degree of variation of soil properties and yield in mzs is lower than that for the whole field without mzs the optimization of irrigation and fertilization schedules can improve yield water productivity and environmental benefits zhang et al 2018 oppong danso et al 2015 during the growing season crop growth parameters e g lai and biomass are correlated with soil water and nutrient dynamics jaynes et al 2005 robertson et al 2007 on the time scale the sensitivity of crops to water and nutrients varies between growth stages mansouri far et al 2010 which causes lai and biomass to vary among growth stages within a field on the spatial scale heterogeneous growing conditions are usually affected by spatial variability of farmland management soil characteristics and the interaction of these factors peralta et al 2015 muschietti piana et al 2018 site specific nitrogen fertilizer management strategies and optimization of irrigation schedules in mzs based on soil properties could decrease nitrogen losses improve yield water productivity and fertilization use efficiency chen et al 2020 muschietti piana et al 2018 combining amelioration of soil constraints and the optimization of management practices is a reasonable way for more sustainable agricultural production in order to guide distributed integrated strategies for improving yield in mzs the key explanatory factors that effect for example yield can first be determined and then reference ranges of these key explanatory factors can be determined partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da is an effective statistical method to screen key explanatory factors in complex data sets and establish prediction models chung and keles 2010 lottering et al 2020 pls da combines the properties of partial least squares regression and the discrimination ability of classification technology previous research used pls da to find important factors among correlated factors mahanti and chakraborty 2020 peerbhay et al 2013 quantile regression qr is a suitable tool for solving the complexity of the relationships between many explanatory variables and response variables which can be used to estimate the variance in median or quantile responses and determine the reference ranges koenker and hallock 2001 wang et al 2020 serafim et al 2019 determined the ranges of soil properties in each layer which were suitable for soybeans yield using qr and found adjustment strategies for soil layers in this study key explanatory factors were selected based on the variable importance in the projection vip values by using pls da and then reference ranges of key explanatory factors were determined by using qr previous research using this experimental dataset focused on spatial and temporal variability maestrini and basso 2018 delineation of mzs peralta et al 2015 muschietti piana et al 2018 and the optimization of agricultural management strategies zhang et al 2018 without considering the optimization of irrigation and fertilization schedules and soil amendments comprehensively therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 characterize spatial variability of crop growth parameters and soil properties 2 quantify correlations of crop growth parameters with soil water and nitrogen dynamics at a temporal scale 3 screen the key explanatory factors of yield and determine the reference ranges by the combination of pls da and qr and 4 to provide a reference for high yield management assigning appropriate soil amendments irrigation and fertilization for different mzs within the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site the experiment was conducted in

sand showed medium variability whereas elevation bd and ph showed low variability table 1 cvs in mzs were smaller than for the whole field which indicated that the spatial distribution of soil properties in mzs is more homogeneous than that of the whole field 3 2 coefficient of variation cv of lai and biomass in each growth stage the cvs of lai and biomass varied among the mzs and years fig

key explanatory factors of yield and contribution rate in mzs in this study key explanatory factors were screened by pls da from 22 explanatory factors belonging to four categories soil physical properties clay silt sand and bd initial soil properties soil water and nitrogen dynamics swc1 5 and an1 5 and topography elevation the contribution rate of initial soil properties was the highest across the whole field fig 5 however within mzs the order of contribution rate was soil water and nitrogen dynamics initial soil properties soil physical properties topography in both years key explanatory factors of yield were screened based on vip values vip 1 0 which varied across both mzs and years table 2 spatial distribution maps of key explanatory factors were showen in figure s1 and s2 although key explanatory factors varied across years within mzs some of them remain unchanged across the whole field silt sand ph soc tn swcini anini an3 and an4 were the key explanatory factors in

swcini anini ec swc3 swc4 an3 and an4 3 5 calibration and validation of pls da model yield prediction based on key explanatory factors using pls da regression fig 6 had high accuracy table 3 results of calibration were more accurate than that of validation in 2017 and 2018 for the measured and predicted yield of mzs and the whole field points were distributed close to the 1 1 line stronger relationships between measured and predicted yield were found within individual mzs than across the whole field in both years based on r2 and nrmse table 3 3 6 reference ranges of key explanatory factors in mzs reference ranges of key explanatory factors were determined by qr which varied both in mzs and years table 4 the same key explanatory factors appeared in different mzs but the reference ranges were different key explanatory factors were in some cases different in the same zone between years however reference ranges of soil physical properties were almost unchanged between years the sampling points satisfying the reference ranges of key explanatory factors in mzs were found based on the results of qr table a1 a3 in z1 z2 and z3 the number of sampling points meeting the reference ranges of key explanatory factors were 10 16 and 8 respectively the reference yields mean yields of these points were 8221 kg ha 1 7848 kg ha 1 and 6825 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 8720 kg ha 1 7869 kg ha 1 and 6913 kg ha 1 in 2018 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively see tables a1 a3 for more details 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties and crop growth spatial variability of lai and biomass varied during the growing period in mzs the greatest variability in lai appeared during the shooting stage whereas the greatest variability in biomass occurred during the heading stage in 2017 and 2018 fig 3 spatial variability of soil properties caused heterogeneous yield and crop growth due to different water and nutrient holding abilities méndez barroso et al 2016 crop growth and dynamics of swc and an were to an extent linearly correlated while the correlations varied during different growth stages fig 4 vegetative stages were highly sensitive to water stress whereas reproductive stages were highly sensitive to nitrogen stress recep 2004 ciampitti and vyn 2011 soil texture affected the movement of water and nitrogen the development of the root system and ultimately the growth of crops sandy or sandy loam soils with weak water holding capacity and strong water conductivity allow water to infiltrate quickly like z3 in this study chikowo et al 2004 whereas silt loams with high available water and medium water conductivity are more able to supply sufficient water to crops throughout the growing season like z1 in this study cui et al 2012 vincent et al 2007 yield in z2 was between z1 and z3 due to the spatial variability of soil texture most of the cvs of lai and biomass in 2018 were lower than those in 2017 because the greater precipitation in 2018 decreased water stress during irrigation intervals and made the crops grow more homogeneously especially in z2 figs 2 and 3 otherwise the effective accumulated temperature 8 7 c during the crop growth period varied across years 1556 c d in 2017 and 1605 c d in 2018 which also affected the maize growth sacks and kucharik 2011 hou et al 2014 4 2 distributed management for improving yield in mzs based on the reference ranges delineation of mzs is an effective way to improve management efficiency and can be used for site specific management within a field albornoz et al 2017 moharana et al 2020 after delineating mzs soil properties are generally more homogeneous than before which is the basis for the implementation of different management methods previous work such as li et al 2019a identified important categories for yield and irrigation water productivity important categories could be selected based on the contribution rate but reference ranges were not used in our study based on the combination of pls da and qr key explanatory factors of yield were selected and the reference ranges determined tables 3 and 4 which can inform methods for improving yield in mzs soil texture characteristics affected yield jalota et al 2010 nouri et al 2016 and were the key explanatory factors in mzs and across the whole field in this study table 2 indicating that soil amelioration is an effective way to increase yield by more than 17 in the research of pan et al 2019 hale et al 2020 found that the application of biochar in sandy soil could increase yield by 26 48 which could be used as a reference for z3 and part of z2 in this study previous research in saline alkaline soils demonstrated that localized ammonium sulfate and superphosphate can improve crop yield and decrease ph and salinity wang et al 2018 adjusting the ph value to within a suitable range could improve crop yield saletnik et al 2018 mbarki et al 2017 a tactic that could be implemented in z3 for the initial soil fertility using different kinds of organic fertilizer can increase the soc tn tp and an and subsequently improve crop yield and quality ni et al 2011 sun and huang 2012 a previous study reported that manure had positive effects on yields by strongly increasing soil fertility cai et al 2019 a combination of organic and synthetic fertilizers can improve the availability of nutrients absorbed by plants and improve yield diacono and montemurro 2010 previous studies showed that increasing organic inputs can significantly increase corn yield by more than 20 mucheru muna et al 2007 kiboi et al 2019 therefore mediating soil fertility through various methods of fertilization could improve maize yield in z2 and z3 soc should be increased more than 5 9 g kg 1 to reach the reference range while tp should be increased more than 1 02 g kg 1 in some parts of z2 in z3 soc tn and anini should be increased more than 3 8 g kg 1 0 51 g kg 1 and 25 6 mg kg 1 optimization of irrigation and fertilization schedules can improve yield irrigation water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and income oppong danso et al 2015 while decrease nitrogen leaching and increase environmental benefits zhang et al 2018 in this study optimization of irrigation and the fertilization schedule was the most critical category for yield improvement in mzs as opposed to the importance of initial soil properties when considering the whole field fig 5 optimizing the date and amount at each time of irrigation or fertilization in each mz is a preferred way to improve maize yield rather than adjusting soil physico chemical properties for the whole field soil water and available nitrogen correlated with crop growth differently during progressive growth stages highlighting that water and n inputs have changing effects on crop growth at different growth stages constraining the supply of irrigation or fertilizer can be carried out in a low correlation period to save water and nitrogen input previous studies demonstrated that regulated deficit irrigation can improve irrigation water productivity and income without significant yield decreasing kang et al 2002 du et al 2010 sufficient fertilization can help to achieve a high yield and water use efficiency sun et al 2019 the proportion of sampling points meeting the reference ranges of key explanatory factors was the largest in z1 45 followed by z2 30 and z3 23 tables a1 a3 there were suitable soil physical conditions and a sufficient water and nutrient supply which resulted in high yields in most areas in z1 the opposite situation appeared in z3 and parts of z2 theoretically the implementation of a distributed management strategy to adjust the key factors to levels within the reference ranges is a feasible way to reduce yield gaps in mzs variable rate soil amendment and fertilization before sowing muschietti piana et al 2018 and variable rate irrigation and n fertilization during the growth period li et al 2019b have been successfully used to address yield gaps in actual agricultural management in this study elevation was not a key explanatory factor of yield unlike some other previous research kumhálová and moudrý 2014 marques da silva and silva 2008 this was because variability in elevation was low across the study area table 1 and not as complex as in other environments e g hillslopes timlin et al 1998 5 conclusion delineation of mzs was the basis for designing site specific management in a large scale field within field spatial variability of crop growth and correlations of crop and soil characteristics changed over time which indicated that irrigation and fertilization management could be optimized a combination of pls da and qr was used to screen key explanatory factors and determine the reference ranges which could guide agricultural management for mzs key explanatory factors of yield and ways for improving yield were different between mzs distributed integrated management including accounting for soil physical factors initial soil properties irrigation and fertilization management and topography is a potential way to increase crop yield revenue and environmental benefits and could be more widely implemented in large scale

10322,spatial and temporal variability of soil properties irrigation schedules and fertilization management play an important role in crop growth and yield in agricultural systems however how to improve and accurately predict crop yield in different management zones mzs within a large scale field are important but rarely discussed in this study coefficient of variation linear correlations partial least squares discriminant analysis and quantile regression were used to quantify relationships between crop and soil properties and determine key explanatory factors of yield and to identify suitable ways to improve crop yield among mzs at the temporal scale coefficients of variation of crop growth parameters lai and biomass and correlations of crop growth parameters with soil water content and available nitrogen varied during crop growth stages in mzs across years crop soil correlations varied with time and were most pronounced in heading and filling stages when lai and biomass approached maximum values respectively at the spatial scale 22 explanatory factors belonging to four categories soil physical properties initial soil properties soil water and nitrogen dynamics and topography were compared results showed that among the four categories initial soil properties had the greatest influence on yield across the whole field whereas soil water and nitrogen dynamics were the most influential for individual mzs key explanatory factors of yield varied across mzs in 2017 and 2018 although key explanatory factors varied across years within a mz some remained unchanged especially soil physical properties based on the quantile regression results the same key explanatory factors might appear in mzs but the reference ranges were different for more sustainable and efficient agricultural production distributed integrated management including soil amelioration before sowing and irrigation and n fertilization scheduling during the crop growth period should be implemented in mzs based on the spatial temporal variability of soil properties keywords crop soil correlation distributed integrated management management zones quantile regression spatial and temporal variability 1 introduction with the growth of the world population food demand is also increasing baudron and giller 2014 however the shortage of water resources has restricted the development of agriculture especially in arid regions müller et al 2016 in recent decades large scale agricultural production has developed rapidly in china with mechanization intensification and excessive irrigation and nitrogen application delineation of management zones mzs is an effective way to achieve the goal of more efficient management of large scale fields supporting the optimization of planting dates tillage systems irrigation and fertilization schedules and insecticide applications albornoz et al 2017 rattalino edreira et al 2017 mzs are relatively uniform homogeneous areas within the field which can guide agricultural management to improve yield and input efficiency breunig et al 2020 however methods to make distributed integrated management decisions including soil amelioration before sowing and irrigation and n fertilization scheduling during the crop growth period according to the actual situation of mzs are rarely reported spatial variability of crop yield is affected by heterogeneous soil properties within a field under the same management conditions xu et al 2019 maestrini and basso 2018 whereas spatio temporal variation of leaf area index lai and biomass accumulation are ultimately reflected in yield variation hakojärvi et al 2013 soil texture and initial properties e g apparent electrical conductivity ph and soil nutrients correlate with yield peralta et al 2015 wang et al 2018 and are the bases for delineating mzs albornoz et al 2017 after delineation the degree of variation of soil properties and yield in mzs is lower than that for the whole field without mzs the optimization of irrigation and fertilization schedules can improve yield water productivity and environmental benefits zhang et al 2018 oppong danso et al 2015 during the growing season crop growth parameters e g lai and biomass are correlated with soil water and nutrient dynamics jaynes et al 2005 robertson et al 2007 on the time scale the sensitivity of crops to water and nutrients varies between growth stages mansouri far et al 2010 which causes lai and biomass to vary among growth stages within a field on the spatial scale heterogeneous growing conditions are usually affected by spatial variability of farmland management soil characteristics and the interaction of these factors peralta et al 2015 muschietti piana et al 2018 site specific nitrogen fertilizer management strategies and optimization of irrigation schedules in mzs based on soil properties could decrease nitrogen losses improve yield water productivity and fertilization use efficiency chen et al 2020 muschietti piana et al 2018 combining amelioration of soil constraints and the optimization of management practices is a reasonable way for more sustainable agricultural production in order to guide distributed integrated strategies for improving yield in mzs the key explanatory factors that effect for example yield can first be determined and then reference ranges of these key explanatory factors can be determined partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da is an effective statistical method to screen key explanatory factors in complex data sets and establish prediction models chung and keles 2010 lottering et al 2020 pls da combines the properties of partial least squares regression and the discrimination ability of classification technology previous research used pls da to find important factors among correlated factors mahanti and chakraborty 2020 peerbhay et al 2013 quantile regression qr is a suitable tool for solving the complexity of the relationships between many explanatory variables and response variables which can be used to estimate the variance in median or quantile responses and determine the reference ranges koenker and hallock 2001 wang et al 2020 serafim et al 2019 determined the ranges of soil properties in each layer which were suitable for soybeans yield using qr and found adjustment strategies for soil layers in this study key explanatory factors were selected based on the variable importance in the projection vip values by using pls da and then reference ranges of key explanatory factors were determined by using qr previous research using this experimental dataset focused on spatial and temporal variability maestrini and basso 2018 delineation of mzs peralta et al 2015 muschietti piana et al 2018 and the optimization of agricultural management strategies zhang et al 2018 without considering the optimization of irrigation and fertilization schedules and soil amendments comprehensively therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 characterize spatial variability of crop growth parameters and soil properties 2 quantify correlations of crop growth parameters with soil water and nitrogen dynamics at a temporal scale 3 screen the key explanatory factors of yield and determine the reference ranges by the combination of pls da and qr and 4 to provide a reference for high yield management

stage fig 4g correlations of biomass with an1 5 in z1 and z2 reached the maximum during the heading stage but reached the maximum in z3 and the whole field during the filling stage in 2018 fig 4h 3 4 key explanatory factors of yield and contribution rate in mzs in this study key explanatory factors were screened by pls da from 22 explanatory factors belonging to four categories soil physical properties clay silt sand and bd initial soil properties soil water and nitrogen dynamics swc1 5 and an1 5 and topography elevation the contribution rate of initial soil properties was the highest across the whole field fig 5 however within mzs the order of contribution rate was soil water and nitrogen dynamics initial soil properties soil physical properties topography in both years key explanatory factors of yield were screened based on vip values vip 1 0 which varied across both mzs and years table 2 spatial distribution maps of key explanatory factors were showen in figure s1 and s2 although key explanatory factors varied across years within mzs some of them remain unchanged across the whole field silt sand ph soc tn swcini anini an3 and an4 were the key explanatory factors in both 2017 and 2018 in z1 yield was mainly influenced by clay silt and tn for both years in z2 the key explanatory factors were clay soc an3 an4 in z3 the key explanatory factors were sand ph soc tn swcini anini ec swc3 swc4 an3 and an4 3 5 calibration and validation of pls da model yield prediction based on key explanatory factors using pls da regression fig 6 had high accuracy table 3 results of calibration were more accurate than that of validation in 2017 and 2018 for the measured and predicted yield of mzs and the whole field points were distributed close to the 1 1 line stronger relationships between measured and predicted yield were found within individual mzs than across the whole field in both years based on r2 and nrmse table 3 3 6 reference ranges of key explanatory factors in mzs reference ranges of key explanatory factors were determined by qr which varied both in mzs and years table 4 the same key explanatory factors appeared in different mzs but the reference ranges were different key explanatory factors were in some cases different in the same zone between years however reference ranges of soil physical properties were almost unchanged between years the sampling points satisfying the reference ranges of key explanatory factors in mzs were found based on the results of qr table a1 a3 in z1 z2 and z3 the number of sampling points meeting the reference ranges of key explanatory factors were 10 16 and 8 respectively the reference yields mean yields of these points were 8221 kg ha 1 7848 kg ha 1 and 6825 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 8720 kg ha 1 7869 kg ha 1 and 6913 kg ha 1 in 2018 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively see tables a1 a3 for more details 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties and crop growth spatial variability of lai and biomass varied during the growing period in mzs the greatest variability in lai appeared during the shooting stage whereas the greatest variability in biomass occurred during the heading stage in 2017 and 2018 fig 3 spatial variability of soil properties caused heterogeneous yield and crop growth due to different water and nutrient holding abilities méndez barroso et al 2016 crop growth and dynamics of swc and an were to an extent linearly correlated while the correlations varied during different growth stages fig 4 vegetative stages were highly sensitive to water stress whereas reproductive stages were highly sensitive to nitrogen stress recep 2004 ciampitti and vyn 2011 soil texture affected the movement of water and nitrogen the development of the root system and ultimately the growth of crops sandy or sandy loam soils with weak water holding capacity and strong water conductivity allow water to infiltrate quickly like z3 in this study chikowo et al 2004 whereas silt loams with high available water and medium water conductivity are more able to supply sufficient water to crops throughout the growing season like z1 in this study cui et al 2012 vincent et al 2007 yield in z2 was between z1 and z3 due to the spatial variability of soil texture most of the cvs of lai and biomass in 2018 were lower than those in 2017 because the greater precipitation in 2018 decreased water stress during irrigation intervals and made the crops grow more homogeneously especially in z2 figs 2 and 3 otherwise the effective accumulated temperature 8 7 c during the crop growth period varied across years 1556 c d in 2017 and 1605 c d in 2018 which also affected the maize growth sacks and kucharik 2011 hou et al 2014 4 2 distributed management for improving yield in mzs based on the reference ranges delineation of mzs is an effective way to improve management efficiency and can be used for site specific management within a field albornoz et al 2017 moharana et al 2020 after delineating mzs soil properties are generally more homogeneous than before which is the basis for the implementation of different management methods previous work such as li et al 2019a identified important categories for yield and irrigation water productivity important categories could be selected based on the contribution rate but reference ranges were not used in our study based on the combination of pls da and qr key explanatory factors of yield were selected and the reference ranges determined tables 3 and 4 which can inform methods for improving yield in mzs soil texture characteristics affected yield jalota et al 2010 nouri et al 2016 and were the key explanatory factors in mzs and across the whole field in this study table 2 indicating that soil amelioration is an effective way to increase yield by more than 17 in the research of pan et al 2019 hale et al 2020 found that the application of biochar in sandy soil could increase yield by 26 48 which could be used as a reference for z3 and part of z2 in this study previous research in saline alkaline soils demonstrated that localized ammonium sulfate and superphosphate can improve crop yield and decrease ph and salinity wang et al 2018 adjusting the ph value to within a suitable range could improve crop yield saletnik et al 2018 mbarki et al 2017 a tactic that could be implemented in z3 for the initial soil fertility using different kinds of organic fertilizer can increase the soc tn tp and an and subsequently improve crop yield and quality ni et al 2011 sun and huang 2012 a previous study reported that manure had positive effects on yields by strongly increasing soil fertility cai et al 2019 a combination of organic and synthetic fertilizers can improve the availability of nutrients absorbed by plants and improve yield diacono and montemurro 2010 previous studies showed that increasing organic inputs can significantly increase corn yield by more than 20 mucheru muna et al 2007 kiboi et al 2019 therefore mediating soil fertility through various methods of fertilization could improve maize yield in z2 and z3 soc should be increased more than 5 9 g kg 1 to reach the reference range while tp should be increased more than 1 02 g kg 1 in some parts of z2 in z3 soc tn and anini should be increased more than 3 8 g kg 1 0 51 g kg 1 and 25 6 mg kg 1 optimization of irrigation and fertilization schedules can improve yield irrigation water productivity nitrogen use efficiency and income oppong danso et al 2015 while decrease nitrogen leaching and increase environmental benefits zhang et al 2018 in this study optimization of irrigation and the fertilization schedule was the most critical category for yield improvement in mzs as opposed to the importance of initial soil properties when considering the whole field fig 5 optimizing the date and amount at each time of irrigation or fertilization in each mz is a preferred way to improve maize yield rather than adjusting soil physico chemical properties for the whole field soil water and available nitrogen correlated with crop growth differently during progressive growth stages highlighting that water and n inputs have changing effects on crop growth at different growth stages constraining the supply of irrigation or fertilizer can be carried out in a low correlation period to save water and nitrogen input previous studies demonstrated that regulated deficit irrigation can improve irrigation water productivity and income without significant yield decreasing kang et al 2002 du et al 2010 sufficient fertilization can help to achieve a high yield and water use efficiency sun et al 2019 the proportion of sampling points meeting the reference ranges of key explanatory factors was the largest in z1 45 followed by z2 30 and z3 23 tables a1 a3 there were suitable soil physical conditions and a sufficient water and nutrient supply which resulted in high yields in most areas in z1 the opposite situation appeared in z3 and parts of z2 theoretically the implementation of a distributed management strategy to adjust the key factors to levels within the reference ranges is a feasible way to reduce yield gaps in mzs variable rate soil amendment and fertilization before sowing muschietti piana et al 2018 and variable rate irrigation and n fertilization during the growth period li et al 2019b have been successfully used to address yield gaps in actual agricultural management in this study elevation was not a key explanatory factor of yield unlike some other previous research kumhálová and moudrý 2014 marques da silva and silva 2008 this was because variability in elevation was low across the study area table 1 and not as complex as in other environments e g hillslopes timlin et al 1998 5 conclusion delineation of mzs was the basis for designing site specific management in a large scale field within field spatial variability of crop growth and correlations of crop and soil characteristics changed over time which indicated that irrigation and fertilization management could be optimized a combination of pls da and qr was used to screen key explanatory factors and determine the reference ranges which could guide agricultural management for mzs key explanatory factors of yield and ways for improving yield were different between mzs distributed integrated management including accounting for soil physical factors initial soil properties irrigation and fertilization management and topography is a potential way to increase crop yield revenue and environmental benefits and could be more widely implemented in large scale

10323,knowledge of vegetation water depletion and the underlying mechanisms are essential for understanding eco hydrological processes and fragile ecological environment protection based on a 2 year field experiments this study investigated the transpiration and its influencing factors for three karstic climax forest communities located in the depression dec mid slope msc and summit suc of a typical karst hill in southwestern china the meteorological factors sap flow eddy covariance and soil moisture were measured results showed that the annual transpiration for suc msc and dec were 701 0 mm yr 1 626 4 mm yr 1 and 663 1 mm yr 1 respectively the daily transpiration was significantly correlated to the air temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 solar radiation r 0 8 p 0 05 and water vapor pressure deficit r 0 3 p 0 05 but showed no strong relationship with the shallow layer water content slwc 0 40 cm moreover the transpiration of the three communities generally maintained high rate e g 4 0 mm d 1 in the growing seasons even when the slwc dropped to about 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in the suc during dry spells overall 77 6 78 3 and 90 8 of the transpired water in the suc msc and dec respectively came from the shallow layer these suggested that the plants in this region could uptake water from deep layers when the slwc is limited and implied that the climax forest communities were generally not limited by water at least in normal years keywords karst ecosystem water depletion water sources eco hydrology 1 introduction karst terrain represents about 10 of the continental area and plays key roles in global biogenic elements cycle and water resources cheng et al 2015 hartmann et al 2014 liu et al 2016 owing to the carbonate nature karst landscape is generally characterized by thin soil layer high infiltration capacity and complex topography wilcox et al 2007 rendering the eco hydrological processes quite different from other ecosystems hartmann et al 2014 in particular the high infiltration and thin soil layer in karst region generally lead to high percolation and relatively low water holding capacity water availability in the up layer which will deeply affect the plant water relations efe 2014 liu et al 2016 in recent years the plant water relations in shallow soil area including the karst terrain drawn much concerns nie et al 2012 rodriguez robles et al 2015 schwinning 2008 wilcox et al 2005 there is a common point that the plants especially the deep rooting plants maeght et al 2013 can utilize water from both soil and the epikarst zone and can even alter their water use strategies during wet and dry seasons jackson et al 2000 maeght et al 2013 nie et al 2012 pockman et al 2008 rong et al 2011 depending on the root zone water availability and the habits of plants mcdowell et al 2008 for example some studies pointed out that the water sources of plants are dynamic ding et al 2018 mccole and stern 2007 nie et al 2010 rodriguez robles et al 2015 while some studies showed that plants mainly uptake water from shallow layer gu et al 2014 heilman et al 2009 schwinning 2008 these indicate that water sources of plants have a close relationship with site specific differences nie et al 2010 although the importance of the deep water sources for plants has been recognized crouchet et al 2019b hubbert et al 2001 jackson et al 2000 liu et al 2014b pockman et al 2008 previous studies mainly focus on the semi arid karst ecosystems e g edward plateau heilman et al 2009 huang et al 2011 nie et al 2010 schwinning 2008 wilcox et al 2005 the studies e g water depletion water sources in humid karst terrain like southwestern china are still limited to date deng et al 2012 huang et al 2011 nie et al 2012 rong et al 2011 the karst region in southwestern china is characterized by frequent precipitation with the annual amount being higher than 1200 mm yr 1 nie et al 2010 the frequent precipitation makes the soil moisture content maintain relatively high in this region zhang et al 2006 2018a however the shallow layer water content slwc would also drop to a very low level in dry spells sun et al 2018 on the other hand frequent precipitation also provides the opportunity for the fractured bedrocks to store relatively high water amount therefore in this region the responses of transpiration to slwc and the importance of deep layer water in water depletion might be different from those in the semi arid karstic regions on the other hand karstic ecosystems are usually considered to be fragile brinkmann and parise 2012 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2004 however some studies showed that the vegetation growth especially the deep rooting forest was not affected by seasonal droughts for example zhang and zhang 2019 found negative correlations between the palmer severity drought index psdi and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi over southwestern china meaning that seasonal droughts may promote the growth of vegetation in this region similarly crouchet et al 2019a found a positive correlation between the bedrock depth and the oak crown death rate during a hot drought on the edwards plateau karst landform these findings imply that vegetation in karst region may be not as fragile as that in our conventional knowledge thus what happened behind these phenomena knowledge of plant water relations is essential for understanding the mechanisms of eco hydrological processes and ecological environment protection therefore this study conducted a 2 year field experiment aimed to 1 quantify water depletion for typical karstic forests in humid karst terrain 2 to identify the main influencing factors for vegetation transpiration and 3 to figure out the implications of the results in ecological restoration in karst region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the two year experiments were carried out in the mulun national nature reserve 107 54 108 05 e 25 07 25 12 n fig 1 which located in a typical karst terrain in southwestern china the topography is characterized by steep hills that separated by lowland depressions with many potholes and caves and underground streams du et al 2017 the mulun nature reserve was established in 1991 for protecting the subtropical karst ecosystem yang et al 2017 the plant communities are mainly composed of families belonging to tropical and subtropical zones and dominated by subtropical species zheng 1999 this area is currently a primeval forest yang et al 2017 therefore it is a suitable study area for the purposes of this study the climate is dominated by subtropical monsoon zhang et al 2018b with the mean temperature of 18 5 c and mean annual precipitation of 1389 mm yr 1 the long term 1960 2016 mean annual rainy days in this region is 161 days year 1 and the mean longest dry spells between two rainfalls is 25 9 8 0 days 2 2 experimental sites and field survey three relatively homogeneous sites 20 m 20 m with few outcrops were selected these sites are respectively located in or on the depression 447 3 m a s l denoted as dec mid slope 565 1 m a s l denoted as msc and the summit 610 7 m a s l denoted as suc of a typical hill fig 1 a survey was conducted to investigate the dominating species and their dbh diameter at breast height and the hydrogeological properties including outcrops soil distribution and soil volume in the field survey all the plants with dbh larger than 1 0 cm were recorded table 1 at each site three pits with 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 4 m which are located at the two corners and the central point of the plot were excavated to determine the hydrogeological properties of shallow layer 0 40 cm the soil volume m3 m 3 was determined by using a water tanks the stones and roots were picked out 2 3 field measurements the tree transpiration was monitored by using the thermal dissipation probe tdp dynamax https dynamaxcorp com in each plot a total of 7 dynamax tdps were installed table 1 specifically the number of tdps for each species was approximately determined by the species abundance and the dbh distribution table 1 all the tdps were installed in the north of the trunks the shallow layer water content slwc was detected by using the time domain reflectometry probes tdr hydra probe ii https www fondriest com the tdrs were installed in the 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm layer note that in the msc and suc the 30 40 cm layer is no longer soil but weathered soft bedrock sand like rock debris with stones therefore the tdrs were planted in the sand like rock debris in these layers the tdp and tdr measurements were collected every 10 min using cr 1000 data logger from july 2017 to june 2019 the meteorological data including solar radiation air pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were monitored every 30 min using a meteorological station near the experimental site on the other hand a total of 55 trees with varying dbh 1 9 20 5 cm covering the dominating species were selected to determine the sapwood area fresh cores were sampled by using an increment borer and then the sapwood thickness was observed in front of a light source saugier et al 1997 2 4 transpiration and shallow layer water content slwc the sap flow density m3 m 2 h 1 for each tree was estimated as granier 1985 1987 granier et al 2000 1 sfd 3600 119 10 6 t max t t 1 231 where 3600 means the 3600 s in an hour t is the temperature difference between the heated probe and the reference probe and t max is the maximum t in a day the overall transpiration of the communities was estimated based on the mean sap flow density and the total sapwood area of the plot the sapwood areas of all the recorded plants were estimated based on the dbh by using the following relationship derived from the observed sapwood thickness mentioned in section 2 2 2 a sw 0 32 dbh 2 3 02 dbh 7 50 r 2 0 96 n 55 where a sw is the sapwood area of a plant cm2 then the transpiration denoted as t mm h 1 for each plot was calculated as 3 t 1 area i 1 m sfd i m j 1 n a swj 1 area i 1 7 sfd i 7 j 1 n 0 32 dbh j 2 3 02 dbh j 7 50 where area is the area of the plot m means the number of trees installed with tdp probes and n is the number of trees in each plot 20 m 20 m all the plants with dbh 1 0 cm were recorded on the other hand the mean shallow layer water content slwc was estimated as 4 slwc k 1 k sw k d k k 1 k d k where k is the number of soil layers sw k is the moisture content in the kth layer and d k is the depth or thickness of the kth layer the changes in slwc denoted as s mm in a specific period was estimated as 5 s 400 sv k 1 k sw k t 1 d k k 1 k d k k 1 k sw k t 2 d k k 1 k d k where 400 means that 0 4 m equal to 400 mm the sv is the soil volume sw k t 1 cm3 cm 3 and sw k t 2 are the water content in kth layer at time t 1 the start and t 2 the end respectively 2 5 data analysis the estimated transpiration for the dec was evaluated by comparing to the eddy flux data latent flux which was collected from an eddy tower li7500a near the dec fig 1 note that due to the frequent rainfalls reasonable records in a total of 136 days were available annual transpiration was calculated by aggregating the daily values in order to investigate the influencing factors correlation analyses were conducted among the environmental factors and transpiration on the other hand daily s t ratio was calculated for investigating the relationships between vegetation transpiration and slwc it was important to note that since the s were negative in rainy days due to the recharged media by rainfall the data were deleted here 3 results 3 1 environmental properties of the study sites results showed that the soil layer in the dec was relatively thick 0 4 m and the one in the msc and suc were thin being about 0 1 0 4 m fig 1 the underlying bedrocks in msc and suc are well weathered which are full of debris like a mixture of sands and stones fig 1 the soil volume in dec msc and suc were 61 35 82 47 and 100 respectively and the saturated water content were 0 38 0 05 0 52 0 04 and 0 51 0 05 cm3 cm 3 respectively meanwhile the dominating species in the three communities were differed dramatically to each other table 1 in the two years there were a total of 315 rainy days mean of 157 5 days year 1 45 0 of the total days being quite similar to the long term mean value 161 0 days year 1 fig 2a the longest dry spell between two rainfalls was 27 days which is close to the long term mean value in this region 25 9 8 0 days the mean annual precipitation was 1312 1 mm yr 1 of which 76 9 was received in the period from april to october the air temperature was mainly higher than 10 0 c in winter and lower than 30 0 c in summer fig 2b with the annual mean being 19 3 7 0 c the vpd was generally lower than 1 5 kpa and relatively high and low vpd were generally observed in summer and in winter respectively the mean vpd during the two years was 0 28 0 2 kpa fig 2d the wind speed showed no strong seasonality and mainly fluctuated around 1 0 m s 1 fig 2e on the other hand the mean daily solar radiation was 10 3 6 7 mj m 2 d 1 of which the maximum being 27 7 mj m 2 d 1 fig 2f 3 2 transpiration of the three forest communities the sap flow in the three communities were highly correlated to each other data showed that the determination coefficients r 2 among them were higher than 0 8 on the other hand the estimated transpiration in the dec was very close to the eddy et evapotranspiration fig 3 especially in the growing seasons figs 3 and 4a in the non growing seasons the eddy et was slightly higher than the estimated transpiration fig 4a this is because that the transpiration occupied larger lower portion of the evapotranspiration including transpiration and soil evaporation in the growing non growing seasons the regression and determination coefficient r 2 of the linear regression between eddy et and sap flow based transpiration was 0 84 and 1 09 respectively fig 4b these demonstrated the reliability of the estimated transpiration during the experimental period the mean annual transpiration in suc msc and dec was 701 0 mm yr 1 626 4 mm yr 1 and 663 1 mm yr 1 respectively fig 4c accounting for about 50 3 of the annual precipitation 1312 1 mm yr 1 and 44 6 of the downward solar radiation 3600 mj m 2 yr 1 in particular the mean transpiration in the suc msc and dec was 0 57 0 66 0 97 0 94 and 0 70 0 68 mm d 1 respectively in winter table 2 and 2 47 1 79 1 93 1 96 2 22 2 23 mm d 1 in spring march to may 3 89 1 83 2 91 2 92 3 20 3 21 mm d 1 in summer june to august and 1 46 1 70 1 50 1 49 1 23 1 22 mm d 1 in autumn september to november table 2 3 3 factors for transpiration and the role of the shallow layer water content the transpiration was positively correlated to the air temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 solar radiation r 0 8 p 0 05 and vpd r 0 3 p 0 05 but showed no strong relationship with the shallow layer water content slwc table 3 however although no significant correlation existed between the slwc and transpiration the dynamic patterns of slwc and transpiration coupled closely fig 5 fig 5 gives three examples for the dynamics of sap flow density and slwc clearly decrease in slwc mainly occurred in the daytime when the transpiration was relatively high fig 5 the slwc differed remarkably in the three communities fig 6 in particular the slwc in suc ranged 0 15 0 34 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 23 cm3 cm 3 and the ranges for msc and dec were 0 28 0 48 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 38 cm3 cm 3 and 0 37 0 49 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 44 cm3 cm 3 respectively fig 6 data also showed that the coefficient of variation of slwc in suc msc and dec was 21 4 13 1 and 6 3 respectively the daily s t ratio of daily slwc change to transpiration was generally higher than 1 0 in the day when precipitation received and then decreased gradually in the following days fig 6 in growing seasons the s t in suc and msc could reach to be near zero in dry spells figs 6a b and fig 7 however the transpiration in dry spells was still high 4 0 mm d 1 fig 7 even when the slwc decreased to 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in the suc fig 7a d and g during the dry spells the transpiration still showed no significant correlation with the slwc r 0 3 p 0 05 n 15 in the non growing seasons the s t were generally higher than 1 0 fig 6a and b there were two reasons the first is because that in the growing non growing seasons the vegetation transpiration occupies the major minor part of evapotranspiration includes transpiration and soil evaporation fig 4 the second is that the slwc content in rainy days were higher than the field water holding capacity which leaded to literal and vertical water redistribution within a period s t 1 0 means that most of the transpired water come from the shallow layer according to this overall 77 6 78 3 and 90 8 of the transpired water in suc msc and dec respectively were from the shallow layer 4 discussion the meteorological data showed that these two years were two normal years in terms of weather because the number of rainy days the longest dry spell total precipitation amount and air temperature were closed to the long term mean values section 2 1 fig 2 in these two years the annual transpiration of the three communities were around 660 mm yr 1 being similar to or slightly lower than the findings in previous studies heilman et al 2009 huang et al 2011 for instance huang et al 2011 found a 836 mm yr 1 for a cyclobalanopsis glauca forest in guilin in the same province as in this study and heilman et al 2009 found a 708 mm yr 1 for an oak ashe juniper woodland on the karstic edwards plateau the differences can be attributed to the different species meteorological conditions and hydrogeological basis what s surprising is that the suc exhibited slightly higher transpiration than the msc and dec fig 5 where the sap flow density was slightly higher than that in suc the linear regression coefficient 1 0 the explanation is that the biomass in suc was higher than those in dec and msc table 1 similar to previous studies huang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018a significant correlations p 0 05 were also found among transpiration and meteorological factors table 2 however no strong relationship was found between transpiration and the slwc shallow layer water content these means that slwc is not the controlling factor of transpiration in this region at least in normal years because the slwc in this region even at the summit rarely decreased to low levels generally 0 15 cm3 cm 3 due to the frequent precipitation fig 6 ungar et al 2013 however these do not mean that slwc was not important for the transpiration the closely coupled dynamic patterns of slwc and transpiration fig 5 and the temporal patterns in the s t ratio of slwc change to transpiration figs 6 and 7 suggested that the transpired water of the three communities mainly came from the shallow layer these are in good agreement with gu et al 2014 which pointed out that the cyclobalanopsis glauca a dominating species in karst landform in sw china southwestern china extracted water mainly from shallow soil layers similarly heilman et al 2009 and schwinning 2008 also found that the woodland on the semiarid edwards plateau relied heavily on water in shallow layers the mechanisms for the facts that most of the transpired water come from the shallow layers in this study and the edwards plateau may be different in this study it would be that the water content in the shallow layers are relatively abundant while on the edwards plateau the reason may be the water deficit in the deep layer the explanations can be indirectly demonstrated by the findings in mccole and stern 2007 which concluded that the water sources of juniper which located in an area being adjacent to a spring on the edwards plateau changed from a dominantly deep water source during the hot and dry summer to a dominantly shallow water source during the cool and moist winter the dynamics of s t generally decreasing from higher than 1 0 to lower than 1 0 during the dry spells between two rainfalls figs 6 and 7 suggested that vegetation can simultaneously uptake water from the shallow and deep layers more importantly when the s t ratio decreased to a low level e g in the suc the transpiration or sap flow density did not noticeably decrease fig 7 these results implied that the plants could uptake abundant water from the deep layers e g weathered rocks when the slwc was limited as pointed out in previous studies estrada medina et al 2013 nie et al 2010 2012 querejeta et al 2007 rong et al 2011 schwinning 2008 however there are some limitations of this work firstly the slwc was estimated based on tdr measurements therefore the reliability of slwc can be affected by the heterogeneous hydrogeological properties the uncertainties in slwc would influence the results of where and how much the water came from nevertheless the closely coupled dynamics of sap flow and slwc demonstrated that the plants mainly uptake the water in shallow layers in this region secondly these findings could not answer the question that how much water the underlying bedrocks can provide for the plants therefore further and more detailed studies are still needed 5 implications based on the results presented above it is reasonable to conclude that the climax forest communities generally uptake water from the shallow layers and can efficiently obtain water from the deep layers in dry spells when the slwc is limited therefore root zone water availability may not be the limiting factor for deep rooting forests in this area the weak sensitivity of transpiration of climax forests to slwc depends on the deep rooting characteristics and the water storage in the weathered bedrocks to shallow rooting species e g grass low water holding capacity of the shallow layers should be a controlling factor in the past several decades karst landform in sw china experienced a severe degradation process namely rocky desertification transform a karst area covered by vegetation and soil into a rocky landscape due to the intensive human activities and vulnerable hydrogeological base jiang et al 2014 the original woodland was transformed to crop land even the steep slopes and the plants were cut for energy purpose e g cooking and heating jiang et al 2014 on the surface these practices destroyed the vegetation cover and directly leaded to rocky desertification but on a deeper level rocky desertification broke the eco hydrological linkages between the ecosystem and the deep layer system without the water supporting from the deep layers the low water holding capacity in the karst up layer not only make it is hard to maintain ecosystem stability but also hinder the vegetation recovery in an ecosystem the deep rooting systems can be considered as a biological irrigation tool via hydraulic lift when the soil moisture in the up layer is limited izumi et al 2018 prieto et al 2011 sekiya et al 2011 for example sekiya et al 2011 designed an intercropping compound ecosystem where the shallow rooting species e g brassica rapa var peruviridis was watered by the deep rooting plants e g festuca arundinacea from this perspective hydraulic lift can help to establish the eco hydrological linkages between the ecosystem and deep layer system further promote deep layer water use and improve the targeted plants productivity in order to improve the ecological environment a large scale ecological restoration project namely the grain for green project cheng et al 2015 tong et al 2018 yang et al 2017 is being implemented in sw china we suggest that people and policy makers should pay more attention to reestablish the eco hydrological linkages between the recovered vegetation and the deep layer system by using deep rooting species which would improve the root zone water availability and help for coping with the challenges from more frequent climate extremes liu et al 2015 2014a 6 conclusion this study conducted a two year experiment to investigate the transpiration and its controlling factors for typical climax forest communities in sw china three experimental sites 20 m 20 m which located in the depression dec mid slope msc and summit suc of a typical karst hill were selected before the experiment a survey was conducted to determine the plant species distribution and their sizes and the soil volume of the sallow layers 0 40 cm the transpiration was estimated based on the thermal dissipation probe tdp measurements and the shallow layer water content slwc was monitored by using tdr probes results showed that the slwc ranged 0 15 0 34 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 23 cm3 cm 3 0 28 0 48 cm3 cm 3 men of 0 38 cm3 cm 3 and 0 37 0 49 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 44 cm3 cm 3 respectively in the suc msc and dec during the study period the mean annual transpiration for suc msc and dec were 701 0 mm yr 1 626 4 mm yr 1 and 663 1 mm yr 1 respectively overall 77 6 78 3 and 90 8 of the transpired water respectively in suc msc and dec came from the shallow layers 0 40 cm the transpiration was closely correlated to the air temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 radiation r 0 8 p 0 05 and vpd r 0 3 p 0 05 but showed no significant relationship with the slwc furthermore the dynamic patterns of s t ratio of slwc change to transpiration and the high transpiration in dry spells 4 0 mm d 1 in the growing season indicated that the plants could simultaneously uptake water from the shallow and deep layers and could obtain sufficient water from deep layers when the slwc was limited the findings may be helpful for ecological restoration and management related policy making for

10323,knowledge of vegetation water depletion and the underlying mechanisms are essential for understanding eco hydrological processes and fragile ecological environment protection based on a 2 year field experiments this study investigated the transpiration and its influencing factors for three karstic climax forest communities located in the depression dec mid slope msc and summit suc of a typical karst hill in southwestern china the meteorological factors sap flow eddy covariance and soil moisture were measured results showed that the annual transpiration for suc msc and dec were 701 0 mm yr 1 626 4 mm yr 1 and 663 1 mm yr 1 respectively the daily transpiration was significantly correlated to the air temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 solar radiation r 0 8 p 0 05 and water vapor pressure deficit r 0 3 p 0 05 but showed no strong relationship with the shallow layer water content slwc 0 40 cm moreover the transpiration of the three communities generally maintained high rate e g 4 0 mm d 1 in the growing seasons even when the slwc dropped to about 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in the suc during dry spells overall 77 6 78 3 and 90 8 of the transpired water in the suc msc and dec respectively came from the shallow layer these suggested that the plants in this region could uptake water from deep layers when the slwc is limited and implied that the climax forest communities were generally not limited by water at least in normal years keywords karst ecosystem water depletion water sources eco hydrology 1 introduction karst terrain represents about 10 of the continental area and plays key roles in global biogenic elements cycle and water resources cheng et al 2015 hartmann et al 2014 liu et al 2016 owing to the carbonate nature karst landscape is generally characterized by thin soil layer high infiltration capacity and complex topography wilcox et al 2007 rendering the eco hydrological processes quite different from other ecosystems hartmann et al 2014 in particular the high infiltration and thin soil layer in karst region generally lead to high percolation and relatively low water holding capacity water availability in the up layer which will deeply affect the plant water relations efe 2014 liu et al 2016 in recent years the plant water relations in shallow soil area including the karst terrain drawn much concerns nie et al 2012 rodriguez robles et al 2015 schwinning 2008 wilcox et al 2005 there is a common point that the plants especially the deep rooting plants maeght et al 2013 can utilize water from both soil and the epikarst zone and can even alter their water use strategies during wet and dry seasons jackson et al 2000 maeght et al 2013 nie et al 2012 pockman et al 2008 rong et al 2011 depending on the root zone water availability and the habits of plants mcdowell et al 2008 for example some studies pointed out that the water sources of plants are dynamic ding et al 2018 mccole and stern 2007 nie et al 2010 rodriguez robles et al 2015 while some studies showed that plants mainly uptake water from shallow layer gu et al 2014 heilman et al 2009 schwinning 2008 these indicate that water sources of plants have a close relationship with site specific differences nie et al 2010 although the importance of the deep water sources for plants has been recognized crouchet et al 2019b hubbert et al 2001 jackson et al 2000 liu et al 2014b pockman et al 2008 previous studies mainly focus on the semi arid karst ecosystems e g edward plateau heilman et al 2009 huang et al 2011 nie et al 2010 schwinning 2008 wilcox et al 2005 the studies e g water depletion water sources in humid karst terrain like southwestern china are still limited to date deng et al 2012 huang et al 2011 nie et al 2012 rong et al 2011 the karst region in southwestern china is characterized by frequent precipitation with the annual amount being higher than 1200 mm yr 1 nie et al 2010 the frequent precipitation makes the soil moisture content maintain relatively high in this region zhang et al 2006 2018a however the shallow layer water content slwc would also drop to a very low level in dry spells sun et al 2018 on the other hand frequent precipitation also provides the opportunity for the fractured bedrocks to store relatively high water amount therefore in this region the responses of transpiration to slwc and the importance of deep layer water in water depletion might be different from those in the semi arid karstic regions on the other hand karstic ecosystems are usually considered to be fragile brinkmann and parise 2012 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2004 however some studies showed that the vegetation growth especially the deep rooting forest was not affected by seasonal droughts for example zhang and zhang 2019 found negative correlations between the palmer severity drought index psdi and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi over southwestern china meaning that seasonal droughts may promote the growth of vegetation in this region similarly crouchet et al 2019a found a positive correlation between the bedrock depth and the oak crown death rate during a hot drought on the edwards plateau karst landform these findings imply that vegetation in karst region may be not as fragile as that in our conventional knowledge thus what happened behind these phenomena knowledge of plant water relations is essential for understanding the mechanisms of eco hydrological processes and ecological environment protection therefore this study conducted a 2 year field experiment aimed to 1 quantify water depletion for typical karstic forests in humid karst terrain 2 to identify the main influencing factors for vegetation transpiration and 3 to figure out the implications of the results in ecological restoration in karst region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the two year experiments were carried out in the mulun national nature reserve 107 54 108 05 e 25 07 25 12 n fig 1 which located in a typical karst terrain in southwestern china the topography is characterized by steep hills that separated by lowland depressions with many potholes and caves and underground streams du et al 2017 the mulun nature reserve was established in 1991 for protecting the subtropical karst ecosystem yang et al 2017 the plant communities are mainly composed of families belonging to tropical and subtropical zones and dominated by subtropical species zheng 1999 this area is currently a primeval forest yang et al 2017 therefore it is a suitable study area for the purposes of this study the climate is dominated by subtropical monsoon zhang et al 2018b with the mean temperature of 18 5 c and mean annual precipitation of 1389 mm yr 1 the long term 1960 2016 mean annual rainy days in this region is 161 days year 1 and the mean longest dry spells between two rainfalls is 25 9 8 0 days 2 2 experimental sites and field survey three relatively homogeneous sites 20 m 20 m with few outcrops were selected these sites are respectively located in or on the depression 447 3 m a s l denoted as dec mid slope 565 1 m a s l denoted as msc and the summit 610 7 m a s l denoted as suc of a typical hill fig 1 a survey was conducted to investigate the dominating species and their dbh diameter at breast height and the hydrogeological properties including outcrops soil distribution and soil volume in the field survey all the plants with dbh larger than 1 0 cm were recorded table 1 at each site three pits with 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 4 m which are located at the two corners and the central point of the plot were excavated to determine the hydrogeological properties of shallow layer 0 40 cm the soil volume m3 m 3 was determined by using a water tanks the stones and roots were picked out 2 3 field measurements the tree transpiration was monitored by using the thermal dissipation probe tdp dynamax https dynamaxcorp com in each plot a total of 7 dynamax tdps were installed table 1 specifically the number of tdps for each species was approximately determined by the species abundance and the dbh distribution table 1 all the tdps were installed in the north of the trunks the shallow layer water content slwc was detected by using the time domain reflectometry probes tdr hydra probe ii https www fondriest com the tdrs were installed in the 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm layer note that in the msc and suc the 30 40 cm layer is no longer soil but weathered soft bedrock sand like rock debris with stones therefore the tdrs were planted in the sand like rock debris in these layers the tdp and tdr measurements were collected every 10 min using cr 1000 data logger from july 2017 to june 2019 the meteorological data including solar radiation air pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were monitored every 30 min using a meteorological station near the experimental site on the other hand a total of 55 trees with varying dbh 1 9 20 5 cm covering the dominating species were selected to determine the sapwood area fresh cores were sampled by using an increment borer and then the sapwood thickness was observed in front of a light source saugier et al 1997 2 4 transpiration and shallow layer water content slwc the sap flow density m3 m 2 h 1 for each tree was estimated as granier 1985 1987 granier et al 2000 1 sfd 3600 119 10 6 t max t t 1 231 where 3600 means the 3600 s in an hour t is the temperature difference between the heated probe and the reference probe and t max is the maximum t in a day the overall transpiration of the communities was estimated based on the mean sap flow density and the total sapwood area of the plot the sapwood areas of all the recorded plants were estimated based on the dbh by using the following relationship derived from the observed sapwood thickness mentioned in section 2 2 2 a sw 0 32 dbh 2 3 02 dbh 7 50 r 2 0 96 n 55 where a sw is the sapwood area of a plant cm2 then the transpiration denoted as t mm h 1 for each plot was calculated as 3 t 1 area i 1 m sfd i m j 1 n a swj 1 area i 1 7 sfd i 7 j 1 n 0 32 dbh j 2 3 02 dbh j 7 50 where area is the area of the plot m means the number of trees installed with tdp probes and n is the number of trees in each plot 20 m 20 m all the plants with dbh 1 0 cm were recorded on the other hand the mean shallow layer water content slwc was estimated as 4 slwc k 1 k sw k d k k 1 k d k where k is the number of soil layers sw k is the moisture content in the kth layer and d k is the depth or thickness of the kth layer the changes in slwc denoted as s mm in a specific period was estimated as 5 s 400 sv k 1 k sw k t 1 d k k 1 k d k k 1 k sw k t 2 d k k 1 k d k where 400 means that 0 4 m equal to 400 mm the sv is the soil volume sw k t 1 cm3 cm 3 and sw k t 2 are the water content in kth layer at time t 1 the start and t 2 the end respectively 2 5 data analysis the estimated transpiration for the dec was evaluated by comparing to the eddy flux data latent flux which was collected from an eddy tower li7500a near the dec fig 1 note that due to the frequent rainfalls reasonable records in a total of 136 days were available annual transpiration was calculated by aggregating the daily values in order to investigate the influencing factors correlation analyses were conducted among the environmental factors and transpiration on the other hand daily s t ratio was calculated for investigating the relationships between vegetation transpiration and slwc it was important to note that since the s were negative in rainy days due to the recharged media by rainfall the data were deleted here 3 results 3 1 environmental properties of the study sites results showed that the soil layer in the dec was relatively thick 0 4 m and the one in the msc and suc were thin being about 0 1 0 4 m fig 1 the underlying bedrocks in msc and suc are well weathered which are full of debris like a mixture of sands and stones fig 1 the soil volume in dec msc and suc were 61 35 82 47 and 100 respectively and the saturated water content were 0 38 0 05 0 52 0 04 and 0 51 0 05 cm3 cm 3 respectively meanwhile the dominating species in the three communities were differed dramatically to each other table 1 in the two years there were a total of 315 rainy days mean of 157 5 days year 1 45 0 of the total days being quite similar to the long term mean value 161 0 days year 1 fig 2a the longest dry spell between two rainfalls was 27 days which is close to the long term mean value in this region 25 9 8 0 days the mean annual precipitation was 1312 1 mm yr 1 of which 76 9 was received in the period from april to october the air temperature was mainly higher than 10 0 c in winter and lower than 30 0 c in summer fig 2b with the annual mean being 19 3 7 0 c the vpd was generally lower than 1 5 kpa and relatively high and low vpd were generally observed in summer and in winter respectively the mean vpd during the two years was 0 28 0 2 kpa fig 2d the wind speed showed no strong seasonality and mainly fluctuated around 1 0 m s 1 fig 2e on the other hand the mean daily solar radiation was 10 3 6 7 mj m 2 d 1 of which the maximum being 27 7 mj m 2 d 1 fig 2f 3 2 transpiration of the three forest communities the sap flow in the three communities were highly correlated to each other data showed that the determination coefficients r 2 among them were higher than 0 8 on the other hand the estimated transpiration in the dec was very close to the eddy et evapotranspiration fig 3 especially in the growing seasons figs 3 and 4a in the non growing seasons the eddy et was slightly higher than the estimated transpiration fig 4a this is because that the transpiration occupied larger lower portion of the evapotranspiration including transpiration and soil evaporation in the growing non growing seasons the regression and determination coefficient r 2 of the linear regression between eddy et and sap flow based transpiration was 0 84 and 1 09 respectively fig 4b these demonstrated the reliability of the estimated transpiration during the experimental period the mean annual transpiration in suc msc and dec was 701 0 mm yr 1 626 4 mm yr 1 and 663 1 mm yr 1 respectively fig 4c accounting for about 50 3 of the annual precipitation 1312 1 mm yr 1 and 44 6 of the downward solar radiation 3600 mj m 2 yr 1 in particular the mean transpiration in the suc msc and dec was 0 57 0 66 0 97 0 94 and 0 70 0 68 mm d 1 respectively in winter table 2 and 2 47 1 79 1 93 1 96 2 22 2 23 mm d 1 in spring march to may 3 89 1 83 2 91 2 92 3 20 3 21 mm d 1 in summer june to august and 1 46 1 70 1 50 1 49 1 23 1 22 mm d 1 in autumn september to november table 2 3 3 factors for transpiration and the role of the shallow layer water content the transpiration was positively correlated to the air temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 solar radiation r 0 8 p 0 05 and vpd r 0 3 p 0 05 but showed no strong relationship with the shallow layer water content slwc table 3 however although no significant correlation existed between the slwc and transpiration the dynamic patterns of slwc and transpiration coupled closely fig 5 fig 5 gives three examples for the dynamics of sap flow density and slwc clearly decrease in slwc mainly occurred in the daytime when the transpiration was relatively high fig 5 the slwc differed remarkably in the three communities fig 6 in particular the slwc in suc ranged 0 15 0 34 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 23 cm3 cm 3 and the ranges for msc and dec were 0 28 0 48 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 38 cm3 cm 3 and 0 37 0 49 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 44 cm3 cm 3 respectively fig 6 data also showed that the coefficient of variation of slwc in suc msc and dec was 21 4 13 1 and 6 3 respectively the daily s t ratio of daily slwc change to transpiration was generally higher than 1 0 in the day when precipitation received and then decreased gradually in the following days fig 6 in growing seasons the s t in suc and msc could reach to be near zero in dry spells figs 6a b and fig 7 however the transpiration in dry spells was still high 4 0 mm d 1 fig 7 even when the slwc decreased to 0 15 cm3 cm 3 in the suc fig 7a d and g during the dry spells the transpiration still showed no significant correlation with the slwc r 0 3 p 0 05 n 15 in the non growing seasons the s t were generally higher than 1 0 fig 6a and b there were two reasons the first is because that in the growing non growing seasons the vegetation transpiration occupies the major minor part of evapotranspiration includes transpiration and soil evaporation fig 4 the second is that the slwc content in rainy days were higher than the field water holding capacity which leaded to literal and vertical water redistribution within a period s t 1 0 means that most of the transpired water come from the shallow layer according to this overall 77 6 78 3 and 90 8 of the transpired water in suc msc and dec respectively were from the shallow layer 4 discussion the meteorological data showed that these two years were two normal years in terms of weather because the number of rainy days the longest dry spell total precipitation amount and air temperature were closed to the long term mean values section 2 1 fig 2 in these two years the annual transpiration of the three communities were around 660 mm yr 1 being similar to or slightly lower than the findings in previous studies heilman et al 2009 huang et al 2011 for instance huang et al 2011 found a 836 mm yr 1 for a cyclobalanopsis glauca forest in guilin in the same province as in this study and heilman et al 2009 found a 708 mm yr 1 for an oak ashe juniper woodland on the karstic edwards plateau the differences can be attributed to the different species meteorological conditions and hydrogeological basis what s surprising is that the suc exhibited slightly higher transpiration than the msc and dec fig 5 where the sap flow density was slightly higher than that in suc the linear regression coefficient 1 0 the explanation is that the biomass in suc was higher than those in dec and msc table 1 similar to previous studies huang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018a significant correlations p 0 05 were also found among transpiration and meteorological factors table 2 however no strong relationship was found between transpiration and the slwc shallow layer water content these means that slwc is not the controlling factor of transpiration in this region at least in normal years because the slwc in this region even at the summit rarely decreased to low levels generally 0 15 cm3 cm 3 due to the frequent precipitation fig 6 ungar et al 2013 however these do not mean that slwc was not important for the transpiration the closely coupled dynamic patterns of slwc and transpiration fig 5 and the temporal patterns in the s t ratio of slwc change to transpiration figs 6 and 7 suggested that the transpired water of the three communities mainly came from the shallow layer these are in good agreement with gu et al 2014 which pointed out that the cyclobalanopsis glauca a dominating species in karst landform in sw china southwestern china extracted water mainly from shallow soil layers similarly heilman et al 2009 and schwinning 2008 also found that the woodland on the semiarid edwards plateau relied heavily on water in shallow layers the mechanisms for the facts that most of the transpired water come from the shallow layers in this study and the edwards plateau may be different in this study it would be that the water content in the shallow layers are relatively abundant while on the edwards plateau the reason may be the water deficit in the deep layer the explanations can be indirectly demonstrated by the findings in mccole and stern 2007 which concluded that the water sources of juniper which located in an area being adjacent to a spring on the edwards plateau changed from a dominantly deep water source during the hot and dry summer to a dominantly shallow water source during the cool and moist winter the dynamics of s t generally decreasing from higher than 1 0 to lower than 1 0 during the dry spells between two rainfalls figs 6 and 7 suggested that vegetation can simultaneously uptake water from the shallow and deep layers more importantly when the s t ratio decreased to a low level e g in the suc the transpiration or sap flow density did not noticeably decrease fig 7 these results implied that the plants could uptake abundant water from the deep layers e g weathered rocks when the slwc was limited as pointed out in previous studies estrada medina et al 2013 nie et al 2010 2012 querejeta et al 2007 rong et al 2011 schwinning 2008 however there are some limitations of this work firstly the slwc was estimated based on tdr measurements therefore the reliability of slwc can be affected by the heterogeneous hydrogeological properties the uncertainties in slwc would influence the results of where and how much the water came from nevertheless the closely coupled dynamics of sap flow and slwc demonstrated that the plants mainly uptake the water in shallow layers in this region secondly these findings could not answer the question that how much water the underlying bedrocks can provide for the plants therefore further and more detailed studies are still needed 5 implications based on the results presented above it is reasonable to conclude that the climax forest communities generally uptake water from the shallow layers and can efficiently obtain water from the deep layers in dry spells when the slwc is limited therefore root zone water availability may not be the limiting factor for deep rooting forests in this area the weak sensitivity of transpiration of climax forests to slwc depends on the deep rooting characteristics and the water storage in the weathered bedrocks to shallow rooting species e g grass low water holding capacity of the shallow layers should be a controlling factor in the past several decades karst landform in sw china experienced a severe degradation process namely rocky desertification transform a karst area covered by vegetation and soil into a rocky landscape due to the intensive human activities and vulnerable hydrogeological base jiang et al 2014 the original woodland was transformed to crop land even the steep slopes and the plants were cut

desertification broke the eco hydrological linkages between the ecosystem and the deep layer system without the water supporting from the deep layers the low water holding capacity in the karst up layer not only make it is hard to maintain ecosystem stability but also hinder the vegetation recovery in an ecosystem the deep rooting systems can be considered as a biological irrigation tool via hydraulic lift when the soil moisture in the up layer is limited izumi et al 2018 prieto et al 2011 sekiya et al 2011 for example sekiya et al 2011 designed an intercropping compound ecosystem where

hydrological linkages between the ecosystem and deep layer system further promote deep layer water use and improve the targeted plants productivity in order to improve the ecological environment a large scale ecological restoration project namely the grain for green project cheng et al 2015 tong et al 2018 yang et al 2017 is being implemented in sw china we suggest that people and policy makers should pay more attention to reestablish the eco hydrological linkages between the recovered vegetation and the deep layer system by using deep rooting species which would improve the root zone water availability and help for coping with the challenges from more frequent climate extremes liu et al 2015 2014a 6 conclusion this study conducted a two year experiment to investigate the transpiration and its controlling factors for typical climax forest communities in sw china three experimental sites 20 m 20 m which located in the depression dec mid slope msc and summit suc of a typical karst hill were selected before the experiment a survey was conducted to determine the plant species distribution and their sizes and the soil volume of the sallow layers 0 40 cm the transpiration was estimated based on the thermal dissipation probe tdp measurements and the shallow layer water content slwc was monitored by using tdr probes results showed that the slwc ranged 0 15 0 34 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 23 cm3 cm 3 0 28 0 48 cm3 cm 3 men of 0 38 cm3 cm 3 and 0 37 0 49 cm3 cm 3 mean of 0 44 cm3 cm 3 respectively in the suc msc and dec during the study period the mean annual transpiration for suc msc and dec were 701 0 mm yr 1 626 4 mm yr 1 and 663 1 mm yr 1 respectively overall 77 6 78 3 and 90 8 of the transpired water respectively in suc msc and dec came from the shallow layers 0 40 cm the transpiration was closely correlated to the air temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 radiation r 0 8 p 0 05 and vpd r 0 3 p 0 05 but showed no significant relationship with the slwc furthermore the dynamic patterns of s t ratio of slwc change to transpiration and the high transpiration in dry spells 4 0 mm d 1 in the growing season indicated that the plants could simultaneously uptake water from the shallow and deep layers and could obtain sufficient water from deep layers when the slwc was limited the findings may be helpful for ecological restoration and management related policy making for

10324,although the deficit irrigation saves the water consumption but it may cause the loss of yield recently the nano fertilizers have been used in the agriculture as an approach to minimize the adverse effects of drought stress thus in this study a two year 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winter wheat seasons split plot field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of the nano chelating fertilizers on the yield and water use efficiency of the wheat with three replications in iran the main plots consisted of full and deficit irrigation 50 of full irrigation requirement and the subplots included foliar spraying with nano chelated silicon boron and zinc fertilizers and control the total irrigation water was equal to 457 and 228 mm for full and deficit irrigation respectively for the first year and it was equal to 378 and 190 mm respectively for the second year deficit irrigation significantly decreased the yield components relative water content rwc and cell membrane stability index cmsi leading to reduction of the grain yield by 43 but it increased the grain protein wue and superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat activities nano zinc increased the protein percentage of wheat grain in both years and irrigation regimes the activity of sod and cat was improved especially in the deficit irrigated plants and also the yield yield components rwc and cmsi of wheat by applying the nano fertilizers under both irrigation conditions nano silica application under deficit irrigation in both years resulted in 28 and 32 increase in the grain yield respectively compared to the control the highest wue was obtained using the nano silica under deficit irrigation condition in both experiments generally the results indicated the considerable importance of the nano silica fertilizer in reducing the damage caused by the deficit irrigation and improving the growth characteristics of the wheat keywords nano silica nanoparticles protein water use efficiency yield 1 introduction today there are serious concerns about the proper management of water resources especially in the countries facing water crisis on a global scale about 70 of the freshwater is consumed in the agriculture sector so sustainable use of water for agriculture has become a top priority ballesteros et al 2016 agriculture sector has reduced the groundwater levels and the amount of water flowing from the rivers into oceans by consuming much of the available freshwater falkenmark and molden 2008 in the arid and semi arid regions of the world receiving much less rainfall than the requirement of the plants has become a major challenge for subsequent decades geerts and raes 2009 motazedian et al 2019 in general the scarcity of water resources in the world shows the need to change the attitude from maximizing the production per unit area to maximizing the production per unit of consumed water evans and sadler 2008 zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation is one of the most important methods used to reduce the irrigation water use and to cope with the water deficit crisis fereres and soriano 2007 nawaz et al 2015 applied the deficit irrigation at 60 of field capacity and abdel motagally and el zohri 2018 applied it at 50 of field capacity that resulted in 40 and 28 3 reduction in the wheat grain yield respectively on the other hand fereres and soriano 2007 shown that the deficit irrigation increases the water use efficiency wheat triticum aestivum l as one of the most important cereals provides the foods for one fifth of the world s population it accounts for about 218 million hectares of the total cultivated land with a yield rate of more than 771 million tons and providing 21 of the population s food demand tsvetanov et al 2016 it is estimated that the wheat production should be increased by 60 in 2050 to meet the needs of the world s growing population savadi et al 2018 more than 50 of the world s wheat farms are affected by the periodic drought stress habuš jerčić et al 2018 it is expected that frequency and intensity of drought will be increased in the future because of climate change caused by the reduced rainfall and increased evaporation due to the global warming dai 2011 therefore there is need for a detailed understanding of the drought damages on the wheat as well as ways to improve the drought resistance in order to increase its productivity hasanuzzaman et al 2018 nanotechnology has made a real revolution in the agriculture the use of nano fertilizers has led to the increased productivity reduced production costs in the last decade and also has led to the increased production stability due to reduction of biotic and abiotic stresses kashyap et al 2016 2017 more solubility than the other similar non nano fertilizers is the important property of these fertilizers derosa et al 2010 the use of nano zn fertilizer plays an important role in the plant tolerance against the drought through increasing the lipids proteins amino acids and chlorophyll b content sedghi et al 2013 rizwan et al 2019 showed that the application of zinc nano fertilizers increased the growth chlorophyll content gas exchange characteristics and zinc concentration in the wheat grain and also decreased the oxidative stress among different nano fertilizers silica nanoparticles have been shown to improve the biomass yield of cucurbita pepo l siddiqui et al 2014 and hawthorn seedlings ashkavand et al 2018 under stress conditions by enhancing the photosynthesis of the plants numerous reports have suggested that the application of nanoparticles increases the plant resistance against the drought stress by activating the antioxidant enzymes facilitating the uptake process in the plants and enhancing their growth cui et al 2017 tripathi et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2018 the results of the study on the defensive role of silicon against the drought stress 50 of fc in wheat showed that si is very important in the plants physiological processes and improves the wheat growth alzahrani et al 2018 boron b is related to cell wall construction and its application in the nano sized form has been shown to eliminate the problem of slow transfer via phloem tavallali 2017 nano b fertilizer is quickly and easily absorbed by the plants is slowly leached and its effects appear in a short period research has shown that spraying and pretreatment of the sunflower seeds with equal amounts of nano b fertilizer has the same and significant effects on the grain increase compared to the control treatment despite the high potential of nanotechnology innovations in the agriculture there is still a lack of a deep understanding regarding the relationship between the application of the nano fertilizers and growth of the plants guerriero and cai 2018a 2018b although the application of silica zinc and boron nanoparticles has been indicated to improve the growth conditions and has increased the crop yield in the previous studies abdel motagally and el zohri 2018 rastogi et al 2019 ali et al 2019a 2019b but according to the review of the literature there are limited studies about the application of zinc silica and boron nano fertilizers in the wheat farms under deficit water stress condition thus the present experiment was designed and implemented to assay the harmful effects of deficit irrigation in the wheat farming especially in the areas such as urmia lake and to evaluate the compensation of drought induced negative effects by application of the nano chelating fertilizers zinc silica and boron 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site west azerbaijan province located in the northwest of iran excluding the lake urmia covers an area of about 37 412 km2 which is equivalent to 2 25 of iran s area lake urmia is the iran s largest lake which lost about 60 of its surface area and 90 of its volume during 2011 2017 previous studies have attributed the decrease in the lake water surface to the excessive harvesting for agricultural uses exacerbated by the factors such as uncontrolled growth of the irrigated land area excessive construction of the reservoirs and dams as well as low agricultural water use efficiency hassanzadeh et al 2012 west azerbaijan has a semi arid and cold climate with an average annual rainfall of 450 mm the experiment was conducted at oshnavieh city 37 2 n 45 7 e and altitude of 1450 m located in west azerbaijan province iran fig 1 in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 wheat growing seasons table 1 shows some physicochemical properties of the soil in the experimental site by a depth of 60 cm the soil texture included the silty clay with a bulk density of 1 37 g cm 3 and the amount of zn b and si in the soil was equal to 0 67 0 58 and 0 68 ppm respectively 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted with a randomized complete block design arranged as a split plot with three replications the main plots were arranged for two levels of irrigation regimes full irrigation 100 of irrigation requirement and deficit irrigation 50 of irrigation requirement the subplots consisted of foliar spraying using the nano chelated silicon containing 2 chelated silicon and absorbable at ph 3 11 nano chelated zinc containing 12 chelated zinc and absorbable at ph 3 11 and nano chelated boron containing 9 chelated boron and absorbable at ph 3 11 fertilizers pulverized at 2 g l 1 of concentration the foliar fertilization was done firstly in tillering growth stage and the others were performed at 15 day intervals nonchelated silicon boron and zinc fertilizers under the trademark of khazra were produced by the sodour ahrar shargh company in accordance with a patent registered at the united states patent and trademark office uspto us8288587b2 mh n chelate compounds google patents 2012 boron zinc or silicon compounds were separately dissolved in some water and then were put on a shaker in order to produce the chelated nano fertilizers when the compound was completely dissolved in the water organic acid was added to the solution and was allowed to completely dissolve at this stage the initiator was added to allow the nuclei generation to start after 8 10 h when the nuclei generation reached a proper level the capping agent was added to stop the nuclei generation then the solution was left in the laboratory environment for 6 h to stabilize the solution finally the deposited nano particles were separated by the filtration and were dried in the oven at 70 c fig 2 a and b the main plot size was equal to 2 5 12 m and it was as 2 5 2 5 m for the subplot there were eight treatments with three replications the winter wheat cultivar pishgam mainly cultivated in the western cold regions of iran which is resistant against the yellow rust disease was sown at an area of 200 kg ha 1 in rows at 20 cm intervals and 5 cm depth on october 25 2016 and october 27 2017 after maturity the crops were harvested on july 5 2017 and july 8 2018 respectively n p and k fertilizers were applied with amounts of 350 kg ha 1 of urea 50 kg ha 1 of triple superphosphate and 50 kg ha 1 of potassium sulfate 50 k2o based on the fertilizer recommendations obtained from soil testing p k and half of n fertilizers were applied as the basal fertilization before seeding by spreading the fertilizer on the surface and mixing into the soil by a rotary cultivator the remained n fertilizer was applied as the topdressing after tillering growth stage during the experiment all the agricultural and conservation practices control of the insects pests diseases and weeds required for all the plots were performed equally 2 3 irrigation requirement in order to apply irrigation treatments in this study the following equation was applied to determine the amount of applied irrigation water allen et al 1998 1 ir et c r o p eff c r 1 lr e a where ir is plant irrigation requirement mm etc is actual plant evapotranspiration mm r0 is runoff mm cr is capillary ascent mm peff is effective rainfall mm lr is leaching requirement and ea is irrigation efficiency the precise application of irrigation rates based on a reliable method has always been a challenge in drought stress studies according to fao recommendation this method is the most reliable method for estimating the plant water requirement as the calculations of this method is based on daily meteorological data geographical information of the experimental site properties of the plant and is superior to other methods therefore in this study the proposed penman monteith fao 56 method was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of the plant which is presented in eq 2 2 et c k c 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34u 2 in the above equation etc is actual evapotranspiration mm δ is slope of

average wind speed at 2 m m s 1 es is saturation vapor pressure kpa and ea is actual vapor pressure of the environment kpa daily values of δ rn es and ea are calculated using the equations presented to calculate rn the reflection coefficient is considered to be 0 23 green vegetation level since the numerical value of g is small and difficult to measure compared to rn its value is assumed to be zero in daily time step calculations the measured values of minimum temperature maximum temperature and relative humidity are also used to calculate ea and es kc is the vegetation coefficient without units that was calculated for wheat according to the fao recommendation allen et al 1998 the time distribution of rainfall in the region is such that most of the precipitation occurs in winter total rainfall was reported 364 mm and 496 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping season respectively the meteorological parameters needed to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of wheat including daily mean values of air temperature wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours and solar radiation were obtained through the synoptic weather station of oshnavieh which was within a short distance from the farm weather data during the two experimental seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 as well as the long term are presented in fig 3 that have been shown since the establishment of the synoptic weather station of oshnavieh until field experiments 18 year mean in this study the amount of effective rainfall at each irrigation interval was determined to ensure to apply the desired stress 50 of water requirement in the deficit irrigation treatments and to avoid over irrigation in the full irrigation treatments the usda scs method was used to calculate the amount of effective rainfall peff in each irrigation event ali and mubarak 2017 since the dead end plots with appropriate distances between treatments were used in this experiment the runoff value ro was zero and the rate of capillary ascent cr was also zero due to the low water table of the area the leaching requirement lr was calculated by the method used by ayers and westcott 1976 and the salinity value of soil saturation extract ece was assumed to be 6 dsm 1 for a 0 decrease in wheat yield as the salinity of irrigation water was 2 dsm 1 the amount of leaching requirement was less than 10 due to lack of water loss in the plumbing system between treatments lack of runoff as well as moisture storage of irrigation water of the root in the interval between the two irrigations irrigation efficiency was determined to be 90 applying this value for efficiency also led to offset the leaching requirement which was obtained less than 10 after determining the amount of water consumed the experimental plots were plumbed by a network of polyethylene pipes and the amount of irrigation water in each irrigation cycle for each plot was measured by volume flow meter to ensure uniform plant establishment all treatments received the same calculated water requirement in autumn by starting irrigation from april to the last irrigation in june the treatments under deficit irrigation were irrigated with 50 of water requirement and the treatments under full irrigation with 100 of water requirement 2 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency is introduced as the ratio of plant yield to actual evapotranspiration and represents an indicator of efficiency in agricultural science the following equation is used to calculate water use efficiency katerji and mastrorilli 2014 3 wue y et c where wue is water use efficiency kg m 3 y is yield kg ha 1 and etc is actual evapotranspiration kg m 3 2 5 growth parameters and measurements in this study total yield and its components as well as characteristics such as spike length cm number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight g stem length cm biological yield kg ha 1 grain yield kg ha 1 and harvest index were measured and recorded after completion of the plant growth cycle all wheat of residual planting lines was manually harvested and total yield was measured to avoid marginal effects by neglecting the two planting lines next to the ridges of each plot for plant height measurement ten plants were randomly selected from each plot and height was measured in centimeters by a graded ruler with millimeter precision from soil surface to terminal spikelet of the plant regardless of awe to determine the spike length the mean base distance of spike to terminal spikelet was randomly measured in ten plants and recorded in centimeters for each plant regardless of awe length to determine the number of grains per spike ten clusters were randomly selected and the mean number of grains in them was measured furthermore to measure 1000 grain weight an average weight of ten samples of 100 grain harvested were used 3 times which was to proportional to 1000 grain weight for this end digital weighing scale with 0 01 gram accuracy was used to determine the harvest index of all the plants in the experimental plot by eliminating two rows of planting on the sides of the plot they were cut from the bottom in each plot and after drying in air for five days the weight of all plants was weighed with scales and recorded as the biological yield then the grains in all spikes harvested were weighed and considered as economic yield finally by dividing the economic yield of the sample in each replication separately by the biological yield of the same sample in the same replication under both deficit irrigation and full irrigation conditions the harvest index value was calculated separately 4 hi gy b iomass ag where hi is harvest index gy is grain yield kg ha 1 and biomassag is above ground biomass kg ha 1 2 5 1 relative water content rwc to determine the relative water content rwc of the leaf five young and fully developed flag leaves from each treatment were randomly selected and cut at the beginning of the grain filling phase may 30 and june 7 respectively for the first and second years of the experiment then they were quickly taken to the laboratory inside the polyethylene bag the selected samples of the leaves were immediately weighed fresh weight then placed in distilled water for three hours and their weight was determined again turgidity weight finally by placing the samples in an oven at 65 c for 48 h the dry weight of the samples was determined and using the equation below the relative water content of the leaves for each experimental treatment was measured barrs and weatherley 1962 5 r w c f w d w t w d w 100 where rwc is the relative water content of leaves fw is the fresh weight dw is the dry weight and tw is the turgidity weight of the samples 2 5 2 cell membrane stability index to determine the membrane stability index cmsi 0 1 g of each experimental sample was placed in a tube containing 20 ml of distilled water after washing with distilled water the tubes were then placed in a hot water bath at 40 c for 30 mins and after cooling their electrical conductivity was measured with an ec meter e c 1 the tubes were then placed in a hot water bath at 100 c for 15 mins and their electrical conductivity was measured e c 2 finally using the following equation the percentage of cell membrane stability index was obtained sairam et al 2002 6 m s i 1 e c 1 e c 2 100 2 5 3 superoxide dismutase and catalase the leaf samples of each experimental treatment after being transferred to the laboratory were first washed with distilled water and then their surface moisture was dried then 0 5 g of each sample was homogenized in cold phosphate buffer ph 7 5 at a concentration of 0 1 m containing 0 5 mm of edta the resulting solution was transferred to centrifugal tubes and centrifuged at 15 000g

test tubes without enzyme extract were also considered as controls by adding 0 1 ml riboflavin 60 μm to the test tubes and placing them under the white light of a 100 watt lamp for 15 mins the reaction began the reaction ended by turning off the light and covering the tubes the control tubes had the highest amount of color absorption at 560 nm was read and one unit of enzyme activity was considered as an enzyme level that reduced the adsorption values of the samples to below 50 compared to the control tube dhindsa et al 1981 sairam et al 2002 the catalase cat activity was calculated by determining the h2o2 decomposition rate at 240 nm and applying the extinction coefficient of 39 4 cm l mol l the reaction mixture was consisted of 1 5 ml of citrate phosphate borate buffer 0 1 m l at ph 7 5 50 μl of enzymatic extract and 13 μl of h2o2 10 mm l the level of enzymes required to decompose 1 μm of oxygenated water per minute is referred to as an enzymatic unit obinger et al 1997 2 5

resulting extract was centrifuged at 14 000g for 15 mins at 4 c one 1 ml of the bradford buffer 10 coomassie brilliant blue v w at 5 ml of 95 ethanol v v was mixed with 0 1 ml of protein extract after five minutes the sample absorption was read at 595 nm bovine serum albumin was used to draw a standard curve and determine the protein content of the sample mg g 1fw 1 2 6 statistical analysis the mean data of three replications per treatment for each trait were analyzed by combined anova for first and second year data and anova using sas 9 4 the mean values of experimental treatments were compared by lsd test at 5 level 3 results the results of the combined analysis of variance showed that the spike length grain number per spike and water use efficiency were influenced by the year there was a significant interaction between the year and irrigation regime plant height 1000 grain weight grain yield biological yield relative water content and membrane stability plant height grain number per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield biological yield water use efficiency relative water content membrane stability and activity of the superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were influenced by the interaction between the irrigation regime and fertilizer treatment besides protein percentage was influenced by the triple interaction between the year irrigation regime and fertilizer treatment spike length and harvest index were only influenced by the simple effects of the irrigation regime and fertilizer treatment table 2 3 1 yield and yield components deficit irrigation reduced the plant height in both years however the plant height was higher in the second year table 3 the foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased the plant height by 26 in both irrigation regimes compared to the control treatment followed by zinc and boron nano fertilizers influenced the plant height table 3 the spike length in the second year was about 11 higher than the first year table 3 and deficit irrigation reduced the spike length by 30 fig 4 the application of boron zinc and silica fertilizers increased the spike length by 27 51 33 64 and 40 33 respectively compared to the control fig 5 the highest grain number per spike was obtained in the second year of the experiment table 3 the foliar application of the nano fertilizers improved the average grain number per spike in both irrigation regimes and the highest average grain number per spike was recorded under the full irrigation by foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer and about 38 increase was observed compared to the control treatment this increase was equal to 32 and 28 for boron and zinc nano fertilizers respectively in the deficit irrigation treatment the foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer improved the grain number per spike 39 of increase furthermore nano boron and nano zinc fertilizers also increased it by 23 and 18 respectively compared to the control treatment table 3 the 1000 grain weight was greater under the full irrigation than deficit irrigation in both years of the experiment however deficit irrigation reduced it by 35 and 42 respectively for the first and second years of the experiment table 3 foliar application of the nano silica zinc and boron fertilizers caused the highest increase in the 1000 grain weight respectively under both full irrigation and deficit irrigation regimes however this increase was more significant under the deficit irrigation condition in both irrigation regimes application of the nano silica fertilizer increased by 41 and 45 under full irrigation and deficit irrigation regimes respectively table 3 in both irrigation regimes and cropping years foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest grain followed by the zinc and boron nano fertilizers respectively fig 6 foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased the grain yield by 35 and 38 respectively under the full and deficit irrigation regimes compared to the control treatment foliar application of the nano fertilizers increased the grain yield in both irrigation regimes table 3 the results showed that the biological yield of wheat in the second year was higher than the first year and deficit irrigation reduced its amount by 17 and 22 respectively for the first and second years table 3 furthermore foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest biological yield 15 320 kg ha 1 under full irrigation condition which showed a 26 increase compared to the control treatment under the deficit irrigation foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased the biological yield by 18 compared to the control treatment in both irrigation regimes nano zinc and nano boron fertilizers ranked next in terms of improving the biological yield the lowest biological yield 10 264 kg ha 1 was related to the control treatment under the deficit irrigation condition table 3 comparing the mean harvest index indicated a significant difference between the full irrigation and deficit irrigation conditions so that the highest harvest index 43 96 was observed under the full irrigation condition and deficit irrigation caused a 38 decrease in this trait fig 4 application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest mean harvest index 40 35 which was significantly different from other nano fertilizer treatments compared to the control treatment application of the silica zinc and boron nano fertilizer treatments increased the mean harvest index by 12 5 5 and 0 7 respectively fig 5 3 2 protein the zinc nano fertilizer applied in the second year under the deficit irrigation condition caused the highest effect while the silica and boron nano fertilizers were in the second and third ranks respectively for deficit irrigation in the second year the zinc and silica nano fertilizers increased the protein content by 26 5 and 25 respectively in the second year compared to the control treatment but these values were equal to 23 5 and 21 6 respectively for zinc and silica nano fertilizers in the first year compared to the control treatment it should also be noted that the percentage of grain protein increased under the deficit irrigation condition fig 7 3 3 irrigation water use efficiency the results showed that the highest water use efficiency was achieved in the second year so that it was 8 10 higher than the first year table 3 moreover the results showed that the silica nano fertilizer treatment under both irrigation regimes caused the highest water use efficiency 1 46 and 1 79 kg m 3 compared to other treatments respectively table 3 in this regard silica nano fertilizer applied under the deficit irrigation condition caused the highest water use efficiency in the plants which was observed showed a 37 89 increase compared to the control treatment under the full irrigation condition table 3 3 4 relative water content rwc comparing the mean results of rwc showed that the deficit irrigation influenced the rwc and reduced it compared to the full irrigation condition furthermore the highest amount of rwc was related to the second year of the experiment under the full irrigation condition table 3 in both irrigation regimens application of the nano fertilizers improved the rwc but application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest rwc foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer induced 21 and 15 increase under the full and deficit irrigation conditions respectively 3 5 cell membrane stability index cmsi the results showed that the nano fertilizers especially the nano silica and nano boron fertilizers improved the cell membrane stability index in both years and under both irrigation regimes table 3 the highest cmsi was related to the second year of the experiment which increased by 11 compared to the first year under full irrigation condition moreover foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased this trait by 16 5 and 33 under the full and deficit irrigation conditions respectively compared to the control treatment table 3 3 6 superoxide dismutase and catalase sod and cat the results showed that the deficit irrigation increased the activity of sod and cat enzymes in general foliar application of the nano fertilizers enhanced the activity of these antioxidant enzymes compared to the control treatment however foliar application of the nano boron fertilizer caused the highest sod value 38 of increase under deficit irrigation regime compared to the control treatment and also foliar application of the zinc and silica nano fertilizers caused the highest cat value 14 of increase compared to the control treatment table 3 4 discussion the results of this two year study showed that the deficit irrigation reduced the plant height spike length number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield biological yield and harvest index of wheat furthermore wue as an important indicator for assessing the usefulness of the applied water was completely influenced by the deficit irrigation and increased on the other hand application of the nano silica fertilizer under both irrigation conditions increased the yield and its components and the studied morphological characteristics as well as the wue rwc and cmsi table 3 and figs 4 6 the decrease in the wheat plant height and spike length caused by the deficit water stress table 3 can be due to the reduction of relative turgidity and protoplasm dehydration which is accompanied by a decrease in the photosynthesis and reduced production of photosynthetic materials cell development and cell division el kholy and gaballah 2005 application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest plant height in both experiments under full irrigation condition application of the nano silica fertilizer under deficit irrigation condition led to an increase in the mean plant height compared to the control treatment table 3 in both years deficit irrigation decreased the grain number per spike the use of nano fertilizers increased the mean number of grains under full and deficit irrigation conditions and the role of nano fertilizers used in these conditions was statistically identical table 3 mean comparisons regarding the use of the nano fertilizers showed that their application increased the 1000 grain weight of wheat under both irrigation conditions and nano silica fertilizer was more effective in this regard table 3 the effect of zinc on the 1000 grain weight of the wheat plant results from its participation in increasing the enzymatic activity improving the membrane structure chlorophyll formation nitrogen metabolism stomatal regulation and starch consumption in the early stages of growth while enhancing the accumulation of the assimilates in the grain finally leading to an increase in the grain weight hera et al 2018 foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest grain yield 6975 kg ha 1 under full irrigation and the lowest grain yield was related to the fertilizer control treatment under deficit irrigation at about 3092 kg ha 1 table 3 the reduction of yield caused by the drought stress can be attributed to the factors such as reduced cell division and growth reduced photosynthesis membrane degradation incompatibility of water and nutrient uptake and their transmission hasanuzzaman et al 2018 the application of the nano silica fertilizer improved the wheat yield by increasing the plant height number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight table 3 and spike length figs 4 and 5 studies on the wheat have shown that the silica leads to the tolerance against the deficit irrigation stress through a decrease in the transpiration and improves the grain yield through an increase in the crop yield as well as the grain filling maghsoudi et al 2016 it has been reported that the application of zinc compensates for the adverse effects of the stress karim et al 2012 and increases the grain yield in the treatment under stress sultana et al 2016 the zinc element is involved in the biochemical processes such as cytochrome synthesis of nucleotides auxin metabolism and membrane maintenance and its deficiency reduces the wheat grain yield rerkasem and jamjod 2004 as well as content of the chlorophyll and photosynthetic materials jiang and huang 2002 it has also been suggested that the increase in the grain yield caused by the foliar application of the boron may be due to its effect on enhancement of the pollen tube growth and formation of wheat grain tahir et al 2009 compared to other nano fertilizers the application of the nano silica fertilizer under full irrigation condition caused the highest increase in the biological yield which was small but visible in the treatments under deficit irrigation table 3 silicon is involved in the formation of the cell wall of the plants and increases the resistance against the lodging by increasing its hardness it also strengthens the overall structure of the individual organs of the plant and increases the drought resistance guerriero and cai 2018a 2018b application of zinc and boron fertilizers also activates some physiological processes such as stomatal regulation chlorophyll formation enzymatic activation and biochemical processes and increases the production of dry matter wasaya et al 2017 the positive effect on the biological yield by application of boron is probably due to its participation in some cellular functions such as cell division longitudinal increase in the meristematic tissues leaf expansion and carbohydrate metabolism gupta and solanki 2013 the harvest index shows the ability of the plants to convert the dry matter into grain yield the harvest index which is directly related to the grain yield and inversely related to the biological yield was decreased in the treatments under deficit irrigation regime but the application of the nano fertilizers enhanced this trait application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest value of harvest index by 25 and about 10 under deficit and optimal irrigation conditions respectively compared to the fertilizer control treatment in general deficit irrigation reduced the harvest index values while foliar application of the nano fertilizers improved it application of the nano fertilizers influences this index through influencing the grain yield and biological yield nano silica fertilizer in particular had a significant effect on improving the harvest index by increasing more grain yield than the biological yield high protein content in the wheat under deficit irrigation condition and using the nano zinc fertilizer fig 7 is probably due to the decreased yield and increased nitrogen concentration in the grain caused by this reduction behboudi et al 2018 increased plants protein content caused by the application of zinc is probably due to its direct effect on the two processes of gene expression and protein synthesis cakmak 2000 it has also been shown that the application of silica si fertilizer increases the protein content and reduces the membrane damage in the plants nazaralian et al 2017 the water use efficiency was higher in the treatments under irrigation stress 50 of irrigation requirement than the full irrigation condition table 3 because under irrigation stress condition the used irrigation water is less than the discharged water from the soil by the evapotranspiration process and therefore all the irrigation water remains in the root zone fereres and soriano 2007 since most or all of the functional water remains in the root zone deficit irrigation increases the water use efficiency fereres and soriano 2007 and the plant does not necessarily have the highest wue value when the functional water is sufficient and the plant yield is maximum blum 2009 erice et al 2011 attia et al 2016 tari 2016 jin et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 reported that the wue of wheat was in the range of 0 4 2 67 kg m 3 foliar application of the silicon in wheat under deficit water stress condition increases the wue by reducing the transpiration rate and membrane permeability maghsoudi et al 2016 previous studies on the effects of silica fertilizer have shown that under deficit water stress condition silicon nanoparticles play an important role in the plant protection and improve the wue stomatal conductivity and transpiration rate haghighi and pessarakli 2013 kataria et al 2018 in general under deficit water stress condition the application of silicon in the wheat plant increases the osmotic and aqueous potential of the leaves and roots as well as wue and reduces the transpiration rate and membrane permeability gong and chen 2012 maghsoudi et al 2016 in the present study the application of the nano silica fertilizer under deficit irrigation condition increased the grain yield compared to the full irrigation condition table 3 this increase in the yield eventually improved the wue on the other hand a regime of 50 of the plant irrigation requirement and the foliar application of the nano fertilizers which improved the grain yield could be considered among the factors increasing the wue foliar application of the zinc and boron in the wheat under deficit water stress condition has been shown to influence the photosynthesis rate and increase the yield by increasing the grain weight and grain number per spike followed by the increased wue which is very important achievement in the arid and semi arid regions karim et al 2012 on the other hand boron facilitates the transport of sugar in the plant thereby improving the grain formation ultimately increasing the yield and enhancing the wue it has also been shown that boron improves the carbohydrate metabolism and reduces the reactive oxygen species ros production and enhances the photosynthesis rate by reducing the phenolic compounds in the leaves ultimately increasing the yield and wue waraich et al 2011 biotic stress reduces the rwc in the wheat but application of silica can moderate the effects of stress by increasing this trait alzahrani et al 2018 application of silica under drought stress increases the strength of leaf tissue in the plant tissues silicon in the form of silica sio2 nh2o accumulates in the cell wall apoplast and strengthens it kim et al 2002 increasing the water absorption and or reducing the transpiration losses keeps the rwc at high level in the plant tissue which in turn increases the photosynthesis rate and improves the plant growth under deficit water condition alsaeedi et al 2019 under water stress condition stomatal obstruction occurs as the first reaction of the plant when the pores are open co2 is absorbed along with water transpiration when the pores are closed water is stored and retained but co2 absorption is impaired drought stress triggers the signal transduction cascades which in turn causes the stomatal obstruction and ultimately preserves the plant water by reducing the transpiration while reducing the co2 absorption taran et al 2017 faizan et al 2020 lack of zinc element prevents the activity of some antioxidant enzymes which in turn causes the oxidative damage to protein molecules chlorophyll and nucleic acids cakmak 2000 zno nanoparticles zno nps also play an important role in minimizing the harmful effects of ros on the intracellular organs the small size of the zno nps facilitates easy penetration into the plant cells and regulates the water channels contributing to the seed germination and plant growth increased rwc under treatment with the foliar application of zinc and boron is probably due to the fact that zinc is effective in the process of stomatal regulation and increases the leaf length and width zhou et al 2016 and application of boron also increases the membrane stability of the leaf wasaya et al 2017 results showed that application of the nano fertilizers under both irrigation regimes enhanced the cell membrane stability index especially under deficit water stress condition table 3 silicon influences the plant water status by increasing the adsorption capacity and or reducing the water loss through leaf transpiration the mechanism of this effect can be attributed to improvement of the aquaporin activity water transfer channels in the cell membranes the increase in the concentration osmosis of xylem root sap or the increase in the root to stem ratio chen et al 2018 alsaeedi et al 2019 silicon has been shown to have a positive effect on the stability of the plants cell membranes by preventing the destruction of cell membrane structure and improving the plant growth and yield under stress merwad et al 2018 silicon strengthens the cell membrane and increases its permeability under drought stress by accumulating around the cell wall zhang et al 2018 numerous reports have shown that under drought stress h2o2 accumulates in the wheat leaves selote et al 2004 and corn hayano kanashiro et al 2009 and application of silicon nanoparticles reduces the h2o2 content and increases the cell membrane stability index ghorbanpour et al 2020 it is shown that the increase in the cell membrane stability caused by the application of boron fertilizer in the wheat plants is probably due to the modification of nadh oxidase activity masood et al 2012 activity of the superoxide dismutase and catalase increased under deficit irrigation and using the nano fertilizers nano boron nano zinc and nano silica fertilizers table 3 in the plants subjected to the water stress ros accumulates and plants produce the antioxidant enzymes such as sod and cat to stimulate the immune system and remove the excess ros das and roychoudhury 2014 du et al 2019 drought stress induces the ros production and leads to the changes in the metabolic activities membrane destruction and increased cell death in the plants the plant uses the mechanism of producing the antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase to cope with the challenges such as deficit water stress the application of boron increases the antioxidant enzymes and reduces the effect of stress on the wheat seth and aery 2017 under environmental stress sod is the first line of defense against the ros accumulation damage accelerating the dismutation of o2 to h2o2 and o2 although low concentrations of h2o2 are beneficial h2o2 can damage the cells at high concentrations and its amount should be kept at low levels therefore at this stage cat takes action and catalyzes the h2o2 to h2o and other non toxic products das and roychoudhury 2014 gong et al 2005 showed that silicon nanoparticles increased the growth and height of the wheat plants by improving the ability of leaves to absorb the light and increasing the photosynthetic capacity application of silica nano fertilizer allows the stems and leaves of the plant to stand upright and increases the photosynthesis rate along with a decrease in shading of the plant ultimately increasing the vegetative growth of the plant and thus increasing the wheat spike length ahmad et al 2016 zinc also increases the spike length by improving the catalytic activity in the wheat anther abbas et al 2011 gong et al 2003 concluded that increased grain number per the wheat spike caused by the application of silica could be due to an increase in the assimilates as a result of increasing the leaf area and photosynthesis in the grain filling phase increased grain number per the cereal spike caused by foliar application of zinc is probably due to its role of in the formation of the pollen tube ziaeyan and rajaie 2009 other reasons include better consumption of starch and transfer of the assimilates for grain growth ultimately leading to an increase in the grain size as well as the grain number per spike jalal et al 2020 boron also plays an important role in the formation of wheat grains so that its application is effective in grain filling and it increases the grain number per spike by reducing the infertility tahir et al 2009 silicon nanoparticles change the amount of transpiration improve the photosynthesis rate and water status in the plants alter the leaf organelles activate the plant defense systems and store and maintain the sufficient amounts of essential nutrients to reduce the damaging effects of deficit water stress on the wheat grain weight and its yield behboudi et al 2018 zinc can store the carbohydrates in the primary cellular metabolism and increase the 1000 grain weight by increasing the soluble sugars and maintaining the osmotic potential singh et al 1992 the 1000 grain weight has a direct effect on the yield of wheat grains the higher the wheat grain weight the higher the grain yield would be muhmood et al 2014 generally it is believed that improvements in the plant yields and yield components caused by the application of the nano boron may be due to its effect on enhancement of the photosynthesis and other plants metabolic activities ultimately leading to the increased metabolic responses in cell division sheykhbaglou et al 2010 goudar et al 2018 it has been observed that the application of silicon nanoparticles in the wheat improves the physiological processes of the plant and increases the biomass by controlling the transpiration rate and stomatal conductivity and regulating the process of photosynthesis ali et al 2019a 2019b hussain et al 2019 siddiqui et al 2020 nano silica fertilizer increases the absorption of nitrogen in the plant and assimilates it in the roots stems and leaves assimilated products often turn into the amino acids and proteins nano silica fertilizer directly and indirectly influences the gene activities modulating the transport proteins of the cell wall and the enzymatic activity on the other hand silicon nanoparticles activate the antioxidant enzymes under stress and thus influence the protein content in the plant suriyaprabha et al 2012 increased ionic concentration caused by application of sio2 nps is probably due to its effect on stabilizing the cell membrane through increasing the antioxidant enzymes so that it improves the cellular permeability of the wheat plant by maintaining the cell membranes under oxidative stress behboudi et al 2018 previous research on the effect of foliar application of the zinc oxide nanoparticles zno in the wheat has shown the adverse effects of drought stress and increased activity of the cat and sod antioxidant enzymes so that they increased the drought resistance and improved the yield components of the wheat taran et al 2017 faizan et al 2020 silicon enhances the water uptake by the root under drought stress through activating the accumulation of the soluble sugars and amino acids and its application increases the activity of the cat and sod enzymes and reduces the h2o2 content in the wheat gong et al 2005 increased activity of the antioxidant enzymes in the wheat caused by the application of silicon under deficit water stress condition can be due to the elimination of ros overproduction pei et al 2010 5 conclusion the results showed that applying the nano fertilizers not only improved the wheat grain yield by increasing the plant height spike length number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight biological yield wue rwc and cmsi but also reduced and adjusted the negative effects caused by the deficit irrigation 50 of irrigation requirement by improving the activity of sod in general deficit irrigation decreased the studies traits compared to full irrigation of the wheat foliar application of the nano fertilizers coupled with full irrigation conditions increased all the yield and morphological characteristics of the wheat and the best values were related to spraying by the nano silica fertilizer the nano zinc and nano boron fertilizers were also studied in terms of improvement of the traits the results of this study showed the importance of foliar application by the nano chelating based fertilizers as high tech products that can protect the wheat against the irrigation stress based on these results and considering the scarcity of water resources and the importance of wheat production the use of the nano silica fertilizer is recommended

10324,although the deficit irrigation saves the water consumption but it may cause the loss of yield recently the nano fertilizers have been used in the agriculture as an approach to minimize the adverse effects of drought stress thus in this study a two year 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winter wheat seasons split plot field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of the nano chelating fertilizers on the yield and water use efficiency of the wheat with three replications in iran the main plots consisted of full and deficit irrigation 50 of full irrigation requirement and the subplots included foliar spraying with nano chelated silicon boron and zinc fertilizers and control the total irrigation water was equal to 457 and 228 mm for full and deficit irrigation respectively for the first year and it was equal to 378 and 190 mm respectively for the second year deficit irrigation significantly decreased the yield components relative water content rwc and cell membrane stability index cmsi leading to reduction of the grain yield by 43 but it increased the grain protein wue and superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat activities nano zinc increased the protein percentage of wheat grain in both years and irrigation regimes the activity of sod and cat was improved especially in the deficit irrigated plants and also the yield yield components rwc and cmsi of wheat by applying the nano fertilizers under both irrigation conditions nano silica application under deficit irrigation in both years resulted in 28 and 32 increase in the grain yield respectively compared to the control the highest wue was obtained using the nano silica under deficit irrigation condition in both experiments generally the results indicated the considerable importance of the nano silica fertilizer in reducing the damage caused by the deficit irrigation and improving the growth characteristics of the wheat keywords nano silica nanoparticles protein water use efficiency yield 1 introduction today there are serious concerns about the proper management of water resources especially in the countries facing water crisis on a global scale about 70 of the freshwater is consumed in the agriculture sector so sustainable use of water for agriculture has become a top priority ballesteros et al 2016 agriculture sector has reduced the groundwater levels and the amount of water flowing from the rivers into oceans by consuming much of the available freshwater falkenmark and molden 2008 in the arid and semi arid regions of the world receiving much less rainfall than the requirement of the plants has become a major challenge for subsequent decades geerts and raes 2009 motazedian et al 2019 in general the scarcity of water resources in the world shows the need to change the attitude from maximizing the production per unit area to maximizing the production per unit of consumed water evans and sadler 2008 zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation is one of the most important methods used to reduce the irrigation water use and to cope with the water deficit crisis fereres and soriano 2007 nawaz et al 2015 applied the deficit irrigation at 60 of field capacity and abdel motagally and el zohri 2018 applied it at 50 of field capacity that resulted in 40 and 28 3 reduction in the wheat grain yield respectively on the other hand fereres and soriano 2007 shown that the deficit irrigation increases the water use efficiency wheat triticum aestivum l as one of the most important cereals provides the foods for one fifth of the world s population it accounts for about 218 million hectares of the total cultivated land with a yield rate of more than 771 million tons and providing 21 of the population s food demand tsvetanov et al 2016 it is estimated that the wheat production should be increased by 60 in 2050 to meet the needs of the world s growing population savadi et al 2018 more than 50 of the world s wheat farms are affected by the periodic drought stress habuš jerčić et al 2018 it is expected that frequency and intensity of drought will be increased in the future because of climate change caused by the reduced rainfall and increased evaporation due to the global warming dai 2011 therefore there is need for a detailed understanding of the drought damages on the wheat as well as ways to improve the drought resistance in order to increase its productivity hasanuzzaman et al 2018 nanotechnology has made a real revolution in the agriculture the use of nano fertilizers has led to the increased productivity reduced production costs in the last decade and also has led to the increased production stability due to reduction of biotic and abiotic stresses kashyap et al 2016 2017 more solubility than the other similar non nano fertilizers is the important property of these fertilizers derosa et al 2010 the use of nano zn fertilizer plays an important role in the plant tolerance against the drought through increasing the lipids proteins amino acids and chlorophyll b content sedghi et al 2013 rizwan et al 2019 showed that the application of zinc nano fertilizers increased the growth chlorophyll content gas exchange characteristics and zinc concentration in the wheat grain and also decreased the oxidative stress among different nano fertilizers silica nanoparticles have been shown to improve the biomass yield of cucurbita pepo l siddiqui et al 2014 and hawthorn seedlings ashkavand et al 2018 under stress conditions by enhancing the photosynthesis of the plants numerous reports have suggested that the application of nanoparticles increases the plant resistance against the drought stress by activating the antioxidant enzymes facilitating the uptake process in the plants and enhancing their growth cui et al 2017 tripathi et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2018 the results of the study on the defensive role of silicon against the drought stress 50 of fc in wheat showed that si is very important in the plants physiological processes and improves the wheat growth alzahrani et al 2018 boron b is related to cell wall construction and its application in the nano sized form has been shown to eliminate the problem of slow transfer via phloem tavallali 2017 nano b fertilizer is quickly and easily absorbed by the plants is slowly leached and its effects appear in a short period research has shown that spraying and pretreatment of the sunflower seeds with equal amounts of nano b fertilizer has the same and significant effects on the grain increase compared to the control treatment despite the high potential of nanotechnology innovations in the agriculture there is still a lack of a deep understanding regarding the relationship between the application of the nano fertilizers and growth of the plants guerriero and cai 2018a 2018b although the application of silica zinc and boron nanoparticles has been indicated to improve the growth conditions and has increased the crop yield in the previous studies abdel motagally and el zohri 2018 rastogi et al 2019 ali et al 2019a 2019b but according to the review of the literature there are limited studies about the application of zinc silica and boron nano fertilizers in the wheat farms under deficit water stress condition thus the present experiment was designed and implemented to assay the harmful effects of deficit irrigation in the wheat farming especially in the areas such as urmia lake and to evaluate the compensation of drought induced negative effects by application of the nano chelating fertilizers zinc silica and boron 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site west azerbaijan province located in the northwest of iran excluding the lake urmia covers an area of about 37 412 km2 which is equivalent to 2 25 of iran s area lake urmia is the iran s largest lake which lost about 60 of its surface area and 90 of its volume during 2011 2017 previous studies have attributed the decrease in the lake water surface to the excessive harvesting for agricultural uses exacerbated by the factors such as uncontrolled growth of the irrigated land area excessive construction of the reservoirs and dams as well as low agricultural water use efficiency hassanzadeh et al 2012 west azerbaijan has a semi arid and cold climate with an average annual rainfall of 450 mm the experiment was conducted at oshnavieh city 37 2 n 45 7 e and altitude of 1450 m located in west azerbaijan province iran fig 1 in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 wheat growing seasons table 1 shows some physicochemical properties of the soil in the experimental site by a depth of 60 cm the soil texture included the silty clay with a bulk density of 1 37 g cm 3 and the amount of zn b and si in the soil was equal to 0 67 0 58 and 0 68 ppm respectively 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted with a randomized complete block design arranged as a split plot with three replications the main plots were arranged for two levels of irrigation regimes full irrigation 100 of irrigation requirement and deficit irrigation 50 of irrigation requirement the subplots consisted of foliar spraying using the nano chelated silicon containing 2 chelated silicon and absorbable at ph 3 11 nano chelated zinc containing 12 chelated zinc and absorbable at ph 3 11 and nano chelated boron containing 9 chelated boron and absorbable at ph 3 11 fertilizers pulverized at 2 g l 1 of concentration the foliar fertilization was done firstly in tillering growth stage and the others were performed at 15 day intervals nonchelated silicon boron and zinc fertilizers under the trademark of khazra were produced by the sodour ahrar shargh company in accordance with a patent registered at the united states patent and trademark office uspto us8288587b2 mh n chelate compounds google patents 2012 boron zinc or silicon compounds were separately dissolved in some water and then were put on a shaker in order to produce the chelated nano fertilizers when the compound was completely dissolved in the water organic acid was added to the solution and was allowed to completely dissolve at this stage the initiator was added to allow the nuclei generation to start after 8 10 h when the nuclei generation reached a proper level the capping agent was added to stop the nuclei generation then the solution was left in the laboratory environment for 6 h to stabilize the solution finally the deposited nano particles were separated by the filtration and were dried in the oven at 70 c fig 2 a and b the main plot size was equal to 2 5 12 m and it was as 2 5 2 5 m for the subplot there were eight treatments with three replications the winter wheat cultivar pishgam mainly cultivated in the western cold regions of iran which is resistant against the yellow rust disease was sown at an area of 200 kg ha 1 in rows at 20 cm intervals and 5 cm depth on october 25 2016 and october 27 2017 after maturity the crops were harvested on july 5 2017 and july 8 2018 respectively n p and k fertilizers were applied with amounts of 350 kg ha 1 of urea 50 kg ha 1 of triple superphosphate and 50 kg ha 1 of potassium sulfate 50 k2o based on the fertilizer recommendations obtained from soil testing p k and half of n fertilizers were applied as the basal fertilization before seeding by spreading the fertilizer on the surface and mixing into the soil by a rotary cultivator the remained n fertilizer was applied as the topdressing after tillering growth stage during the experiment all the agricultural and conservation practices control of the insects pests diseases and weeds required for all the plots were performed equally 2 3 irrigation requirement in order to apply irrigation treatments in this study the following equation was applied to determine the amount of applied irrigation water allen et al 1998 1 ir et c r o p eff c r 1 lr e a where ir is plant irrigation requirement mm etc is actual plant evapotranspiration mm r0 is runoff mm cr is capillary ascent mm peff is effective rainfall mm lr is leaching requirement and ea is irrigation efficiency the precise application of irrigation rates based on a reliable method has always been a challenge in drought stress studies according to fao recommendation this method is the most reliable method for estimating the plant water requirement as the calculations of this method is based on daily meteorological data geographical information of the experimental site properties of the plant and is superior to other methods therefore in this study the proposed penman monteith fao 56 method was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of the plant which is presented in eq 2 2 et c k c 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34u 2 in the above equation etc is actual evapotranspiration mm δ is slope of

average wind speed at 2 m m s 1 es is saturation vapor pressure kpa and ea is actual vapor pressure of the environment kpa daily values of δ rn es and ea are calculated using the equations presented to calculate rn the reflection coefficient is considered to be 0 23 green vegetation level since the numerical value of g is small and difficult to measure compared to rn its value is assumed to be zero in daily time step calculations the measured values of minimum temperature maximum temperature and relative humidity are also used to calculate ea and es kc is the vegetation coefficient without units that was calculated for wheat according to the fao recommendation allen et al 1998 the time distribution of rainfall in the region is such that most of the precipitation occurs in winter total rainfall was reported 364 mm and 496 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping season respectively the meteorological parameters needed to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of wheat including daily mean values of air temperature wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours and solar radiation were obtained through the synoptic weather station of oshnavieh which was within a short distance from the farm weather data during the two experimental seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 as well as the long term are presented in fig 3 that have been shown since the establishment of the synoptic weather station of oshnavieh until field experiments 18 year mean in this study the amount of effective rainfall at each irrigation interval was determined to ensure to apply the desired stress 50 of water requirement in the deficit irrigation treatments and to avoid over irrigation in the full irrigation treatments the usda scs method was used to calculate the amount of effective rainfall peff in each irrigation event ali and mubarak 2017 since the dead end plots with appropriate distances between treatments were used in this experiment the runoff value ro was zero and the rate of capillary ascent cr was also zero due to the low water table of the area the leaching requirement lr was calculated by the method used by ayers and westcott 1976 and the salinity value of soil saturation extract ece was assumed to be 6 dsm 1 for a 0 decrease in wheat yield as the salinity of irrigation water was 2 dsm 1 the amount of leaching requirement was less than 10 due to lack of water loss in the plumbing system between treatments lack of runoff as well as moisture storage of irrigation water of the root in the interval between the two irrigations irrigation efficiency was determined to be 90 applying this value for efficiency also led to offset the leaching requirement which was obtained less than 10 after determining the amount of water consumed the experimental plots were plumbed by a network of polyethylene pipes and the amount of irrigation water in each irrigation cycle for each plot was measured by volume flow meter to ensure uniform plant establishment all treatments received the same calculated water requirement in autumn by starting irrigation from april to the last irrigation in june the treatments under deficit irrigation were irrigated with 50 of water requirement and the treatments under full irrigation with 100 of water requirement 2 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency is introduced as the ratio of plant yield to actual evapotranspiration and represents an indicator of efficiency in agricultural science the following equation is used to calculate water use efficiency katerji and mastrorilli 2014 3 wue y et c where wue is water use efficiency kg m 3 y is yield kg ha 1 and etc is actual evapotranspiration kg m 3 2 5 growth parameters and measurements in this study total yield and its components as well as characteristics such as

growth cycle all wheat of residual planting lines was manually harvested and total yield was measured to avoid marginal effects by neglecting the two planting lines next to the ridges of each plot for plant height measurement ten plants were randomly selected from each plot and height was measured in centimeters by a graded ruler with millimeter precision from soil surface to terminal spikelet of the plant regardless of awe to determine the spike length the mean base distance of spike to terminal spikelet was randomly measured in ten plants and recorded in centimeters for each plant regardless of awe length to determine the number of grains per spike ten clusters were randomly selected and the mean number of grains in them was measured furthermore to measure 1000 grain weight an average weight of ten samples of 100 grain harvested were used 3 times which was to proportional to 1000 grain weight for this end digital weighing scale with 0 01 gram accuracy was used to determine the harvest index of all the plants in the experimental plot by eliminating two rows of planting on the sides of the plot they were cut from the bottom in each plot and after drying in air for five days the weight of all plants was weighed with scales and recorded as the biological yield then the grains in all spikes harvested were weighed and considered as economic yield finally by dividing the economic yield of the sample in each replication separately by the biological yield of the same sample in the same replication under both deficit irrigation and full irrigation conditions the harvest index value was calculated separately 4 hi gy b iomass ag where hi is harvest index gy is grain yield kg ha 1 and biomassag is above ground biomass kg ha 1 2 5 1 relative water content rwc to determine the relative water content rwc of the leaf five young and fully developed flag leaves from each treatment were randomly selected and cut at the beginning of the grain filling phase may 30 and june 7 respectively for the first and second years of the experiment then they were quickly taken to the laboratory inside the polyethylene bag the selected samples of the leaves were immediately weighed fresh weight then placed in distilled water for three hours and their weight was determined again turgidity weight finally by placing the samples in an oven at 65 c for 48 h the dry weight of the samples was determined and using the equation below the relative water content of the leaves for each experimental treatment was measured barrs and weatherley 1962 5 r w c f w d w t w d w 100 where rwc is the relative water content of leaves fw is the fresh weight dw is the dry weight and tw is the turgidity weight of the samples 2 5 2 cell membrane stability index to determine the membrane stability index cmsi 0 1 g of each experimental sample was placed in a tube containing 20 ml of distilled water after washing with distilled water the tubes were then placed in a hot water bath at 40 c for 30 mins and after cooling their electrical conductivity was measured with an ec meter e c 1 the tubes were then placed in a hot water bath at 100 c for 15 mins and their electrical conductivity was measured e c 2 finally using the following equation the percentage of cell membrane stability index was obtained sairam et al 2002 6 m s i 1 e c 1 e c 2 100 2 5 3 superoxide dismutase and catalase the leaf samples of each experimental treatment after being transferred to the laboratory were first washed with distilled water and then their surface moisture was dried then 0 5 g of each sample was homogenized in cold phosphate buffer ph 7 5 at a concentration of 0 1 m containing 0 5 mm of edta the resulting solution was transferred to centrifugal tubes and centrifuged at 15 000g for 15 mins at 4 c estimation of superoxide dismutase sod was performed by nitro blue tetrazolium nbt reduction about three milliliters of the reaction mixture containing 0 1 ml of sodium carbonate 1

test tubes without enzyme extract were also considered as controls by adding 0 1 ml riboflavin 60 μm to the test tubes and placing them under the white light of a 100 watt lamp for 15 mins the reaction began the reaction ended by turning off the light and covering the tubes the control tubes had the highest amount of color absorption at 560 nm was read and one unit of enzyme activity was considered as an enzyme level that reduced the adsorption values of the samples to below 50 compared to the control tube dhindsa et al 1981 sairam et al 2002 the catalase cat activity was calculated by determining the h2o2 decomposition rate at 240 nm and applying the extinction coefficient of 39 4 cm l mol l the reaction mixture was consisted of 1 5 ml of citrate phosphate borate buffer 0 1 m l

mean data of three replications per treatment for each trait were analyzed by combined anova for first and second year data and anova using sas 9 4 the mean values of experimental treatments were compared by lsd test at 5 level 3 results the results of the combined analysis of variance showed that the spike length grain number per spike and water use efficiency were influenced by the year there was a significant interaction between the year and irrigation regime plant height 1000 grain weight grain yield biological yield relative water content and membrane stability plant height grain number per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield biological yield water use efficiency relative water content membrane stability and activity of the superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were influenced by the interaction between the irrigation regime and fertilizer treatment besides protein percentage was influenced by the triple interaction between the year irrigation regime and fertilizer treatment spike length and harvest index were only influenced by the simple effects of the irrigation regime and fertilizer treatment table 2 3 1 yield and yield components deficit irrigation reduced the plant height in both years however the plant height was higher in the second year table 3 the foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased the plant height by 26 in both irrigation regimes compared to the control treatment followed by zinc and boron nano fertilizers influenced the plant height table 3 the spike length in the second year was about 11 higher than the first year table 3 and deficit irrigation reduced the spike length by 30 fig 4 the application of boron zinc and silica fertilizers increased the spike length by 27 51 33 64 and 40 33 respectively compared to the control fig 5 the highest grain number per spike was obtained in the second year of the experiment table 3 the foliar application of the nano fertilizers improved the average grain number per spike in both irrigation regimes and the highest average grain number per spike was recorded under the full irrigation by foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer and about 38 increase was observed compared to the control treatment this increase was equal to 32 and 28 for boron and zinc nano fertilizers respectively in the deficit irrigation treatment the foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer improved the grain number per spike 39 of increase furthermore nano boron and nano zinc fertilizers also increased it by 23 and 18 respectively compared to the control treatment table 3 the 1000 grain weight was greater under the full irrigation than deficit irrigation in both years of the experiment however deficit irrigation reduced it by 35 and 42 respectively for the first and second years of the experiment table 3 foliar application of the nano silica zinc and boron fertilizers caused the highest increase in the 1000 grain weight respectively under both full irrigation and deficit irrigation regimes however this increase was more significant under the deficit irrigation condition in both irrigation regimes application of the nano silica fertilizer increased by 41 and 45 under full irrigation and deficit irrigation regimes respectively table 3 in both irrigation regimes and cropping years foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest grain followed by the zinc and boron nano fertilizers respectively fig 6 foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased the grain yield by 35 and 38 respectively under the full and deficit irrigation regimes compared to the control treatment foliar application of the nano fertilizers increased the grain yield in both irrigation regimes table 3 the results showed that the biological yield of wheat in the second year was higher than the first year and deficit irrigation reduced its amount by 17 and 22 respectively for the first and second years table 3 furthermore foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest biological yield 15 320 kg ha 1 under full irrigation condition which showed a 26 increase compared to the control treatment under the deficit irrigation foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased the biological yield by 18 compared to the control treatment in both irrigation regimes nano zinc and nano boron fertilizers ranked next in terms of improving the biological yield the lowest biological yield 10 264 kg ha 1 was related to the control treatment under the deficit irrigation condition table 3 comparing the mean harvest index indicated a significant difference between the full irrigation and deficit irrigation conditions so that the highest harvest index 43 96 was observed under the full irrigation condition and deficit irrigation caused a 38 decrease in this trait fig 4 application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest mean harvest index 40 35 which was significantly different from other nano fertilizer treatments compared to the control treatment application of the silica zinc and boron nano fertilizer treatments increased the mean harvest index by 12 5 5 and 0 7 respectively fig 5 3 2 protein the zinc nano fertilizer applied in the second year under the deficit irrigation condition caused the highest effect while the silica and boron nano fertilizers were in the second and third ranks respectively for deficit irrigation in the second year the zinc and silica nano fertilizers increased the protein content by 26 5 and 25 respectively in the second year compared to the control treatment but these values were equal to 23 5 and 21 6 respectively for zinc and silica nano fertilizers in the first year compared to the control treatment it should also be noted that the percentage of grain protein increased under the deficit irrigation condition fig 7 3 3 irrigation water use efficiency the results showed that the highest water use efficiency was achieved in the second year so that it was 8 10 higher than the first year table 3 moreover the results showed that the silica nano fertilizer treatment under both irrigation regimes caused the highest water use efficiency 1 46 and 1 79 kg m 3 compared to other treatments respectively table 3 in this regard silica nano fertilizer applied under the deficit irrigation condition caused the highest water use efficiency in the plants which was observed showed a 37 89 increase compared to the control treatment under the full irrigation condition table 3 3 4 relative water content rwc comparing the mean results of rwc showed that the deficit irrigation influenced the rwc and reduced it compared to the full irrigation condition furthermore the highest amount of rwc was related to the second year of the experiment under the full irrigation condition table 3 in both irrigation regimens application of the nano fertilizers improved the rwc but application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest rwc foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer induced 21 and 15 increase under the full and deficit irrigation conditions respectively 3 5 cell membrane stability index cmsi the results showed that the nano fertilizers especially the nano silica and nano boron fertilizers improved the cell membrane stability index in both years and under both irrigation regimes table 3 the highest cmsi was related to the second year of the experiment which increased by 11 compared to the first year under full irrigation condition moreover foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer increased this trait by 16 5 and 33 under the full and deficit irrigation conditions respectively compared to the control treatment table 3 3 6 superoxide dismutase and catalase sod and cat the results showed that the deficit irrigation increased the activity of sod and cat enzymes in general foliar application of the nano fertilizers enhanced the activity of these antioxidant enzymes compared to the control treatment however foliar application of the nano boron fertilizer caused the highest sod value 38 of increase under deficit irrigation regime compared to the control treatment and also foliar application of the zinc and silica nano fertilizers caused the highest cat value 14 of increase compared to the control treatment table 3 4 discussion the results of this two year study showed that the deficit irrigation reduced the plant height spike length number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield biological yield and harvest index of wheat furthermore wue as an important indicator for assessing the usefulness of the applied water was completely influenced by the deficit irrigation and increased on the other hand application of the nano silica fertilizer under both irrigation conditions increased the yield and its components and the studied morphological characteristics as well as the wue rwc and cmsi table 3 and figs 4 6 the decrease in the wheat plant height and spike length caused by the deficit water stress table 3 can be due to the reduction of relative turgidity and protoplasm dehydration which is accompanied by a decrease in the photosynthesis and reduced production of photosynthetic materials cell development and cell division el kholy and gaballah 2005 application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest plant height in both experiments under full irrigation condition application of the nano silica fertilizer under deficit irrigation condition led to an increase in the mean plant height compared to the control treatment table 3 in both years deficit irrigation decreased the grain number per spike the use of nano fertilizers increased the mean number of grains under full and deficit irrigation conditions and the role of nano fertilizers used in these conditions was statistically identical table 3 mean comparisons regarding the use of the nano fertilizers showed that their application increased the 1000 grain weight of wheat under both irrigation conditions and nano silica fertilizer was more effective in this regard table 3 the effect of zinc on the 1000 grain weight of the wheat plant results from its participation in increasing the enzymatic activity improving the membrane structure chlorophyll formation nitrogen metabolism stomatal regulation and starch consumption in the early stages of growth while enhancing the accumulation of the assimilates in the grain finally leading to an increase in the grain weight hera et al 2018 foliar application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest grain yield 6975 kg ha 1 under full irrigation and the lowest grain yield was related to the fertilizer control treatment under deficit irrigation at about 3092 kg ha 1 table 3 the reduction of yield caused by the drought stress can be attributed to the factors such as reduced cell division and growth reduced photosynthesis membrane degradation incompatibility of water and nutrient uptake and their transmission hasanuzzaman et al 2018 the application of the nano silica fertilizer improved the wheat yield by increasing the plant height number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight table 3 and spike length figs 4 and 5 studies on the wheat have shown that the silica leads to the tolerance against the deficit irrigation stress through a decrease in the transpiration and improves the grain yield through an increase in the crop yield as well as the grain filling maghsoudi et al 2016 it has been reported that the application of zinc compensates for the adverse effects of the stress karim et al 2012 and increases the grain yield in the treatment under stress sultana et al 2016 the zinc element is involved in the biochemical processes such as cytochrome synthesis of nucleotides auxin metabolism and membrane maintenance and its deficiency reduces the wheat grain yield rerkasem and jamjod 2004 as well as content of the chlorophyll and photosynthetic materials jiang and huang 2002 it has also been suggested that the increase in the grain yield caused by the foliar application of the boron may be due to its effect on enhancement of the pollen tube growth and formation of wheat grain tahir et al 2009 compared to other nano fertilizers the application of the nano silica fertilizer under full irrigation condition caused the highest increase in the biological yield which was small but visible in the treatments under deficit irrigation table 3 silicon is involved in the formation of the cell wall of the plants and increases the resistance against the lodging by increasing its hardness it also strengthens the overall structure of the individual organs of the plant and increases the drought resistance guerriero and cai 2018a 2018b application of zinc and boron fertilizers also activates some physiological processes such as stomatal regulation chlorophyll formation enzymatic activation and biochemical processes and increases the production of dry matter wasaya et al 2017 the positive effect on the biological yield by application of boron is probably due to its participation in some cellular functions such as cell division longitudinal increase in the meristematic tissues leaf expansion and carbohydrate metabolism gupta and solanki 2013 the harvest index shows the ability of the plants to convert the dry matter into grain yield the harvest index which is directly related to the grain yield and inversely related to the biological yield was decreased in the treatments under deficit irrigation regime but the application of the nano fertilizers enhanced this trait application of the nano silica fertilizer caused the highest value of harvest index by 25 and about 10 under deficit and optimal irrigation conditions respectively compared to the fertilizer control treatment in general deficit irrigation reduced the harvest index values while foliar application of the nano fertilizers improved it application of the nano fertilizers influences this index through influencing the grain yield and biological yield nano silica fertilizer in particular had a significant effect on improving the harvest index by increasing more grain yield than the biological yield high protein content in the wheat under deficit irrigation condition and using the nano zinc fertilizer fig 7 is probably due to the decreased yield and increased nitrogen concentration in the grain caused by this reduction behboudi et al 2018 increased plants protein content caused by the application of zinc is probably due to its direct effect on the two processes of gene expression and protein synthesis cakmak 2000 it has also been shown that the application of silica si fertilizer increases the protein content and reduces the membrane damage in the plants nazaralian et al 2017 the water use efficiency was higher in the treatments under irrigation stress 50 of irrigation requirement than the full irrigation condition table 3 because under irrigation stress condition the used irrigation water is less than the discharged water from the soil by the evapotranspiration process and therefore all the irrigation water remains in the root zone fereres and soriano 2007 since most or all of the functional water remains in the root zone deficit irrigation increases the water use efficiency fereres and soriano 2007 and the plant does not necessarily have the highest wue value when the functional water is sufficient and the plant yield is maximum blum 2009 erice et al 2011 attia et al 2016 tari 2016 jin et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 reported that the wue of wheat was in the range of 0 4 2 67 kg m 3 foliar application of the silicon in wheat under deficit water stress condition increases the wue by reducing the transpiration rate and membrane permeability maghsoudi et al 2016 previous studies on the effects of silica fertilizer have shown that under deficit water stress condition silicon nanoparticles play an important role in the plant protection and improve the wue stomatal conductivity and transpiration rate haghighi and pessarakli 2013 kataria et al 2018 in general under deficit water stress condition the application of silicon in the wheat plant increases the osmotic and aqueous potential of the leaves and roots as well as wue and reduces the transpiration rate and membrane permeability gong and chen 2012 maghsoudi et al 2016 in the present study the application of the nano silica fertilizer under deficit irrigation condition increased the grain yield compared to the full irrigation condition table 3 this increase in the yield eventually improved the wue on the other hand a regime of 50 of the plant irrigation requirement and the foliar application of the nano fertilizers which improved the grain yield could be considered among the factors increasing the wue foliar application of the zinc and boron in the wheat under deficit water stress condition has been shown to influence the photosynthesis rate and increase the yield by increasing the grain weight and grain number per spike followed by the increased wue which is very important achievement in the arid and semi arid regions karim et al 2012 on the other hand boron facilitates the transport of sugar in the plant thereby improving the grain formation ultimately increasing the yield and enhancing the wue it has also been shown that boron improves the carbohydrate metabolism and reduces the reactive oxygen species ros production and enhances the photosynthesis rate by reducing the phenolic compounds in the leaves ultimately increasing the yield and wue waraich et al 2011 biotic stress reduces the rwc in the wheat but application of silica can moderate the effects of stress by increasing this trait alzahrani et al 2018 application of silica under drought stress increases the strength of leaf tissue in the plant tissues silicon in the form of silica sio2 nh2o accumulates in the cell wall apoplast and strengthens it kim et al 2002 increasing the water absorption and or reducing the transpiration losses keeps the rwc at high level in the plant tissue which in turn increases the photosynthesis rate and improves the plant growth under deficit water condition alsaeedi et al 2019 under water stress condition stomatal obstruction occurs as the first reaction of the plant when the pores are open co2 is absorbed along with water transpiration when the pores are closed water is stored and retained but co2 absorption is impaired drought stress triggers the signal transduction cascades which in turn causes the stomatal obstruction and ultimately preserves the plant water by reducing the transpiration while reducing the co2 absorption taran et al 2017 faizan et al 2020 lack of zinc element prevents the activity of some antioxidant enzymes which in turn causes the oxidative damage to protein molecules chlorophyll and nucleic acids cakmak 2000 zno nanoparticles zno nps also play an important role in minimizing the harmful effects of ros on the intracellular organs the small size of the zno nps facilitates easy penetration into the plant cells and regulates the water channels contributing to the seed germination and plant growth increased rwc under treatment with the foliar application of zinc and boron is probably due to the fact that zinc is effective in the process of stomatal regulation and increases the leaf length and width zhou et al 2016 and application of boron also increases the membrane stability of the leaf wasaya et al 2017 results showed that application of the nano fertilizers under both irrigation regimes enhanced the cell membrane stability index especially under deficit water stress condition table 3 silicon influences the plant water status by increasing the adsorption capacity and or reducing the water loss through leaf transpiration the mechanism of this effect can be attributed to improvement of the aquaporin activity water transfer channels in the cell membranes the increase in the concentration osmosis of xylem root sap or the increase in the root to stem ratio chen et al 2018 alsaeedi et al 2019 silicon has been shown to have a positive effect on the stability of the plants cell membranes by preventing the destruction of cell membrane structure and improving the plant growth and yield under stress merwad et al 2018 silicon strengthens the cell membrane and increases its permeability under drought stress by accumulating around the cell wall zhang et al 2018 numerous reports have shown that under drought stress h2o2 accumulates in the wheat leaves selote et al 2004 and corn hayano kanashiro et al 2009 and application of silicon nanoparticles reduces the h2o2 content and increases the cell membrane stability index ghorbanpour et al 2020 it is shown that the increase in the cell membrane stability caused by the application of boron fertilizer in the wheat plants is probably due to the modification of nadh oxidase activity masood et al 2012 activity of the superoxide dismutase and catalase increased under deficit irrigation and using the nano fertilizers nano boron nano zinc and nano silica fertilizers table 3 in the plants subjected to the water stress ros accumulates and plants produce the antioxidant enzymes such as sod and cat to stimulate the immune system and remove the excess ros das and roychoudhury 2014 du et al 2019 drought stress induces the ros production and leads to the changes in the metabolic activities membrane destruction and increased cell death in the plants the plant uses the mechanism of producing the antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase to cope with the challenges such as deficit water stress the application of boron increases the antioxidant enzymes and reduces the effect of stress on the wheat seth and aery 2017 under environmental stress sod is the first line of defense against the ros accumulation damage accelerating the dismutation of o2 to h2o2 and o2 although low concentrations of h2o2 are beneficial h2o2 can damage the cells at high concentrations and its amount should be kept at low levels therefore at this stage cat takes action and catalyzes the h2o2 to h2o and other non toxic products das and roychoudhury 2014 gong et al 2005 showed that silicon nanoparticles increased the growth and height of the wheat plants by improving the ability of leaves to absorb the light and increasing the photosynthetic capacity application of silica nano fertilizer allows the stems and leaves of the plant to stand upright and increases the photosynthesis rate along with a decrease in shading of the plant ultimately increasing the vegetative growth of the plant and thus increasing the wheat spike length ahmad et al 2016 zinc also increases the spike length by improving the catalytic activity in the wheat anther abbas et al 2011 gong et al 2003 concluded that increased grain number per the wheat spike caused by the application of silica could be due to an increase in the assimilates as a result of increasing the leaf area and photosynthesis in the grain filling phase increased grain number per the cereal spike caused by foliar application of zinc is probably due to its role of in the formation of the pollen tube ziaeyan and rajaie 2009 other reasons include better consumption of starch and transfer of the assimilates for grain growth ultimately leading to an increase in the grain size as well as the grain number per spike jalal et al 2020 boron also plays an important role in the formation of wheat grains so that its application is effective in grain filling and it increases the grain number per spike by reducing the infertility tahir et al 2009 silicon nanoparticles change the amount of transpiration improve the photosynthesis rate and water status in the plants alter the leaf organelles activate the plant defense systems and store and maintain the sufficient amounts of essential nutrients to reduce the damaging effects of deficit water stress on the wheat grain weight and its yield behboudi et al 2018 zinc can store the carbohydrates in the primary cellular metabolism and increase the 1000 grain weight by increasing the soluble sugars and maintaining the osmotic potential singh et al 1992 the 1000 grain weight has a direct effect on the yield of wheat grains the higher the wheat grain weight the higher the grain yield would be muhmood et al 2014 generally it is believed that improvements in the plant yields and yield components caused by the application of the nano boron may be due to its effect on enhancement of the photosynthesis and other plants metabolic activities ultimately leading to the increased metabolic responses in cell division sheykhbaglou et al 2010 goudar et al 2018 it has been observed that the application of silicon nanoparticles in the wheat improves the physiological processes of the plant and increases the biomass by controlling the transpiration rate and stomatal conductivity and regulating the process of photosynthesis ali et al 2019a 2019b hussain et al 2019 siddiqui et al 2020 nano silica fertilizer increases the absorption of nitrogen in the plant and assimilates it in the roots stems and leaves assimilated products often turn into the amino acids and proteins nano silica fertilizer directly and indirectly influences the gene activities modulating the transport proteins of the cell wall and the enzymatic activity on the other hand silicon nanoparticles activate the antioxidant enzymes under stress and thus influence the protein content in the plant suriyaprabha et al 2012 increased ionic concentration caused by application of sio2 nps is probably due to its effect on stabilizing the cell membrane through increasing the antioxidant enzymes so that it improves the cellular permeability of the wheat plant by maintaining the cell membranes under oxidative stress behboudi et al 2018 previous research on the effect of foliar application of the zinc oxide nanoparticles zno in the wheat has shown the adverse effects of drought stress and increased activity of the cat and sod antioxidant enzymes so that they increased the drought resistance and improved the yield components of the wheat taran et al 2017 faizan et al 2020 silicon enhances the water uptake by the root under drought stress through activating the accumulation of the soluble sugars and amino acids and its application increases the activity of the cat and sod enzymes and reduces the h2o2 content in the wheat gong et al 2005 increased activity of the antioxidant enzymes in the wheat caused by the application of silicon under deficit water stress condition can be due to the elimination of ros overproduction pei et al 2010 5 conclusion the results showed that applying the nano fertilizers not only improved the wheat grain yield by increasing the plant height spike length number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight biological yield wue rwc and cmsi but also reduced and adjusted the negative effects caused by the deficit irrigation 50 of irrigation requirement by improving the activity of sod in general deficit irrigation decreased the studies traits compared to full irrigation of the wheat foliar application of the nano fertilizers coupled with full irrigation conditions increased all the yield and morphological characteristics of the wheat and the best values were related to spraying by the nano silica fertilizer the nano zinc and nano boron fertilizers were also studied in terms of improvement of the traits the results of this study showed the importance of foliar application by the nano chelating based fertilizers as high tech products that can protect the wheat against the irrigation stress based on these results and considering the scarcity of water resources and the importance of wheat production the use of the nano silica fertilizer is recommended
