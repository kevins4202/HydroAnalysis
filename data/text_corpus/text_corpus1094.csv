5470,soil and water assessment tool swat is one of the most widely used semi distributed hydrological models assessment of the uncertainties in swat outputs is a popular but challenging topic due to the significant number of parameters the purpose of this study is to investigate the use of polynomial chaos expansion pce in assessing uncertainty propagation in swat under the impact of significant parameter sensitivity furthermore for the first time a machine learning technique i e artificial neural network ann is integrated with pce to expand its capability in generating probabilistic forecasts of daily flow the traditional pce and the proposed pce ann methods are applied to a case study in the guadalupe watershed in texas usa to assess the uncertainty propagation in swat for flow prediction during the historical and forecasting periods the results show that pce provides similar results as the traditional monte carlo mc method with a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 99 for the mean flow during the historical period while the proposed pce ann method reproduces mc output with a r2 value of 0 84 for mean flow during the forecasting period it is also indicated that pce and pce ann are as reliable as but much more efficient than mc pce takes about 1 of the computational time required by mc pce ann only takes a few minutes to produce probabilistic forecasting while mc requires running the model for dozens or hundreds even thousands of times notably the development of the pce ann framework is the first attempt to explore pce s probabilistic forecasting capability using machine learning pce ann is a promising uncertainty assessment and probabilistic forecasting technique as it is more efficient in terms of computation time and it does not cause loss

forecasting 1 introduction in the water resources sector designers researchers and decision makers rely intensively on hydrological models hydrological models have become widely applied and highly evolved along with advancements in computing technology researchers have developed many hydrological models with different structures assumptions and processes the variety of hydrological models makes it difficult for users to decide which model best represents a watershed s hydrological processes the soil and water assessment tool swat has gained a lot of attention since arnold et al first proposed it in 1998 swat has been widely used for watershed modeling for several reasons 1 swat is an open source model which allows researchers and engineers to debug and improve the algorithm for higher accuracy for specific study areas eckhardt et al 2002 fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a b 2 swat is a semi distributed model which enables it to better balance the tradeoff between simulation efforts and accuracy compared to both lumped and fully distributed models when simulating large non homogenous watersheds eckhardt et al 2002 fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a b 3 swat has the ability to perform not only hydrological modeling but also simulate sediment transport and water quality processes arabi et al 2008 dagnew et al 2016 debele et al 2008 hallouz et al 2018 iudicello et al 2013 4 swat is compatible with geographic information system gis softeware which can present the results in a more informative and interactive manner to assist decision makers in interpreting different scenarios olivera et al 2006 shen et al 2013 suliman et al 2015 swat like many other hydrological models needs to be calibrated and validated the calibration process is performed on parameters that are either not directly measured or very sensitive the values of these parameters are adjusted to minimize the deviation between simulated results and observations one of the most widely used swat calibration toolkits is the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup arnold et al 2012 the swat cup toolbox provides several techniques for uncertainty analysis including generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 parameter solution para sol and markov chain monte carlo mcmc the computational time for all of these methods is relatively long and it increases with respect to watershed size and the number of parameters several approaches have been developed and tested to enhance calibration efficiency and to reduce computational time for example zhang et al 2009 used a genetic algorithm ga to calibrate the swat model using bayesian model averaging algorithm bma with the best model ensembles the ga bma model was able to address prediction uncertainty using interval estimation while requiring less computational time compared to mcmc comparing the computation time of this method to mcmc almost one order of magnitude in hours was reduced while producing comparable results li et al 2010 used a bootstrap algorithm with bma to calibrate a swat model the bootstrap algorithm was used to calibrate the model and to find the best set of parameters from a prior distribution then the model was recalibrated by generating new observation data from adding some residuals to the actual observation this process was repeated for several iterations to produce a posterior distribution for each parameter the bootstrap method used less computational time than the ga bma method but its performance in terms of uncertainty quantification varied significantly from case to case and thus was not always reliable these previous studies indicate that there is a need for more reliable and efficient uncertainty analysis methods for swat recently polynomial chaos expansion pce has been proposed as a new method for uncertainty quantification based on previous studies pce requires much less computational time than mc when used for analyzing the propagation of parameter uncertainties this algorithm has been used in many fields such as transportation stavropoulou and muller 2015 chemical process paffrath and wever 2007 villegas et al 2012 and aerodynamics wu et al 2018 it has also been used in water related areas such as groundwater flow and contaminant transport deman et al 2016 laloy et al 2013 li and zhang 2007 rupert and miller 2007 and computational fluid dynamics hosder 2010 najm 2009 tagade and choi 2014 more recently pce has been introduced to surface water modeling to quantify model uncertainty fan et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 used the pce with the lumped model hymod to test the potential of pce for assessing model uncertainty fan et al 2014 investigated the use of second and third order pce to address the parameter uncertainties in hymod the uncertainties of two parameters were analyzed and one year of synthetic data was used to compare the results generated by mc simulation second order pce and third order pce both second and third order pce provided similar results as mc the third order pce generated results closer to those generated by mc but was more computationally demanding compared to the second order pce wang et al 2015 used pce and reduced pce as well as mc with latent hypercube sampling lhs to conduct the uncertainty analysis for a case study of the xiangxi river watershed in china the hymod model was used to simulate two years of flow the results showed that pce and reduced pce gave similar results and almost the same nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse as mc lhs however the time required to perform mc lhs was 55 s whereas it only took 4 8 and 3 5 s for pce and reduced pce respectively both studies demonstrated the promising application of pce in replacing mc for uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling pce has the potential for application as an efficient technique that can save time and computational resources in uncertainty quantification and its advantages would only be more significant when applied to more sophisticated hydrological models however the hymod tested in these two studies is only a simple conceptual model which cannot demonstrate pce s applicability and reliability for more sophisticated hydrological models as such the application of pce on more complicated models such as a distributed or semi distributed model requires further investigation besides the existing pce method relies on observations to quantify the propagation of parameter uncertainties with a model which prevents it from providing hydrological forecasts under uncertainty therefore pce s capability for probabilistic forecasting should also be explored the objective of this study is to investigate the capability of pce in quantifying swat s parameter uncertainty and providing probabilistic flow forecasts in an efficient way to enable pce to generate hydrological forecasts under uncertainty with swat an artificial neural network algorithm ann will be integrated with pce the new pce ann method will be used to build a surrogate model for swat which can forecast daily flow and quantify the uncertainties associated with the obtained forecasts efficiently the proposed pce ann is applied to a case study in the guadalupe river watershed in texas usa this paper is divided into seven sections section 2 describes the setup of the swat model as well as its automatic calibration toolbox swat cup section 3 illustrates the framework and development processes of pce and pce ann section 4 describes the study area and the data used in this paper section 5 discusses the results of this study section 6 discusses the advantages and limitations of the pce ann method finally section 7 summarizes the conclusions of this study 2 swat model swat is a semi distributed model that has been widely used for hydrological and environmental modeling swat has gained much attention as it is open source software and many databases documentation and publications are available to the public additionally several software products such as arcswat qswat are available for swat to provide users with a user friendly interface and to present results as intuitive and informative maps swat is standardized for us topographic and weather conditions and all input data required to build a swat model is integrated within the swat database white et al 2016 2017 as shown in fig 1 swat is fed by multiple databases including the digital elevation models dems streamlines soil data and land uses to set up a swat model streamlines are first burnt to the dem to make sure that the automatic delineation is accurate second outlet points are selected at the desired flow gages third the delineation process is carried out based on the chosen outlets fourth the study area is classified according to land use soil characteristics and slope to determine the hydrologic response units hrus for each sub catchment fifth all weather data are fed into the model as a time series table sixth model parameters are estimated based on the slope land use soil data and weather conditions finally swat is ready for calibration and validation preferably with a warmup period to avoid any initialization error there are several different approaches for model calibration one of the most widely used toolkits is swat cup due to its ease of use and the variety of techniques to be used for calibration there are three automatic calibration algorithms embedded in swat cup sufi glue and para sol in this study sufi is used for model calibration for several reasons sufi is the fastest algorithm as it uses the lhs technique to cover the parameter ranges sufi depends on running the model several times with a narrower parameter range each time additionally in previous studies sufi has been found to have a slightly better performance compared to the other two algorithms khatun et al 2018 singh et al 2013 the calibration can be done after defining the uniform distribution of each parameter the number of iterations and the objective function the parameter ranges used in this study are determined based on previous studies and are shown in table 1 parameters that have different values spatially are changed by multiplying the original value by a ratio in order to keep the spatial distribution relatively consistent the curve number cn2 is an example of the spatial parameters so it is noted as relative change r other parameters that have a specific value assigned across the catchment are changed by randomly selecting a value from the corresponding uniform distribution these parameters are noted as replacement change v the objective of the calibration is to maximize the nse value after running the automatic calibration tool the best parameter set is chosen and the model can be re run in the swat cup for validation or in swat for further simulation swat cup can provide a global sensitivity analysis report during the calibration process the sensitivity report shows the most sensitive parameters that should be considered as the target parameters for uncertainty analysis the sensitivity report can be in the form of scatter plots or in a statistical format p test and t test if the scatter plot is uniformly distributed along the range then the corresponding parameter is not sensitive if there is a clear trend in the scatter points then this parameter is sensitive the statistical format is preferred over the scatter plot format in order to avoid human bias the parameter is considered sensitive if the p value is lower than 0 05 which also indicates that the t test values are high khatun et al 2018 yesuf et al 2016 when two parameters have the same p value a t test may be used for differentiating them in this study the five most significant parameters identified using this process are used for further uncertainty analysis 3 uncertainty quantification 3 1 polynomial chaos expansion pce pce is a statistical method which describes the uncertainties in a system using normally distributed random inputs the statistical process is a composition of independent gaussian random variables presented by hermite polynomial fan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the pce equation is written as 1 y a 0 i 1 n a i γ 1 ζ i i 1 n j 1 i a i j γ 2 ζ i ζ j where y is the output and γ p ζ 1 ζ 2 ζ p is the polynomial chaos of order p in previous studies an approximation has been made to truncate pce to a lower level to reduce the computational time while maintaining reasonable accuracy fan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the number of pce terms n is a function of the pce order p and the number of random variables used for uncertainty analysis m 2 n m p m p in this study a second order hermite polynomial is used to quantify the uncertainty associated with five parameters resulting in a total of 21 pce terms the equation of the output can be written as follows 3 y a 0 a 1 ζ 1 a 2 ζ 2 a 3 ζ 3 a 4 ζ 4 a 5 ζ 5 a 6 ζ 1 ζ 2 a 7 ζ 1 ζ 3 a 8 ζ 1 ζ 4 a 9 ζ 1 ζ 5 a 10 ζ 2 ζ 3 a 11 ζ 2 ζ 4 a 12 ζ 2 ζ 5 a 13 ζ 3 ζ 4 a 14 ζ 3 ζ 5 a 15 ζ 4 ζ 5 a 16 ζ 1 2 1 a 17 ζ 2 2 1 a 18 ζ 3 2 1 a 19 ζ 4 2 1 a 20 ζ 5 2 1 3 2 selection of collocation points the main idea of selecting the collocation points is to have the pce output be the same as the model output at those selected points once the equations are established the coefficients in eq 3 can be obtained this coefficient estimation method is called the probabilistic collocation method pcm the collocation points can be selected using the combination of the roots of the one order higher hermite polynomial thus for the second order hermite polynomial the collocation points are the combination of the three roots 3 0 3 for each ζ value in this study there are five pce parameters which results in a total of 243 collocation points since there are only 21 unknowns and 243 equations realizations this system of equations is overdetermined unless there is redundancy in the equations solving the system of equations using linear regression is feasible in the historical period as the simulation output of the model is known i e observations are available as shown in fig 2 a the model output can be expressed as a set of hermite orthogonal polynomials in terms of standard normal random variables using pce which can be used to assess the propagation of parameter uncertainty the pce coefficients can be estimated using observation data during the historical period however for the forecasting period the coefficients are unknown due to the lack of observation data as shown in fig 2b thus the uncertainties associated with the forecasts cannot be quantified using the traditional pce method in this study a machine learning technique i e ann is introduced to the traditional pce framework to enable the analysis of uncertainties associated with simulated future time series and to generate probabilistic forecasts 3 3 estimation of pce coefficients based on machine learning to address the aforementioned issue a machine learning technique is implemented to estimate the pce coefficients for the forecasting period where observed flow data is unavailable in the forecasting period the coefficients and outputs are unknown as shown in fig 2b as shown in fig 2c ann is used to build the relationships between meteorological data and pce coefficients in the historical training period the trained ann model is then used to estimate the pce coefficients in the forecasting period which are directly used as the coefficients of the pce terms finally the hermite polynomials can be obtained to build a pce surrogate model and thus the uncertainties associated with the future flow can be quantified through probabilistic forecasting the ann model built in this study consists of 18 input variables including multi day cumulative precipitation denoted as p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p15 p30 p45 p60 p90 p120 p150 and p180 maximum daily temperature minimum daily temperature and wind speed the output is the 21 pce coefficients the ann model is built using one hidden layer with 25 neurons the numbers of hidden layers and neurons are determined based on a series of sensitivity analysis a backpropagation algorithm is used to find the weights and coefficients during the training period of the ann model since the ann model produces different weights and coefficients every time the model is trained the model is trained for hundred realizations and the average is taken as the model output 3 4 the uncertainty anlaysis framework fig 3 summarizes the process of uncertainty analysis for swat using both mc and pce ann first a swat model is built for the study area then the swat model is calibrated using swat cup the goal of this process is to find the most sensitive parameters as well as the best values for the non sensitive parameters after selecting the sensitive parameters both mc and pce ann can be performed to perform mc the chosen parameters are changed randomly within its physical range for 10 000 realizations to find the uncertainty in the prediction period on the other hand to perform pce ann the chosen parameters are assumed to be independent and are transformed to standard normal distributions collocation points are then selected from the normal distribution for each parameter then the swat model is run with all the possible combinations of parameter values at the collocation points and one output value is obtained for each combination at each time step subsequently a linear equation where the pce coefficients are the unknowns can be established for each parameter combination at each time step the system of linear equations can be solved to find the values of the pce coefficients with the obtained pce coefficients the pce surrogate model is built for the calibration period for the future period ann is trained to find the relationships between metrological data and pce coefficients during the historical period so that the pce coefficients can be found using meteorological forecasts finally a pce equation can be obtained to quantify the uncertainties at each time step of the forecasting period without running swat or obtaining flow observations 4 study area and data collection a case study of the guadalupe basin in texas usa is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed pce ann method the guadalupe basin as shown in fig 4 is located in southeastern texas with an outflow into the gulf of mexico the study area is the upper sub catchment that is gauged at the spring branch the spring branch watershed is approximately 3 500 km2 and has an average slope of 0 12 with a 345 m elevation drop along the longest 290 km stream path four years of rainfall temperature and flow data for the spring branch watershed are used in this case study weather data is collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa flow data is from the united states geological survey usgs soil data of a 30 m resolution is obtained from the state soil geographic dataset by united states department of agriculture usda land cover data of a 30 m resolution is from the national land cover database nlcd and dem of 90 m resolution is from srtm v4 1 data which is derived from the usgs nasa srtm data with a square grid of a size 5 the data cover the period between 1988 and 1997 with a daily resolution the data are divided into three parts for modeling purposes the first year 1988 is used as a warmup period three years 1989 1991 of data are used for calibration and sensitivity analysis and this period is assumed to be historical six years 1992 1997 of data are used for flow forecasting as well as uncertainty analysis assuming it is the forecasting i e future period the basin lies in a moderate temperature zone with an overall average maximum temperature of 27 c and an average minimum of 16 c during the study period the basin is in a semi arid region where the average rainfall is 2 48 mm day resulting in a relatively low average streamflow the flow is less than 17 60 m3 s most of the time during the stduy period however there are few days with extreme events causing high peak flow that reaches to approximately 1 600 m3 s during the calibration period and 1 900 m3 s during the forecasting period 5 results 5 1 calibration and parameter sensitivity calibration of the swat model was performed for a total of 27 parameters over the historical period from 1989 to 1991 during the automatic calibration process four parameters were updated by a particular ratio to maintain spatial consistency while the remaining parameters were replaced using values randomly chosen from the uniform distributions over their physical ranges shown in table 1 after running an automatic calibration process for 2 000 iterations the fitted values were extracted as shown in table 2 the calibration process produces results with a nse value of 0 77 the results imply that swat can provide satisfactory daily flow prediction for the study area li et al 2010 yang et al 2008 2007 zhang et al 2016a b it is worth mentioning that the model performance was also tested using six years of data for calibration and three years for validation there was no significant change in model performance when the length of calibration period is changed which further demonstrates swat s capability of simulating the spring branch catchment the sensitivity analysis results as the t and p values are also presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 there are 11 sensitive parameters based on the significance level of the p value p value less than 0 05 cn is the most sensitive parameter based on the t stat the other 10 sensitive parameters can be classified into three groups the first group describes channel properties which can be measured directly through stream and watershed survey and thus were not considered as uncertain parameters the second group contains soil moisture and density parameters which are the most sensitive parameters as they have a significant impact on infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration processes the third group of sensitive parameters is related to baseflow which determines the amount of infiltrated water that recontributes to streamflow as well as the travel time to reach the watershed outlet in this study the propagation of the uncertainties of five parameters were assessed the five parameters include cn and two parameters from both the second and third groups from the second group soil evaporation compensation factor esco and available water content sol awc were selected to represent the evaporation process and the amount of infiltration respectively from the third group baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and groundwater delay gw delay were selected to determine the ratio of groundwater contributing to streamflow and the time it takes to reach the stream it is worth pointing out that changing the calibration algorithm and or the length of calibration period could result in different parameter values and different sensitive parameter sets however the pce ann framework to be developed would remain the same the proposed model is capable of analyzing the uncertainties of all sensitive parameters but only the most representative five parameters were chosen for demonstration purposes in this study 5 2 building a pce surrogate for swat before exploring and improving pce s capability of addressing forecasting uncertainties the traditional pce s performance for quantifying the uncertainties during the historical period was evaluated based on the calibration results optimized values of swat s parameters were found however as shown in the sensitivity analysis results some sensitive parameters lead to significant uncertainty the uncertainty analysis for swat was performed by setting all the parameters to fixed values and only changing the chosen five sensitive parameters to perform the pce on the historical period 1989 1991 the swat model was run for 243 times at the collocation point combinations after performing those runs the pce coefficients were calculated and the parameter uncertainty that propagated to the model output was described using hermite polynomials of the standard gaussian variable as shown in eq 1 in order to assess pce s reliability in terms of quantifying swat s parameter uncertainty the pce s results were compared to those of a traditional uncertainty quantification technique mc simulation 10 000 sets of parameter values were taken from the parameter distributions and used to run swat simulations for mc analysis the mean flow and the variance were calculated as shown in figs 5 and 6 the mean daily flow is almost the same for both mc and pce as shown in figs 7 and 8 the variance tends to be higher in the mc results than pce because the surrogate pce model was built based on using the collocation points which only accounts for approximate 90 of the parameter range the results demonstrate that pce can be considered as a reliable alternative of mc for quantifying swat s parameter uncertainty by building an surrogate of swat pce can generate uncertainty analysis results similar to mc while reducing the required simulation runs from thousands to 243 however it should be noted that the pce approach can only be used when observations are known in order to find the coefficients in the surrogate model so the current pce cannot be used for generating forecasts under uncertainty a machine learning algorithm ann was introduced to extend the pce capabilities in probabilistic flow forecasting 5 3 exploring pce s forecasting capability to enable pce for generating flow forecasts under parameter uncertainty ann was used to find the relationships between metrological conditions and the corresponding pce coefficients the ann model was trained several times to ensure the stability of the results the mean square error for the model on average was 0 01 with a standard deviation of 0 08 and an average coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 90 for the 21 coefficients which indicates that the model is reliable once the model was validated it could be used to find the coefficient in the forecasting period 1992 1997 to perform uncertainty analysis for the forecasting period 1992 1997 using the proposed pce ann framework swat was first run for 243 times at the collocation points for the period 1989 1991 then the ann model was built to estimate pce coefficients in the forecasting period finally the uncertainties associated with the forecasted flow can be decoded using a composition of independent gaussian random variables presented by hermite polynomial for comparison purposes a mc simulation of swat was conducted for the five sensitive parameters and random values from the normal distributions in pce were used to generate samples of the pce output from the 10 000 runs of the mc simulation and the surrogate pce ann results mean flow variance as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles were calculated the mean flow predicted by both pce ann and mc is shown in fig 9 although the difference between pce ann and mc during the forecasting period is slightly higher than that during the historical period the two mean flow time series share a very similar pattern there is only a small overestimation for a few values in 1992 1995 and 1996 this overestimation may be a result of the error propagation which started during the process of pce coefficient estimation based on ann fig 10 shows the linear relationship between pce ann and mc mean values the r2 value is 0 84 which indicates that there is a good fit between the pce ann and mc results with only some minor deviations the slope of the best fit line is slightly less than 1 which implies an overall overestimation by the pce ann framework compared to mc when the mean flow is compared with observation mc has an nse value of 0 52 while pce ann has an nse value of 0 55 this indicates that both mc and pce ann performed well for flow forecasting the variability of flow generated from both pce ann and mc is represented as the standard deviation in fig 11 the variation is higher in mc than pce ann most of the time which agrees with the deduction made in the historical period it is worth mentioning that the pce ann output has a higher variation for the peak flow in july 1997 fig 12 shows the linear relationship between the standard deviation values of pce ann and mc fig 12 shows that the standard deviation is similar at low uncertainty conditions whereas mc variation is higher at high uncertainty conditions in general the slope of best fit is greater than one which indicated that the mc output has an overall higher variance as apprehended from the previous section fig 12 also shows that the standard deviation has an acceptable fit with a r2 value of 0 65 fig 13 shows more details by presenting the 25th and 75th percentiles from both methods to further compare the pce ann and mc results the distributions of flow on four selected days are presented in fig 14 the histograms show that the shapes of probability distributions generated by mc and pce ann are very similar from the comparison results it can be concluded that pce ann is able to provide probabilistic forecasts close to mc s with much less computational time and resources 6 discussion the use of polynomial chaos expansion pce to build a surrogate model for the semi distributed swat model was successful the pce produced very similar uncertainty analysis results during the historical period as the monte carlo mc method this proves that pce can be used to build a surrogate model for analyzing the parameter uncertainty in swat to enable pce for probabilistic forecasting a machine learning algorithm was integrated to estimate pce coefficients for the forecasting period where flow observation data is not available artificial neural network ann succeeded to mimic the relationship between weather input and pce coefficients the proposed pce ann method generated similar probabilistic outputs compared to mc simulation in terms of mean and variation with a r2 value of 0 84 and 0 64 respectively based on previous studies the r2 value of 0 84 for mean daily flow can be considered a good fit for example thavhana et al 2018 obtained an r2 of 0 65 for swat calibration and 0 523 for validation and li et al 2010 obtained an r2 of 0 70 for daily streamflow forecasting using swat and 0 86 for monthly forecasting in terms of computation efficiency the mc simulation took approximately 50 hours while it took only 30 min to build the pce moreover it took pce ann several minutes to generate probabilistic flow forecasts while mc required another 50 hours to re run the model for the future period these results demonstrate that the use of pce could signficantly reduce the computation time for uncertainty analysis ann is a widely used machine learning method and its performance is satisfactory for this particular case study this is why only ann was tested and integrated into the pce framework in this study nevertheless other statistical or machine learning methods can be further investigated for future studies the selection of candidate method depends on the quality and quantity of input data as well as the ability of the method itself ideally a candidate method should have a structure well suited for multi target prediction in order to support the estimation of multiple pce coefficients ibrahim and karakurt 2013 mosavi et al 2018 one limitation of pce is that the uncertain model parameters are assumed to be independent pce is not applicable if the model parameters are interdependent there are a few studies that attempted to address the issue of correlated parameters however only the parameter correlations in simple models can be tackled in the existing studies paulson et al 2017 rahman 2018 there is no existing pce framework that can quantify the effects of correlated parameters on the output of complex hydrological models further research is required to enable pce to support uncertainty analysis for hydrological models with dependent parameters another assumption in this study is that the parameters all have a uniform distribution defined by its range whereas in reality the distribution varies depending on the catchment morphology in future research the use of other methods such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue for finding more accurate parameter distributions can be further investigated yang et al 2008 introducing glue into the pce framework will increase the required computational time however it would still be worth investigating as glue have the potential to address the issue of parameter dependency as well 7 conclusions in this study a new pce ann approach for quantifying parameter uncertainty and generating probabilistic flow forecasts was developed the proposed method can quantitatively describe the propagation of parameter uncertainty in a modeling system and was applied to the hydrological modeling of the guadalupe basin in texas us previously pce has only been used to build surrogates for simple lumped hydrological models such as hymod in this study pce was used for a more complex semi distributed model swat for the first time the traditional pce framework requires observed flow as input to assess the propagation of parameter uncertainty and thus could not be used to analyze the uncertainties in future time series by innovatively integrating data driven techniques into the traditional pce framework the proposed pce ann approach enables the pce to generate probabilistic flow forecasts the probabilistic forecasting results of pce ann were compared to those of mc simulation the results demonstrated that pce ann is able to provide probabilities forecasts close to mc s with much less computation time pce ann s advantage in terms of computational efficiency is expected to be more significantly beneficial as the model complexity increases in the future the pce ann should be tested for other complex hydrological models as well as for more watersheds of different sizes and types other advanced data driven techniques can be further investigated to improve the prediction of pce coefficients also one of pce s fundamental assumption is that the uncertain parameters are independent further research is needed to address the common parameter dependency issue in hydrological modeling credit authorship contribution statement maysara ghaith methodology software writing original draft zhong li conceptualization

efforts and accuracy compared to both lumped and fully distributed models when simulating large non homogenous watersheds eckhardt et al 2002 fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a b 3 swat has the ability to perform not only hydrological modeling but also simulate sediment transport and water quality processes arabi et al 2008 dagnew et al 2016 debele et al 2008 hallouz et al 2018 iudicello et al 2013 4 swat is compatible with geographic information system gis softeware which can present the results in a more informative and interactive manner to assist decision makers in interpreting different scenarios olivera et al 2006 shen et al 2013 suliman et al 2015 swat like many other hydrological models needs to be calibrated and validated the calibration process is performed on parameters that are either not directly measured or very sensitive the values of these parameters are adjusted to minimize the deviation between simulated results and observations one of the most widely used swat calibration toolkits is the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup arnold et al 2012 the swat cup toolbox provides several techniques for uncertainty analysis including generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 parameter solution para sol and markov chain monte carlo mcmc the computational time for all of these methods is relatively long and it increases with respect to watershed size and the number of parameters several approaches have been developed and tested to enhance calibration efficiency and to reduce computational time for example zhang et al 2009 used a genetic algorithm ga to calibrate the swat model using bayesian model averaging algorithm bma with the best model ensembles the ga bma model was able to address prediction uncertainty using interval estimation while requiring less computational time compared to mcmc comparing the computation time of this method to mcmc almost one order of magnitude in hours was reduced while producing comparable results li et al 2010 used a bootstrap algorithm with bma to calibrate a swat model the bootstrap algorithm was used to calibrate the model and to find the best set of parameters from a prior distribution then the model was recalibrated by generating new observation data from adding some residuals to the actual observation this process was repeated for several iterations to produce a posterior distribution for each parameter the bootstrap method used less computational time than the ga bma method but its performance in terms of uncertainty quantification varied significantly from case to case and thus was not always reliable these previous studies indicate that there is a need for more reliable and efficient uncertainty analysis methods for swat recently polynomial chaos expansion pce has been proposed as a new method for uncertainty quantification based on previous studies pce requires much less computational time than mc when used for analyzing the propagation of parameter uncertainties this algorithm has been used in many fields such as transportation stavropoulou and muller 2015 chemical process paffrath and wever 2007 villegas et al 2012 and aerodynamics wu et al 2018 it has also been used in water related areas such as groundwater flow and contaminant transport deman et al 2016 laloy et al 2013 li and zhang 2007 rupert and miller 2007 and computational fluid dynamics hosder 2010 najm 2009 tagade and choi 2014 more recently pce has been introduced to surface water modeling to quantify model uncertainty fan et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 used the pce with the lumped model hymod to test the potential of pce for assessing model uncertainty fan et al 2014 investigated the use of second and third order pce to address the parameter uncertainties in hymod the uncertainties of two parameters were analyzed and one year of synthetic data was used to compare the results generated by mc simulation second order pce and third order pce both second and third order pce provided similar results as mc the third order pce generated results closer to those generated by mc but was more computationally demanding compared to the second order pce wang et al 2015 used pce and reduced pce as well as mc with latent hypercube sampling lhs to conduct the uncertainty analysis for a case study of the xiangxi river watershed in china the hymod model was used to simulate two years of flow the results showed that pce and reduced pce gave similar results and almost the same nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse as mc lhs however the time required to perform mc lhs was 55 s whereas it only took 4 8 and 3 5 s for pce and reduced pce respectively both studies demonstrated the promising application of pce in replacing mc for uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling pce has the potential for application as an efficient technique that can save time and computational resources in uncertainty quantification and its advantages would only be more significant when applied to more sophisticated hydrological models however the hymod tested in these two studies is only a simple conceptual model which cannot demonstrate pce s applicability and reliability for more sophisticated hydrological models as such the application of pce on more complicated models such as a distributed or semi distributed model requires further investigation besides the existing pce method relies on observations to quantify the propagation of parameter uncertainties with a model which prevents it from providing hydrological forecasts under uncertainty therefore pce s capability for probabilistic forecasting should also be explored the objective of this study is to investigate the capability of pce in quantifying swat s parameter uncertainty and providing probabilistic flow forecasts in an efficient way to enable pce to generate hydrological forecasts under uncertainty with swat an artificial neural network algorithm ann will be integrated with pce the new pce ann method will be used to build a surrogate model for swat which can forecast daily flow and quantify the uncertainties associated with the obtained forecasts efficiently the proposed pce ann is applied to a case study in the guadalupe river watershed in texas usa this paper is divided into seven sections section 2 describes the setup of the swat model as well as its automatic calibration toolbox swat cup section 3 illustrates the framework and development processes of pce and pce ann section 4 describes the study area and the data used in this paper section 5 discusses the results of this study section 6 discusses the advantages and limitations of the pce ann method finally section 7 summarizes the conclusions of this study 2 swat model swat is a semi distributed model that has been widely used for hydrological and environmental modeling swat has gained much attention as it is open source software and many databases documentation and publications are available to the public additionally several software products such as arcswat qswat are available for swat to provide users with a user friendly interface and to present results as intuitive and informative maps swat is standardized for us topographic and weather conditions and all input data required to build a swat model is integrated within the swat database white et al 2016 2017 as shown in fig 1 swat is fed by multiple databases including the digital elevation models dems streamlines soil data and land uses to set up a swat model streamlines are first burnt to the dem to make sure that the automatic delineation is accurate second outlet points are selected at the desired flow gages third the delineation process is carried out based on the chosen outlets fourth the study area is classified according to land use soil characteristics and slope to determine the hydrologic response units hrus for each sub catchment fifth all weather data are fed into the model as a time series table sixth model parameters are estimated based on the slope land use soil data and weather conditions finally swat is ready for calibration and validation preferably with a warmup period to avoid any initialization error there are several different approaches for model calibration one of the most widely used toolkits is swat cup due to its ease of use and the variety of techniques to be used for calibration there are three automatic calibration algorithms embedded in swat cup sufi glue and para sol in this study sufi is used for model calibration for several reasons sufi is the fastest algorithm as it uses the lhs technique to cover the parameter ranges sufi depends on running the model several times with a narrower parameter range each time additionally in previous studies sufi has been found to have a slightly better performance compared to the other two algorithms khatun et al 2018 singh et al 2013 the calibration can be done after defining the uniform distribution of each parameter the number of iterations and the objective function the parameter ranges used in this study are determined based on previous studies and are shown in table 1 parameters that have different values spatially are changed by multiplying the original value by a ratio in order to keep the spatial distribution relatively consistent the curve number cn2 is an example of the spatial parameters so it is noted as relative change r other parameters that have a specific value assigned across the catchment are changed by randomly selecting a value from the corresponding uniform distribution these parameters are noted as replacement change v the objective of the calibration is to maximize the nse value after running the automatic calibration tool the best parameter set is chosen and the model can be re run in the swat cup for validation or in swat for further simulation swat cup can provide a global sensitivity analysis report during the calibration process the sensitivity report shows the most sensitive parameters that should be considered as the target parameters for uncertainty analysis the sensitivity report can be in the form of scatter plots or in a statistical format p test and t test if the scatter plot is uniformly distributed along the range then the corresponding parameter is not sensitive if there is a clear trend in the scatter points then this parameter is sensitive the statistical format is preferred over the scatter plot format in order to avoid human bias the parameter is considered sensitive if the p value is lower than 0 05 which also indicates that the t test values are high khatun et al 2018 yesuf et al 2016 when two parameters have the same p value a t test may be used for differentiating them in this study the five most significant parameters identified using this process are used for further uncertainty analysis 3 uncertainty quantification 3 1 polynomial chaos expansion pce pce is a statistical method which describes the uncertainties in a system using normally distributed random inputs the statistical process is a composition of independent gaussian random variables presented by hermite polynomial fan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the pce equation is written as 1 y a 0 i 1 n a i γ 1 ζ i i 1 n j 1 i a i j γ 2 ζ i ζ j where y is the output and γ p ζ 1 ζ 2 ζ p is the polynomial chaos of order p in previous studies an approximation has been made to truncate pce to a lower level to reduce the computational time while maintaining reasonable accuracy fan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the number of pce terms n is a function of the pce order p and the number of random variables used for uncertainty analysis m 2 n m p m p in this study a second order hermite polynomial is used to quantify the uncertainty associated with five parameters resulting in a total of 21 pce terms the equation of the output can be written as follows 3 y a 0 a 1 ζ 1 a 2 ζ 2 a 3 ζ 3 a 4 ζ 4 a 5 ζ 5 a 6 ζ 1 ζ 2 a 7 ζ 1 ζ 3 a 8 ζ 1 ζ 4 a 9 ζ 1 ζ 5 a 10 ζ 2 ζ 3 a 11 ζ 2 ζ 4 a 12 ζ 2 ζ 5 a 13 ζ 3 ζ 4 a 14 ζ 3 ζ 5 a 15 ζ 4 ζ 5 a 16 ζ 1 2 1 a 17 ζ 2 2 1 a 18 ζ 3 2 1 a 19 ζ 4 2 1 a 20 ζ 5 2 1 3 2 selection of collocation points the main idea of selecting the collocation points is to have the pce output be the same as the model output at those selected points once the equations are established the coefficients in eq 3 can be obtained this coefficient estimation method is called the probabilistic collocation method pcm the collocation points can be selected using the combination of the roots of the one order higher hermite polynomial thus for the second order hermite polynomial the collocation points are the combination of the three roots 3 0 3 for each ζ value in this study there are five pce parameters which results in a total of 243 collocation points since there are only 21 unknowns and 243 equations realizations this system of equations is overdetermined unless there is redundancy in the equations solving the system of equations using linear regression is feasible in the historical period as the simulation output of the model is known i e observations are available as shown in fig 2 a the model output can be expressed as a set of hermite orthogonal polynomials in terms of standard normal random variables using pce which can be used to assess the propagation of parameter uncertainty the pce coefficients can be estimated using observation data during the historical period however for the forecasting period the coefficients are unknown due to the lack of observation data as shown in fig 2b thus the uncertainties associated with the forecasts cannot be quantified using the traditional pce method in this study a machine learning technique i e ann is introduced to the traditional pce framework to enable the analysis of uncertainties associated with simulated future time series and to generate probabilistic forecasts 3 3 estimation of pce coefficients based on machine learning to address the aforementioned issue a machine learning technique is implemented to estimate the pce coefficients for the forecasting period where observed flow data is unavailable in the forecasting period the coefficients and outputs are unknown as shown in fig 2b as shown in fig 2c ann is used to build the relationships between meteorological data and pce coefficients in the historical training period the trained ann model is then used to estimate the pce coefficients in the forecasting period which are directly used as the coefficients of the pce terms finally the hermite polynomials can be obtained to build a pce surrogate model and thus the uncertainties associated with the future flow can be quantified through probabilistic forecasting the ann model built in this study consists of 18 input variables including multi day cumulative precipitation denoted as p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p15 p30 p45 p60 p90 p120 p150 and p180 maximum daily temperature minimum daily temperature and wind speed the output is the 21 pce coefficients the ann model is built using one hidden layer with 25 neurons the numbers of hidden layers and neurons are determined based on a series of sensitivity analysis a backpropagation algorithm is used to find the weights and coefficients during the training period of the ann model since the ann model produces different weights and coefficients every time the model is trained the model is trained for hundred realizations and the average is taken as the model output 3 4 the uncertainty anlaysis framework fig 3 summarizes the process of uncertainty analysis for swat using both mc and pce ann first a swat model is built for the study area then the swat model is calibrated using swat cup the goal of this process is to find the most sensitive parameters as well as the best values for the non sensitive parameters after selecting the sensitive parameters both mc and pce ann can be performed to perform mc the chosen parameters are changed randomly within its physical range for 10 000 realizations to find the uncertainty in the prediction period on the other hand to perform pce ann the chosen parameters are assumed to be independent and are transformed to standard normal distributions collocation points are then selected from the normal distribution for each parameter then the swat model is run with all the possible combinations of parameter values at the collocation points and one output value is obtained for each combination at each time step subsequently a linear equation where the pce coefficients are the unknowns can be established for each parameter combination at each time step the system of linear equations can be solved to find the values of the pce coefficients with the obtained pce coefficients the pce surrogate model is built for the calibration period for the future period ann is trained to find the relationships between metrological data and pce coefficients during the historical period so that the pce coefficients can be found using meteorological forecasts finally a pce equation can be obtained to quantify the uncertainties at each time step of the forecasting period without running swat or obtaining flow observations 4 study area and data collection a case study of the guadalupe basin in texas usa is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed pce ann method the guadalupe basin as shown in fig 4 is located in southeastern texas with an outflow into the gulf of mexico the study area is the upper sub catchment that is gauged at the spring branch the spring branch watershed is approximately 3 500 km2 and has an average slope of 0 12 with a 345 m elevation drop along the longest 290 km stream path four years of rainfall temperature and flow data for the spring branch watershed are used in this case study weather data is collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa flow data is from the united states geological survey usgs soil data of a 30 m resolution is obtained from the state soil geographic dataset by united states department of agriculture usda land cover data of a 30 m resolution is from the national land cover database nlcd and dem of 90 m resolution is from srtm v4 1 data which is derived from the usgs nasa srtm data with a square grid of a size 5 the data cover the period between 1988 and 1997 with a daily resolution the data are divided into three parts for modeling purposes the first year 1988 is used as a warmup period three years 1989 1991 of data are used for calibration and sensitivity analysis and this period is assumed to be historical six years 1992 1997 of data are used for flow forecasting as well as uncertainty analysis assuming it is the forecasting i e future period the basin lies in a moderate temperature zone with an overall average maximum temperature of 27 c and an average minimum of 16 c during the study period the basin is in a semi arid region where the average rainfall is 2 48 mm day resulting in a relatively low average streamflow the flow is less than 17 60 m3 s most of the time during the stduy period however there are few days with extreme events causing high peak flow that reaches to approximately 1 600 m3 s during the calibration period and 1 900 m3 s during the forecasting period 5 results 5 1 calibration and parameter sensitivity calibration of the swat model was performed for a total of 27 parameters over the historical period from 1989 to 1991 during the automatic calibration process four parameters were updated by a particular ratio to maintain spatial consistency while the remaining parameters were replaced using values randomly chosen from the uniform distributions over their physical ranges shown in table 1 after running an automatic calibration process for 2 000 iterations the fitted values were extracted as shown in table 2 the calibration process produces results with a nse value of 0 77 the results imply that swat can provide satisfactory daily flow prediction for the study area li et al 2010 yang et al 2008 2007 zhang et al 2016a b it is worth mentioning that the model performance was also tested using six years of data for calibration and three years for validation there was no significant change in model performance when the length of calibration period is changed which further demonstrates swat s capability of simulating the spring branch catchment the sensitivity analysis results as the t and p values are also presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 there are 11 sensitive parameters based on the significance level of the p value p value less than 0 05 cn is the most sensitive parameter based on the t stat the other 10 sensitive parameters can be classified into three groups the first group describes channel properties which can be measured directly through stream and watershed survey and thus were not considered as uncertain parameters the second group contains soil moisture and density parameters which are the most sensitive parameters as they have a significant impact on infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration processes the third group of sensitive parameters is related to baseflow which determines the amount of infiltrated water that recontributes to streamflow as well as the travel time to reach the watershed outlet in this study the propagation of the uncertainties of five parameters were assessed the five parameters include cn and two parameters from both the second and third groups from the second group soil evaporation compensation factor esco and available water content sol awc were selected to represent the evaporation process and the amount of infiltration respectively from the third group baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and groundwater delay gw delay were selected to determine the ratio of groundwater contributing to streamflow and the time it takes to reach the stream it is worth pointing out that changing the calibration algorithm and or the length of calibration period could result in different parameter values and different sensitive parameter sets however the pce ann framework to be developed would remain the same the proposed model is capable of analyzing the uncertainties of all sensitive parameters but only the most representative five parameters were chosen for demonstration purposes in this study 5 2 building a pce surrogate for swat before exploring and improving pce s capability of addressing forecasting uncertainties the traditional pce s performance for quantifying the uncertainties during the historical period was evaluated based on the calibration results optimized values of swat s parameters were found however as shown in the sensitivity analysis results some sensitive parameters lead to significant uncertainty the uncertainty analysis for swat was performed by setting all the parameters to fixed values and only changing the chosen five sensitive parameters to perform the pce on the historical period 1989 1991 the swat model was run for 243 times at the collocation point combinations after performing those runs the pce coefficients were calculated and the parameter uncertainty that propagated to the model output was described using hermite polynomials of the standard gaussian variable as shown in eq 1 in order to assess pce s reliability in terms of quantifying swat s parameter uncertainty the pce s results were compared to those of a traditional uncertainty quantification technique mc simulation 10 000 sets of parameter values were taken from the parameter distributions and used to run swat simulations for mc analysis the mean flow and the variance were calculated as shown in figs 5 and 6 the mean daily flow is almost the same for both mc and pce as shown in figs 7 and 8 the variance tends to be higher in the mc results than pce because the surrogate pce model was built based on using the collocation points which only accounts for approximate 90 of the parameter range the results demonstrate that pce can be considered as a reliable alternative of mc for quantifying swat s parameter uncertainty by building an surrogate of swat pce can generate uncertainty analysis results similar to mc while reducing the required simulation runs from thousands to 243 however it should be noted that the pce approach can only be used when observations are known in order to find the coefficients in the surrogate model so the current pce cannot be used for generating forecasts under uncertainty a machine learning algorithm ann was introduced to extend the pce capabilities in probabilistic flow forecasting 5 3 exploring pce s forecasting capability to enable pce for generating flow forecasts under parameter uncertainty ann was used to find the relationships between metrological conditions and the corresponding pce coefficients the ann model was trained several times to ensure the stability of the results the mean square error for the model on average was 0 01 with a standard deviation of 0 08 and an average coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 90 for the 21 coefficients which indicates that the model is reliable once the model was validated it could be used to find the coefficient in the forecasting period 1992 1997 to perform uncertainty analysis for the forecasting period 1992 1997 using the proposed pce ann framework swat was first run for 243 times at the collocation points for the period 1989 1991 then the ann model was built to estimate pce coefficients in the forecasting period finally the uncertainties associated with the forecasted flow can be decoded using a composition of independent gaussian random variables presented by hermite polynomial for comparison purposes a mc simulation of swat was conducted for the five sensitive parameters and random values from the normal distributions in pce were used to generate samples of the pce output from the 10 000 runs of the mc simulation and the surrogate pce ann results mean flow variance as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles were calculated the mean flow predicted by both pce ann and mc is shown in fig 9 although the difference between pce ann and mc during the forecasting period is slightly higher than that during the historical period the two mean flow time series share a very similar pattern there is only a small overestimation for a few values in 1992 1995 and 1996 this overestimation may be a result of the error propagation which started during the process of pce coefficient estimation based on ann fig 10 shows the linear relationship between pce ann and mc mean values the r2 value is 0 84 which indicates that there is a good fit between the pce ann and mc results with only some minor deviations the slope of the best fit line is slightly less than 1 which implies an overall overestimation by the pce ann framework compared to mc when the mean flow is compared with observation mc has an nse value of 0 52 while pce ann has an nse value of 0 55 this indicates that both mc and pce ann performed well for flow forecasting the variability of flow generated from both pce ann and mc is represented as the standard deviation in fig 11 the variation is higher in mc than pce ann most of the time which agrees with the deduction made in the historical period it is worth mentioning that the pce ann output has a higher variation for the peak flow in july 1997 fig 12 shows the linear relationship between the standard deviation values of pce ann and mc fig 12 shows that the standard deviation is similar at low uncertainty conditions whereas mc variation is higher at high uncertainty conditions in general the slope of best fit is greater than one which indicated that the mc output has an overall higher variance as apprehended from the previous section fig 12 also shows that the standard deviation has an acceptable fit with a r2 value of 0 65 fig 13 shows more details by presenting the 25th and 75th percentiles from both methods to further compare the pce ann and mc results the distributions of flow on four selected days are presented in fig 14 the histograms show that the shapes of probability distributions generated by mc and pce ann are very similar from the comparison results it can be concluded that pce ann is able to provide probabilistic forecasts close to mc s with much less computational time and resources 6 discussion the use of polynomial chaos expansion pce to build a surrogate model for the semi distributed swat model was successful the pce produced very similar uncertainty analysis results during the historical period as the monte carlo mc method this proves that pce can be used to build a surrogate model for analyzing the parameter uncertainty in swat to enable pce for probabilistic forecasting a machine learning algorithm was integrated to estimate pce coefficients for the forecasting period where flow observation data is not available artificial neural network ann succeeded to mimic the relationship between weather input and pce coefficients the proposed pce ann method generated similar probabilistic outputs compared to mc simulation in terms of mean and variation with a r2 value of 0 84 and 0 64 respectively based on previous studies the r2 value of 0 84 for mean daily flow can be considered a good fit for example thavhana et al 2018 obtained an r2 of 0 65 for swat calibration and 0 523 for validation and li et al 2010 obtained an r2 of 0 70 for daily streamflow forecasting using swat and 0 86 for monthly forecasting in terms of computation efficiency the mc simulation took approximately 50 hours while it took only 30 min to build the pce moreover it took pce ann several minutes to generate probabilistic flow forecasts while mc required another 50 hours to re run the model for the future period these results demonstrate that the use of pce could signficantly reduce the computation time for uncertainty analysis ann is a widely used machine learning method and its performance is satisfactory for this particular case study this is why only ann was tested and integrated into the pce framework in this study nevertheless other statistical or machine learning methods can be further investigated for future studies the selection of candidate method depends on the quality and quantity of input data as well as the ability of the method itself ideally a candidate method should have a structure well suited for multi target prediction in order to support the estimation of multiple pce coefficients ibrahim and karakurt 2013 mosavi et al 2018 one limitation of pce is that the uncertain model parameters are assumed to be independent pce is not applicable if the model parameters are interdependent there are a few studies that attempted to address the issue of correlated parameters however only the parameter correlations in simple models can be tackled in the existing studies paulson et al 2017 rahman 2018 there is no existing pce framework that can quantify the effects of correlated parameters on the output of complex hydrological models further research is required to enable pce to support uncertainty analysis for hydrological models with dependent parameters another assumption in this study is that the parameters all have a uniform distribution defined by its range whereas in reality the distribution varies depending on the catchment morphology in future research the use of other methods such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue for finding more accurate parameter distributions can be further investigated yang et al 2008 introducing glue into the pce framework will increase the required computational time however it would still be worth investigating as glue have the potential to address the issue of parameter dependency as well 7 conclusions in this study a new pce ann approach for quantifying parameter uncertainty and generating probabilistic flow forecasts was developed the proposed method can quantitatively describe the propagation of parameter uncertainty in a modeling system and was applied to the hydrological modeling of the guadalupe basin in texas us previously pce has only been used to build surrogates for simple lumped hydrological models such as hymod in this study pce was used for a more complex semi distributed model swat for the first time the traditional pce framework requires observed flow as input to assess the propagation of parameter uncertainty and thus could not be used to analyze the uncertainties in future time series by innovatively integrating data driven techniques into the traditional pce framework the proposed pce ann approach enables the pce to generate probabilistic flow forecasts the probabilistic forecasting results of pce ann were compared to those of mc simulation the results demonstrated that pce ann is able to provide probabilities forecasts close to mc s with much less computation time pce ann s advantage in terms of computational efficiency is expected to be more significantly beneficial as the model complexity increases in the future the pce ann should be tested for other complex hydrological models as well as for more watersheds of different sizes and types other advanced data driven techniques can be further investigated to improve the prediction of pce coefficients also one of pce s fundamental assumption is that the uncertain parameters are independent further research is needed to address the common parameter dependency issue in hydrological modeling credit authorship contribution statement maysara ghaith methodology software writing original draft zhong li conceptualization

5471,seawater intrusion si is an increased threat to the groundwater resource in coastal regions the cut off wall is widely used to arrest the advance of a seawater wedge but it is likely to cause groundwater contamination in landward aquifers in order to alleviate the contamination problem we proposed a new variable permeability cut off wall vpfw with a semi permeable section at the bottom of the physical barrier this study is the first to investigate the spatial distributions and transient behaviors of si and nitrate pollution at field scale under the joint effects of physical barriers and denitrification results show the dissolved oxygen do decreases almost synchronously with the intrusion of sw near the sea boundary and the denitrification of no3 and retreat of the dissolved organic carbon doc wedge occurred in the inland aquifer notably the freshwater discharge flux and nitrate discharge flux for the developed vpfw increase by 35 and 20 respectively while the enrichment ratio of specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr went down by 15 on average compared with the traditional cut off wall four indices were proposed to quantify the impervious barrier heights h relative hydraulic conductivities k and control effectiveness of si and nitrate pollution moreover we found the control effectiveness for si and nitrate pollution was continually enhanced with the reduction of k and increase of h however excessive reduction and increase may result in the oppositeimpacts the optimal k and h for the vpfw can be determined with the required value of the reduction rate of saltwater wedge length swr and svnr but all cut off wall cases fail to meet the demand the results show that the vpfw is much more effective in controlling si and nitrate pollution in comparison with the traditional cut off wall keywords variable permeability physical barrier seawater intrusion nitrate contamination unconfined aquifer 1 introduction due to the continuous rise in

threat to the groundwater quality in coastal regions walther et al 2017 werner et al 2013 werner and simmons 2009 it is critical to develop efficient approaches to control si and also satisfy the water supply for human activities abarca et al 2013 lu et al 2015 existing engineering approaches for si control include physical barriers artificial recharge by injection or infiltration saltwater

movement of the saltwater wedge sw abdoulhalik et al 2017 luyun et al 2009 in much of china and japan the construction of a traditional water supply system is limited by the geological conditions luyun et al 2009 thus in addition to hydraulic barriers subsurface physical barriers which have low operating costs and a stable si controlling effect are commonly used in japan china the usa and african countries since the 1990s eight physical barriers have been successfully constructed for the prevention of si in yantai weihai and qingdao china ishida et al 2003 jamali et al 2013 subsurface physical barriers can be generally divided into two types according to their structure subsurface dams and cut off walls abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a the structures of the different barriers are presented in fig 1 a subsurface dam is an impermeable wall constructed at the bottom of the aquifer leaving an opening at the upper aquifer for upstream fresh groundwater discharge fig 1a in contrast

physical barriers on si prevention allow 2012 botero acosta and donado 2015 kaleris and ziogas 2013 takahashi et al 2012 the effectiveness of a subsurface dam has been demonstrated to be highly

wall height seawater will continue to intrude until it reaches a natural intruding length chang et al 2019 moreover the presence of a low permeable layer in the aquifer will weaken the effectiveness of the subsurface dam abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b additionally an impermeablewall at the bottom of the aquifer may limit fresh groundwater discharge to the ocean and result in residual saltwater becoming trapped upstream of the subsurface dam luyun et al 2009 investigated the time required to flush residual saltwater behind the subsurface dam and found the recovery time is much longer than the intrusion time in addition a subsurface dam is not suitable for areas where drastic changes in groundwater level and continuous gld occur the presence of low permeable layers also weaken the effectiveness of a subsurface dam abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b in some regions where the phreatic aquifer is very thin an inverted wedge of saltwater may form li et al 2007 in this case a subsurface dam will not work in contrast a cut off wall is an effective method to solve the problem of residual salty water in many cases because its structure creates a high flow rate at the opening to flush out the saltwater several studies have investigated the effectiveness of the cut off wall under various hydrogeological conditions anwar 1983 developed an analytical solution based on the sharp interface assumption his results indicated that a cut off wall significantly depressed the saltwater wedge and performance was dependent on the wall s height utilizing numerical simulations kaleris and ziogas 2013 investigated the effectiveness of cut off walls in si prevention under groundwater extraction conditions the results implied that the effect of a cut off wall was stronger when the extraction position was closer to the ocean boundary with relatively slow average flow velocity they also assessed the protective effect of a cut off wall on groundwater exploitation and found that wells performed better than horizontal drains at extracting groundwater nitrate pollution in groundwater is a critical environmental and hydrological issue attracting worldwide attention cui et al 2014 jang et al 2017 in coastal regions there is extensive agricultural activity and animal farming which may lead to nitrate pollution of groundwater in unconfined aquifers rajmohan et al 2009 studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers have been carried out with laboratory experiments jang et al 2017 li et al 2018 2017 and numerical simulations shammas and thunvik 2009 sun et al 2019 these studies illustrate that variable density flow sea level rise aquifer heterogeneity and stratigraphy may affect the contaminant transport process however research of nitrate migration in coastal aquifers utilizing a subsurface cut off wall is insufficient yoshimoto et al 2013 found the average concentration of no3 n in groundwater was below 10 mg l before the construction of a cut off wall the concentration noticeably increased after cut off wall construction kang and xu 2017 monitored the nitrate concentration of an aquifer both upstream and downstream of a cut off wall and found the average nitrate concentration upstream was 9 92 mg l which was much higher than the 0 76 mg l concentration measured downstream sun et al 2019 investigated the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in the presence of a cut off wall and the effects of a subsurface dam on the prevention of si and nitrate contamination they conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the influence of subsurface dams on nitrate distribution and identified that wall height was a key factor in determining the area of the nitrate pollution zone however their results are restricted to the laboratory scale and the effects of denitrification are ignored which would lead to an overestimation of nitrate contamination at the field scale overall a cut off wall is a stable and effective method to control si and the problem of residual saltwater the drawback is that the wall needs to be constructed deep which may severely affect the discharge of the groundwater and eventually lead to nitrate contamination in the landward aquifer to achieve a better trade off between si control and nitrate contamination we developed a new variable permeability cut off wall vpfw with a shorter upper impervious section and a taller semi permeable part of the barrier to reduce the accumulation of nitrates in the landward aquifer the objective of this research is to 1 clarify the steady distribution and transient behavior of si and nitrate pollution under the effects of a physical barrier and denitrification 2 quantify the impervious barrier heights h relative to hydraulic conductivities k and control the effectiveness of the vpfw on si and nitrate pollution and 3 optimize the vpfw structure based on its principal structural parameters 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model we considered the processes of si and nitrate migration as well as transformation in an unconfined isotropic homogeneous aquifer with a variable permeability full section wall vpfw the study made the following assumptions 1 the fluid density depends on the salt mass concentration 2 the denitrification reaction obeys first order reaction kinetics 3 oxygen is depleted initially in the phreatic aquifer 4 the upper part of the vpfw is impervious fig 2 depicts the model geometry and boundary conditions l and b represent the length and the thickness of the aquifer respectively the left boundary is the seawater boundary denoted by γs the right boundary is the freshwater boundary denoted by γf the vpfw is 50 m away from γs with a thickness of 1 m the elements for the impervious upper part h of the vpfw are not active while the semi permeable part of the vpfw at the bottom of aquifer has a hydraulic permeability k the nitrate infiltration zone is 30 m away from γf to simulate the seawater intrusion process with no3 transport and reactions we considered salt nitrate dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved oxygen do in the model the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k 0 was set to be 30 m d the porosity ϕ was 0 3 at γs the water table of seawater was set to 50 m dirichlet type mass boundaries were imposed with a constant do concentration of 6 4 mg l a doc concentration of 9 0 mg l and a salt concentration of 35000 mg l at γf the water level was set to 51 5 m with a fixed doc concentration of 10 mg l at the top boundary a constant infiltration rate of 1 mm d was assigned with a constant nitrate concentration of 100 mg l table 1 the bottom boundary was impervious the denitrification process is presented in table 2 along with the nitrate migration kim et al 2017 2 2 numerical modelling feflow 7 0 software was used to simulate the variable density groundwater transport and reaction processes the corresponding governing equations were cited from diersch 2014 the 2d simulation domain was discretized into 21 000 triangular elements and the peclect number was controlled to be less than 1 25 for each element for the areas of the vpfw and saltwater wedge the meshes should be refined by a factor of 5 with respect to the above element size a one step newton iteration with predictor corrector was used to solve the nonlinear matrix the initial time step length was set to 0 001d and the total simulation time was 5000d with a limiting maximum time step of 1 2d the maximum tolerance error was 2 10 3 and a full upwinding technique was used the hydraulic head at γf was set to be 55 5 m in the warm up period while the other parameters remained unchanged the initial doc concentration in the domain was 10 mg l while the concentration of other species was set to 0 mg l the other parameters and boundary conditions used are listed in table 2 when the warm up process reached steady state the calculated results were used as the initial conditions for the subsequent dynamic simulations the hydraulic head at γf was then changed to 51 5 m and a physical barrier was built within the aquifer in the simulations cut off wall cases c h and vpfw cases v k h were considered to compare the effects of the height of the upper impermeable wall h and the relative hydraulic conductivity of the semi permeable part to the aquifer k in cut off wall cases the impermeable wall heights were set to be 0 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 m in vpfw cases the relative hydraulic conductivities k are set to be 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 to 1 64 and the wall heights are 0 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 m respectively c 0 stands for a reference case without a wall in the aquifer while v k 0 show semi permeable walls with k fully penetrating the aquifer 2 3 evaluation indicators the effects of the vpfw and cut off walls on si are normally assessed with two indicators reduction rate of seawater wedge swr and reduction rate of total salt mass tsmr in the landward aquifer with walls these indicators were used by werner et al 2010 to evaluate the degree of si the lengths of the seawater wedge swl are determined by the tip location with a 10 salinity contour line luyun et al 2009 swr is defined as 1 swr swl 0 s w l swl 0 where swl is the measured seawater wedge lengths with a wall and swl 0 is the seawater wedge lengths in a stable state without a wall tsmr is expressed in a dimensionless form as 2 tsmr tsm 0 t s m tsm 0 where tsm is the total salt mass in the landward fresh aquifer with a wall and tsm 0 is the total salt mass in a stable state without a wall the enrichment ratio of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and enrichment ratio of total nitrate mass in the landward aquifer tnmr are applied to evaluate the effects of subsurface barriers on nitrate contamination svnr can be written as 3 svnr svn svn 0 svn 0 where svn is the specific volumes of nitrate contamination zone with a wall and svn 0 is the specific volumes of nitrate contamination zone in a stable state without a wall tnmr is formulated as 4 tnmr tnm t nm 0 tnm 0 where tnm is the total nitrate mass with a wall and tnm 0 is the total nitrate mass in the landward aquifer in a stable state without a wall for a qualified physical barrier we hope to achieve a higher reduction rate of seawater wedge swr a reduction in the rate of the total salt mass tsmr a lower enrichment ratio of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and a lower enrichment ratio of total nitrate mass in the landward aquifer tnmr 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of h and k on steady distributions of si and nitrate pollution in this section steady state distributions of saltwater and nitrate at different wall heights h and relative hydraulic conductivities k in the cut off wall and vpfw cases are represented in fig 6 the cut off wall cases c h are presented in the left column to compare its steady state distribution characteristics of salt and nitrate with the vpfw cases at impervious wall heights of 0 15 25 35 45 m the seawater wedge lengths swl significantly decrease with the increase of wall heights which means that taller wall heights can effectively restrain the advance of si to the landward aquifer at the same time fresh groundwater carrying no3 migrates above the saltwater wedge under the effects of hydraulic gradient and buoyancy and converges to discharge into the ocean at the upper seawater boundary after the construction of cut off walls fresh water with no3 moves down through the openings under the impervious walls and the areas of no3 pollution zones increase gradually with the increase of h until they achieve stability at 5000d the vpfw cases are presented in the middle column of fig 6 with impervious wall heights of 0 15 25 35 45 m and a relative hydraulic conductivity k of 1 4 similarly we see that the values of swl decrease with the increase of wall height but the reduction degrees are all smaller than those in the cut off wall cases the reason for this is that the saltwater wedge is restrained by the same size semi permeable layers with k 1 4 in this situation no3 contamination zones are also above the saltwater wedge in the aquifer and they increase slightly under the barriers the vpfw cases are presented in the right column of fig 6 with impervious wall heights of 0 15 25 35 and 45 m and a relative hydraulic conductivity k of 1 16 the values of swl further reduce with the increase of wall heights indicating less saltwater flows through the semi permeable layers this is because the wall with a lower hydraulic conductivity strongly blocks the seawater intrusion in these cases the areas of no3 contamination zones are more or less the same as those in the middle column due to the long equilibrium period of 5000d 3 2 dynamic behaviors of si and no3 pollution for specified walls 3 2 1 changes of salt and no3 over time in this section the transient salinities and nitrate concentrations between a traditional cut off wall case and a typical vpfw case with time are presented in fig 3 since c 45 a n d v 1 16 25 have a similar seawater wedge length the specified cases are chosen to compare and analyze the transient behaviors of si and no3 pollution initially seawater gradually intrudes into the fresh aquifer and forms growing saltwater wedges at the bottom of the aquifer near the sea boundary see fig 3 a the toe of the saltwater wedge reaches the impermeable barrier at 120d and only just exceeds the barrier at 5000d after the construction of c 45 fresh groundwater with no3 shifts down through the opening of the cut off wall and the areas of the no3 pollution zone increase gradually until they achieve stability at 5000d at the same time seawater begins to intrude into the freshwater aquifer and low concentration saltwater slightly diffuses through the opening of the cut off wall this is because saltwater can be flushed out of the opening seaward by fresh groundwater flow with a relatively high velocity since the semi permeable section for v 1 16 25 is much taller than that in the case of c 45 freshwater with no3 moves down around shorter impervious walls see fig 3 b therefore there are slightly longer saltwater plumes through the semi permeable section of the vpfw at 120 360 and 5000d however the areas of no3 pollution plume are approximate 20 30 smaller than that in the c 45 case which implies that the changes of relative hydraulic conductivity are very important to the distributions of no3 pollution meanwhile seawater intruded into the freshwater aquifer slowly and it exceeded the semi permeable opening by 20 25 m more than that in the cut off wall case at 5000d 3 2 2 changes of doc and do over time fig 4 displays the transient changes of doc and do over time in the specified vpfw cases in fig 4 a the advance of do is almost synchronous with the movement of sw because do is also from seawater the do concentration gradually decreased as it approaches the barrier the do contour of 0 5 mg l reaches the opening under the cut off wall at about 120d denitrification has been inhibited due to the existence of do on the left side of the barrier at the landward side infiltrated nitrate bearing water mixes with upstream fresh groundwater carrying doc resulting in the degradation of some no3 and the retreat of the doc wedge towards γf due to denitrification in this case most of the doc has been degraded and the doc left is distributed in the lower left corner the length of the doc wedge retreats inland over time this explains why the doc is lacking near the barrier in most of the aquifer fig 4 b shows that the changes in doc over time in the case of v 1 16 25 are similar to those in the cut off wall case the do concentrations near the opening of the vpfw at 120d 360d and 5000d are a little higher than those in the cut off wall case because more freshwater with no3 flows through the upper part of the opening in the vpfw case in a relative anaerobicenvironment 3 2 3 transient effects for controlling si and no3 pollution fig 5 a displays the changes of freshwater discharge flux at γs over time at the beginning t 0d the freshwater discharge fluxes are maximum in both cases because there are no walls in the aquifers as soon as walls are constructed fresh groundwater begins to move down around the impervious part of the wall which results in a rapid reduction of freshwater discharge flux in the initial half year and then decreased slowly until the flow reaches a steady state since there is a bigger opening for v 1 16 25 the freshwater discharge flux is 35 more than that in the cut off case from 180d to 5000d which shows that v 1 16 25 has a relatively small blocking effect on groundwater flow the changes of nitrate discharge flux ndf over time for both cases are presented in fig 5 b at the beginning t 0d since no wall restrains the freshwater flow carrying no3 the nitrate plumes stay in the upper areas of the aquifer and the nitrate discharge fluxes are maximum after the construction of both walls fresh groundwater with no3 has to flow down around the impervious barrier and through a semi permeable layer in the case of v 1 16 25 moreover it must move down even deeper to get around a higher impervious barrier to the sea boundary in the cut off wall case therefore the nitrate discharge fluxes decreased greatly from 0d to 300d for both cases after 300d the nitrate discharge fluxes tended to increase continuously in the remaining time period and the salty water wedge returns seaward through the larger opening under the impervious barrier the average value of nfd for v 1 16 25 is about 20 more than that in the case of c 45 despite comparable effectiveness in si prevention fig 5 c describes the changes in the reduction rate of seawater wedge swr over time in both cases the values of swr decreases in the initial half year for both cases as fresh groundwater flows down around the impervious wall and carries the seawater wedge seaward and then gradually approaches a steady state the final swl is 54 2 m in the v 1 16 25 case which is 5 longer than that in the cut off wall case fig 5 d displays changes of the specific volume of nitrate increasing rate svnr over time in the aquifer for both cases svnr continuously increased to 41 at 5000d in the cut off wall case while it only reached 26 for v 1 16 25 in the same period in other words although swr decreases by 2 svnr goes down by 15 on average compared with the traditional cut off wall which shows v 1 16 25 can greatly lessen the nitrate enrichment in the aquifer 3 3 control effectiveness of vpfw on si and nitrate pollution 3 3 1 performance of vpfw fig 7 a displays the changes of the reduction rate of the saltwater wedge swr with relative hydraulic conductivities k at different barrier heights h when the wall height was 15 m the values of swr first increased quickly with the decrease of k and then tended to slowly rise to about 63 the values of swr also increased by a declining degree at wall heights of 20 25 30 and 35 m with the decrease of k but then they almost converged to the same value as h 15 m this is due to the blocking effects on si generated by the lower k of the semi permeable part of the barrier when the wall height reached 40 m all values of swr were almost same these results indicate that an excessive increase of h and reduction of k make no sense for si prevention fig 7 b presents the changes of the reduction rate of total salt mass tsmr with relative hydraulic conductivities k at different barrier heights h generally fig 7 b is similar to fig 7 a in appearance when the wall heights are 15 20 25 30 and 35 m the values of swr first increased with the decrease of k by a declining degree then decreased slowly until they finally converge at about 90 this shows that an increase of k restrains the advance of the seawater wedge and some salty water is even trapped in the upstream aquifer when the wall height was 40 m all the values of tsmr decreased slowly until they converge at about 90 these results show that an excessive increase of h and reduction of k are useless for si control in vpfw cases the relationship between enrichment ratios of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and relative hydraulic conductivities k at different wall heights h for the vpfw are presented in fig 7 c the values of svnr increased by almost 20 23 parallel to the decrease of k from 1 to 1 64 at wall heights of 15 20 25 30 and 35 m the reason for the expansion of nitrate contamination plumes is due to the reduction of k and increase of h which results in the decrease of fresh groundwater and nitrate fluxes through the semi permeable layers and the increase of nitrate contaminated areas in the upstream aquifer furthermore when h is 40 m the values of svnr increased by about 28 with the decrease of k implying that higher wall heights have a stronger effect on the enrichment of nitrate contaminant in the landward aquifer the relationship between enrichment ratios of total nitrate mass tnmr and relative hydraulic conductivities k at different wall heights h are presented in fig 7 d fig 7 d is similar to fig 7 c in appearance similarly the values of tnmr increased by almost 8 11 parallel to the decrease of k from 1 to 1 64 at wall heights of 15 20 25 30 and 35 m the reason for this is that the reduction of k and increase of h can lead to a drop in fresh groundwater and nitrate fluxes through the semi permeable layers as well as the enrichment of total nitrate mass in the upstream aquifer overall according to the above analysis it was found that the reduction of k rather than only increasing the wall heights produces better control of seawater intrusion there are many alternatives with different wall heights and relative hydraulic conductivities for controlling seawater intrusion however excessive reduction of k will inversely increase the salinity in the aquifer moreover the nitrate in groundwater is continually enriched with the increase of h and the decrease of k when the wall height is higher than 35 m it is easier to cause nitrate enrichment in the landward aquifer 3 3 2 optimization of vpfw as stated above the successful performance of physical barriers depends on the effective control of si and groundwater contamination in upstream aquifers therefore we hoped that the reduction rate of saltwater wedge swr is higher and the enrichment ratio of specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr is lower in the vpfw however they are a couple of conflicts swr is inversely proportional to svnr in practice therefore we must further optimize the structure of the vpfw and evaluate the trade off between si and upstream groundwater pollution after extensive simulations the steady state distributions of reduction rates of water wedge length swr at different heights of the impermeable part of the barrier h and relative hydraulic conductivities k are presented in fig 8 a with the increase of h and the reduction of k seawater intrusion became weaker and the values of swr went up from 0 to 70 symmetrically the enrichment ratios of relative specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr at different heights h and relative hydraulic conductivities k are presented in fig 8 b similarly nitrate in the aquifer was gradually enriched and the values of svnr also increased from 0 to 70 with the increase of h and the reduction of k however the growing processes are asymmetrical and h has a stronger effect on the nitrate enrichment than k because of the asymmetry between swr and svnr it is possible for us to find the best combinations of h and k generally an excellent physical barrier has a reduction rate of water wedge length swr of more than 60 abdoulhalik et al 2017 when fig 8 a is compared with fig 8 b we find an optimized area surrounded by a 60 swr contour line and a 30 svnr contour line in which swr is more than 60 and svnr is less than 30 fig 8 c based on the simulated results all the cut off wall cases were out of the optimized shaded area which means a traditional cut off wall is not able to satisfy the optimal standard the results show that the developed vpfw is superior to the traditional cut off wall for the control of si and nitrate contamination this example can be extended to various conditions and requirements such that decision makers may select the most relevant criterion e g reduction of saline intrusion thus swr 75 and acquire an individual outline for their optimized area and in turn adjust h and k to meet the needs of practical engineering 4 summary and conclusion in this study we proposed a new variable permeability full section wall vpfw then investigated the dynamic mechanism and control effectiveness of si and nitrate pollution under the effects of the physical barriers and denitrification and lastly optimize the major structural parameters our main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the advancement of dissolved oxygen do is almost synchronous with the movement of saltwater near the sea boundary and the do gradually decreases as saltwater approached the barrier at the landward side infiltrated nitrate bearing water mixes with upstream fresh groundwater carrying dissolve organic carbon doc resulting in the degradation of some no3 and the continuous retreat of the doc wedge towards the fresh water boundary 2 based on the comparison of two typical barriers the freshwater discharge flux and nitrate discharge flux for v 1 16 25 increased by 35 and 20 respectively and the area of the nitrate plume zone decreases by 15 on average while the swr only went down by 2 compared to the traditional cut off wall 3 it was found that a reduction of k rather than only increasing the wall heights produces better control of seawater intrusion although excessive reduction of k will inversely increase the salinity in the aquifer moreover the nitrate in the groundwater is constantly enriched with the increase of h and the decrease of k however when the wall height is taller than 35 m it may cause serious nitrate enrichment in the landward aquifer 4 according to the evaluation of trade offs between si and the nitrate enrichment optimization of the vpfw structure swr and svnr went up from 0 to 70 asymmetrically the optimal k and h for the vpfw can be determined with over 60 swr and less than 30 svnr but all the cut off wall cases fail to meet the requirement the results show that the vpfw is much more effective in controlling si and nitrate pollution in comparison with the cut off wall while we were able to show the general feasibility of this new barrier concept we think that future work should try to investigate additional aspects of design e g location of the barrier and influences of hydrogeological conditions and hydraulic variations e g pumping activity credit authorship

5471,seawater intrusion si is an increased threat to the groundwater resource in coastal regions the cut off wall is widely used to arrest the advance of a seawater wedge but it is likely to cause groundwater contamination in landward aquifers in order to alleviate the contamination problem we proposed a new variable permeability cut off wall vpfw with a semi permeable section at the bottom of the physical barrier this study is the first to investigate the spatial distributions and transient behaviors of si and nitrate pollution at field scale under the joint effects of physical barriers and denitrification results show the dissolved oxygen do decreases almost synchronously with the intrusion of sw near the sea boundary and the denitrification of no3 and retreat of the dissolved organic carbon doc wedge occurred in the inland aquifer notably the freshwater discharge flux and nitrate discharge flux for the developed vpfw increase by 35 and 20 respectively while the enrichment ratio of specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr went down by 15 on average compared with the traditional cut off wall four indices were proposed to quantify the impervious barrier heights h relative hydraulic conductivities k and control effectiveness of si and nitrate pollution moreover we found the control effectiveness for si and nitrate pollution was continually enhanced with the reduction of k and increase of h however excessive reduction and increase may result in the oppositeimpacts the optimal k and h for the vpfw can be determined with the required value of the reduction rate of saltwater wedge length swr and svnr but all cut off wall cases fail to meet the demand the results show that the vpfw is much more effective in controlling si and nitrate pollution in comparison with the traditional cut off wall keywords variable permeability physical barrier seawater intrusion nitrate contamination unconfined aquifer 1 introduction due to the continuous rise in sea level resulting from climate change rozell and wong 2010 and groundwater level drop gld caused by over exploitation of coastal aquifers seawater intrusion si has become an increasingly serious threat to the groundwater quality in coastal regions walther et al 2017 werner et al 2013 werner and simmons 2009 it is critical to develop efficient approaches to control si and also satisfy the water supply for human activities abarca et al 2013 lu et al 2015 existing engineering approaches for si control include physical barriers artificial recharge by injection or infiltration saltwater extraction and so on abarca et al 2006 allow 2012 lu et al 2017 luyun et al 2011 2009 the injection and saltwater extraction approaches aim to create a hydraulic barrier to obstruct the inland movement of the saltwater wedge sw abdoulhalik et al 2017 luyun et al 2009 in much of china and japan the construction of a traditional water supply system is limited by the geological conditions luyun et al 2009 thus in addition to hydraulic barriers subsurface physical barriers which have low operating costs and a stable si controlling effect are commonly used in japan china the usa and african countries since the 1990s eight physical barriers have been successfully constructed for the prevention of si in yantai weihai and qingdao china ishida et al 2003 jamali et al 2013 subsurface physical barriers can be generally divided into two types according to their structure subsurface dams and cut off walls abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a the structures of the different barriers are presented in fig 1 a subsurface dam is an impermeable wall constructed at the bottom of the aquifer leaving an opening at the upper aquifer for upstream fresh groundwater discharge fig 1a in contrast a cut off wall is an impermeablebarrier constructed at the upper aquifer which leaves an opening at the bottom of the aquifer fig 1b studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of physical barriers on si prevention allow 2012 botero acosta and donado 2015 kaleris and ziogas 2013 takahashi et al 2012 the effectiveness of a subsurface dam has been demonstrated to be highly related to the wall height and the distance from construction site to coast taller barriers usually achieve better si prevention luyun et al 2009 if the seawater table near the wall is higher than the wall height seawater will continue to intrude until it reaches a natural intruding length chang et al 2019 moreover the presence of a low permeable layer in the aquifer will weaken the effectiveness of the subsurface dam abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b additionally an impermeablewall at the bottom of the aquifer may limit fresh groundwater discharge to the ocean and result in residual saltwater becoming trapped upstream of the subsurface dam luyun et al 2009 investigated the time required to flush residual saltwater behind the subsurface dam and found the recovery time is much longer than the intrusion time in addition a subsurface dam is not suitable for areas where drastic changes in groundwater level and continuous gld occur the presence of low permeable layers also weaken the effectiveness of a subsurface dam abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b in some regions where the phreatic aquifer is very thin an inverted wedge of saltwater may form li et al 2007 in this case a subsurface dam will not work in contrast a cut off wall is an effective method to solve the problem of residual salty water in many cases because its structure creates a high flow rate at the opening to flush out the saltwater several studies have investigated the effectiveness of the cut off wall under various hydrogeological conditions anwar 1983 developed an analytical solution based on the sharp interface assumption his results indicated that a cut off wall significantly depressed the saltwater wedge and performance was dependent on the wall s height utilizing numerical simulations kaleris and ziogas 2013 investigated the effectiveness of cut off walls in si prevention under groundwater extraction conditions the results implied that the effect of a cut off wall was stronger when the extraction position was closer to the ocean boundary with relatively slow average flow velocity they also assessed the protective effect of a cut off wall on groundwater exploitation and found that wells performed better than horizontal drains at extracting groundwater nitrate pollution in groundwater is a critical environmental and hydrological issue attracting worldwide attention cui et al 2014 jang et al 2017 in coastal regions there is extensive agricultural activity and animal farming which may lead to nitrate pollution of groundwater in unconfined aquifers rajmohan et al 2009 studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers have been carried out with laboratory experiments jang et al 2017 li et al 2018 2017 and numerical simulations shammas and thunvik 2009 sun et al 2019 these studies illustrate that variable density flow sea level rise aquifer heterogeneity and stratigraphy may affect the contaminant transport process however research of nitrate migration in coastal aquifers utilizing a subsurface cut off wall is insufficient yoshimoto et al 2013 found the average concentration of no3 n in groundwater was below 10 mg l before the construction of a cut off wall the concentration noticeably increased after cut off wall construction kang and xu 2017 monitored the nitrate concentration of an aquifer both upstream and downstream of a cut off wall and found the average nitrate concentration upstream was 9 92 mg l which was much higher than the 0 76 mg l concentration measured downstream sun et al 2019 investigated the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in the presence of a cut off wall and the effects of a subsurface dam on the prevention of si and nitrate contamination they conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the influence of subsurface dams on nitrate distribution and identified that wall height was a key factor in determining the area of the nitrate pollution zone however their results are restricted to the laboratory scale and the effects of denitrification are ignored which would lead to an overestimation of nitrate contamination at the field scale overall a cut off wall is a stable and effective method to control si and the problem of residual saltwater the drawback is that the wall needs to be constructed deep which may severely affect the discharge of the groundwater and eventually lead to nitrate contamination in the landward aquifer to achieve a better trade off between si control and nitrate contamination we developed a new variable permeability cut off wall vpfw with a shorter upper impervious section and a taller semi permeable part of the barrier to reduce the accumulation of nitrates in the landward aquifer the objective of this research is to 1 clarify the steady distribution and transient behavior of si and nitrate pollution under the effects of a physical barrier and denitrification 2 quantify the impervious barrier heights h relative to hydraulic conductivities k and control the effectiveness of the vpfw on si and nitrate pollution and 3 optimize the vpfw structure based on its principal structural parameters 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model we considered the processes of si and nitrate migration as well as transformation in an unconfined isotropic homogeneous aquifer with a variable permeability full section wall vpfw the study made the following assumptions 1 the fluid density depends on the salt mass concentration 2 the denitrification reaction obeys first order reaction kinetics 3 oxygen is depleted initially in the phreatic aquifer 4 the upper part of the vpfw is impervious fig 2 depicts the model geometry and boundary conditions l and b represent the length and the thickness of the aquifer respectively the left boundary is the seawater boundary denoted by γs the right boundary is the freshwater boundary denoted by γf the vpfw is 50 m away from γs with a thickness of 1 m the elements for the impervious upper part h of the vpfw are not active while the semi permeable part of the vpfw at the bottom of aquifer has a hydraulic permeability k the nitrate infiltration zone is 30 m away from γf to simulate the seawater intrusion process with no3 transport and reactions we considered salt nitrate dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved oxygen do in the model the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k 0 was set to be 30 m d the porosity ϕ was 0 3 at γs the water table of seawater was set to 50 m dirichlet type mass boundaries were imposed with a constant do concentration of 6 4 mg l a doc concentration of 9 0 mg l and a salt concentration of 35000 mg l at γf the water level was set to 51 5 m with a fixed doc concentration of 10 mg l at the top boundary a constant infiltration rate of 1 mm d was assigned with a constant nitrate concentration of 100 mg l table 1 the bottom boundary was impervious the denitrification process is presented in table 2 along with the nitrate migration kim et al 2017 2 2 numerical modelling feflow 7 0 software was used to simulate the variable density groundwater transport and reaction processes the corresponding governing equations were cited from diersch 2014 the 2d simulation domain was discretized into 21 000 triangular elements and the peclect number was controlled to be less than 1 25 for each element for the areas of the vpfw and saltwater wedge the meshes should be refined by a factor of 5 with respect to the above element size a one step newton iteration with predictor corrector was used to solve the nonlinear matrix the initial time step length was set to 0 001d and the total simulation time was 5000d with a limiting maximum time step of 1 2d the maximum tolerance error was 2 10 3 and a full upwinding technique was used the hydraulic head at γf was set to be 55 5 m in the warm up period while the other parameters remained unchanged the initial doc concentration in the domain was 10 mg l while the concentration of other species was set to 0 mg l the other parameters and boundary conditions used are listed in table 2 when the warm up process reached steady state the calculated results were used as the initial conditions for the subsequent dynamic simulations the hydraulic head at γf was then changed to 51 5 m and a physical barrier was built within the aquifer in the simulations cut off wall cases c h and vpfw cases v k h were considered to compare the effects of the height of the upper impermeable wall h and the relative hydraulic conductivity of the semi permeable part to the aquifer k in cut off wall cases the impermeable wall heights were set to be 0 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 m in vpfw cases the relative hydraulic conductivities k are set to be 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 to 1 64 and the wall heights are 0 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 m respectively c 0 stands for a reference case without a wall in the aquifer while v k 0 show semi permeable walls with k fully penetrating the aquifer 2 3 evaluation indicators the effects of the vpfw and cut off walls on si are normally assessed with two indicators reduction rate of seawater wedge swr and reduction rate of total salt mass tsmr in the landward aquifer with walls these indicators were used by werner et al 2010 to evaluate the degree of si the lengths of the seawater wedge swl are determined by the tip location with a 10 salinity contour line luyun et al 2009 swr is defined as 1 swr swl 0 s w l swl 0 where swl is the measured seawater wedge lengths with a wall and swl 0 is the seawater wedge lengths in a stable state without a wall tsmr is expressed in a dimensionless form as 2 tsmr tsm 0 t s m tsm 0 where tsm is the total salt mass in the landward fresh aquifer with a wall and tsm 0 is the total salt mass in a stable state without a wall the enrichment ratio of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and enrichment ratio of total nitrate mass in the landward aquifer tnmr are applied to evaluate the effects of subsurface barriers on nitrate contamination svnr can be written as 3 svnr svn svn 0 svn 0 where svn is the specific volumes of nitrate contamination zone with a wall and svn 0 is the specific volumes of nitrate contamination zone in a stable state without a wall tnmr is formulated as 4 tnmr tnm t nm 0 tnm 0 where tnm is the total nitrate mass with a wall and tnm 0 is the total nitrate mass in the landward aquifer in a stable state without a wall for a qualified physical barrier we hope to achieve a higher reduction rate of seawater wedge swr a reduction in the rate of the total salt mass tsmr a lower enrichment ratio of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and a lower enrichment ratio of total nitrate mass in the landward aquifer tnmr 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of h and k on steady distributions of si and nitrate pollution in this section steady state distributions of saltwater and nitrate at different wall heights h and relative hydraulic conductivities k in the cut off wall and vpfw cases are represented in fig 6 the cut off wall cases c h are presented in the left column to compare its steady state distribution characteristics of salt and nitrate with the vpfw cases at impervious wall heights of 0 15 25 35 45 m the seawater wedge lengths swl significantly decrease with the increase of wall heights which means that taller wall heights can effectively restrain the advance of si to the landward aquifer at the same time fresh groundwater carrying no3 migrates above the saltwater wedge under the effects of hydraulic gradient and buoyancy and converges to discharge into the ocean at the upper seawater boundary after the construction of cut off walls fresh water with no3 moves down through the openings under the impervious walls and the areas of no3 pollution zones increase gradually with the increase of h until they achieve stability at 5000d the vpfw cases are presented in the middle column of fig 6 with impervious wall heights of 0 15 25 35 45 m and a relative hydraulic conductivity k of 1 4 similarly we see that the values of swl decrease with the increase of wall height but the reduction degrees are all smaller than those in the cut off wall cases the reason for this is that the saltwater wedge is restrained by the same size semi permeable layers with k 1 4 in this situation no3 contamination zones are also above the saltwater wedge in the aquifer and they increase slightly under the barriers the vpfw cases are presented in the right column of fig 6 with impervious wall heights of 0 15 25 35 and 45 m and a relative hydraulic conductivity k of 1 16 the values of swl further reduce with the increase of wall heights indicating less saltwater flows through the semi permeable layers this is because the wall with a lower hydraulic conductivity strongly blocks the seawater intrusion in these cases the areas of no3 contamination zones are more or less the same as those in the middle column due to the long equilibrium period of 5000d 3 2 dynamic behaviors of si and no3 pollution for specified walls 3 2 1 changes of salt and no3 over time in this section the transient salinities and nitrate concentrations between a traditional cut off wall case and a typical vpfw case with time are presented in fig 3 since c 45 a n d v 1 16 25 have a similar seawater wedge length the specified cases are chosen to compare and analyze the transient behaviors of si and no3 pollution initially seawater gradually intrudes into the fresh aquifer and forms growing saltwater wedges at the bottom of the aquifer near the sea boundary see fig 3 a the toe of the saltwater wedge reaches the impermeable barrier at 120d and only just exceeds the barrier at 5000d after the construction of c 45 fresh groundwater with no3 shifts down through the opening of the cut off wall and the areas of the no3 pollution zone increase gradually until they achieve stability at 5000d at the same time seawater begins to intrude into the freshwater aquifer and low concentration saltwater slightly diffuses through the opening of the cut off wall this is because saltwater can be flushed out of the opening seaward by fresh groundwater flow with a relatively high velocity since the semi permeable section for v 1 16 25 is much taller than that in the case of c 45 freshwater with no3 moves down around shorter impervious walls see fig 3 b therefore there are slightly longer saltwater plumes through the semi permeable section of the vpfw at 120 360 and 5000d however the areas of no3 pollution plume are approximate 20 30 smaller than that in the c 45 case which implies that the changes of relative hydraulic conductivity are very important to the distributions of no3 pollution meanwhile seawater intruded into the freshwater aquifer slowly and it exceeded the semi permeable opening by 20 25 m more than that in the cut off wall case at 5000d 3 2 2 changes of doc and do over time fig 4 displays the transient changes of doc and do over time in the specified vpfw cases in fig 4 a the advance of do is almost synchronous with the movement of sw because do is also from seawater the do concentration gradually decreased as it approaches the barrier the do contour of 0 5 mg l reaches the opening under the cut off wall at about 120d denitrification has been inhibited due to the existence of do on the left side of the barrier at the landward side infiltrated nitrate bearing water mixes with upstream fresh groundwater carrying doc resulting in the degradation of some no3 and the retreat of the doc wedge towards γf due to denitrification in this case most of the doc has been degraded and the doc left is distributed in the lower left corner the length of the doc wedge retreats inland over time this explains why the doc is lacking near the barrier in most of the aquifer fig 4 b shows that the changes in doc over time in the case of v 1 16 25 are similar to those in the cut off wall case the do concentrations near the opening of the vpfw at 120d 360d and 5000d are a little higher than those in the cut off wall case because more freshwater with no3 flows through the upper part of the opening in the vpfw case in a relative anaerobicenvironment 3 2 3 transient effects for controlling si and no3 pollution fig 5 a displays the changes of freshwater discharge flux at γs over time at the beginning t 0d the freshwater discharge fluxes are maximum in both cases because there are no walls in the aquifers as soon as walls are constructed fresh groundwater begins to move down around the impervious part of the wall which results in a rapid reduction of freshwater discharge flux in the initial half year and then decreased slowly until the flow reaches a steady state since there is a bigger opening for v 1 16 25 the freshwater discharge flux is 35 more than that in the cut off case from 180d to 5000d which shows that v 1 16 25 has a relatively small blocking effect on groundwater flow the changes of nitrate discharge flux ndf over time for both cases are presented in fig 5 b at the beginning t 0d since no wall restrains the freshwater flow carrying no3 the nitrate plumes stay in the upper areas of the aquifer and the nitrate discharge fluxes are maximum after the construction of both walls fresh groundwater with no3 has to flow down around the impervious barrier and through a semi permeable layer in the case of v 1 16 25 moreover it must move down even deeper to get around a higher impervious barrier to the sea boundary in the cut off wall case therefore the nitrate discharge fluxes decreased greatly from 0d to 300d for both cases after 300d the nitrate discharge fluxes tended to increase continuously in the remaining time period and the salty water wedge returns seaward through the larger opening under the impervious barrier the average value of nfd for v 1 16 25 is about 20 more than that in the case of c 45 despite comparable effectiveness in si prevention fig 5 c describes the changes in the reduction rate of seawater wedge swr over time in both cases the values of swr decreases in the initial half year for both cases as fresh groundwater flows down around the impervious wall and carries the seawater wedge seaward and then gradually approaches a steady state the final swl is 54 2 m in the v 1 16 25 case which is 5 longer than that in the cut off wall case fig 5 d displays changes of the specific volume of nitrate increasing rate svnr over time in the aquifer for both cases svnr continuously increased to 41 at 5000d in the cut off wall case while it only reached 26 for v 1 16 25 in the same period in other words although swr decreases by 2 svnr goes down by 15 on average compared with the traditional cut off wall which shows v 1 16 25 can greatly lessen the nitrate enrichment in the aquifer 3 3 control effectiveness of vpfw on si and nitrate pollution 3 3 1 performance of vpfw fig 7 a displays the changes of the reduction rate of the saltwater wedge swr with relative hydraulic conductivities k at different barrier heights h when the wall height was 15 m the values of swr first increased quickly with the decrease of k and then tended to slowly rise to about 63 the values of swr also increased by a declining degree at wall heights of 20 25 30 and 35 m with the decrease of k but then they almost converged to the same value as h 15 m this is due to the blocking effects on si generated by the lower k of the semi permeable part of the barrier when the wall height reached 40 m all values of swr were almost same these results indicate that an excessive increase of h and reduction of k make no sense for si prevention fig 7 b presents the changes of the reduction rate of total salt mass tsmr with relative hydraulic conductivities k at different barrier heights h generally fig 7 b is similar to fig 7 a in appearance when the wall heights are 15 20 25 30 and 35 m the values of swr first increased with the decrease of k by a declining degree then decreased slowly until they finally converge at about 90 this shows that an increase of k restrains the advance of the seawater wedge and some salty water is even trapped in the upstream aquifer when the wall height was 40 m all the values of tsmr decreased slowly until they converge at about 90 these results show that an excessive increase of h and reduction of k are useless for si control in vpfw cases the relationship between enrichment ratios of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and relative hydraulic conductivities k at different wall heights h for the vpfw are presented in fig 7 c the values of svnr increased by almost 20 23 parallel to the decrease of k from 1 to 1 64 at wall heights of 15 20 25 30 and 35 m the reason for the expansion of nitrate contamination plumes is due to the reduction of k and increase of h which results in the decrease of fresh groundwater and nitrate fluxes through the semi permeable layers and the increase of nitrate contaminated areas in the upstream aquifer furthermore when h is 40 m the values of svnr increased by about 28 with the decrease of k implying that higher wall heights have a stronger effect on the enrichment of nitrate contaminant in the landward aquifer the relationship between enrichment ratios of total nitrate mass tnmr and relative hydraulic conductivities k at different wall heights h are presented in fig 7 d fig 7 d is similar to fig 7 c in appearance similarly the values of tnmr increased by almost 8 11 parallel to the decrease of k from 1 to 1 64 at wall heights of 15 20 25 30 and 35 m the reason for this is that the reduction of k and increase of h can lead to a drop in fresh groundwater and nitrate fluxes through the semi permeable layers as well as the enrichment of total nitrate mass in the upstream aquifer overall according to the above analysis it was found that the reduction of k rather than only increasing the wall heights produces better control of seawater intrusion there are many alternatives with different wall heights and relative hydraulic conductivities for controlling seawater intrusion however excessive reduction of k will inversely increase the salinity in the aquifer moreover the nitrate in groundwater is continually enriched with the increase of h and the decrease of k when the wall height is higher than 35 m it is easier to cause nitrate enrichment in the landward aquifer 3 3 2 optimization of vpfw as stated above the successful performance of physical barriers depends on the effective control of si and groundwater contamination in upstream aquifers therefore we hoped that the reduction rate of saltwater wedge swr is higher and the enrichment ratio of specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr is lower in the vpfw however they are a couple of conflicts swr is inversely proportional to svnr in practice therefore we must further optimize the structure of the vpfw and evaluate the trade off between si and upstream groundwater pollution after extensive simulations the steady state distributions of reduction rates of water wedge length swr at different heights of the impermeable part of the barrier h and relative hydraulic conductivities k are presented in fig 8 a with the increase of h and the reduction of k seawater intrusion became weaker and the values of swr went up from 0 to 70 symmetrically the enrichment ratios of relative specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr at different heights h and relative hydraulic conductivities k are presented in fig 8 b similarly nitrate in the aquifer was gradually enriched and the values of svnr also increased from 0 to 70 with the increase of h and the reduction of k however the growing processes are asymmetrical and h has a stronger effect on the nitrate enrichment than k because of the asymmetry between swr and svnr it is possible for us to find the best combinations of h and k generally an excellent physical barrier has a reduction rate of water wedge length swr of more than 60 abdoulhalik et al 2017 when fig 8 a is compared with fig 8 b we find an optimized area surrounded by a 60 swr contour line and a 30 svnr contour line in which swr is more than 60 and svnr is less than 30 fig 8 c based on the simulated results all the cut off wall cases were out of the optimized shaded area which means a traditional cut off wall is not able to satisfy the optimal standard the results show that the developed vpfw is superior to the traditional cut off wall for the control of si and nitrate contamination this example can be extended to various conditions and requirements such that decision makers may select the most relevant criterion e g reduction of saline intrusion thus swr 75 and acquire an individual outline for their optimized area and in turn adjust h and k to meet the needs of practical engineering 4 summary and conclusion in this study we proposed a new variable permeability full section wall vpfw then investigated the dynamic mechanism and control effectiveness of si and nitrate pollution under the effects of the physical barriers and denitrification and lastly optimize the major structural parameters our main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the advancement of dissolved oxygen do is almost synchronous with the movement of saltwater near the sea boundary and the do gradually decreases as saltwater approached the barrier at the landward side infiltrated nitrate bearing water mixes with upstream fresh groundwater carrying dissolve organic carbon doc resulting in the degradation of some no3 and the continuous retreat of the doc wedge towards the fresh water boundary 2 based on the comparison of two typical barriers the freshwater discharge flux and nitrate discharge flux for v 1 16 25 increased by 35 and 20 respectively and the area of the nitrate plume zone decreases by 15 on average while the swr only went down by 2 compared to the traditional cut off wall 3 it was found that a reduction of k rather than only increasing the wall heights produces better control of seawater intrusion although excessive reduction of k will inversely increase the salinity in the aquifer moreover the nitrate in the groundwater is constantly enriched with the increase of h and the decrease of k however when the wall height is taller than 35 m it may cause serious nitrate enrichment in the landward aquifer 4 according to the evaluation of trade offs between si and the nitrate enrichment optimization of the vpfw structure swr and svnr went up from 0 to 70 asymmetrically the optimal k and h for the vpfw can be determined with over 60 swr and less than 30 svnr but all the cut off wall cases fail to meet the requirement the results show that the vpfw is much more effective in controlling si and nitrate pollution in comparison with the cut off wall while we were able to show the general feasibility of this new barrier concept we think that future work should try to investigate additional aspects of design e g location of the barrier and influences of hydrogeological conditions and hydraulic variations e g pumping activity credit authorship

5472,the development of biocrusts and litter cover has been promoted by the vegetation restoration of karst mountainous lands in recent decades however the contribution of biocrust and litter to the karst terrestrial water cycle is still unclear the interactive effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation processes were explored by inserting microlysimeters 20 cm radius and 35 cm height into the karst mountainous lands to collect undisturbed soils four moss crust biomass levels 0 0 32 0 64 and 0 96 kg m 2 and three pine needle biomass levels 0 0 32 and 0 64 kg m 2 were used to estimate the influences of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation losses and surface temperatures in addition the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles were also assessed the effect of pine needle cover on reducing evaporation rates was stronger than that of moss crusts moreover the influences of moss crusts on the evaporation rate were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles while the effects of pine needles on the evaporation rate were not highly affected by the moss crusts furthermore thermal signatures showed that the pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature pr 0 50 compared to the effect of the moss crusts pr 0 17 there was a significant relationship between the value of ebare soil e0 and the mean soil water content swcmean for bare soils the predictive ability of the one parameter concept weighted average vegetation coefficient kc was slightly better than that of the double parameter concept moss crust factor kmc and pine needle factor knp the key ecohydrological role of ground cover in controlling evaporation cannot be neglected for karst mountainous land management and preventing rocky desertification keywords moss crust pine needle evaporation process karst mountainous land 1 introduction the karst landform which plays a significant role in water supply and consumption covers approximately 10 of the earth s land surface yang et al 2017 in southwest china the vegetation of karst mountainous lands was severely damaged prior to the 1980s leading to increasingly worsening ecological environments therefore since the 1980s various vegetation restoration projects have been conducted in karst degraded ecosystems in southwest china tong et al 2018 li et al 2018 the latest monitoring results in 2018 showed that the woodland and meadow vegetation in the karst mountains had been substantially improved and their total areas had increased by 14500 km2 from 57 5 2011 to 61 4 2016 www gov cn xinwen 2018 12 13 content 5348378 htm 1 it is a rapid landscape scale shift in surface and land use that has significant implications for the terrestrial water cycle chen et al 2010 cao et al 2009 soil water evaporation is an essential part of the terrestrial water cycle liu et al 2016a b it plays a critical role in vegetation growth and restoration and in the decision whether to adopt natural vegetation succession or human intervention jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however due to the wide existence of soil fractures numerous underground fractures and conduits that induce rapid drainage soil water deficit is one of the most important limiting factors affecting vegetation restoration in karst mountainous lands zhang et al 2018 although the climate is humid with abundant precipitation in karst ecosystems water stress happens frequently because of the thin soil layer and low water holding capacity liu et al 2016a b therefore soil water evaporation is a dominant water flux of karst ecosystems reducing available water for transpiration however previous studies mainly focused on soil water evaporation processes in non karst areas after vegetation restoration i e desert semiarid woodland grassland and dryland yu et al 2010 giuditta et al 2018 the effects of different vegetation types on soil evaporation soil water storage and water balance in these non karst areas were investigated for example jiao et al 2018 found that soil evaporation e rather than transpiration t consumed more soil water in the black locust plantation in the semi arid loess plateau china the characteristics of soil evaporation and temperature under aggregate mulches created by burrowing ants were shown by li et al 2017 few studies have investigated the soil water evaporation processes in karst landscapes after vegetation restoration the evaporation processes should be studied in detail to restore the karst mountainous ecological system and improve its functions generally the development of litter cover and biocrusts is often promoted by vegetation restoration which has a significant role in the terrestrial water cycle magliano et al 2017 confirmed that litter was more effective than forest canopy in reducing soil evaporation in dry rangelands the physicochemical characteristics influencing the soil hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity can be altered by litter cover and biocrusts kakeh et al 2018 wang et al 2017 for example the effects of mixing pine needle litter on soil biological properties in sandy loam soils were studied by rai et al 2017 moreover litter cover and biocrusts also reduced the atmospheric demand jiang et al 2018 showed that biological soil crusts reduced soil evaporation by maintaining a lower soil temperature than that of the physical soil crust and interpatch zone during the dry period in addition the effects of litter cover and biocrusts on soil evaporation depend on their types development characteristics and the climatic conditions of the study areas xiao et al 2010 demonstrated that soil evaporation in arid and semiarid environments was not highly changed by the presence of biological soil crusts loess plateau of china chamizo et al 2013 concluded that for the specific crust and soil types tested the evaporation relative to physical crusts or scraped soils in semiarid environments was not significantly modified by the presence or the type of biocrusts tabernas desert however li et al 2016 proposed some different results that moss crusts can prevent water evaporation in low precipitation 5 mm and 10 mm and cannot effectively prevent the evaporation process in 15 mm rainfall simulations finally the effects of litter cover on soil evaporation were different from the effects of biocrusts liu et al 2019 found that litter crusts increased the soil water content in both the surface 0 5 cm and subsurface 5 10 cm soils biocrusts increased the soil water content in the surface soil and decreased the content in the subsurface soil in recent decades many efforts have been devoted to investigating the influences of litter cover and biocrust on soil hydrology in arid and semiarid environments xiao and hu 2017 shi et al 2018 however most of the previous evaporation studies have focused on contrasting patchy vegetation ecosystems which were dominated by fully vegetated and bare soil patches magliano et al 2017 few studies have investigated the effects of litter cover and biocrusts on soil water evaporation processes in moist climatic karst regions with water stress pines are widely used in massive forestation projects in degraded karst mountainous lands forest litter layers that form the accumulation of pine needles because of the complex influences of leaf litterfall wind and rainfall were produced by afforestation with high spatial heterogeneity fig 1 b in addition the annual availability of pine needles was estimated for energy applications kala and subbarao 2018 consequently the biomass of litter layers was dynamic in these regions in addition to the litter layers the afforestation in degraded karst mountainous lands also contributed to the promotion of the extensive development of biocrusts many biocrusts were moss crusts fig 1c the analysis of how litter cover and biocrust interact in the regulation of soil evaporation is crucial to understand the ecohydrology of degraded restoring restored karst mountainous ecosystems as well as to infer how different vegetation restoration practices may affect this process in this paper the effect of ground cover on evaporation processes was explored differentiating the effects of biocrust moss crusts and litter cover pine needles in karst mountainous lands the objectives of our work were as follows 1 to estimate the influences of different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation and surface temperature 2 to identify the regulating factors affecting evaporation and surface temperature and 3 to discuss the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts one parameter concept and double parameter concept considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was located in a pinus massoniana forest 26 26 59 72 26 26 43 01 n and 106 39 2 23 106 39 18 85 e in western huaxi district guiyang city guizhou province fig 1a pinus massoniana is a typical afforestation species in guizhou province the soil surface of the pinus massoniana forest is widely covered by pine needles and moss crust fig 1b huaxi district is dominated by a subtropical humid temperate climate with an average annual precipitation of 1185 mm an average annual temperature of 15 and an annual potential evaporation of 830 mm seventy eight percent of the precipitation is between may and october this site had a forest canopy density of 0 75 and was covered with mixed soils that mainly included sedimentary red soil and yellow soil carbonate derived laterite the lithology is dominated by limestone from the guanling formation of the middle triassic the soil thickness had high heterogeneity and ranged from 0 3 m to 3 2 m with a mean value of 0 8 m due to vegetation restoration the percentage of rocky outcrops decreased to 30 soil particle size was analyzed using a mastersizer2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments uk soil organic matter was determined by the walkley black method the soil electrical conductivity of a 1 5 soil to water extract and ph were determined using an mp521 lab ph conductivity meter shanghai san xin instrumentation china the biomass of moss crusts and pine needles was determined by the drying method the thickness length and diameter were measured with a vernier scale the characteristics of the soil materials moss crusts and pine needles including thickness and species in this study site were measured and are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental setup the effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation processes were evaluated by employing twelve treatments with different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles table 2 the treatments included four moss crust biomass levels 0 0 32 0 64 and 0 96 kg m 2 three pine needle biomass levels 0 0 32 and 0 64 kg m 2 these treatments were attained using the following three stages of preparation stage 1 artificially cultivate moss crust the moss crusts were artificially cultivated with similar methods as shown in xiao et al 2015 due to the high heterogeneity of the moss crusts in the field laboratory grown moss crusts were applied to make the moss crust structure and developmental stage consistent the artificial cultivation of moss was conducted in a greenhouse mosses are propagated mainly through asexual reproduction along with their stem and leaf fragments under natural conditions therefore in this study the stem and leaf fragments of moss collected from the field were used to artificially cultivate moss crust then artificially cultivated moss crusts with the same species as the pinus massoniana forest were selected to colonize the soil surface the main species of moss collected was hypnum hedw after air drying and removing the plant residue soil materials and rock fragments the well developed moss crusts were collected from the field and crushed with a plant shredder the soil materials collected from the forestlands served as the culture media square trays 30 cm radius were used as culture vessels then the soil materials were packed in the trays freely draining at the bottom the thickness of the packed soil was 0 5 cm and its bulk density was approximately 1 3 g cm 3 afterward the shattered moss fragments were distributed uniformly at a dose of 250 g m 2 air dry matter on the soil surface in the square trays finally the square trays were placed in the shade and hand irrigated every 7 days this process was carried out in successive cycles until the moss crusts completely covered the soil surface fig 1d stage 2 field sampling in situ after heavy rain the field sampling procedure was carried out to obtain a soil water content close to the field water holding capacity 0 30 g cm 3 polyvinyl chloride pvc microlysimeters 20 cm radius and 35 cm height were used for field sampling in situ to collect undisturbed soils from the forestlands note that these undisturbed soils were collected from neighboring places and at the same depths to exclude the influences of soil properties on soil evaporation then undisturbed soils of 15 cm thickness were collected by inserting these microlysimeters into the forestlands the microlysimeters were carefully removed from the forestlands afterward their bases were sealed to a perfectly fitted pvc sheet the pvc microlysimeters were cut to 20 cm an excess of 5 cm was used to place the moss crust and pine needles stage 3 colonize and cover the microlysimeters by artificially cultivated moss and pine needles all microlysimeters were immediately placed in the laboratory with natural light and ventilation after they were extracted from the soil once the microlysimeters were extracted from the soil and sealed the experimental treatments were applied the artificially cultivated moss crusts with a soil layer of 0 5 cm were first saturated to the field water holding capacity and then placed on the soil surfaces of the microlysimeters slight pressures and a small amount of water were applied to tightly connect the moss crusts including the soil layer of 0 5 cm and the soil surface of the microlysimeters the above steps were essential to ensure that the microlysimeters were naturally colonized by the moss since pine needles widely exist in pinus massoniana forests pine needles were directly collected from forestlands finally pine needles were applied to cover the surface of the microlysimeters in a uniformly distributed manner 2 3 evaporation measurements evaporation experiments were performed in a shelter canopy laboratory environment from april 18 to july 27 2019 the air temperature and relative humidity were measured by a temperature and humidity recorder testo 174h data logger testo se co kgaa the microlysimeters were weighed at 9 00 am every day with an electronic precision balance of 0 1 g the soil water losses were determined by employing the differences between masses it must be noted that since some water approximately 5 g was sprayed on the surface on the 5th day to ensure the survival of moss crusts the soil water contents for all treatments on the 5th day were slightly higher the evaporation process of free water was also measured by the same polyvinyl chloride microlysimeters with two replicates the thermal images at 9 00 am every two days were recorded by a thermal camera testo 865 testo se co kgaa irsoft 4 5 software was used to analyze a thermal image automatically these thermal images were then imported into irsoft 4 5 software to evaluate the temporal and spatial evolution of the surface temperature for different treatments 2 4 free water evaporation the air temperature had a range of 15 6 31 8 and the atmospheric relative humidity was 41 3 88 9 fig 2 this result suggests that evaporation occurred at a dynamic atmospheric evaporability therefore with the duration of evaporation the cumulative evaporation of free water ec0 mm nonlinearly increased the evaporation rate of free water e0 mm d 1 fluctuated the evaporation rate of free

measurements including i successive cumulative evaporation evaporation rates the ratios of soil evaporation to free water surface evaporation and the mean gravimetric soil water content swcmean determined by the conservation of mass and ii the surface temperature field evaluated from the thermal images the successive cumulative evaporation evaporation rates and the ratios of soil evaporation to free water surface evaporation were used to assess the effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporative loss the thermal images were analyzed by irsoft 4 5 testo se co kgaa to obtain the temporal and spatial evolution of the surface temperatures on different days a partial correlation coefficient was used to measure the degree of association between two variables with the effect of a set of controlling variables removed altman 1991 girden 1992 partial correlations between the evaporation rate of the whole column e the mean surface temperature at 9 00 and the environmental factors were analyzed the analyses of partial correlation were conducted using the significance levels of 0 05 and 0 01 there is a hypothesis in ecohydrology that the evaporation rate is reduced in the areas covered by vegetation because of the sheltering effects of vegetation chen et al 2018 in this study the evaporation rate e with the bare soil evaporation ebare soil one parameter concept was calculated using the weighted average vegetation coefficient kc which considered the combined effects of moss crusts and pine needles moreover the evaporation rate e for different treatments double parameter concept was determined by applying the moss crust potential evapotranspiration weighting factor kmc and the pine needle potential evapotranspiration weighting factor knp the 70 days of data included the evaporation rate of free water e0 the evaporation rate of the whole column e mean air temperature ta mean atmospheric relative humidity rhmean the mean gravimetric soil water content swcmean and the coverage of moss crusts cmc the data were applied to test the one parameter concept and double parameter concept regression analysis was conducted to indicate the relationships between each variable and the determination coefficient r2 was used to evaluate the performances of the applied regression equations all statistical analyses of the data were performed in r version 3 4 2 3 results 3 1 evaporation process 3 1 1 cumulative evaporation fig 3 shows the relative cumulative evaporation the ratio of cumulative evaporation ec to cumulative free water evaporation ec0 for different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles there are a few features in fig 3 illustrating the complexity of evaporation with the coverage of moss crusts and pine needles the first puzzling behavior is the difference between non covered and covered treatments the relative cumulative evaporation of the non covered treatment m0p0 remained unchanged before it decreased exponentially to a stable value however the relative cumulative evaporation of covered treatments first increased at the first stage and then decreased exponentially to a steady value at the second stage the second interesting behavior is that the influences of moss crusts on cumulative evaporation were weakened by the increasing pine needles at the second stage in fact the relative cumulative evaporation of all covered treatments became closer from p0 to p2 in the second stage fig 3 regression analysis was performed on the relative cumulative evaporation ec ec0 and the trends mentioned above were confirmed by the evaporation time t table 3 2 e c e c 0 e firstday a t 0 5 3 e c e c 0 e max e steady e b t t 0 e steady where efirstday was the relative cumulative evaporation on the first day emax was the maximum value of the relative cumulative evaporation in the second stage esteady was the stable value of the relative cumulative evaporation in the second stage t0 was the inflection point of time days e was the euler number 2 71828 and a and b were the empirical parameters the determination coefficients r2 dimensionless ranged from 0 62 to 0 90 the mean square errors rmse dimensionless were between 0 005 and 0 019 in addition the results of regression analysis also showed that the inflection point of time of the uncovered treatment entering the falling rate stage was 1 51 4 days earlier than that of the covered treatments moreover there were no significant relationships between the inflection time and the surface biomass 3 1 2 evaporation rate the mean daily soil evaporation rate et70 decreased linearly with the increase in moss crust biomass for the p0 and p1 treatments r2 0 81 and 0 74 respectively fig 4 however the rate was not significantly affected by the moss crusts in the p2 treatment r2 0 08 the mean daily soil evaporation rate et70 decreased linearly with the increase in pine needle biomass for all treatments with determination coefficients between 0 71 and 0 94 these results showed that the effects of moss crusts on evaporation rates were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles the effects of pine needles on evaporation rates were not largely affected by the moss crust cover 3 1 3 comparative effects of the main influencing factors the evaporation rate e was significantly increased by the air temperature and the mean soil water content with partial correlation coefficients pr of 0 31 and 0 21 respectively table 4 and fig 4 however the evaporation rate was significantly reduced with the increase in pine needle biomass pr 0 41 moss crust biomass pr 0 13 and atmospheric relative humidity pr 0 71 these results indicated that the atmospheric relative humidity had the largest impact on the evaporation rate while the biomass of moss crusts had the lowest influence the most interesting conclusion was that compared to the effect of the moss crusts pr 0 13 the pine needles had a much larger negative effect on the evaporation rate pr 0 41 3 2 surface temperature 3 2 1 thermal signature the comparison of the thermal signature on june 16 2019 for different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles is shown in fig 5 with the increase in the biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles the surface temperature was increased the m3p2 treatment showed the highest surface temperature localized cold spots appeared at the position of the soil surface without moss crust cover for example the surface temperature of moss crust in the m2p0 treatment was higher than that of bare soil however the localized cold spots were hardly recognized with the pine needle cover 3 2 2 mean surface temperature generally the mean surface temperature at 09 00 with more moss crusts and pine needles was significantly higher the mean surface temperature at 09 00 increased linearly with the increase in the biomass of moss crusts for the p0 and p1 treatments r2 0 74 and 0 90 respectively fig 6 however the temperature was not significantly affected by the moss crusts in the p2 treatment r2 0 03 on the other hand the mean surface temperature increased linearly with the increase in the biomass of pine needles for all treatments with large determination coefficients these results indicated that the effects of moss crust cover on the surface temperature were obviously restricted by the biomass of pine needles the effects of pine needles on the surface temperature were not largely affected by the moss crusts 3 2 3 comparative effects of the main influencing factors partial correlation coefficients showed that with the increase in pine needle biomass pr 0 50 p 0 01 moss crust biomass pr 0 17 p 0 01 air temperature pr 0 97 p 0 01 and atmospheric relative humidity pr 0 27 p 0 01 the daily mean surface temperature significantly increased however the daily mean surface temperature significantly decreased as the mean soil water content increased pr 0 27 p 0 01 table 4 the most important conclusion was that compared to the effect of the biomass of moss crusts pr 0 17 the biomass of pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature pr 0 50 3 3 evaporation estimation considering the effects of moss crusts and pine needles 3 3 1 estimation of bare soil evaporation ebare soil there was a significant relationship between the value of ebare soil e0 and the mean soil water content swcmean the average value of three replicates for the m0p0 treatment fig 7 therefore the bare soil evaporation ebare soil could be expressed as ebare soil 1 90swcmean 0 20 e0 with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 52 it should be noted that the precision of evaluations and predictions was not favorable when the mean soil water content was close to 0 30 this result indicated that the above equation should be modified when the soil water content was very high however it was very practical because the soil was drying after a few days 3 3 2 one parameter concept and double parameter concept the model performances shown in table 5 are representative of all tested treatments with r2 values between 0 93 and 0 99 for the one parameter concept and 0 77 and 0 94 for the double parameter concept this result showed that the predictive ability of the one parameter concept was slightly better than that of the double parameter concept in this study 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of research results from drylands the effect of different biomass levels on evaporation processes began with a relatively high evaporation rate during stage 1 before day 11 followed by a lower rate during stage 2 after day 11 and before day 70 fig 3 there are some differences between the above conclusion and the results of xiao et al 2010 in their study the falling rate stages were observed approximately 5 days after evaporation began our equations about the correlations between cumulative soil evaporation and time during the constant rate stage and falling rate stage significantly differed from the equations of xiao et al 2010 the equations at the falling rate stage were similar to the results reported by magliano et al 2017 the most likely reasons may be that empirical equations are not universal and cannot accurately describe the correlations between cumulative soil evaporation and time during different stages in this study the interactive effects of moss crusts and pine needles on the evaporation losses of carbonate derived laterite from karst mountainous lands were explored the functional roles of ground cover in dryland ecosystems have quickly gained increasing interest from many scientists bettina et al 2016 kakeh et al 2018 jia et al 2018 sand jensen et al 2015 in drylands a majority of cases showed that compared to bare soils biocrusts reduced evaporation bettina et al 2016 although the aerial part of xerophytic bryophytes in biocrust was thin the composite layer formed by the interpenetration of pseudoroots and surface soil was very thick this layer has become an integral part of the surface soil and participates in the processes of soil hydrology and energy circulation hardie and almajmaie 2019 shi et al 2018 xiao and hu 2017 although biocrust litter plays a major role in drylands their overall functional roles in karst ecosystems have not yet been identified and described our work showed that soil evaporation was significantly reduced by the moss crust but the effects were minor table 4 the result was not in agreement with kidron and tal 2012 who reported crusted plots having an evaporation rate of 1 24 1 57 with an average of 1 38 times higher than that of the bare sand in drylands the possible reason was that the composite part of the wet moss and the surface soil was very shallow in the karst ecosystem which was mainly composed of moss stem and leaf clustering fig 1 and table 1 however the litter cover had a large influence on the soil evaporation for karst mountainous lands table 4 and fig 4 this result was very similar to those reported by magliano et al 2017 in drylands in addition the modeling concepts reported by whitney et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 from drylands table 5 and fig 7 were also examined and tested the model simulations were in agreement with the daily soil evaporation rate observations as quantified through rmse and r2 for different biomasses of biological crusts and pine needles 4 2 the implications and limitations of this study for field situations the latest monitoring results in 2018 showed that vegetation protection and artificial afforestation contributed 65 5 to the reversal of rocky desertification data were from the national forestry and grassland administration of china however the contribution of biocrust and litter to the reversal of rocky desertification is still unclear although the climate of karst mountainous lands in southwest china is humid with abundant precipitation water stress frequently occurs because the water holding capacity of the thin soil layer is low and there is rapid water loss due to karst fissures liu et al 2016a b fu et al 2016 the results in this paper confirmed that the effect of pine needle cover on reducing evaporation rates was stronger than that of moss crust as seen from the differences in the slopes of these linear fitting equations figs 5 and 6 the opportunity for plant roots to uptake water was increased by the reduction in evaporation losses which were also beneficial to the growth of vegetation in rocky desertification areas another interesting finding was that compared to the influence of the biomass of pine needles the air temperature had a lower influence on evaporation loss table 4 it can be speculated in this study that forest litter should play a certain role in resisting the negative influences of global warming on forest hydrology this interesting finding should be confirmed in the future in addition the results in this paper also showed that moss crust had a minor effect on increasing the soil temperature while the pine needle cover had a stronger effect on limiting the temperature changes in the soil table 4 figs 5 and 6 moreover limiting drastic fluctuations in soil temperature is conducive to seed germination ooi et al 2012 the woodland and meadow vegetation in the karst mountainous areas have been substantially improved in recent decades brandt et al 2018 nevertheless the rocky desertification problem easily rebounded by human land conflicts and fragile ecosystems in this study the forest litter was very effective in maintaining the temperature and humidity in the karst mountainous areas therefore a possible measurement i e artificially cultivated biocrusts and midwifed forest litter was inspired by these results to prevent and control rocky desertification however such studies are rarely reported despite the efforts made in these experiments there are some limitations that need to be addressed in the future although these indoor experiments were subjected to sharp diurnal temperature and humidity fluctuations they were not subject to some climatological variables such as wind that could be relevant under field conditions the laboratory scale results also require confirmation by field studies the experimental results obtained during multiple local studies need to be integrated and extrapolated to ecosystem and global scales bettina et al 2016 in addition carbonate derived laterite has a special dilation shrinkage characteristic which is different from other derived laterites and not typical of dilative soils liao et al 2000 there was a clear distinction between the dry season and the rainy season in southwest china liu et al 2015 the dilation shrinkage characteristics were enhanced in these meteorological conditions leading to the formation of fractures in the soils therefore the effects of biocrust and littler on the interaction between soil evaporation and the formation of fractures in soils should be investigated in the future biocrusts and litter can naturally develop or recover after disturbance and their biomass should be dynamic in this study the different developmental stages of biocrusts and litter were simulated by using the different biomasses of biocrusts and litter although the influences of biomass on soil evaporation can be reflected by this method the scientific knowledge is still far from closing the overall cycles i e growing and decaying of vegetation seasonally some studies have shown that above a certain coverage i e 60 or 75 the biocrust did not reduce the evaporation rate harper and marble 1988 berdugo et al 2014 in our study the moss coverage was not raised to such a high value 40 and thus our conclusions have certain limitations as the moss coverage was high moreover it should be noted that only hypnum hedw and pine needle effects were investigated in this work actually the hypnum hedw has nearly 43 species worldwide there are 18 species and 1 subspecies recorded in guizhou province southwest china xiong 2014 different types of moss crust can affect evaporation directly by their various compositions and structures including swelling upon wetting which modifies microtopography exopolysaccharide eps production hydrophobicity and the efficiency of harvesting dew maphangwa et al 2012 tao and zhang 2012 the effects of litter crusts mixed with different species on litter structure and the movement of water within the litter crusts should be considered liu et al 2019 more experiments on the effects of different biocrusts and litters should be performed in karst mountainous lands we expect that an interdisciplinary and global team including hydrologists biologists and soil scientists could be extremely helpful to solve the above key scientific problems and future research challenges 5 conclusions the ground cover effect on evaporation processes was explored differentiating the effects of biocrust moss crusts and litter cover pine needles in karst mountainous lands the influences of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation losses and surface temperatures were estimated by using four moss crust biomass levels 0 0 32 0 64 and 0 96 kg m 2 and three pine needle biomass levels 0 0 32 and 0 64 kg m 2 in addition the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles were also assessed the main results showed that the effects of moss crusts on evaporation rates were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles while the effects of pine needles on evaporation rates were not largely affected by the moss crusts the pine needles had a much larger negative effect on the evaporation rate pr 0 41 compared to that of the moss crusts pr 0 13 thermal signatures showed that the pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature pr 0 50 compared to that of the moss crusts pr 0 17 the pine needles were very effective in containing the temperature and humidity in the karst mountainous areas finally there was a significant relationship between the value of ebare soil e0 and the mean soil water

5472,the development of biocrusts and litter cover has been promoted by the vegetation restoration of karst mountainous lands in recent decades however the contribution of biocrust and litter to the karst terrestrial water cycle is still unclear the interactive effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation processes were explored by inserting microlysimeters 20 cm radius and 35 cm height into the karst mountainous lands to collect undisturbed soils four moss crust biomass levels 0 0 32 0 64 and 0 96 kg m 2 and three pine needle biomass levels 0 0 32 and 0 64 kg m 2 were used to estimate the influences of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation losses and surface temperatures in addition the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles were also assessed the effect of pine needle cover on reducing evaporation rates was stronger than that of moss crusts moreover the influences of moss crusts on the evaporation rate were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles while the effects of pine needles on the evaporation rate were not highly affected by the moss crusts furthermore thermal signatures showed that the pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature pr 0 50 compared to the effect of the moss crusts pr 0 17 there was a significant

neglected for karst mountainous land management and preventing rocky desertification keywords moss crust pine needle evaporation process karst mountainous land 1 introduction the karst landform which plays a significant role in water supply and consumption covers approximately 10 of the earth s land surface yang et al 2017 in southwest china the vegetation of karst mountainous lands was severely damaged prior to the 1980s leading to increasingly worsening ecological environments therefore since the 1980s various vegetation restoration projects have been conducted in karst degraded ecosystems in southwest china tong et al 2018 li et al 2018 the latest monitoring results in 2018 showed that the woodland and meadow vegetation in the karst mountains had been substantially improved and their total areas had increased by 14500 km2 from 57 5 2011 to 61 4 2016 www gov cn xinwen 2018 12 13 content 5348378 htm 1 it is a rapid landscape scale shift in surface and land use that has significant implications for the terrestrial water cycle chen et al 2010 cao et al 2009 soil water evaporation is an essential part of the terrestrial water cycle liu et al 2016a b it plays a critical role in vegetation growth and restoration and in the decision whether to adopt natural vegetation succession or human intervention jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however due to the wide existence of soil fractures numerous underground fractures and conduits that induce rapid drainage soil water deficit is one of the most important limiting factors affecting vegetation restoration in karst mountainous lands zhang et al 2018 although the climate is humid with abundant precipitation in karst ecosystems water stress happens frequently because of the thin soil layer and low water holding capacity liu et al 2016a b therefore soil water evaporation is a dominant water flux of karst ecosystems reducing available water for transpiration however previous studies mainly focused on soil water evaporation processes in non karst areas after vegetation restoration i e desert semiarid woodland grassland and dryland yu et al 2010 giuditta et al 2018 the effects of different vegetation types on soil evaporation soil water storage and water balance in these non karst areas were investigated for example jiao et al 2018 found that soil evaporation e rather than transpiration t consumed more soil water in the black locust plantation in the semi arid loess plateau china the characteristics of soil evaporation and temperature under aggregate mulches created by burrowing ants were shown by li et al 2017 few studies have investigated the soil water evaporation processes in karst landscapes after vegetation restoration the evaporation processes should be studied in detail to restore the karst mountainous ecological system and improve its functions generally the development of litter cover and biocrusts is often promoted by vegetation restoration which has a significant role in the terrestrial water cycle magliano et al 2017 confirmed that litter was more effective than forest canopy in reducing soil evaporation in dry rangelands the physicochemical characteristics influencing the soil hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity can be altered by litter cover and biocrusts kakeh et al 2018 wang et al 2017 for example the effects of mixing pine needle litter on soil biological properties in sandy loam soils were studied by rai et al 2017 moreover litter cover and biocrusts also reduced the atmospheric demand jiang et al 2018 showed that biological soil crusts reduced soil evaporation by maintaining a lower soil temperature than that of the physical soil crust and interpatch zone during the dry period in addition the effects of litter cover and biocrusts on soil evaporation depend on their types development characteristics and the climatic conditions of the study areas xiao et al 2010 demonstrated that soil evaporation in arid and semiarid environments was not highly changed by the presence of biological soil crusts loess plateau of china chamizo et al 2013 concluded that for the specific crust and soil types tested the evaporation relative to physical crusts or scraped soils in semiarid environments was not significantly modified by the presence or the type of biocrusts tabernas desert however li et al 2016 proposed some different results that moss crusts can prevent water evaporation in low precipitation 5 mm and 10 mm and cannot effectively prevent the evaporation process in 15 mm rainfall simulations finally the effects of litter cover on soil evaporation were different from the effects of biocrusts liu et al 2019 found that litter crusts increased the soil water content in both the surface 0 5 cm and subsurface 5 10 cm soils biocrusts increased the soil water content in the surface soil and decreased the content in the subsurface soil in recent decades many efforts have been devoted to investigating the influences of litter cover and biocrust on soil hydrology in arid and semiarid environments xiao and hu 2017 shi et al 2018 however most of the previous evaporation studies have focused on contrasting patchy vegetation ecosystems which were dominated by fully vegetated and bare soil patches magliano et al 2017 few studies have investigated the effects of litter cover and biocrusts on soil water evaporation processes in moist climatic karst regions with water stress pines are widely used in massive forestation projects in degraded karst mountainous lands forest litter layers that form the accumulation of pine needles because of the complex influences of leaf litterfall wind and rainfall were produced by afforestation with high spatial heterogeneity fig 1 b in addition the annual availability of pine needles was estimated for energy applications kala and subbarao 2018 consequently the biomass of litter layers was dynamic in these regions in addition to the litter layers the afforestation in degraded karst mountainous lands also contributed to the promotion of the extensive development of biocrusts many biocrusts were moss crusts fig 1c the analysis of how litter cover and biocrust interact in the regulation of soil evaporation is crucial to understand the ecohydrology of degraded restoring restored karst mountainous ecosystems as well as to infer how different vegetation restoration practices may affect this process in this paper the effect of ground cover on evaporation processes was explored differentiating the effects of biocrust moss crusts and litter cover pine needles in karst mountainous lands the objectives of our work were as follows 1 to estimate the influences of different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation and surface temperature 2 to identify the regulating factors affecting evaporation and surface temperature and 3 to discuss the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts one parameter concept and double parameter concept considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was located in a pinus massoniana forest 26 26 59 72 26 26 43 01 n and 106 39 2 23 106 39 18 85 e in western huaxi district guiyang city guizhou province fig 1a pinus massoniana is a typical afforestation species in guizhou province the soil surface of the pinus massoniana forest is widely covered by pine needles and moss crust fig 1b huaxi district is dominated by a subtropical humid temperate climate with an average annual precipitation of 1185 mm an average annual temperature of 15 and an annual potential evaporation of 830 mm seventy eight percent of the precipitation is between may and october this site had a forest canopy density of 0 75 and was covered with mixed soils that mainly included sedimentary red soil and yellow soil carbonate derived laterite the lithology is dominated by limestone from the guanling formation of the middle triassic the soil thickness had high heterogeneity and ranged from 0 3 m to 3 2 m with a mean value of 0 8 m due to vegetation restoration the percentage of rocky outcrops decreased to 30 soil particle size was analyzed using a mastersizer2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments uk soil organic matter was determined by the walkley black method the soil electrical conductivity of a 1 5 soil to water extract and ph were determined using an mp521 lab ph conductivity meter shanghai san xin instrumentation china the biomass of moss crusts and pine needles was determined by the drying method the thickness length and diameter were measured with a vernier scale the characteristics of the soil materials moss crusts and pine needles including thickness and species in this study site were measured and are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental setup the effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation processes were evaluated by employing twelve treatments with different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles table 2 the treatments included four moss crust biomass levels 0 0 32 0 64 and 0 96 kg m 2 three pine needle biomass levels 0 0 32 and 0 64 kg m 2 these treatments were attained using the following three stages of preparation stage 1 artificially cultivate moss crust the moss crusts were artificially cultivated with similar methods as shown in xiao et al 2015 due to the high heterogeneity of the moss crusts in the field laboratory grown moss crusts were applied to make the moss crust structure and developmental stage consistent the artificial cultivation of moss was conducted in a greenhouse mosses are propagated mainly through asexual reproduction along with their stem and leaf fragments under natural conditions therefore in this study the stem and leaf fragments of moss collected from the field were used to artificially cultivate moss crust then artificially cultivated moss crusts with the same species as the pinus massoniana forest were selected to colonize the soil surface the main species of moss collected was hypnum hedw after air drying and removing the plant residue soil materials and rock fragments the well developed moss crusts were collected from the field and crushed with a plant shredder the soil materials collected from the forestlands served as the culture media square trays 30 cm radius were used as culture vessels then the soil materials were packed in the trays freely draining at the bottom the thickness of the packed soil was 0 5 cm and its bulk density was approximately 1 3 g cm 3 afterward the shattered moss fragments were distributed uniformly at a dose of 250 g m 2 air dry matter on the soil surface in the square trays finally the square trays were placed in the shade and hand irrigated every 7 days this process was carried out in successive cycles until the moss crusts completely covered the soil surface fig 1d stage 2 field sampling in situ after heavy rain the field sampling procedure was carried out to obtain a soil water content close to the field water holding capacity 0 30 g cm 3 polyvinyl chloride pvc microlysimeters 20 cm radius and 35 cm height were used for field sampling in situ to collect undisturbed soils from the forestlands note that these undisturbed soils were collected from neighboring places and at the same depths to exclude the influences of soil properties on soil evaporation then undisturbed soils of 15 cm thickness were collected by inserting these microlysimeters into the forestlands the microlysimeters were carefully removed from the forestlands afterward their bases were sealed to a perfectly fitted pvc sheet the pvc microlysimeters were cut to 20 cm an excess of 5 cm was used to place the moss crust and pine needles stage 3 colonize and cover the microlysimeters by artificially cultivated moss and pine needles all microlysimeters were immediately placed in the laboratory with natural light and ventilation after they were extracted from the soil once the microlysimeters were extracted from the soil and sealed the experimental treatments were applied the artificially cultivated moss crusts with a soil layer of 0 5 cm were first saturated to the field water holding capacity and then placed on the soil surfaces of the microlysimeters slight pressures and a small amount of water were applied to tightly connect the moss crusts including the soil layer of 0 5 cm and the soil surface of the microlysimeters the above steps were essential to ensure that the microlysimeters were naturally colonized by the moss since pine needles widely exist in pinus massoniana forests pine needles were directly collected from forestlands finally pine needles were applied to cover the surface of the microlysimeters in a uniformly distributed manner 2 3 evaporation measurements evaporation experiments were performed in a shelter canopy laboratory environment from april 18 to july 27 2019 the air temperature and relative humidity were measured by a temperature and humidity recorder testo 174h data logger testo se co kgaa the microlysimeters were weighed at 9 00 am every day with an electronic precision balance of 0 1 g the soil water losses were determined by employing the differences between masses it must be noted that since some water approximately 5 g was sprayed on the surface on the 5th day to ensure the survival of moss crusts the soil water contents for all treatments on the 5th day were slightly higher the evaporation process of free water was also measured by the same polyvinyl chloride microlysimeters with two replicates the thermal images at 9 00 am every two days were recorded by a thermal camera testo 865 testo se co kgaa irsoft 4 5 software was used to analyze a thermal image automatically these thermal images were then imported into irsoft 4 5 software to evaluate the temporal and spatial evolution of the surface temperature for different treatments 2 4 free water evaporation the air temperature had a range of 15 6 31 8 and the atmospheric relative humidity was 41 3 88 9 fig 2 this result suggests that evaporation occurred at a dynamic atmospheric evaporability therefore with the duration of evaporation the cumulative evaporation of free water ec0 mm nonlinearly increased the evaporation rate of free water e0 mm d 1 fluctuated the evaporation rate of free water e0 mm d 1 was expressed as a function of the mean air temperature ta and mean atmospheric relative humidity rhmean with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 89 1 e 0 0 85 0 618 10 7 5 t a 273 3 t

measurements including i successive cumulative evaporation evaporation rates the ratios of soil evaporation to free water surface evaporation and the mean gravimetric soil water content swcmean determined by the conservation of mass and ii the surface temperature field evaluated from the thermal images the successive cumulative evaporation evaporation rates and the ratios of soil evaporation to free water surface evaporation were used to assess the effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporative loss the thermal images were analyzed by irsoft 4 5 testo se co kgaa to obtain the temporal and spatial evolution of the surface temperatures on different days a partial correlation coefficient was used to measure the degree of association between two variables with the effect of a set of controlling variables removed altman 1991 girden 1992 partial correlations between the evaporation rate of the whole column e the mean surface temperature at 9 00 and the environmental factors were analyzed the analyses of partial correlation were conducted using the significance levels of 0 05 and 0 01 there is a hypothesis in ecohydrology that the evaporation rate is reduced in the areas covered by vegetation because of the sheltering effects of vegetation chen et al 2018 in this study the evaporation rate e with the bare soil evaporation ebare soil one parameter concept was calculated using the weighted average vegetation coefficient kc which considered the combined effects of moss crusts and pine needles moreover the evaporation rate e for different treatments double parameter concept was determined by applying the moss crust potential evapotranspiration weighting factor kmc and the pine needle potential evapotranspiration weighting factor knp the 70 days of data included the evaporation rate of free water e0 the evaporation rate of the whole column e mean air temperature ta mean atmospheric relative humidity rhmean the mean gravimetric soil water content swcmean and the coverage of moss crusts cmc the data were applied to test the one parameter concept and double parameter concept regression analysis was conducted to indicate the relationships between each variable and the determination coefficient r2 was used to evaluate the performances of the applied regression equations all statistical analyses of the data were performed in r version 3 4 2 3 results 3 1 evaporation process 3 1 1 cumulative evaporation fig 3 shows the relative cumulative evaporation the ratio of cumulative evaporation ec to cumulative free water evaporation ec0 for different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles there are a few features in fig 3 illustrating the complexity of evaporation with the coverage of moss crusts and pine needles the first puzzling behavior is the difference between non covered and covered treatments the relative cumulative evaporation of the non covered treatment m0p0 remained unchanged before it decreased exponentially to a stable value however the relative cumulative evaporation of covered treatments first increased at the first stage and then decreased exponentially to a steady value at the second stage the second interesting behavior is that the influences of moss crusts on cumulative evaporation were weakened by the increasing pine needles at the second stage in fact the relative cumulative evaporation of all covered treatments became closer from p0 to p2 in the second stage fig 3 regression analysis was performed on the relative cumulative evaporation ec ec0 and the trends mentioned above were confirmed by the evaporation time t table 3 2 e c e c 0 e firstday a t 0 5 3 e c e c 0 e max e steady e b t t 0 e steady where efirstday was the relative cumulative evaporation on the first day emax was the maximum value of the relative cumulative evaporation in the second stage esteady was the stable value of the relative cumulative evaporation in the second stage t0 was the inflection point of time days e was the euler number 2 71828 and a and b were the empirical parameters the determination coefficients r2 dimensionless ranged from 0 62 to 0 90 the mean square errors rmse dimensionless were between 0 005 and 0 019 in addition the results of regression analysis also showed that the inflection point of time of the uncovered treatment entering the falling rate stage was 1 51 4 days earlier than that of the covered treatments moreover there were no significant relationships between the inflection time and the surface biomass 3 1 2 evaporation rate the mean daily soil evaporation rate et70 decreased linearly with the increase in moss crust biomass for the p0 and p1 treatments r2 0 81 and 0 74 respectively fig 4 however the rate was not significantly affected by the moss crusts in the p2 treatment r2 0 08 the mean daily soil evaporation rate et70 decreased linearly with the increase in pine needle biomass for all treatments with determination coefficients between 0 71 and 0 94 these results showed that the effects of moss crusts on evaporation rates were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles the effects of pine needles on evaporation rates were not largely affected by the moss crust cover 3 1 3 comparative effects of the main influencing factors the evaporation rate e was significantly increased by the air temperature and the mean soil water content with partial correlation coefficients pr of 0 31 and 0 21 respectively table 4 and fig 4 however the evaporation rate was significantly reduced with the increase in pine needle biomass pr 0 41 moss crust biomass pr 0 13 and atmospheric relative humidity pr 0 71 these results indicated that the atmospheric relative humidity had the largest impact on the evaporation rate while the biomass of moss crusts had the lowest influence the most interesting conclusion was that compared to the effect of the moss crusts pr 0 13 the pine needles had a much larger negative effect on the evaporation rate pr 0 41 3 2 surface temperature 3 2 1 thermal signature the comparison of the thermal signature on june 16 2019 for different biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles is shown in fig 5 with the increase in the biomass levels of moss crusts and pine needles the surface temperature was increased the m3p2 treatment showed the highest surface temperature localized cold spots appeared at the position of the soil surface without moss crust cover for example the surface temperature of moss crust in the m2p0 treatment was higher than that of bare soil however the localized cold spots were hardly recognized with the pine needle cover 3 2 2 mean surface temperature generally the mean surface temperature at 09 00 with more moss crusts and pine needles was significantly higher the mean surface temperature at 09 00 increased linearly with the increase in the biomass of moss crusts for the p0 and p1 treatments r2 0 74 and 0 90 respectively fig 6 however the temperature was not significantly affected by the moss crusts in the p2 treatment r2 0 03 on the other hand the mean surface temperature increased linearly with the increase in the biomass of pine needles for all treatments with large determination coefficients these results indicated that the effects of moss crust cover on the surface temperature were obviously restricted by the biomass of pine needles the effects of pine needles on the surface temperature were not largely affected by the moss crusts 3 2 3 comparative effects of the main influencing factors partial correlation coefficients showed that with the increase in pine needle biomass pr 0 50 p 0 01 moss crust biomass pr 0 17 p 0 01 air temperature pr 0 97 p 0 01 and atmospheric relative humidity pr 0 27 p 0 01 the daily mean surface temperature significantly increased however the daily mean surface temperature significantly decreased as the mean soil water content increased pr 0 27 p 0 01 table 4 the most important conclusion was that compared to the effect of the biomass of moss crusts pr 0 17 the biomass of pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature pr 0 50 3 3 evaporation estimation considering the effects of moss crusts and pine needles 3 3 1 estimation of bare soil evaporation ebare soil there was a significant relationship between the value of ebare soil e0 and the mean soil water content swcmean the average value of three replicates for the m0p0 treatment fig 7 therefore the bare soil evaporation ebare soil could be expressed as ebare soil 1 90swcmean 0 20 e0 with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 52 it should be noted that the precision of evaluations and predictions was not favorable when the mean soil water content was close to 0 30 this result indicated that the above equation should be modified when the soil water content was very high however it was very practical because the soil was drying after a few days 3 3 2 one parameter concept and double parameter concept the model performances shown in table 5 are representative of all tested treatments with r2 values between 0 93 and 0 99 for the one parameter concept and 0 77 and 0 94 for the double parameter concept this result showed that the predictive ability of the one parameter concept was slightly better than that of the double parameter concept in this study 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of research results from drylands the effect of different biomass levels on evaporation processes began with a relatively high evaporation rate during stage 1 before day 11 followed by a lower rate during stage 2 after day 11 and before day 70 fig 3 there are some differences between the above conclusion and the results of xiao et al 2010 in their study the falling rate stages were observed approximately 5 days after evaporation began our equations about the correlations between cumulative soil evaporation and time during the constant rate stage and falling rate stage significantly differed from the equations of xiao et al 2010 the equations at the falling rate stage were similar to the results reported by magliano et al 2017 the most likely reasons may be that empirical equations are not universal and cannot accurately describe the correlations between cumulative soil evaporation and time during different stages in this study the interactive effects of moss crusts and pine needles on the evaporation losses of carbonate derived laterite from karst mountainous lands were explored the functional roles of ground cover in dryland ecosystems have quickly gained increasing interest from many scientists bettina et al 2016 kakeh et al 2018 jia et al 2018 sand jensen et al 2015 in drylands a majority of cases showed that compared to bare soils biocrusts reduced evaporation bettina et al 2016 although the aerial part of xerophytic bryophytes in biocrust was thin the composite layer formed by the interpenetration of pseudoroots and surface soil was very thick this layer has become an integral part of the surface soil and participates in the processes of soil hydrology and energy circulation hardie and almajmaie 2019 shi et al 2018 xiao and hu 2017 although biocrust litter plays a major role in drylands their overall functional roles in karst ecosystems have not yet been identified and described our work showed that soil evaporation was significantly reduced by the moss crust but the effects were minor table 4 the result was not in agreement with kidron and tal 2012 who reported crusted plots having an evaporation rate of 1 24 1 57 with an average of 1 38 times higher than that of the bare sand in drylands the possible reason was that the composite part of the wet moss and the surface soil was very shallow in the karst ecosystem which was mainly composed of moss stem and leaf clustering fig 1 and table 1 however the litter cover had a large influence on the soil evaporation for karst mountainous lands table 4 and fig 4 this result was very similar to those reported by magliano et al 2017 in drylands in addition the modeling concepts reported by whitney et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 from drylands table 5 and fig 7 were also examined and tested the model simulations were in agreement with the daily soil evaporation rate observations as quantified through rmse and r2 for different biomasses of biological crusts and pine needles 4 2 the implications and limitations of this study for field situations the latest monitoring results in 2018 showed that vegetation protection and artificial afforestation contributed 65 5 to the reversal of rocky desertification data were from the national forestry and grassland administration of china however the contribution of biocrust and litter to the reversal of rocky desertification is still unclear although the climate of karst mountainous lands in southwest china is humid with abundant precipitation water stress frequently occurs because the water holding capacity of the thin soil layer is low and there is rapid water loss due to karst fissures liu et al 2016a b fu et al 2016 the results in this paper confirmed that the effect of pine needle cover on reducing evaporation rates was stronger than that of moss crust as seen from the differences in the slopes of these linear fitting equations figs 5 and 6 the opportunity for plant roots to uptake water was increased by the reduction in evaporation losses which were also beneficial to the growth of vegetation in rocky desertification areas another interesting finding was that compared to the influence of the biomass of pine needles the air temperature had a lower influence on evaporation loss table 4 it can be speculated in this study that forest litter should play a certain role in resisting the negative influences of global warming on forest hydrology this interesting finding should be confirmed in the future in addition the results in this paper also showed that moss crust had a minor effect on increasing the soil temperature while the pine needle cover had a stronger effect on limiting the temperature changes in the soil table 4 figs 5 and 6 moreover limiting drastic fluctuations in soil temperature is conducive to seed germination ooi et al 2012 the woodland and meadow vegetation in the karst mountainous areas have been substantially improved in recent decades brandt et al 2018 nevertheless the rocky desertification problem easily rebounded by human land conflicts and fragile ecosystems in this study the forest litter was very effective in maintaining the temperature and humidity in the karst mountainous areas therefore a possible measurement i e artificially cultivated biocrusts and midwifed forest litter was inspired by these results to prevent and control rocky desertification however such studies are rarely reported despite the efforts made in these experiments there are some limitations that need to be addressed in the future although these indoor experiments were subjected to sharp diurnal temperature and humidity fluctuations they were not subject to some climatological variables such as wind that could be relevant under field conditions the laboratory scale results also require confirmation by field studies the experimental results obtained during multiple local studies need to be integrated and extrapolated to ecosystem and global scales bettina et al 2016 in addition carbonate derived laterite has a special dilation shrinkage characteristic which is different from other derived laterites and not typical of dilative soils liao et al 2000 there was a clear distinction between the dry season and the rainy season in southwest china liu et al 2015 the dilation shrinkage characteristics were enhanced in these meteorological conditions leading to the formation of fractures in the soils therefore the effects of biocrust and littler on the interaction between soil evaporation and the formation of fractures in soils should be investigated in the future biocrusts and litter can naturally develop or recover after disturbance and their biomass should be dynamic in this study the different developmental stages of biocrusts and litter were simulated by using the different biomasses of biocrusts and litter although the influences of biomass on soil evaporation can be reflected by this method the scientific knowledge is still far from closing the overall cycles i e growing and decaying of vegetation seasonally some studies have shown that above a certain coverage i e 60 or 75 the biocrust did not reduce the evaporation rate harper and marble 1988 berdugo et al 2014 in our study the moss coverage was not raised to such a high value 40 and thus our conclusions have certain limitations as the moss coverage was high moreover it should be noted that only hypnum hedw and pine needle effects were investigated in this work actually the hypnum hedw has nearly 43 species worldwide there are 18 species and 1 subspecies recorded in guizhou province southwest china xiong 2014 different types of moss crust can affect evaporation directly by their various compositions and structures including swelling upon wetting which modifies microtopography exopolysaccharide eps production hydrophobicity and the efficiency of harvesting dew maphangwa et al 2012 tao and zhang 2012 the effects of litter crusts mixed with different species on litter structure and the movement of water within the litter crusts should be considered liu et al 2019 more experiments on the effects of different biocrusts and litters should be performed in karst mountainous lands we expect that an interdisciplinary and global team including hydrologists biologists and soil scientists could be extremely helpful to solve the above key scientific problems and future research challenges 5 conclusions the ground cover effect on evaporation processes was explored differentiating the effects of biocrust moss crusts and litter cover pine needles in karst mountainous lands the influences of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation losses and surface temperatures were estimated by using four moss crust biomass levels 0 0 32 0 64 and 0 96 kg m 2 and three pine needle biomass levels 0 0 32 and 0 64 kg m 2 in addition the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles were also assessed the main results showed that the effects of moss crusts on evaporation rates were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles while the effects of pine needles on evaporation rates were not largely affected by the moss crusts the pine needles had a much larger negative effect on the evaporation rate pr 0 41 compared to that of the moss crusts pr 0 13 thermal signatures showed that the pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature pr 0 50 compared to that of the moss crusts pr 0 17 the pine needles were very effective in containing the temperature and humidity in the karst mountainous areas finally there was a significant relationship between the value of ebare soil e0 and the mean soil water content swcmean for bare soils the predictive ability of the one parameter concept weighted average vegetation coefficient kc was slightly better than that of the double parameter concept moss crust

5473,soil water vegetation interactions have been a research topic for decades landscape patterns can be shaped by soil water availability and in reverse the effects of subsurface flow on the soil water vegetation interactions are relatively less studied than the surface flow especially in the semiarid region this work is focused on how the larch larix principis rupprechtti interacted with soil water and how the convex pattern of the larch was formed along the stony soil slope in the semiarid loess plateau northwest china the soil water balance equation in soil water assessment tool swat was modified to include subsurface flow exchange between two adjacent hydrologic response units hrus the slope was then delineated into adjacent hrus to understand the hydrologic and ecological processes inside the slope the modified swat model on the slope was calibrated and validated by the field data the model was forced by a 55 year meteorological data series to investigate the larch soil water interactions and the formation of the convex distribution pattern over long term it is found that the subsurface flow has shaped the convex distribution of vegetation lai along the slope the subsurface flow occurs due to relatively high permeability of the stony soil and it affects the heterogeneities of soil water availability through the soil water storage capacity the concave spatial pattern of the soil water stress determines the vegetation growth along the slope in this semiarid region these understandings provide new knowledge about the influences of hydrological processes on vegetation distribution patterns along a slope which is useful in vegetation management under similar conditions keywords soil water vegetation interactions soil water availability subsurface flow loess plateau swat 1 introduction soil water and vegetation two critical subjects in the terrestrial ecosystem are closely associated through complex interactions and feedbacks the soil water availability controls vegetation spatial distribution patterns and dynamics alamusa et al 2017 duniway et al 2010 liu et al 2016 in turn vegetation affects the soil water balance through processes including interception transpiration and root uptake fan et al 2015a fan et al 2015c martens et al 2017 mei et al 2018 potts et al 2010 soil water is the main source of vegetation maintenance and growth asbjornsen et al 2011 sufficient soil water supply may maintain the good growth status whereas a shortage of soil water may impose stress on plant growth resulting in reduced growth e g leaf area index lai accordingly barkaoui et al 2016 consequently the energy interception may decrease and thus reduce the root water uptake the interactions between soil water and vegetation determine their spatial distributions and are affected by the overall effects of climate soil and topography climate is a fundamental factor to drive the soil water dynamics and vegetation distribution jin et al 2018 li et al 2013 zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 it was pointed out that the spatial distribution of soil water is dominantly influenced by lateral water movements i e nonlocal controls under wet conditions whereas under dry conditions soil water distribution is mainly controlled by vertical flux i e local controls grayson et al 1997 ridolfi 2003 confirmed such a phenomenon by showing that under humid condition mean annual precipitation map 1900 mm the soil water has significant spatial gradient with sufficient subsurface flow under dry condition map 480 mm soil water lacks spatial variations due to the negligible subsurface flow movement however some studies have recognized that lateral water flux also plays a vital role in shaping soil water availability in dryland ecosystems ludwig et al 2005 mayor et al 2019 wilcox and newman 2005 yu et al 2008 soil textures and their influences on soil water variations have been studied intensively fernandez illescas

hydraulic conductivity gaur and mohanty 2013 such differences in soil characteristics influence the soil water movement and soil water stress which may limit vegetation growth fernandez illescas et al 2001 larger porosity and higher water conductivity exert positive effects on lateral and vertical water movement in the soil profile beven and germann 2013 lin 2006 ridolfi et al 2003 studies showed that under same humid condition soil water is more spatially organized under loamy sand than loam with saturated water conductivity of approximately 1000 cm day and 200 cm day respectively ridolfi et al 2003 in rocky mountain areas of semiarid arid loess plateau map 420 mm stony soil distributes in areas accounting for approximately 13 of the total area shao 2010 shi et al 2008 in comparison with loess stony soil has larger porosity and higher water conductivity wang et al 2011 such relatively permeable soil in combination with low permeable bedrock would lead to lateral subsurface flow that cannot be overlooked zhu and lin 2009 investigating the influence of lateral water movement on soil water spatial variations under such conditions is beneficial for understanding associated ecohydrological processes and vegetation management in mountain areas in mountain areas the topography is a critical factor in shaping spatial patterns of soil water and vegetation gaur and mohanty 2013 tague et al 2009 hillslope is a fundamental block and a basic unit for many land surface processes in mountain areas liao et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 topography has been indicated to have a predominant role in determining spatial patterns of soil water on a slope under humid condition famiglietti et al 1998 gaur and mohanty 2013 western and grayson 1998 western et al 1999 the convergence of redistributed runoff downward from the uphill part of the slope is an important reason for higher soil water content at the downhill part kim and mohanty 2016 lin 2006 such hydrological connectivity on soil water budget and then vegetation growth has been intensively studied using mathematical approaches in hydrological models including soil and water assessment tool swat topmodel regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys and community land model clm kim and mohanty 2016 kotikian et al 2019 ondo et al 2017 tague and band 2004 most of such studies have been conducted in relatively humid regions with map 800 mm gaur and mohanty 2013 kim and mohanty 2016 ondo et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 as compared to those in semiarid and arid regions e g yu et al 2008 in previous pieces of research work the redistribution of runoff and its effects on soil and vegetation variations within the slope were not discussed adequately because they focused more on surface runoff redistribution and its effects golden et al 2014 ludwig et al 2005 magliano et al 2015 yu et al 2008 and relatively less on the subsurface flow a notable exception was conducted by ridolfi et al 2003 who demonstrated the influences of subsurface flow in determining the spatial patterns of soil water however the vegetation was assumed to be uniform spatially and invariant temporally in the study area which led to the exclusion of interactions between spatial soil water dynamics and vegetation evolution therefore the subsurface flow redistribution and its effects on the spatial patterns of soil water and vegetation interactions along a slope under dry conditions are still needed to be addressed in this study a stony slope covered with larch larix principis rupprechtti was selected in semiarid loess plateau northwestern china the mathematical modeling approaches were applied to answer the following questions quantitatively 1 how does water yield especially subsurface flow vary and redistribute along the slope 2 how do the soil water vegetation and their interactions vary along the slope and 3 how does subsurface flow redistribution affect the spatial patterns of soil water and vegetation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the diediegou watershed northern liupan mountains 106 4 55 106 9 15 e 35 54 12 35 58 33 n in ningxia province northwest

county ningxia hui autonomous region china 106 27 e 36 00 n 1753 m show that the map is 468 126 5 mm 1961 2015 approximately 72 of the total precipitation occurs from june to september the mean annual temperature is 6 6 0 8 c for the same period the watershed covers an area of 25 4 km2 with elevations ranging from 1976 m to 2588 m fig 1 b the bedrock is mainly composed of sandy mudstone and calcareous shale tian et al 2017 which limit water permeation in the watershed natural forests had been replaced by plantations since the 1980s li et al 2017 the larch larix principis rupprechtii one of the dominant afforestation types distributes mainly on semi shady northwest and northeast facing and shady north facing slopes wang et al 2012 a representative northwest facing nw 30 stony hillslope was selected the hillslope is planted with larch aged 30 years since 1987 the elevation and horizontal length of the slope is 124 m and 264 m respectively fig 1 c six experimental plots 20 20 m were established at the top t upper u mid upper mu middle m mid down md and down d positions along the slope fig 1 d the characteristics of each plot are listed in table 1 2 2 field observations soil properties and plant lai were measured in all of the six plots measurements of soil water soil water potential and volumetric soil water content and terms related to evapotranspiration throughfall stemflow sapflow and evapotranspiration from the understory were undertaken in the plots u m and d 2 2 1 climate the metrological data including precipitation mm wind speed m s temperature c relative humidity and solar radiation w m 2 were observed using an automatic weather station weatherhawk usa from 2015 to 2016 the station was installed in an open area 100 m away from the slope the data were recorded every five minutes by a data logger type dl6 delta t uk 2 2 2 soils in the plots u m and d soil water potential and volumetric soil water content were measured during the growing seasons april to october in 2015 and 2016 soil water potential ψ kpa was measured automatically using the equilibrium tensiometers eq15 ecomatik germany which were installed in soil layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm respectively the soil water potential was recorded by a data logger type dl6 delta t uk at a time interval of five minutes the volumetric soil water content of the soil layers was measured once a week using the time domain reflectometer tdr type trime t2 germany in the six plots the soil properties including saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat porosity n and field capacity θfc were measured from the field samples in the laboratory the undisturbed soil samples were collected using a cutting ring 100 cm3 from three soil profiles at the center of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers in each experimental plot along the slope n and θfc were measured by the soaking method ksat was determined by the double ring infiltration method with constant water head wang 2016 soil depth was measured using soil auger 5 cm in diameter at five points selected according to the five plot sampling method in each plot zhao et al 2019 the average of the measurements at the five points was taken as the soil depth of the plot 2 2 3 throughfall stemflow sapflow and evapotranspiration from the understory in order to estimate the canopy interception of rainfall the throughfall was measured after each rainfall event using twelve standard rain gauges 20 cm in diameter and 70 cm in height the gauges were evenly arranged into four rows and three columns in the plot the measured throughfall volumes ml of rain gauges were averaged and then converted into throughfall depth mm of the plot liu et al 2018 the stemflow was also measured five representative trees were selected by their diameter at the breast height dbh for measurement representing the trees with varying dbh in the plot a spiral type stemflow collector made of rubber hose was used to collect the stemflow fan et al 2015a the collector was wrapped around the trunk with three loops collecting the flow along the stem and then draining the water into a plastic bucket 25 l in volume for measurement the stemflow of five trees was then upscaled to plot based on the dbh classes and plot area fan et al 2015b fan et al 2014 sapflow was measured to estimate transpiration of the trees in the plot for the six plots three to five trees were selected with consideration of their dbh on each tree four thermal diffusion probes sf l ecomatik germany were installed to measure sapflow density two probes were installed vertically at approximately 1 3 m aboveground on the tree trunk another two probes were installed in line with the upper probe at left and right sides respectively the data was automatically collected at a five minute interval then the tree level sapflow density was upscaled to plot level daily transpiration based on the sapwood area and plot area li et al 2017

lai was measured in the six plots using lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor company usa during the growing season from 2015 to 2016 the measurements were taken at an interval varying from half a month to a month in each plot the measurements were undertaken at eleven points diagonally for each point the measurements were repeated three times the direct measurements were then calibrated by a factor the average of the measurements at the eleven points was taken as the plant lai of the plot 2 3 mathematical approaches the model used in this study is basically swat soil water and assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 swat is a physically based and distributed watershed scale hydrological model that has been applied to ranges of climate vegetation soil and management practices francesconi et al 2016 the hydrological response unit hru is the key for dealing with the spatial heterogeneities of climate soil vegetation and topography in swat the swat model assumes that there was no exchange of mass between adjacent hrus however when spatial variability of the hydrological and biological processes and their interactions are to be addressed along a slope delineation of a slope into hrus and hydrological connections between two adjacent ones are necessary in the following subsections a full set of mathematical equations is given tentatively for an overall picture of the modified swat model for the vegetation soil interactions at slope scale although the descriptions of plant growth and stress indices seems repetitive to the descriptions in the swat documents neitsch et al 2011 the descriptions will emphasize 1 delineation of the slope into hrus 2 modified soil water balance equation of hru with lateral inflow and outflow included 2 3 1 hydrological response units hrus the study slope is treated as a small catchment spatial heterogeneities of topography soil and plant along the slope were treated by the hrus the slope can be delineated into adjacent vertical columns in fig 2 the top of the column is the ground surface while the bottom is the bedrock and each column is called an hru the study slope has a horizontal distance from the top to bottom of 264 m thus is divided into 66 adjacent hrus the hrus have the same horizontal width of 4 m and varying depths to the impermeable bedrock the experimental plots and the hrus they contain are depicted in fig 2 the soil depth of each hru within a plot was assumed equivalent to the measured soil depth of the plot for the hru out of the plots their soil depth was assumed as the mean of the two adjacent plots within a plot the soil properties of each hru were assumed the same as the measurements the soil properties below the depth of 60 cm down to the rock were not measured and assumed similar to those in the layer 40 60 cm for each hru for each hru the soil profile was divided into a sequence of layers from ground surface to the bedrock the values of 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm in 0 10 cm 10 100 cm and 100 200 cm were used to delineate the soil profile into layers for all of the hrus the soil layers with the same sequential layer number had the same thickness furthermore the two adjacent hrus were hydrologically connected through both surface and subsurface flow an individual hru might receive flow from its upper neighboring hru and release flow to its lower neighboring hru the subsurface flow was assumed to move between two adjacent hrus at the soil layers with the same sequential number 2 3 2 hydrological processes 2 3 2 1 water balance in a hru water balance in each layer of a hru is expressed as

θfc θwp and θ within soil profiles are required to simulate the water movement parameters ksat n and θfc were set based on the data acquired from observations in layers of 0 60 cm soil profile for hrus of the six plots soil characteristic curves were derived from the observed volumetric soil water content and soil water potential values the power function proposed by gardner et al 1970a 1970b were used to fit the observed data the optimized constants in the power function for each soil layer in the plots u m and d are listed in table s1 parameter θwp and θ for soil layers in each plot were derived from the curves at soil water potential of 1 5 mpa and 0 03 mpa respectively these values were used as a reference for the parameter calibration and validation the value of cn required to calculate surface runoff was set uniformly for all hrus under the condition of well grown forest grass combination and fair ability of runoff generation according to the referenced value proposed in neitsch et al 2011 2 4 1 2 plant the potentially maximum lai laimax represents the lai under no stress for a specie in the study region vegetation grows strongest in the mid term of the growing season july august and lai reaches its highest the lai of larch in the mid term of the growing season along the studied slope was obtained from both observations and references the lai of larch ranges between approximately 1 2 3 9 therefore the laimax was set to be 4 0 for all hrus along the slope the root depth zroot was set identically to the soil thickness along the slope the parameter c in eq 16 was set to ensure that 75 and 90 of the fine root accumulated in 0 60 and 0 100 cm soil profiles respectively 100 of fine root distributed within the soil profile in hrus with soil thickness smaller than 100 cm thus the c is 1 3 1 3 2 8 3 5 4 0 4 5 for plots t u mu m md and d 2 4 2 efficiency evaluation the soil water storage of 0 60 cm in plots u m and d were used as the primary target for the model parameter calibration and validation in addition plot evapotranspiration and lai data were used to evaluate the model performance during calibration and validation plot evapotranspiration was the added sum of transpiration estimated from the sapflow evaporation of the canopy interception estimated from the residue of gross precipitation with the throughfall and stemflow removed liu et al 2018 and understory evapotranspiration estimated from the micro lysimeter measurements during the calibration and validation the simulated values for each hru of plots u m

optimum very good good and satisfied respectively whereas nse 0 5 means unsatisfied simulated results moriasi et al 2007 2 5 long term simulation and analysis a long term simulation was conducted to get an insight view of the interrelationships between vegetation features and soil water along the hillslope under different climatic conditions 2 5 1 climate data and initial soil profile condition daily metrological data 1961 2015 at the national metrological station at guyuan from national metrological information center http data cma cn was used to drive the simulation the data series include precipitation maximum air temperature mean air temperature minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed pressure and solar radiation the annual precipitation ranges from 282 mm to 856 mm with a mean of 468 mm the large variation of the annual precipitation indicates that the dry and wet years were covered in this series the long term run required the initial condition of the soil profile it was assumed that the soil profiles were at field capacity indicating no soil water stress at the initial stage 2 5 2 analysis of the output the long term simulation generated hydrological and biological variables for each hru at a daily time step statistical analysis of simulation output was performed to address the temporal and spatial patterns of variables along the slope water yield and components the water yield surface flow subsurface flow and deep seepage varies spatially along the slope the water yield coefficient defined as the ratio of water yield to precipitation at the same period feng et al 2016 was calculated at each plot to reveal the spatial pattern of the water yield for each plot along the slope the surface flow qsurf and subsurface flow qlat were s and l from the most right hru of the plot the deep seepage qsep was the sum of d from the bottom soil layers of hrus of the plot for each plot subsurface inflow and outflow were defined as the l entered into the most left hru and ran out of the most right hru of the plot respectively a net gain of subsurface flow defined as the difference of inflow and outflow was calculated and its spatial pattern over long term was thus revealed statistically soil water temporal dynamics and spatial variations of soil water availability directly influence the vegetation growth along the slope the rew defined as the fraction of extractable water was used as an index to represent the soil water availability it is calculated as li et al 2017 37 rew θ θ wp θ fc θ wp vegetation characteristics vegetation growth was characterized by lai for each plot the lai was the mean of hrus in the plot water stress indices the swstress calculated according to the equation 34 was applied to reflect the effect of soil water limitation on vegetation growth the value of swstress ranges from 0 to 1 and a lower swstress represents slighter water stress 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation were conducted using a two year simulation based on approaches described in section 2 3 figs 3 5 display the comparisons of simulated soil water storage actual evapotranspiration and lai to measured values during the growing season from 2015 to 2016 at plots u m and d the simulated soil water storage showed similar dynamics to observations with the nse and r 2 ranging from 0 73 to 0 91 and 0 59 to 0 77 for plots u m and d respectively fig 3 the nse and r 2 of actual evapotranspiration ranges from 0 84 to 0 88 and 0 84 to 0 89 for plots u m and d respectively fig 4 in addition the simulated vegetation lai abruptly captured the seasonal variations of vegetation growth in different plots u m d fig 5 the results indicated that the model performed good in reconstructing the key hydrological processes i e soil water fluctuations and evapotranspiration and vegetation features along the slope the optimized key hydraulic parameters set is listed in table 2 3 2 subsurface flow and soil water along the slope 3 2 1 water yield and subsurface flow during the growing season the mean water yield coefficient showed significant variations in inter annual and spatial distributions fig 6 a inter annually the water yield coefficient changed remarkably with precipitation the coefficient of variation cv ranged from 0 32 to 0 79 for different plots along the slope generally larger than that of precipitation 0 28 spatially the water yield coefficient decreased exponentially downward the slope t to d ranging from 0 263 to 0 027 at the outlet of the slope the mean water yield coefficient was 0 027 which could be considered as the water yield capacity of the slope among the water yield components the subsurface flow was dominant fig 6 b at the top the subsurface flow was 65 of the water yield however downward the slope it was more than 90 3 2 2 subsurface inflow to a hru in this case study of slope hydrology and its interactions with the vegetation changes the contribution of subsurface flow to soil water was one of the focused points for a hru the input to soil water includes infiltration from the ground surface and lateral inflow from its upper hru an index k defined as the ratio of subsurface inflow to infiltration was used to represent their relative importance to the soil water it was found that the mean value of k showed a convex shape along the slope peaking at the plot m fig 7 for the plot t the subsurface inflow was assumed as zero for other plots the subsurface flow was not more than one third of the infiltration indicating that the infiltration dominated the supply to soil water along the slope inflow to the soil water column of a hru either the infiltration or the subsurface flow left the soil column partially through evapotranspiration and percolation and partially through the subsurface flow into the next neighboring hru the net gain either positive or negative of subsurface flow for a hru needs to be discussed when the importance of subsurface flow contribution to soil water is addressed 3 2 3 subsurface flow contribution to soil water the net gain of subsurface flow for a hru is defined as the difference between the inflow and outflow a negative net gain means more subsurface flow leaves than flows into the hru however a positive net gain means the subsurface flow contributes to the water consumption by the evapotranspiration as well as the percolation changes of the net gain from plot t to d along the slope are depicted in fig 8 downward the slope both the inflow and outflow increased first until the middle part of the slope and then decreased the outflow decreased more quickly than inflow as a result the negative net gain turned into positive at the plot mu quantitatively on an average of 55 years the net release of subsurface flow at plot t reached as high as 78 mm yr the net use of subsurface flow at the bottom plot was 3 5 mm yr generally the net gain of subsurface flow had a remarkable increase downward the slope and peaked in plot m increasing net gain of the subsurface flow might attribute to the increasing soil water storage capacity downward the slope on the upper slope the soil was thin and its soil water storage capacity was small infiltration and subsurface flow occurred during the rainfall events and decayed quickly with time the infiltrated water filled the soil to field capacity at first and the extra water left the soil column as lateral flow or percolation under the semiarid condition depletion of the soil water leaves space for storing the infiltration and subsurface flow from upper hru the thicker the soil is the more space for the storage and the less subsurface flow leaves the hru higher use of the subsurface flow at the middle of the slope indicated by a mean net gain of 8 7 mm yr might imply a better vegetation status there 3 3 soil water soil water is a key variable in soil water and vegetation interactions soil water balance is influenced by lateral subsurface flux and vertical infiltration in turn soil water availability directly limits vegetation lai and evapotranspiration the effect of soil water on vegetation growth differs spatially and temporally due to heterogeneities of soil water availability along the slope the mean rew over the soil profile during the growing season was higher with less variations at the plot m than elsewhere along the slope fig 9 this was resulted from the joint effects of infiltration the net gain of subsurface flow and the soil water storage capacity although the soil water storage capacity increased with soil thickness downward the slope the water supply overpasses the storage capacity at some places of the slope which was indicated as the plot m in this case study the water supply was primarily limited by the annual precipitation under such a semiarid climate within the soil profile the distribution of the rew results from the soil water supply and root water uptake from the standpoint of water supply the soil water profiles were determined by the infiltration depth and amount the maximum infiltration depth varied for each rainfall event depending upon the antecedent soil water content hydraulic conductivity and the precipitation amount statistically the maximum infiltration depth might get as deep as 200 cm with a mean of 18 cm the deeper the soil is the less possibly the soil water is replenished vegetation uptakes water from the deeper soil as well especially when the soil water in the upper soil cannot meet with its demand the combined effects of limited replenishment and root uptake from the deep soil resulted in a decreasing mean rew with increasing soil depth fig 10 it was also noticed that the mean rew tended to increase with soil depth deeper than 160 cm this was probably because of very weak uptake due to very low root length density 3 4 soil water and plant interactions evapotranspiration eta is the most important water loss in soil water balance and is controlled by multiple factors zhang et al 2019 transpiration is an essential component of the eta in forest land 45 58 it is constrained by soil water availability i e rew both temporally and spatially from april to june fast increasing evapotranspiration and insufficient precipitation led to continuous consumption of soil water reduced soil water availability progressively limited transpiration with soil water replenished due to adequate rainfall the soil water stress declined gradually during the mid term of the growing season june august fig 11 a spatially the swstress formed a concave pattern along the slope with its lowest in plot m fig 11 b controlled by soil water availability mean vegetation lai during the growing season was convexly organized from the tophill to the foothill the mean lai over the growing season increased from 0 83 in plot t to 2 34 in plot m and then decreased to lower than 2 2 in plots md and d fig 12 seasonally the lai increased sharply in the early stage april may then increased slower until peaked in mid july and after that started to decrease to the end of the growing season thus although lai had similar spatial patterns along the slope in different months during the growing season the variations among plots differed in different growing stages the difference was larger in the mid stage due to stronger vegetation growth than in the early stage and the late stage september october 4 discussions the results reveal how the convex distribution of vegetation lai is shaped along the slope it is due to spatial variations of the subsurface flow and the soil water storage capacity and thus the soil water availability to vegetation utilization under the semiarid climate in this study the high permeability of the stony soil allows the occurrence of subsurface flow the increasing soil thickness i e the soil water storage capacity enhances the interception of the subsurface flow from the upper slope however utilization of the subsurface flow reaches its peak somewhere at the middle slope although the lower slope has higher soil water storage capacity however this capacity is unable to be fulfilled due to the insufficient infiltration water amount and subsurface inflow in such a semiarid region the soil water stress to plant use and growth remains least in the middle slope when compared to other plots the higher lai of the vegetation means more transpiration i e more soil water depletion interactions between the soil water and plant shape the convex distribution of the lai with the highest lai occurring at the plot m along the slope eventually which is out of general expectations in a humid region the lateral movement of subsurface flow in unsaturated zones has been recognized as an important factor to influence soil water spatial patterns grayson et al 1997 lv et al 2013 perry and niemann 2007 the convergence of subsurface water flux from uphill is beneficial for soil water availability in the downhill plots monotonically increasing soil water content was attributed to subsurface flow on a planar hillslope with grass coverage and loamy soil under humid climate map 1900 mm through mathematical simulations ridolfi et al 2003 soil water shows a convex pattern along the studied slope in the semiarid region fig 9 this results from the combined effects of subsurface flow soil water storage and soil water depletion the relatively high permeability of the stony soil is the leading cause of the active subsurface flow under the semiarid climate subsurface flow and infiltration are the most important input components of soil water balance for an hru although the subsurface inflow is not more than one third of the infiltration fig 7 it plays a vital role in regulating the soil water availability and its convex pattern along the slope in a semiarid and arid region the ecological and hydrological systems are strongly coupled ludwig et al 2005 there are different sayings about the role of runoff in influencing the landscape patterns some studies indicated that the role of lateral flow including surface and subsurface flow is limited while infiltration is the dominant influencing factor grayson et al 1997 in investigating spatial variability of soil water along a slope ridolfi et al 2003 indicated that the subsurface flow plays a negligible role either however it was recognized that the banded and patchy landscape units and surface runoff interception are bilaterally enhanced indicating the importance of lateral distribution of surface runoff in shaping landscape pattern ludwig et al 2005 mayor et al 2019 reid et al 1999 wilcox and newman 2005 yu et al 2008 the present study reveals the importance of subsurface flow in shaping the landscape pattern in the semiarid region at the middle plot with the largest net gain of subsurface flow soil water availability rew is the highest and most stable over the long period figs 9 and 10 resulting in the lowest soil water stress fig 11 this provided the most favorable soil water environment for vegetation growth thus the highest vegetation lai fig 12 the soil water balance equation is modified to include the subsurface flow exchange between adjacent units based on the methods used in the swat model the swat model has been proved useful for a broad range of climate topography soil and vegetation conditions around the world francesconi et al 2016 it should be pointed out that the upward flux due to soil water potential differences between lower and upper soil layers is neglected in the simulation this is a weakness of the soil water balance approach when applied to simulate the soil water dynamics over soil profile this may result in an underestimation of soil water in the upper layers when the potential upward flow from the lower layers exists as a consequence the root uptake in the upper layers may be underestimated in this study it is found that soil water content in the lower layers remains in a relatively low state over the long term so the upward flux might not be a significant component a richard s equation may help to resolve this issue however it is more complicated in the numerical scheme and requires extensive data 5 summary delineation of a slope into different hrus helped to reveal the variations of both ecological and hydrological variables inside this was achieved through the modification of the soil water balance equation by including the subsurface flow exchange between adjacent hrus in the swat model it is found that the subsurface flow forces to shape the convex distribution of vegetation lai along the slope the subsurface flow occurs due to relatively permeable stony soil it affects the spatial variability of soil water availability through the soil water storage capacity and soil water stress on vegetation growth as a consequence the findings of the current study give new knowledge about the effects of subsurface flow redistribution on soil water availability and vegetation distribution patterns along the slope in the semiarid region it is suggested that the soil water and vegetation interactions could be studied with regard to different vegetation types soil properties and their combinations under influences of topography and precipitation to draw an overall picture in

5473,soil water vegetation interactions have been a research topic for decades landscape patterns can be shaped by soil water availability and in reverse the effects of subsurface flow on the soil water vegetation interactions are relatively less studied than the surface flow especially in the semiarid region this work is focused on how the larch larix principis rupprechtti interacted with soil water and how the convex pattern of the larch was formed along the stony soil slope in the semiarid loess plateau northwest china the soil water balance equation in soil water assessment tool swat was modified to include subsurface flow exchange between two adjacent hydrologic response units hrus the slope was then delineated into adjacent hrus to understand the hydrologic and ecological processes inside the slope the modified swat model on the slope was calibrated and validated by the field data the model was forced by a 55 year meteorological data series to investigate the larch soil water interactions and the formation of the convex distribution pattern over long term it is found that the subsurface flow has shaped the convex distribution of vegetation lai along the slope the subsurface flow occurs due to relatively high permeability of the stony soil and it affects the heterogeneities of soil water availability through the soil water storage capacity the concave spatial pattern of the soil water stress determines the vegetation growth along the slope in this semiarid region these understandings provide new knowledge about the influences of hydrological processes on vegetation distribution patterns along a slope which is useful in vegetation management under similar conditions keywords soil water vegetation interactions soil water availability subsurface flow

growth asbjornsen et al 2011 sufficient soil water supply may maintain the good growth status whereas a shortage of soil water may impose stress on plant growth resulting in reduced growth e g leaf area index lai accordingly barkaoui et al 2016 consequently the energy interception may decrease and thus reduce the root water uptake the interactions between soil water and vegetation determine their spatial distributions and are affected by the overall effects of climate soil and topography climate is a fundamental factor to drive the soil water dynamics and vegetation distribution jin et al 2018 li et al 2013 zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 it was pointed out that the spatial distribution of soil water is dominantly influenced by lateral water movements i e nonlocal controls under wet conditions whereas under dry conditions soil water distribution is mainly controlled by vertical flux i e local controls grayson et al 1997 ridolfi 2003 confirmed such a phenomenon by showing that under humid condition mean annual precipitation map 1900 mm the soil water has significant spatial gradient with sufficient subsurface flow under dry condition map 480 mm soil water lacks spatial variations due to the negligible subsurface flow movement however some studies have recognized that lateral water flux also plays a vital role in shaping soil water availability in dryland ecosystems ludwig et al 2005 mayor et al 2019 wilcox and newman 2005 yu et al 2008 soil textures and their influences on soil water variations have been studied intensively fernandez illescas

loess stony soil has larger porosity and higher water conductivity wang et al 2011 such relatively permeable soil in combination with low permeable bedrock would lead to lateral subsurface flow that cannot be overlooked zhu and lin 2009 investigating the influence of lateral water movement on soil water spatial variations under such conditions is beneficial for understanding associated

of redistributed runoff downward from the uphill part of the slope is an important reason for higher soil water content at the downhill part kim and mohanty 2016 lin 2006 such hydrological connectivity on soil water budget and then vegetation growth has been intensively studied using mathematical approaches in hydrological models including soil and water assessment tool swat topmodel regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys and community land model clm kim and mohanty 2016 kotikian et al 2019 ondo et al 2017 tague and band 2004 most of such studies have been conducted in relatively humid regions with map 800 mm gaur and mohanty 2013 kim and mohanty 2016 ondo et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 as compared to those in semiarid and arid regions e g yu et al 2008 in previous pieces of research work the redistribution of runoff and its effects on soil and vegetation variations within the slope were not discussed adequately because they focused more on surface runoff redistribution and its effects golden et al 2014 ludwig et al 2005 magliano et al 2015 yu et al 2008 and relatively less on the subsurface flow a notable exception was conducted by ridolfi et al 2003 who demonstrated the influences of subsurface flow in determining the spatial patterns of soil water however the vegetation was assumed to be uniform spatially and invariant temporally in the study area which led to the exclusion of interactions between spatial soil water dynamics and vegetation evolution therefore the subsurface flow redistribution and its effects on the spatial patterns of soil water and vegetation interactions along a slope under dry conditions are still needed to be addressed in this study a stony slope covered with larch larix principis rupprechtti was selected in semiarid loess plateau northwestern china the mathematical modeling approaches were applied to answer the following questions quantitatively 1 how does water yield especially subsurface flow vary and redistribute along the slope 2 how do the soil water vegetation and their interactions vary along the slope and 3 how does subsurface flow redistribution affect the spatial patterns of soil water and vegetation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the diediegou watershed northern liupan mountains 106 4 55 106 9 15 e 35 54 12 35 58 33 n in ningxia province northwest

the measured throughfall volumes ml of rain gauges were averaged and then converted into throughfall depth mm of the plot liu et al 2018 the stemflow was also measured five representative trees were selected by their diameter at the breast height dbh for measurement representing the trees with varying dbh in the plot a spiral type stemflow collector made of rubber hose was used to collect the stemflow fan et al 2015a the collector was wrapped around the trunk with three loops collecting the flow along the stem and then draining the water into a plastic bucket 25 l in volume for measurement the stemflow of five trees was then upscaled to plot based on the dbh classes and plot area fan et al 2015b fan et al 2014 sapflow was measured to estimate transpiration of the trees in the plot for the six plots three to five trees were selected with consideration of their dbh on each tree four thermal diffusion probes sf l ecomatik germany were installed to measure sapflow density two probes were installed vertically at approximately 1 3 m aboveground on the tree trunk another two probes were installed in line with the upper probe at left and right sides respectively the data was automatically collected at a five minute interval then the tree level sapflow density was upscaled to plot level daily transpiration based on the sapwood area and plot area li et al 2017

tool neitsch et al 2011 swat is a physically based and distributed watershed scale hydrological model that has been applied to ranges of climate vegetation soil and management practices francesconi et al 2016 the hydrological response unit hru is the key for dealing with the spatial heterogeneities of climate soil vegetation and topography in swat the swat model assumes that there was no exchange of mass between adjacent hrus however when spatial variability of the hydrological and biological processes and their interactions are to be addressed along a slope delineation of a slope into hrus and hydrological connections between two adjacent ones are necessary in the following subsections a full set of mathematical equations is given tentatively for an overall picture of the modified swat model for the vegetation soil interactions at slope scale although the descriptions of plant growth and stress indices seems repetitive to the descriptions in the swat documents neitsch et al 2011 the descriptions will emphasize 1 delineation of the slope into hrus 2 modified soil water balance equation of hru with lateral inflow and outflow included 2 3 1 hydrological response units hrus the study slope is treated as a small catchment spatial heterogeneities of topography soil and plant along the slope were treated by the hrus the slope can be delineated into adjacent vertical columns in fig 2 the top of the column is the ground surface while the bottom is the bedrock and each column is called an hru the study slope has a horizontal distance from the top to bottom of 264 m thus is divided into 66 adjacent hrus the hrus have the same horizontal width of 4 m and varying depths to the impermeable bedrock the experimental plots and the hrus they contain are depicted in fig 2 the soil depth of each hru within a plot was assumed equivalent to the measured soil depth of the plot for the hru out of the plots their soil depth was assumed as the mean of the two adjacent plots within a plot the soil properties of each hru were assumed the same as the measurements the soil properties below the depth of 60 cm down to the rock were not measured and assumed similar to those in the layer 40 60 cm for each hru for each hru the soil profile was divided into a sequence of layers from ground surface to the bedrock the values of 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm in 0 10 cm 10 100 cm and 100 200 cm were used to delineate the soil profile into layers for all of the hrus the soil layers with the same sequential layer number had the same thickness furthermore the two adjacent hrus were hydrologically connected through both surface and subsurface flow an individual hru might receive flow from its upper neighboring hru and release flow to its lower neighboring hru the subsurface flow was assumed to move between two adjacent hrus at the soil layers with the same sequential number 2 3 2 hydrological processes 2 3 2 1 water balance in a hru water balance in each layer of a hru is expressed as

θfc θwp and θ within soil profiles are required to simulate the water movement parameters ksat n and θfc were set based on the data acquired from observations in layers of 0 60 cm soil profile for hrus of the six plots soil characteristic curves were derived from the observed volumetric soil water content and soil water potential values the power function proposed by gardner et al 1970a 1970b were used to fit the observed data the optimized constants in the power function for each soil layer in the plots u m and d are listed in table s1 parameter θwp and θ for soil layers in each plot were derived from the curves at soil water potential of 1 5 mpa and 0 03 mpa respectively these values were used as a reference for the parameter calibration and validation the value of cn required to calculate surface runoff was set uniformly for all hrus under the condition of well grown forest grass combination and fair ability of runoff generation according to the referenced value proposed in neitsch et al 2011 2 4 1 2 plant the potentially maximum lai laimax represents the lai under no stress for a specie in the study region vegetation grows strongest in the mid term of the growing season july august and lai reaches its highest the lai of larch in the mid term of the growing season along the studied slope was obtained from both observations and references the lai of larch ranges between approximately 1 2 3 9 therefore the laimax was set to be 4 0 for all hrus along the slope the root depth zroot was set identically to the soil thickness along the slope the parameter c in eq 16 was set to ensure that 75 and 90 of the fine root accumulated in 0 60 and 0 100 cm soil profiles respectively 100 of fine root distributed within the soil profile in hrus with soil thickness smaller than 100 cm thus the c is 1 3 1 3 2 8 3 5 4 0 4 5 for plots t u mu m md and d 2 4 2 efficiency evaluation the soil water storage of 0 60 cm in plots u m and d were used as the primary target for the model parameter calibration and validation in addition plot evapotranspiration and lai data were used to evaluate the model performance during calibration and validation plot evapotranspiration was the added sum of transpiration estimated from the sapflow evaporation of the canopy interception estimated from the residue of gross precipitation with the throughfall and stemflow removed liu et al 2018 and understory evapotranspiration estimated from the micro lysimeter measurements during the calibration and validation the simulated values for each hru of plots u m

observation and simulation respectively q mean obs and q mean sim are mean of observed and simulated data respectively the range of r2 is 0 to 1 and closer to 1 means lower error between simulated results and observations generally the simulated results are acceptable when r2 greater than 0 5 nse ranges from to 1 nse 1 0 75 nse 1 0 6 nse 0 75 and 0 5 nse 0 6 indicate the simulated result are optimum very good good and satisfied respectively whereas nse 0 5 means unsatisfied simulated results moriasi et al 2007 2 5 long term simulation and analysis a long term simulation was conducted to get an insight view of the interrelationships between vegetation features and soil water along the hillslope under different climatic conditions 2 5 1 climate data and initial soil profile condition daily metrological data 1961 2015 at the national metrological station at guyuan from national metrological information center http data cma cn was used to drive the simulation the data series include precipitation maximum air temperature mean air temperature minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed pressure and solar radiation the annual precipitation ranges from 282 mm to 856 mm with a mean of 468 mm the large variation of the annual precipitation indicates that the dry and wet years were covered in this series the long term run required the initial condition of the soil profile it was assumed that the soil profiles were at field capacity indicating no soil water stress at the initial stage 2 5 2 analysis of the output the long term simulation generated hydrological and biological variables for each hru at a daily time step statistical analysis of simulation output was performed to address the temporal and spatial patterns of variables along the slope water yield and components the water yield surface flow subsurface flow and deep seepage varies spatially along the slope the water yield coefficient defined as the ratio of water yield to precipitation at the same period feng et al 2016 was calculated at each plot to reveal the spatial pattern of the water yield for each plot along the slope the surface flow qsurf and subsurface flow qlat were s and l from the most right hru of the plot the deep seepage qsep was the sum of d from the bottom soil layers of hrus of the plot for each plot subsurface inflow and outflow were defined as the l entered into the most left hru and ran out of the most right hru of the plot respectively a net gain of subsurface flow defined as the difference of inflow and outflow was calculated and its spatial pattern over long term was thus revealed statistically soil water temporal dynamics and spatial variations of soil water availability directly influence the vegetation growth along the slope the rew defined as the fraction of extractable water was used as an index to represent the soil water availability it is calculated as li et al 2017 37 rew θ θ wp θ fc θ wp vegetation characteristics vegetation growth was characterized by lai for each plot the lai was the mean of hrus in the plot water stress indices the swstress calculated according to the equation 34 was applied to reflect the effect of soil water limitation on vegetation growth the value of swstress ranges from 0 to 1 and a lower swstress represents slighter water stress 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation were conducted using a two year simulation based on approaches described in section 2 3 figs 3 5 display the comparisons of simulated soil water storage actual evapotranspiration and lai to measured values during the growing season from 2015 to 2016 at plots u m and d the simulated soil water storage showed similar dynamics to observations with the nse and r 2 ranging from 0 73 to 0 91 and 0 59 to 0 77 for plots u m and d respectively fig 3 the nse and r 2 of actual evapotranspiration ranges from 0 84 to 0 88 and 0 84 to 0 89 for plots u m and d respectively fig 4 in addition the simulated vegetation lai abruptly captured the seasonal variations of vegetation growth in different plots u m d fig 5 the results indicated that the model performed good in reconstructing the key hydrological processes i e soil water fluctuations and evapotranspiration and vegetation features along the slope the optimized key hydraulic parameters set is listed in table 2 3 2 subsurface flow and soil water along the slope 3 2 1 water yield and subsurface flow during the growing season the mean water yield coefficient showed significant variations in inter annual and spatial distributions fig 6 a inter annually the water yield coefficient changed remarkably with precipitation the coefficient of variation cv ranged from 0 32 to 0 79 for different plots along the slope generally larger than that of precipitation 0 28 spatially the water yield coefficient decreased exponentially downward the slope t to d ranging from 0 263 to 0 027 at the outlet of the slope the mean water yield coefficient was 0 027 which could be considered as the water yield capacity of the slope among the water yield components the subsurface flow was dominant fig 6 b at the top the subsurface flow was 65 of the water yield however downward the slope it was more than 90 3 2 2 subsurface inflow to a hru in this case study of slope hydrology and its interactions with the vegetation changes the contribution of subsurface flow to soil water was one of the focused points for a hru the input to soil water includes infiltration from the ground surface and lateral inflow from its upper hru an index k defined as the ratio of subsurface inflow to infiltration was used to represent their relative importance to the soil water it was found that the mean value of k showed a convex shape along the slope peaking at the plot m fig 7 for the plot t the subsurface inflow was assumed as zero for other plots the subsurface flow was not more than one third of the infiltration indicating that the infiltration dominated the supply to soil water along the slope inflow to the soil water column of a hru either the infiltration or the subsurface flow left the soil column partially through evapotranspiration and percolation and partially through the subsurface flow into the next neighboring hru the net gain either positive or negative of subsurface flow for a hru needs to be discussed when the importance of subsurface flow contribution to soil water is addressed 3 2 3 subsurface flow contribution to soil water the net gain of subsurface flow for a hru is defined as the difference between the inflow and outflow a negative net gain means more subsurface flow leaves than flows into the hru however a positive net gain means the subsurface flow contributes to the water consumption by the evapotranspiration as well as the percolation changes of the net gain from plot t to d along the slope are depicted in fig 8 downward the slope both the inflow and outflow increased first until the middle part of the slope and then decreased the outflow decreased more quickly than inflow as a result the negative net gain turned into positive at the plot mu quantitatively on an average of 55 years the net release of subsurface flow at plot t reached as high as 78 mm yr the net use of subsurface flow at the bottom plot was 3 5 mm yr generally the net gain of subsurface flow had a remarkable increase downward the slope and peaked in plot m increasing net gain of the subsurface flow might attribute to the increasing soil water storage capacity downward the slope on the upper slope the soil was thin and its soil water storage capacity was small infiltration and subsurface flow occurred during the rainfall events and decayed quickly with time the infiltrated water filled the soil to field capacity at first and the extra water left the soil column as lateral flow or percolation under the semiarid condition depletion of the soil water leaves space for storing the infiltration and subsurface flow from upper hru the thicker the soil is the more space for the storage and the less subsurface flow leaves the hru higher use of the subsurface flow at the middle of the slope indicated by a mean net gain of 8 7 mm yr might imply a better vegetation status there 3 3 soil water soil water is a key variable in soil water and vegetation interactions soil water balance is influenced by lateral subsurface flux and vertical infiltration in turn soil water availability directly limits vegetation lai and evapotranspiration the effect of soil water on vegetation growth differs spatially and temporally due to heterogeneities of soil water availability along the slope the mean rew over the soil profile during the growing season was higher with less variations at the plot m than elsewhere along the slope fig 9 this was resulted from the joint effects of infiltration the net gain of subsurface flow and the soil water storage capacity although the soil water storage capacity increased with soil thickness downward the slope the water supply overpasses the storage capacity at some places of the slope which was indicated as the plot m in this case study the water supply was primarily limited by the annual precipitation under such a semiarid climate within the soil profile the distribution of the rew results from the soil water supply and root water uptake from the standpoint of water supply the soil water profiles were determined by the infiltration depth and amount the maximum infiltration depth varied for each rainfall event depending upon the antecedent soil water content hydraulic conductivity and the precipitation amount statistically the maximum infiltration depth might get as deep as 200 cm with a mean of 18 cm the deeper the soil is the less possibly the soil water is replenished vegetation uptakes water from the deeper soil as well especially when the soil water in the upper soil cannot meet with its demand the combined effects of limited replenishment and root uptake from the deep soil resulted in a decreasing mean rew with increasing soil depth fig 10 it was also noticed that the mean rew tended to increase with soil depth deeper than 160 cm this was probably because of very weak uptake due to very low root length density 3 4 soil water and plant interactions evapotranspiration eta is the most important water loss in soil water balance and is controlled by multiple factors zhang et al 2019 transpiration is an essential component of the eta in forest land 45 58 it is constrained by soil water availability i e rew both temporally and spatially from april to june fast increasing evapotranspiration and insufficient precipitation led to continuous consumption of soil water reduced soil water availability progressively limited transpiration with soil water replenished due to adequate rainfall the soil water stress declined gradually during the mid term of the growing season june august fig 11 a spatially the swstress formed a concave pattern along the slope with its lowest in plot m fig 11 b controlled by soil water availability mean vegetation lai during the growing season was convexly organized from the tophill to the foothill the mean lai over the growing season increased from 0 83 in plot t to 2 34 in plot m and then decreased to lower than 2 2 in plots md and d fig 12 seasonally the lai increased sharply in the early stage april may then increased slower until peaked in mid july and after that started to decrease to the end of the growing season thus although lai had similar spatial patterns along the slope in different months during the growing season the variations among plots differed in different growing stages the difference was larger in the mid stage due to stronger vegetation growth than in the early stage and the late stage september october 4 discussions the results reveal how the convex distribution of vegetation lai is shaped along the slope it is due to spatial variations of the subsurface flow and the soil water storage capacity and thus the soil water availability to vegetation utilization under the semiarid climate in this study the high permeability of the stony soil allows the occurrence of subsurface flow the increasing soil thickness i e the soil water storage capacity enhances the interception of the subsurface flow from the upper slope however utilization of the subsurface flow reaches its peak somewhere at the middle slope although the lower slope has higher soil water storage capacity however this capacity is unable to be fulfilled due to the insufficient infiltration water amount and subsurface inflow in such a semiarid region the soil water stress to plant use and growth remains least in the middle slope when compared to other plots the higher lai of the vegetation means more transpiration i e more soil water depletion interactions between the soil water and plant shape the convex distribution of the lai with the highest lai occurring at the plot m along the slope eventually which is out of general expectations in a humid region the lateral movement of subsurface flow in unsaturated zones has been recognized as an important factor to influence soil water spatial patterns grayson et al 1997 lv et al 2013 perry and niemann 2007 the convergence of subsurface water flux from uphill is beneficial for soil water availability in the downhill plots monotonically increasing soil water content was attributed to subsurface flow on a planar hillslope with grass coverage and loamy soil under humid climate map 1900 mm through mathematical simulations ridolfi et al 2003 soil water shows a convex pattern along the studied slope in the semiarid region fig 9 this results from the combined effects of subsurface flow soil water storage and soil water depletion the relatively high permeability of the stony soil is the leading cause of the active subsurface flow under the semiarid climate subsurface flow and infiltration are the most important input components of soil water balance for an hru although the subsurface inflow is not more than one third of the infiltration fig 7 it plays a vital role in regulating the soil water availability and its convex pattern along the slope in a semiarid and arid region the ecological and hydrological systems are strongly coupled ludwig et al 2005 there are different sayings about the role of runoff in influencing the landscape patterns some studies indicated that the role of lateral flow including surface and subsurface flow is limited while infiltration is the dominant influencing factor grayson et al 1997 in investigating spatial variability of soil water along a slope ridolfi et al 2003 indicated that the subsurface flow plays a negligible role either however it was recognized that the banded and patchy landscape units and surface runoff interception are bilaterally enhanced indicating the importance of lateral distribution of surface runoff in shaping landscape pattern ludwig et al 2005 mayor et al 2019 reid et al 1999 wilcox and newman 2005 yu et al 2008 the present study reveals the importance of subsurface flow in shaping the landscape pattern in the semiarid region at the middle plot with the largest net gain of subsurface flow soil water availability rew is the highest and most stable over the long period figs 9 and 10 resulting in the lowest soil water stress fig 11 this provided the most favorable soil water environment for vegetation growth thus the highest vegetation lai fig 12 the soil water balance equation is modified to include the subsurface flow exchange between adjacent units based on the methods used in the swat model the swat model has been proved useful for a broad range of climate topography soil and vegetation conditions around the world francesconi et al 2016 it should be pointed out that the upward flux due to soil water potential differences between lower and upper soil layers is neglected in the simulation this is a weakness of the soil water balance approach when applied to simulate the soil water dynamics over soil profile this may result in an underestimation of soil water in the upper layers when the potential upward flow from the lower layers exists as a consequence the root uptake in the upper layers may be underestimated in this study it is found that soil water content in the lower layers remains in a relatively low state over the long term so the upward flux might not be a significant component a richard s equation may help to resolve this issue however it is more complicated in the numerical scheme and requires extensive data 5 summary delineation of a slope into different hrus helped to reveal the variations of both ecological and hydrological variables inside this was achieved through the modification of the soil water balance equation by including the subsurface flow exchange between adjacent hrus in the swat model it is found that the subsurface flow forces to shape the convex distribution of vegetation lai along the slope the subsurface flow occurs due to relatively permeable stony soil it affects the spatial variability of soil water availability through the soil water storage capacity and soil water stress on vegetation growth as a consequence the findings of the current study give new knowledge about the effects of subsurface flow redistribution on soil water availability and vegetation distribution patterns along the slope in the semiarid region it is suggested that the soil water and vegetation interactions could be studied with regard to different vegetation types soil properties and their combinations under influences of topography and precipitation to draw an overall picture in

5474,grace gravity recovery and climate experiment long term terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa is attributed to the complex interaction of climatic physical and anthropogenic drivers this paper therefore explores how different hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes interact and combine over space to produce the mass variations that grace twsa detects using the nile river basin nrb as a case study it explicitly analyzes nine hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes as well as their relationship to the twsa in different climatic zones the analytic method employed the long term trends derived for both the dependent twsa and independent explanatory variables via applying two geographically multiple regression gmr approaches i an ordinary least square regression ols model in which the contributions of all variables to twsa variability are deemed equal at all locations and ii a geographically weighted regression gwr which assigns a weight to each variable at different locations based on clustering occurrences the models efficacy was investigated using standard goodness of fit diagnostics the ols explains that the basin at large twsa spatial variability significantly attributed to five variables i e precipitation runoff surface water storage soil moisture storage and population density p 0 0001 the ols model however produced an r2 value of 0 14 with skewed standardized residuals in contrast the gwr model retained varying explanatory variables by different climate zone for instance the results showed that all nine variables contribute significantly with varying ranking to the trend in twsa in the tropical zone the evapotranspiration et and population density are the only significant variables in the semiarid zone population density contributes significantly to twsa variability in all zones the gwr model yielded r2 values with a median of 0 71 and normally distributed standard residuals to evaluate the robustness of the gwr approach the basin wide twsa pattern was simulated using the gwr model outputs herein the gwr highlights the importance of the spatial locations to attribute the spatial variability in grace tswa long term trends

velicogna et al 2014 sutterley et al 2014 as well as floods reager et al 2015 and droughts long et al 2014 ndehedehe et al 2016 nie et al 2017 sun et al 2018 all of the above applications could benefit from an improved understanding of how twsa varies over space and time in response to complex interactions among the major drivers and processes to date however effort in this regard has been focused on correlating grace twsa to a single or limited number of basin processes including precipitation swenson and wahr 2006 land surface model outputs döll et al 2014a ahmed et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 hasan et al 2019b hasan et al 2019c or climate forcing processes such as el niño southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod awange et al 2016 shamsudduha et al 2017 khaki et al 2018 furthermore much of the existing studies treat the basins as a single lumped unit or domain in reality however for most large basins such as the nile the processes that contribute to driving twsa exhibit extreme variations spatially in the nile basin for example average annual precipitation varies from over 1000 mm per year in the south to less than 100 mm per year in the arid region other variables such as runoff evapotranspiration and population density experience unique spatial variability furthermore at any given location some processes covary positively with twsa while others covary negatively that is the variables contributing to increasing trends twsa in one location may instead contribute to negative trends at other locations within the same basin finally both the number and combination of variables driving twsa as well as their relative importance also change significantly within the basin as a result for large drainage areas a basin wide averaged analysis of twsa and its drivers conceals considerable spatial variability that can inform planning or support refined modeling and analysis from an applied perspective using geospatial modeling to analyze and map the spatial patterns in twsa variations is critical for developing robust statistical models for reconstructing time series of proxy grace anomalies that predate the launch of the grace mission april 2002 as well as filling the record gap between grace and grace follow on grace fo mission additionally significantly improves our understanding of the hydroclimatic anthropogenic and biophysical processes and dynamics that impact twsa occurrence and variability at the intra basin scale such geospatial information is critical for planning and resource management in areas undergoing rapid population change and environmental stresses it is also useful for assessing the risk that different activities and processes pose individually or in different combinations to total water resources availability and change in this paper therefore we expand upon the framework established by current studies to investigate space time variations in twsa in response to major hydroclimatic biophysical and anthropogenic factors specifically we investigate within basin twsa variability in response to major drivers based on long term secular trends in both twsa and its drivers the secular trend component is a measure of the deterministic evolution or the rate of changes in the basin s freshwater availability over time previous research e g ahmed et al 2016 hasan et al 2019b hasan et al 2019c has also shown that the trend component expresses the dominant twsa variability across most of africa s large basins herein the analysis is accomplished via two geographically multiple regression gmr approaches the ordinary least square ols regression and a geographically weighted regression gwr modeling over the nile river basin nrb the ols model deemed to treat all variables equally at a different spatial location while the gwr assigns spatial weights to each variable based on the strength of the contribution of that variable to twsa at each location see section 2 3 3 nakaya 2001 fotheringham et al 2002 the utilized approaches significantly improve our understanding of the hydroclimatic anthropogenic and biophysical processes and dynamics that impact twsa occurrence and variability over space at the intra basin scale the paper is organized as follows following this introduction section 2 describes briefly the study area and highlighting its unique suitability for spatiotemporal analysis of tws it also introduces the utilized datasets see section 2 2 and methods utilized in section 2 3 section 3 presents the results and discusses their implications finally section 4 summarizes the importance of space domain analysis and the major findings from the study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area with total flow length approximately 6 700 km the nile is the longest river in the world the river has two major tributaries the white and blue niles other important tributaries include the sobat and bahr el jebel which flow into the white nile and the atbara river which joins the nile below the confluence of the white and blue niles fig 1 together these rivers drain a total basin area of 3 3 million square kilometers approximately 11 percent of africa s total landmass from south to north the basin traverses five bioclimatic zones namely tropical subtropical semiarid arid and mediterranean climate zone shahin 1985 collins 2002 the headwaters of the blue and atbara rivers originate in the subtropical mountain bioclimatic zone of ethiopia while the tropical bioclimatic zone forms the sobat and bahr el jebel sub basins precipitation and surface runoff patterns vary significantly across the basin in response to this climatic heterogeneity precipitation declines from over 1000 mm yr in the tropical regions in the headwaters of the white nile to less than 100 mm yr in the arid zone below the delta camberlin 2009 actual evapotranspiration et follows a similar pattern it exceeds 1000 mm yr in the tropical and subtropical zones but declines to less than 80 mm yr in the arid zone collins 2002 conway 2005 camberlin 2009 in contrast thepotential evapotranspiration pet grades in the opposite direction increasing from 1 100 mm yr in the tropical and subtropical zones to over 3 000 mm yr in the semiarid and arid zones as land surface temperature rises camberlin 2009 conway 2005 hasan et al 2015 2018 collins 2002 due to the above differences the nile basin has low runoff rates on average about 0 98 l s km2 moges and gebremichael 2014 senay et al 2014 hasan 2017 in terms of the human and political geography the nrb comprises 11 countries with a total population in 2012 of nearly 400 million oestigaard 2012 the basin s population is projected to reach 800 million by 2050 haub and kaneda 2019 the nile basin is a water conflict hotspot because of the multiplicity of countries with competing demands and conflicting priorities that share the basin gleick 1991 gleick 1994 schwartz and singh 1999 rapid population growth and devastating historical droughts compel upstream countries to exploit the nile s water resources to support ambitious development plans an example is thegrand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd on the blue nile basin bnb which will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in africa when it is completed yet egypt a downstream country depends on the nile more directly and intensely than any other country depends on any single resource conflict theorists postulate that such high dependence on a single resource increases the likelihood that a country might risk conflict or war to protect that resource ibrahim 2011 martens 2011 thus to both upstream and downstream countries the nile is critical to survival food security and development planning fortunately the countries in the region and the international community are keenly aware of these risks as a result the nile basin today has arguably more treaties governing its use than any other international river basin in the world wolf et al 2003 in support of these treaties numerous models and simulations of the basin s water resources continue to be developed and refined as knowledge of the water resources dynamics of the basin improves in summary the nrb is uniquely suited to analyze the space variability of twsa and its major spatial drivers due to its immense size extreme variability and heterogeneity the nile spans africa s most extensive mountain systems largest marshlands tropical rainforest and desert collins 2002 the nile s human geography is equally diverse it includes the highest population densities in africa e g the nile delta and floodplain in egypt as well as extremely low population densities as in the sahara and marshlands 2 2 datasets this study integrates a list of hydroclimatic physical and anthropogenic

mann kendal mk theil sen slope trend test was performed on each grid throughout the nrb following the methodology explained in section 3 2 1 2 the 95 confidence intervals around the trends and associated uncertainty were calculated according to standard approaches tiwari et al 2009 scanlon et al 2016 hasan et al 2019a hasan et al 2019c sultan et al 2019 3 the gridded trend outputs were projected to a consistent spatiotemporal scale and resampled to a fixed grid of 1 0 degree spatial resolution 4 the global basin wide and local explanatory variables of twsa variability analyzed using the ols and gwr respectively for each corresponding grid value see section 3 2 3 fig 2 shows the general framework of the research methodology 2 3 1 trend analysis in general the relationship between a dependent variable e g twsa and several independent variables can be analyzed based on either the raw values of the processor or the dominant component characterizing the time series such as trends cycles and seasonality adhikari and agrawal 2013 gentle 2017 hasan 2017 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2018 with respect to twsa across africa previous research e g swenson and wahr 2009 ahmed et al 2014 forootan et al 2014 moore and williams 2014 ahmed et al 2016 hasan et al 2016 hassan and jin 2016 hasan et al 2019b hasan et al 2019a showed that twsa trend provides a robust means of investigating the relationship between twsa and the driving hydrologic variables particularly the twsa trend variability resulted from complex interactions among multiple processes which differ widely from one location to another thus for large spatially heterogeneous areas trends provide summative estimates that indicate both the general direction as well as the rate of change thereby imposing a degree of order on an otherwise chaotic process to measure the long term secular trend the modified non parametric mk trend test mann 1945 hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 pohlert 2018 was applied to each variable the mk method is widely used for trend estimation and justification for its use appears in numerous publications nikzad tehrani et al 2018 hasan et al 2019c generally the mk statistic s for a time series x 1 x 2 x n is calculated as 1 s k 1 n 1 i k 1 n sgn x i x k 0 1 2 where s g n x 1 x 2 1 x 1 x 2 0 0 x 1 x 2 0 1 x 1 x 2 0 where x j and x k are all pairs of sample points the mk method tests the presence and significance of a trend but not its magnitude therefore we applied sen s slope estimator q i to determine the magnitude of the trend in each x i with a statistically significant trend the test is calculated as 3 q i x j x k t j t k i 1 2 n j k where q i is theil sen estimator measured as the median of the sample points the slope is measured at n points in the time series n n n 1 2 q i is the median of these n values we accessed to the sen s slope algorithm via the carn r project the spatialeco package for spatial analysis and modeling utilities evans and ram 2018 fig 3 shows the gridded trend outputs from each variable the confidence intervals associated with these trend estimates across the basin were determined following standard approaches not shown in the figure 2 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis to test the spatial patterns and clustering tendency of the gridded trend outputs moran s i index was calculated for each individual variable moran s i is an inferential statistical tool that calculates the spatial autocorrelation among neighboring points distributed across a study domain chen 2013 shen et al 2016 i e 4 i 1 σ 2 i j x i x x j x i j ω ij where x is trend value indexed by i and j locations x is the mean of x σ 2 is the variance and ω ij is a matrix of spatial weights for this analysis the ω ij s were estimated following the method of nakaya 2001 equation 4 produces normalized values of i between 1 0 and 1 0 representing the degree of clustering dispersion or randomness in the study process the process is classified as clustered dispersed if moran s i is positive negative and statistically significant p 0 05 otherwise the process is classified as random additional information about moran s spatial autocorrelation can be found in griffith 2009 table 2 shows the moran s i of the trend for each variable 2 3 3 gmr analysis the gridded trend outputs were analyzed using gmr formulations in general the gmr approach follows a multiple ols regression expression as 5 y α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n ε i where y is the trend of the dependent variable twsa x 1 x 2 x n are the trends in the independent explanatory variables α is the model intercept β t is the coefficient associated with each variable and ε i is the residual or stochastic component the ols model eq 5 treats the entire basin as a single undifferentiated unit and the contributions of all variables are deemed equal at all locations the gwr conversely modifies the general ols formulation and assigns weights to each variable based on the occurrence of clusters among neighborhood pixels i e 6 y i α p i β 1 p 1 x 1 β 2 p 2 x 2 β n p n x n ε i where pi is pixel location because the clusters were ultimately used to explain grace derived twsa it was important to ensure that the area of each cluster was at least 200 000 km2 the size deemed essential for robustly detecting the grace footprint the gwr eq 6 adopts a spatially distributed approach in which the relative contributions of the independent variables vary spatially in the gwr the model establishes an area with radius r to calibrate the least squares regression fitting the regression model centered at each pi is assigned a binary weight value between 1 and 0 depending on whether it is contained within a cluster or not the weight ω ij assigned to observation j would be 7 ω ij 1 if d ij r 0 if d ij r where d ij is the distance between the location of observation i and j within each cluster the method assigns weights values that decay according to gaussian distance decay function i e 8 ω ij 1 d ij b 2 2 i f d ij r 0 i f d ij r where b is a nonnegative decay parameter describing the relationship between weight and distance using eq 8 the gwr assigns spatial weights to each variable proportionate to the strength of the trend in different parts of the basin and the clustering tendency this approach produced separate regression models for each specific location for this analysis the gwr model was summarized for five conventional bioclimatic zones of the nile basin as well as four sub basins prior to model development multicollinearity among the independent and dependent variables was evaluated using r square tolerance and variable infiltration factor vif table 3 the cutoff thresholds were respectively 0 20 for tolerance and 3 0 for vif wheeler and tiefelsdorf 2005 table 3 indicates that all variables satisfied the set thresholds the efficacy of ols model as well as each gwr model was tested using standard goodness of fit diagnostics including correlation coefficient r2 mean squared error mse maximum likelihood of variance mlv classic akaike information criterion classic aic and cross validation cv among other tests see the appendix 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of trend and clustering analysis table 2 summarizes the theil sen slope outputs the trend confidence interval ci and moran s i clustering index for each variable across the nile basin the trends in et sws sms gws and pet are statistically significant p 0 0001 at the scale of the basin as a whole two variables et sms show positive trends of 0 60 mm 0 05 mm yr and 2 67 mm 0 14 mm yr respectively the positive et trend likely reflects rising atmospheric temperature in the basin due to a temperature increase of approximately 2 c over the past 20 years on the other hand the strong positive sms trend indicating increasing sms across the basin moran s index analysis revealed statistically significant clustering p 0 0001 in all variables except ndvi the lack of clusters in ndvi is not intuitive but may reflect similarities in the vegetation response to twsa variability across the nile basin soil moisture showed perfect clustering suggesting that the strong bifurcation of the basin into a dry arid northern part and humid climatic zones to the south exerts a dominant control on sms clustering fig 3 shows plots of the spatial patterns of trends for each variable each variable shows a different and unique spatial trend pattern across the basin some variables e g runoff and soil moisture show predominantly positive trends while others e g surface water and pet show predominantly negative trends precipitation and groundwater storage show a tendency to clustering i e coherent zones of positive or negative trends while others e g ndvi show little to no clustering tendency because twsa integrates the effects of these interactions among all the twsa spatial pattern is distinct from any individual variable for the nrb at large twsa has a positive increasing trend of 2 17 mm 0 128 mm yr the results compare favorably with those reported by e g ahmed et al 2014 based on analysis of twsa trends for different sub basins the authors found a positive tws trend of 3 14 mm 0 27 mm yr for the blue nile and atbara sub basins on the other hand the authors reported a negative tws trend of 3 72 mm 0 27 mm yr 99 confidence for the nubian sandstone aquifer furthermore according to fig 3 precipitation patterns across the nrb display slightly negative trend while the et 3d expresses a positive trend during the study period a cursory review of some of the trends leads to conclusions that are not intuitive for example consideration of water budget fundamentals suggests that sms should decrease as p decreases and et increases yet fig 3f shows increasing sms suggesting the possible influence of other variables besides p and et conversely sws 3e and pet 3h show statistically significant negative trends 1 51 mm 0 15 mm yr 0 64 mm 0 04 mm yr respectively similar to et the negative trend in sws is obvious and likely attributable to declining precipitation and increasing surface water use the declining pet indicates that the basin has become on average more water limited thereby providing fewer opportunities for evapotranspiration despite the availability of energy the groundwater trend 3g shows a mild declining trend further studies are needed to establish definitively and explain these patterns 3 2 gmr analysis results as noted previously two gmr regression models were implemented in the ols model the entire basin was treated as a single unit to explore the global explanatory variable the ols model indicates that five variables contribute to twsa variability in the nile basin table 4 these are precipitation runoff surface water storage soil moisture storage and population density p 0 0001 the ols produced skewed standardized residuals and low but statistically significant correlation coefficient r2 of 0 14 fig 4 a b the model residuals are poorly distributed indicating an overall weak model fit a likely explanation for this result is error cancellation consistent with observed divergent trends in independent variables instead the gwr model standardized residuals are normally distributed with minimum bias fig 4c additionally the gwr model produced r2 varying from 0 28 to 0 91 with a median of 0 71 p 0 0001 fig 4 d e the result of the gwr showed a six fold improvement in explained twsa variance as the regression model takes into account spatial differences in the strengths of each variables contributions to twsa across the basin fig 5 maps the spatial distribution of the standardized residuals and r2 values for the ols and gwr across the basin as noted the ols standardized residuals are inhomogeneous with strong outliers across the arid area i e nile delta and the main nile river course in upper egypt and the central and southwest portions of the basin i e sobat and bahar el jabel basins fig 5a the ols r2 has a consistent spatial distribution across the basin fig 5b unlikely the gwr displays more homogenous standardized residuals with fewer outliers across the arid and equatorial lake areas fig 5c the gwr r2 values are relatively high but varied across the basin fig 5d the gwr highlights that the degree of explained variance in twsa improves as the regression model takes into account local differences in the strength of each variable contribution to the twsa variability across the basin table 5 summarizes the diagnostics for the ols and gwr models for each variable the gwr model delineated clusters indicating areas of significant positive or negative correlation with twsa fig 6 is a map of the locations clusters where each variable makes statistically significant contributions to twsa across the basin the results show that precipitation is significantly correlated with twsa in the tropical region equatorial lake sobat upper blue nile and trunk channel sub basin bahr el ghazal and the headwaters of the atbara basin evapotranspiration is positively correlated with the twsa trend in the equatorial lake area north sobat basin atbara basin and the main nile basin population density contributes positively to the twsa in the headwaters and trunk channel sub basins but negatively elsewhere as might be expected evapotranspiration makes the highest contribution in the arid and semiarid regions as well as the central and western regions of the basin where wetlands and the sudd predominate surface water contributes strongly and positively in the headwater regions of the white and blue nile overall the results are consistent with the basin s known hydroclimatic characteristics and behavior taking the above patterns into account table 6 shows the variables retained in the gwr model equations by climate zone several observations are immediately obvious in general the storage processes i e sws sms and gws explained a larger proportion of the twsa variability compared to flux processes e g p r et the contributions of the storage parameters may reflect their relative magnitude as well as the fact that two storage processes sms and gws occur continuously over time and space whereas flux processes are temporally episodic and spatially discontinuous as hypothesized both the numbers and combinations of variables contributing to the twsa are different for each climate zone in the arid zone the important variables include r et sms pet and pop dens in the semiarid zone twsa is driven primarily by e and pop dens all variables are retained in the tropical zone remarkably but for reasons that remain unclear at this time population density is the only variable that is statistically significant to twsa variability in every climate zone the observation reflects the role of anthropogenic processes on water mass distributions to evaluate the robustness of the gwr approach we simulated the twsa patterns using the gwr model outputs across the basin the agreement with the original twsa trends is excellent with r2 0 80 p 0 0001 fig 7 4 summary and conclusions grace derived twsa has become an essential source of water storage information in a growing array of hydrologic analysis and research a common way in which the data have been analyzed is to correlate grace anomalies with various hydroclimatic phenomena such as drought floods and groundwater depletion among numerous applications comparatively few studies have analyzed the question of how spatiotemporal variability among different basin processes interacts to produce the mass distributions in water storage across the basin this study attempts to fill that gap by making use of trends of nine hydro physical and anthropogenic processes first the modified nonparametric mk trend test was applied to derive the gridded trend estimates for each variable second the data were projected to a consistent spatial resolution of 1 degree grids third the trend data were evaluated for multicollinearity as well as the clustering tendency using moran s i index following standard evaluation and diagnostic analysis the ols model retained five variables precipitation runoff surface water storage soil moisture storage and population density p 0 0001 collectively the trends in these variables explained 14 of the variability in twsa trends for the basin at large this low explanatory power likely diminishes to opposing signs sign cancellation in different variables the gwr model delineated clusters of significant positive and negative correlation with twsa the gwr model produced homogenous standardized residuals and a high correlation coefficient the gwr retained different sets of variables at different locations in the basin to explain the twsa variability surface water trend is an important contributor to twsa trends across the southern and eastern portion of the nrb where major surface water reservoirs are abundant e g lake victoria lake albert lake koga and lake tana in the blue nile basin soil moisture trend explained the twsa trends across the equatorial lake areas sobat upper blue nile and main nile in the source areas in the north these zones are characterized by the presence of major natural lakes and reservoirs twsa trend is associated with groundwater trend in the equatorial lake zone and west area of the red sea crystalline rocks in the north of the basin finally the trend in population density was statistically important especially in the highly populated areas across the nrb including equatorial lake blue nile basin and the main nile in the north by explicitly accounting for the spatial variability in trends in this manner the r2 values improved significantly varying from 0 28 to 0 91 with a median of 0 71 the result underscores the importance of taking into account spatial differences in the drivers of twsa for large drainage basins and study domains because the clusters were ultimately used to explain grace derived twsa we ensured that the area of each cluster was at least 200 000 km2 the size deemed essential for robustly detecting the grace footprint credit authorship contribution statement emad hasan

5474,grace gravity recovery and climate experiment long term terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa is attributed to the complex interaction of climatic physical and anthropogenic drivers this paper therefore explores how different hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes interact and combine over space to produce the mass variations that grace twsa detects using the nile river basin nrb as a case study it explicitly analyzes nine hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes as well as their relationship to the twsa in different climatic zones the analytic method employed the long term trends derived for both the dependent twsa and independent explanatory variables via applying two geographically multiple regression gmr approaches i an ordinary least square regression ols model in which the contributions of all variables to twsa variability are deemed equal at all locations and ii a geographically weighted regression gwr which assigns a weight to each variable at different locations based on clustering occurrences the models efficacy was investigated using standard goodness of fit diagnostics the ols explains that the basin at large twsa spatial variability significantly attributed to five variables i e precipitation runoff surface water storage soil moisture storage and population density p 0 0001 the ols model however produced an r2 value of 0 14 with skewed standardized residuals in contrast the gwr model retained varying explanatory variables by different climate zone for instance the results showed that all nine variables contribute significantly with varying ranking to the trend in twsa in the tropical zone the evapotranspiration et and population density are the only significant variables in the semiarid zone population density contributes significantly to twsa variability in all zones the gwr model yielded r2 values with a median of 0 71 and normally distributed standard residuals to evaluate the robustness of the gwr approach the basin wide twsa pattern was simulated using the gwr model outputs herein the gwr highlights the importance of the spatial locations to attribute the spatial variability in grace tswa long term trends

velicogna et al 2014 sutterley et al 2014 as well as floods reager et al 2015 and droughts long et al 2014 ndehedehe et al 2016 nie et al 2017 sun et al 2018 all of the above applications could benefit from an improved understanding of how twsa varies over space and time in response to complex interactions among the major drivers and processes to date however effort in this regard has been focused on correlating grace twsa to a single or limited number of basin processes including precipitation swenson and wahr 2006 land surface model outputs döll et al 2014a ahmed et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 hasan et al 2019b hasan et al 2019c or climate forcing processes such as el niño southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod awange et al 2016 shamsudduha et al 2017 khaki et al 2018 furthermore much of the existing studies treat the basins as a single lumped unit or domain in reality however for most large basins such as the nile the processes that contribute to driving twsa exhibit extreme variations spatially in the nile basin for example average annual precipitation varies from over 1000 mm per year in the south to less than 100 mm per year in the arid region other variables such as runoff evapotranspiration and population density experience unique spatial variability furthermore at any given location some processes covary positively with twsa while others covary negatively that is the variables contributing to increasing trends twsa in one location may instead contribute to negative trends at other locations within the same basin finally both the number and combination of variables driving twsa as well as their relative importance also change significantly within the basin as a result for large drainage areas a basin wide averaged analysis of twsa and its drivers conceals considerable spatial variability that can inform planning or support refined modeling and analysis from an applied perspective using geospatial modeling to analyze and map the spatial patterns in twsa variations is critical for developing robust statistical models for reconstructing time series of proxy grace anomalies that predate the launch of the grace mission april 2002 as well as filling the record gap between grace and grace follow on grace fo mission additionally significantly improves our understanding of the hydroclimatic anthropogenic and biophysical processes and dynamics that impact twsa occurrence and variability at the intra basin scale such geospatial information is critical for planning and resource management in areas undergoing rapid population change and environmental stresses it is also useful for assessing the risk that different activities and processes pose individually or in different combinations to total water resources availability and change in this paper therefore we expand upon the framework established by current studies to investigate space time variations in twsa in response to major hydroclimatic biophysical and anthropogenic factors specifically we investigate within basin twsa variability in response to major drivers based on long term secular trends in both twsa and its drivers the secular trend component is a measure of the deterministic evolution or the rate of changes in the basin s freshwater availability over time previous research e g ahmed et al 2016 hasan et al 2019b hasan et al 2019c has also shown that the trend component expresses the dominant twsa variability across most of africa s large basins herein the analysis is accomplished via two geographically multiple regression gmr approaches the ordinary least square ols regression and a geographically weighted regression gwr modeling over the nile river basin nrb the ols model deemed to treat all variables equally at a different spatial location while the gwr assigns spatial weights to each variable based on the strength of the contribution of that variable to twsa at each location see section 2 3 3 nakaya 2001 fotheringham et al 2002 the utilized approaches significantly improve our understanding of the hydroclimatic anthropogenic and biophysical processes and dynamics that impact twsa occurrence and variability over space at the intra basin scale the paper is organized as follows following this introduction section 2 describes briefly the study area and highlighting its unique suitability for spatiotemporal analysis of tws it also introduces the utilized datasets see section 2 2 and methods utilized in section 2 3 section 3 presents the results and discusses their implications finally section 4 summarizes the importance of space domain analysis and the major findings from the study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area with total flow length approximately 6 700 km the nile is the longest river in the world the river has two major tributaries the white and blue niles other important tributaries include the sobat and bahr el jebel which flow into the white nile and the atbara river which joins the nile below the confluence of the white and blue niles fig 1 together these rivers drain a total basin area of 3 3 million square kilometers approximately 11 percent of africa s total landmass from south to north the basin traverses five bioclimatic zones namely tropical subtropical semiarid arid and mediterranean climate zone shahin 1985 collins 2002 the headwaters of the blue and atbara rivers originate in the subtropical mountain bioclimatic zone of ethiopia while the tropical bioclimatic zone forms the sobat and bahr el jebel sub basins precipitation and surface runoff patterns vary significantly across the basin in response to this climatic heterogeneity precipitation declines from over 1000 mm yr in the tropical regions in the headwaters of the white nile to less than 100 mm yr in the arid zone below the delta camberlin 2009 actual evapotranspiration et follows a similar pattern it exceeds 1000 mm yr in the tropical and subtropical zones but declines to less than 80 mm yr in the arid zone collins 2002 conway 2005 camberlin 2009 in contrast thepotential evapotranspiration pet grades in the opposite direction increasing from 1 100 mm yr in the tropical and subtropical zones to over 3 000 mm yr in the semiarid and arid zones as land surface temperature rises camberlin 2009 conway 2005 hasan et al 2015 2018 collins 2002 due to the above differences the nile basin has low runoff rates on average about 0 98 l s km2 moges and gebremichael 2014 senay et al 2014 hasan 2017 in terms of the human and political geography the nrb comprises 11 countries with a total population in 2012 of nearly 400 million oestigaard 2012 the basin s population is projected to reach 800 million by 2050 haub and kaneda 2019 the nile basin is a water conflict hotspot because of the multiplicity of countries with competing demands and conflicting priorities that share the basin gleick 1991 gleick 1994 schwartz and singh 1999 rapid population growth and devastating historical droughts compel upstream countries to exploit the nile s water resources to support ambitious development plans an example is thegrand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd on the blue nile basin bnb which will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in africa when it is completed yet egypt a downstream country depends on the nile more directly and intensely than any other country depends on any single resource conflict theorists postulate that such high dependence on a single resource increases the likelihood that a country might risk conflict or war to protect that resource ibrahim 2011 martens 2011 thus to both upstream and downstream countries the nile is critical to survival food security and development planning fortunately the countries in the region and the international community are keenly aware of these risks as a result the nile basin today has arguably more treaties governing its use than any other international river basin in the world wolf et al 2003 in support of these treaties numerous models and simulations of the basin s water resources continue to be developed and refined as knowledge of the water resources dynamics of the basin improves in summary the nrb is uniquely suited to analyze the space variability of twsa and its major spatial drivers due to its immense size extreme variability and heterogeneity the nile spans africa s most extensive mountain systems largest marshlands tropical rainforest and desert collins 2002 the nile s human geography is equally diverse it includes the highest population densities in africa e g the nile delta and floodplain in egypt as well as extremely low population densities as in the sahara and marshlands 2 2 datasets this study integrates a list of hydroclimatic physical and anthropogenic

mann kendal mk theil sen slope trend test was performed on each grid throughout the nrb following the methodology explained in section 3 2 1 2 the 95 confidence intervals around the trends and associated uncertainty were calculated according to standard approaches tiwari et al 2009 scanlon et al 2016 hasan et al 2019a hasan et al 2019c sultan et al 2019 3 the gridded trend outputs were projected to a consistent spatiotemporal scale and resampled to a fixed grid of 1 0 degree spatial resolution 4 the global basin wide and local explanatory variables of twsa variability analyzed using the ols and gwr respectively for each corresponding grid value see section 3 2 3 fig 2 shows the general framework of the research methodology 2 3 1 trend analysis in general the relationship between a dependent variable e g twsa and several independent variables can be analyzed based on either the raw values of the processor or the dominant component characterizing the time series such as trends cycles and seasonality adhikari and agrawal 2013 gentle 2017 hasan 2017 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2018 with respect to twsa across africa previous research e g swenson and wahr 2009 ahmed et al 2014 forootan et al 2014 moore and williams 2014 ahmed et al 2016 hasan et al 2016 hassan and jin 2016 hasan et al 2019b hasan et al 2019a showed that twsa trend provides a robust means of investigating the relationship between twsa and the driving hydrologic variables particularly the twsa trend variability resulted from complex interactions among multiple processes which differ widely from one location to another thus for large spatially heterogeneous areas trends provide summative estimates that indicate both the general direction as well as the rate of change thereby imposing a degree of order on an otherwise chaotic process to measure the long term secular trend the modified non parametric mk trend test mann 1945 hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 pohlert 2018 was applied to each variable the mk method is widely used for trend estimation and justification for its use appears in numerous publications nikzad tehrani et al 2018 hasan et al 2019c generally the mk statistic s for a time series x 1 x 2 x n is calculated as 1 s k 1 n 1 i k 1 n sgn x i x k 0 1 2 where s g n x 1 x 2 1 x 1 x 2 0 0 x 1 x 2 0 1 x 1 x 2 0 where x j and x k are all pairs of sample points the mk method tests the presence and significance of a trend but not its magnitude therefore we applied sen s slope estimator q i to determine the magnitude of the trend in each x i with a statistically significant trend the test is calculated as 3 q i x j x k t j t k i 1 2 n j k where q i is theil sen estimator measured as the median of the sample points the slope is measured at n points in the time series n n n 1 2 q i is the median of these n values we accessed to the sen s slope algorithm via the carn r project the spatialeco package for spatial analysis and modeling utilities evans and ram 2018 fig 3 shows the gridded trend outputs from each variable the confidence intervals associated with these trend estimates across the basin were determined following standard approaches not shown in the figure 2 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis to test the spatial patterns and clustering tendency of the gridded trend outputs moran s i index was calculated for each individual variable moran s i is an inferential statistical tool that calculates the spatial autocorrelation among neighboring points distributed across a study domain chen 2013 shen et al 2016 i e 4 i 1 σ 2 i j x i x x j x i j ω ij where x is trend value indexed by i and j locations x is the mean of x σ 2 is the variance and ω ij is a matrix of spatial weights for this analysis the ω ij s were estimated following the method of nakaya 2001 equation 4 produces normalized values of i between 1 0 and 1 0 representing the degree of clustering dispersion or randomness in the study process the process is classified as clustered dispersed if moran s i is positive negative and statistically significant p 0 05 otherwise the process is classified as random additional information about moran s spatial autocorrelation can be found in griffith 2009 table 2 shows the moran s i of the trend for each variable 2 3 3 gmr analysis the gridded trend outputs were analyzed using gmr formulations in general the gmr approach follows a multiple ols regression expression as 5 y α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n ε i where y is the trend of the dependent variable twsa x 1 x 2 x n are the trends in the independent explanatory variables α is the model intercept β t is the coefficient associated with each variable and ε i is the residual or stochastic component the ols model eq 5 treats the entire basin as a single undifferentiated unit and the contributions of all variables are deemed equal at all locations the gwr conversely modifies the general ols formulation and assigns weights to each variable based on the occurrence of clusters among neighborhood pixels i e 6 y i α p i β 1 p 1 x 1 β 2 p 2 x 2 β n p n x n ε i where pi is pixel location because the clusters were ultimately used to explain grace derived twsa it was important to ensure that the area of each cluster was at least 200 000 km2 the size deemed essential for robustly detecting the grace footprint the gwr eq 6 adopts a spatially distributed approach in which the relative contributions of the independent variables vary spatially in the gwr the model establishes an area with radius r to calibrate the least squares regression fitting the regression model centered at each pi is assigned a binary weight value between 1 and 0 depending on whether it is contained within a cluster or not the weight ω ij assigned to observation j would be 7 ω ij 1 if d ij r 0 if d ij r where d ij is the distance between the location of observation i and j within each cluster the method assigns weights values that decay according to gaussian distance decay function i e 8 ω ij 1 d ij b 2 2 i f d ij r 0 i f d ij r where b is a nonnegative decay parameter describing the relationship between weight and distance using eq 8 the gwr assigns spatial weights to each variable proportionate to the strength of the trend in different parts of the basin and the clustering tendency this approach produced separate regression models for each specific location for this analysis the gwr model was summarized for five conventional bioclimatic zones of the nile basin as well as four sub basins prior to model development multicollinearity among the independent and dependent variables was evaluated using r square tolerance and variable infiltration factor vif table 3 the cutoff thresholds were respectively 0 20 for tolerance and 3 0 for vif wheeler and tiefelsdorf 2005 table 3 indicates that all variables satisfied the set thresholds the efficacy of ols model as well as each gwr model was tested using standard goodness of fit diagnostics including correlation coefficient r2 mean squared error mse maximum likelihood of variance mlv classic akaike information criterion classic aic and cross validation cv among other tests see the appendix 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of trend and clustering analysis table 2 summarizes the theil sen slope outputs the trend confidence interval ci and moran s i clustering index for each variable across the nile basin the trends in et sws sms gws and pet are statistically significant p 0 0001 at the scale of the basin as a whole two variables et sms show positive trends of 0 60 mm 0 05 mm yr and 2 67 mm 0 14 mm yr respectively the positive et trend likely reflects rising atmospheric temperature in the basin due to a temperature increase of approximately 2 c over the past 20 years on the other hand the strong positive sms trend indicating increasing sms across the basin moran s index analysis revealed statistically significant clustering p 0 0001 in all variables except ndvi the lack of clusters in ndvi is not intuitive but may reflect similarities in the vegetation response to twsa variability across the nile basin soil moisture showed perfect clustering suggesting that the strong bifurcation of the basin into a dry arid northern part and humid climatic zones to the south exerts a dominant control on sms clustering fig 3 shows plots of the spatial patterns of trends for each variable each variable shows a different and unique spatial trend pattern across the basin some variables e g runoff and soil moisture show predominantly positive trends while others e g surface water and pet show predominantly negative trends precipitation and groundwater storage show a tendency to clustering i e coherent zones of positive or negative trends while others e g ndvi show little to no clustering tendency because twsa integrates the effects of these interactions among all the twsa spatial pattern is distinct from any individual variable for the nrb at large twsa has a positive increasing trend of 2 17 mm 0 128 mm yr the results compare favorably with those reported by e g ahmed et al 2014 based on analysis of twsa trends for different sub basins the authors found a positive tws trend of 3 14 mm 0 27 mm yr for the blue nile and atbara sub basins on the other hand the authors reported a negative tws trend of 3 72 mm 0 27 mm yr 99 confidence for the nubian sandstone aquifer furthermore according to fig 3 precipitation patterns across the nrb display slightly negative trend while the et 3d expresses a positive trend during the study period a cursory review of some of the trends leads to conclusions that are not intuitive for example consideration of water budget fundamentals suggests that sms should decrease as p decreases and et increases yet fig 3f shows increasing sms suggesting the possible influence of other variables besides p and et conversely sws 3e and pet 3h show statistically significant negative trends 1 51 mm 0 15 mm yr 0 64 mm 0 04 mm yr respectively similar to et the negative trend in sws is obvious and likely attributable to declining precipitation and increasing surface water use the declining pet indicates that the basin has become on average more water limited thereby providing fewer opportunities for evapotranspiration despite the availability of energy the groundwater trend 3g shows a mild declining trend further studies are needed to establish definitively and explain these patterns 3 2 gmr analysis results as noted previously two gmr regression models were implemented in the ols model the entire basin was treated as a single unit to explore the global explanatory variable the ols model indicates that five variables contribute to twsa variability in the nile basin table 4 these are precipitation runoff surface water storage soil moisture storage and population density p 0 0001 the ols produced skewed standardized residuals and low but statistically significant correlation coefficient r2 of 0 14 fig 4 a b the model residuals are poorly distributed indicating an overall weak model fit a likely explanation for this result is error cancellation consistent with observed divergent trends in independent variables instead the gwr model standardized residuals are normally distributed with minimum bias fig 4c additionally the gwr model produced r2 varying from 0 28 to 0 91 with a median of 0 71 p 0 0001 fig 4 d e the result of the gwr showed a six fold improvement in explained twsa variance as the regression model takes into account spatial differences in the strengths of each variables contributions to twsa across the basin fig 5 maps the spatial distribution of the standardized residuals and r2 values for the ols and gwr across the basin as noted the ols standardized residuals are inhomogeneous with strong outliers across the arid area i e nile delta and the main nile river course in upper egypt and the central and southwest portions of the basin i e sobat and bahar el jabel basins fig 5a the ols r2 has a consistent spatial distribution across the basin fig 5b unlikely the gwr displays more homogenous standardized residuals with fewer outliers across the arid and equatorial lake areas fig 5c the gwr r2 values are relatively high but varied across the basin fig 5d the gwr highlights that the degree of explained variance in twsa improves as the regression model takes into account local differences in the strength of each variable contribution to the twsa variability across the basin table 5 summarizes the diagnostics for the ols and gwr models for each variable the gwr model delineated clusters indicating areas of significant positive or negative correlation with twsa fig 6 is a map of the locations clusters where each variable makes statistically significant contributions to twsa across the basin the results show that precipitation is significantly correlated with twsa in the tropical region equatorial lake sobat upper blue nile and trunk channel sub basin bahr el ghazal and the headwaters of the atbara basin evapotranspiration is positively correlated with the twsa trend in the equatorial lake area north sobat basin atbara basin and the main nile basin population density contributes positively to the twsa in the headwaters and trunk channel sub basins but negatively elsewhere as might be expected evapotranspiration makes the highest contribution in the arid and semiarid regions as well as the central and western regions of the basin where wetlands and the sudd predominate surface water contributes strongly and positively in the headwater regions of the white and blue nile overall the results are consistent with the basin s known hydroclimatic characteristics and behavior taking the above patterns into account table 6 shows the variables retained in the gwr model equations by climate zone several observations are immediately obvious in general the storage processes i e sws sms and gws explained a larger proportion of the twsa variability compared to flux processes e g p r et the contributions of the storage parameters may reflect their relative magnitude as well as the fact that two storage processes sms and gws occur continuously over time and space whereas flux processes are temporally episodic and spatially discontinuous as hypothesized both the numbers and combinations of variables contributing to the twsa are different for each climate zone in the arid zone the important variables include r et sms pet and pop dens in the semiarid zone twsa is driven primarily by e and pop dens all variables are retained in the tropical zone remarkably but for reasons that remain unclear at this time population density is the only variable that is statistically significant to twsa variability in every climate zone the observation reflects the role of anthropogenic processes on water mass distributions to evaluate the robustness of the gwr approach we simulated the twsa patterns using the gwr model outputs across the basin the agreement with the original twsa trends is excellent with r2 0 80 p 0 0001 fig 7 4 summary and conclusions grace derived twsa has become an essential source of water storage information in a growing array of hydrologic analysis and research a common way in which the data have been analyzed is to correlate grace anomalies with various hydroclimatic phenomena such as drought floods and groundwater depletion among numerous applications comparatively few studies have analyzed the question of how spatiotemporal variability among different basin processes interacts to produce the mass distributions in water storage across the basin this study attempts to fill that gap by making use of trends of nine hydro physical and anthropogenic processes first the modified nonparametric mk trend test was applied to derive the gridded trend estimates for each variable second the data were projected to a consistent spatial resolution of 1 degree grids third the trend data were evaluated for multicollinearity as well as the clustering tendency using moran s i index following standard evaluation and diagnostic analysis the ols model retained five variables precipitation runoff surface water storage soil moisture storage and population density p 0 0001 collectively the trends in these variables explained 14 of the variability in twsa trends for the basin at large this low explanatory power likely diminishes to opposing signs sign cancellation in different variables the gwr model delineated clusters of significant positive and negative correlation with twsa the gwr model produced homogenous standardized residuals and a high correlation coefficient the gwr retained different sets of variables at different locations in the basin to explain the twsa variability surface water trend is an important contributor to twsa trends across the southern and eastern portion of the nrb where major surface water reservoirs are abundant e g lake victoria lake albert lake koga and lake tana in the blue nile basin soil moisture trend explained the twsa trends across the equatorial lake areas sobat upper blue nile and main nile in the source areas in the north these zones are characterized by the presence of major natural lakes and reservoirs twsa trend is associated with groundwater trend in the equatorial lake zone and west area of the red sea crystalline rocks in the north of the basin finally the trend in population density was statistically important especially in the highly populated areas across the nrb including equatorial lake blue nile basin and the main nile in the north by explicitly accounting for the spatial variability in trends in this manner the r2 values improved significantly varying from 0 28 to 0 91 with a median of 0 71 the result underscores the importance of taking into account spatial differences in the drivers of twsa for large drainage basins and study domains because the clusters were ultimately used to explain grace derived twsa we ensured that the area of each cluster was at least 200 000 km2 the size deemed essential for robustly detecting the grace footprint credit authorship contribution statement emad hasan
