12005,in argentina the complementary irrigation has increased in most agricultural regions where it is necessary to minimize possible negative impacts on the quantity and quality of groundwater numerical modeling techniques are used to obtain projections of the aquifer dynamics for which a conceptual model is needed that provides the input data in the numerical simulations a hydrogeological conceptual model for a rural area of buenos aires province argentina where complementary irrigation has caused significant depletion of groundwater levels during the irrigation season has been developed it was based on available geophysical and hydrogeological information and measurements of piezometric levels and hydraulic parameters of the aquifer together with the geochemical analysis of groundwater this model was imported to a numerical model and the hydrogeological parameters were adjusted by the calibration with static piezometric levels measured in the wells the conceptual model was validated satisfactorily using a fitting criterion to reach a value of root mean square error less than 5 different simulations of the probable drawdowns of the levels due to pumping were performed in the study area the main hydrogeological unit is semi confined mostly comprising of a multilayer unit with good quality of water its minimum and maximum thickness was 60 and 240 m respectively the groundwater flows northwards from the hilly area to the plains the recharge was 4 6 mm year 1 representing 5 of annual precipitation dynamic simulations show that the aquifer gets dried which questions its sustainability the alternating condition of the source or drain of the streams depends on the irrigation period or the dry season respectively great drawdowns of piezometric levels in some areas might be the cause of changes in water classification these results lead to the need of planning the use of groundwater as a complement to agricultural activity considering sustainable employment of the resource keywords conceptual hydrogeological model complementary irrigation aquifer geophysics 1 introduction in latin america groundwater is a vital resource that plays a strategic role for sustainable development which will be even more important in the next years as water shortages and increased climate variability become significant worldwide concerns oas 2004 1 1 oas organization of american states adverse effects of groundwater overexploitation include water level reduction and storage quality degradation reduction of flow in streams wetlands and springs subsidence of the land uneconomical pumping conditions interference with preexisting uses lamsoge et al 2014 according to fao 2 2 fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations for a global population that will reach 9 billion in 2050 it is obvious that more water will be needed to produce 60 of additional food that will be necessary fao 2017 although in recent years it was possible to provide better quality of food to more people this is often achieved at the expense of water resources and the health of the ecosystems they support fao 2017 in argentina the use of groundwater for irrigation has increased in most of the regions particularly in sub humid and humid regions where complementary irrigation may be strengthened with an integrated approach which maximizes and optimizes its use minimizing possible negative impacts on the quantity and quality of groundwater ministry of agriculture of argentina 2015 overexploitation of groundwater has caused increasing pressure to develop more sophisticated techniques for sustainable management of the aquifers modern numerical modeling techniques have been used to obtain projections of future aquifer conditions in response to a set of proposed scenarios once the model has been developed and calibrated the effects on the aquifer dynamics can be analyzed by altering and testing the model jones et al 2015 for this a correct characterization of groundwater in the study area is necessary in order to obtain a conceptual model that provides the input data for numerical simulations jones et al 2015 therefore the elaboration of the conceptual model is an indispensable step in planning the use of groundwater as a complement to agricultural activity for sustainable use of the resource in the study area numerous workers have applied conceptual models to develop numerical description of groundwater flow related to the overexploitation of water for agricultural irrigation e g liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 li et al 2017 alfaro et al 2017 singh 2014 and farhadi et al 2016 during the last decade in the southwestern sw part of the province of buenos aires argentina more precisely in the rural area around the city of coronel suarez installation of sprinkler irrigation systems has grown steadily that partly explains the growth in the production of extensive crops these production systems use groundwater for complementary irrigation the lack of a management plan and even the knowledge of aquifer characteristics has let do a series of negative environmental impacts viz significant reduction of water levels during the irrigation season pia 3 3 pia pampeano irrigation association coronel suárez group 2013 personal communication there is a lack of knowledge about the effect that the set of pumping wells for irrigation may produce in the level drawdowns in the area the study area is located in an extensive inter hill sedimentary basin the general hydrogeological information is provided by auge 2004 and gonzález 2005 but there is no study at a more localized scale specifically the rural area of coronel suarez more recently a geophysical survey of this zone was carried out by losinno et al 2016 who determined with vertical electrical soundings the depth and thicknesses of the aquifers in some sectors of the study area however more geophysical and hydrogeological information is needed to build the conceptual model the calibration and validation of a numerical model for the simulation of the system is not possible while pumping because of the lack of available data on dynamic levels in the wells nevertheless an estimation of probable drawdown levels due to pumping can be done this objective may constitute the basis for the future study of the possible changes on groundwater dynamics due to irrigation contributing to a sustainable agricultural practice and minimizing the negative impacts on ecohydrological systems the application of geophysics to describe the morphology of aquifers has been used by several authors in different environments viz hasan et al 2018 levi et al 2018 and boiero et al 2010 in the study area that has geological complexity due to the proximity of the hill system of ventania and the limited number of wells the background hydrogeological information was collected through field works a previous preliminary geophysical survey was complemented with other geophysical information from the study area pumping tests and physico chemical groundwater analysis 2 methodology for the construction of the conceptual model a detailed review of the local geology and hydrogeology and climate data was performed the field work consisted of inventory of wells measurement of piezometric levels hydraulic tests integration of different geophysical surveys previously carried out analysis of water samples and physicochemical characterization of surface and groundwater and their interaction following hydrogeological characterization of the aquifer system considering all the attributes together a preliminary water balance was established in this way the conceptual model takes into account the natural system adequately and determines the accuracy of the predictive capacity of the subsequent numerical model sea 2012 the conceptual model of the study area with its geometrical configuration was imported to the numerical model using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1983 and the calibration was performed by comparing the calculated static piezometric levels with the ones measured in the wells in order to adjust the hydrogeological parameters of the model following this a simulation of dynamic piezometric levels was carried out through taking into account the flow rates and depth of groundwater wells used for complementary irrigation consequently the impact of agricultural activity of irrigation over groundwater resources could be assessed 2 1 study area and regional framework the study area is located in the southwestern sw part of the buenos aires province in argentina between 37 91 and 36 82 s and 61 32 and 62 55 w covering an approximate area of 9200 km2 around the city of coronel suárez the northern limit of the study is marked by the system of the so called chained lagoons of sw while its southern limit is the orographic system of ventania its eastern boundary is defined by the quinihual and salado streams while the pigüé stream forms its western boundary fig 1 the surface hydrology of the study area that mostly belongs to the basin of the chained lagoons of the sw is characterized by enclosed lagoons which receive streams coming down from the hills of ventania flowing in south north direction fig 1 the sauce corto stream is the main course in the middle basin the stream el huascar flows in northeast direction through the vallimanca stream basin and discharges outside the study area ministry of internal affairs 2017 these streams and other ones of lesser extension such as guaminí cura malal grande hinojo chico and las tunas maintain a permanent regime ign 2020 2 1 1 climate in order to estimate the recharge to the aquifer system calculation of monthly water balance custodio and llamas 1996 was used the potential evapotranspiration the maximum amount of water that can return from the soil to the atmosphere by evaporation through the vegetation cover was estimated by the thornthwaite method thornthwaite and mather 1955 the data of temperature and precipitation correspond to coronel suarez and pigüé weather stations for a period between 1982 and 2016 34 years national meteorological service nms 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology fig 2 shows the geological framework of the study area it is located in the claromecó sedimentary basin between the orographic system of ventania precambrian and paleozoic rocks and the outcrop of the hilly system of tandilia both from the upper paleozoic this basin is asymmetric with maximum depth of 6000 m estimated using geophysical studies showing a minimum in the gravimetric and magnetic anomalies along a nw se axis in agreement with claromecó trench fig 2 kostadinoff 2007 gravimetric anomalies increase towards the ventania system sw and lamadrid ne according to selles martínez 1987 between the towns of c suarez lamadrid and benito juárez the crystalline basement remains very high this characteristic could have prevented the drainage towards the atlantic ocean and on the contrary could have driven part of its drainage to the north geological information from two well reports were taken into account don pedro and la colina wells see fig 1 stratigraphically postpampeano sediments consist of silty sand and fine sand with consolidated calcareous rocks decreasing consolidation with depth the pampeano sediments are approximately 18 56 m depth with sandy silts and scarce fine sand loess of pliopleistocene according to auge 2004 the study area corresponds mainly to the inter hilly plane hydrogeological region between the orographic systems of ventania and tandilia fig 3 the pospampeano sediments with reduced thickness usually less than 5 m constitute the unsaturated zone underlying this the pampeano sedimentary unit is of greatest hydrogeological interest because it hosts the most productive and good quality aquifer widely used in both rural and urban areas the perforation for the wells in the study area is difficult due to the existence of up to 5 m thick massive calcareous layers the upper section of the pampeano sedimentary unit hosts the free aquifer while in the lower levels the degree of confinement increases generating semi confined aquifers with the thickness exceeding 40 or 50 m the pampean aquifer rests directly on the hydrogeological basement formed by paleozoic or proterozoic rocks without tertiary units paraná or olivos formations the hydrogeological basement forms a discontinuous anisotropic and heterogeneous medium with water in fissures and null to very low productivity in azul foothills of tandilia system the hydrogeological basement is located at 150 m depth and in laprida inter hilly plane region at 170 m the aquifer characteristics of the inter hilly plane region are summarized in table 1 for the study area gonzález 2005 agrees with the hydrogeological horizons previously described and recognizes a direct autochthon recharge and another one by underground flow from the hilly region towards the north chained lagoons of sw and ne through vallimanca basin the local discharge occurs towards the streams with an inflowing behavior near the hills the pampeano aquifer water has low salinity 2000 mg l in the inter hilly plane due to the very slow circulation salinity is likely to exceed 2000 mg l another hydrogeological region with smaller extension within the study area is the endorheic region in the sw coinciding with the endorheic basin of the chained lagoons of the sw fig 3 in that part the pampeano aquifer is semiconfined at depth underlying the paraná formation comprising of clays forms an aquiclude whereas a sandy packet below the clay layer from the same formation contains saline waters and shows positive potentiometric levels the basement is composed of paleozoic rocks the recharge of the system is directly autochthonous due to the good permeability of the outcrops sands the underground flow has a centripetal behavior towards the lagoons being the discharge of the system exclusively consumptive evapotranspiration evaporation 2 1 3 geophysics according to rizzolo 2011 personalcommunication who performed vertical electrical soundings ves at the study zone the depth of the hydrogeological basement decreases towards huanguelén and guaminí cities given the geological complexity observed in fig 2 where the zone includes a lot of faults and the nearby system of ventania together with the lack of a complete geophysical information a set of sixteen ves were carried out previously by our group losinno et al 2016 covering the study area in order to have a more homogeneous distribution of soundings the schlumberger allred et al 2008 configuration was used with a maximum opening up to 2000m in order to ensure the end points in the curves corresponding to the increase in resistivity caused by the presence of the hydrogeological basement the 1d layer models were obtained by inversion of experimental data these results were compared with previous geophysical information and the geological and hydrogeological background and ended up completing the information coming from the inventory of wells the determination of water table depth was estimated from geoelectrical models 2 2 field work 2 2 1 well inventory measurement of piezometric levels and hydrochemistry although the study area has a large number of rural farmers who use groundwater for complementary irrigation a subset of these wells were surveyed grouped in the pampeano irrigation association pia 2014 the characteristics of pumping equipment and flow rates were obtained for thirty wells the well depths are in the range of 80 100 m tapping the pampeano aquifer it must be considered that inside the well there is an interconnection between the phreatic and the deeper aquifers because most of the wells are not piped the static piezometric levels were measured before and after the irrigation season in december 2014 and april 2015 respectively in the same campaigns december 2014 and april 2015 thirty five water samples were extracted the hydrochemistry allows a better understanding of the dynamics of the groundwater flows and allowed to evaluate the variation of groundwater quality before and after the irrigation period the parameters analyzed were electrical conductivity ec ph and the concentration of major ions according to the standard methods s m 2018 bicarbonate chloride sulfate calcium magnesium sodium and potassium water classification was carried out using the dominant ion method with the piper hill langelier diagram custodio and llamas 1996 the sar sodium adsorption ratio was also determined in order to evaluate the risk of sodification of the soils under irrigation as well as the danger of salinization was estimated through the measurement of ec fao 1985 2 2 2 hydraulic parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity k of the pampeano aquifer was estimated by pumping tests at three wells distributed according to the topography high middle and low zone while the storage coefficient s was obtained from hydraulic tests according to the hydrogeological information and type of construction of the wells the theis method for free aquifers was used with the correction of dupuit to verify the trials the methodology of constant recharge of recovery of theis was also applied kruseman and de ridder 2000 they were carried out at constant flow for periods of 22 41 h according to the well and to the stabilization of the level drops in addition to get more hydrogeological information slug test studies were also carried out in eight complementary wells in the area the k was estimated by the method of hvorslev 1951 slug test consists of the introduction of slugs inside the well to produce a sudden rise of the water and then through a diver the successive drops are registered as a function of time until the recovery of the original level subsequently the k of the aquifer was calculated using equation 1 1 k r t 2 l n l r f 2 l t 37 hvorslev 1951 where k is the aquifer permeability rt is the casing radius of the well l is the length of the filter in the well rf is the radius of the filtering zone and t37 is the time in which 37 of the initial ascent remains 2 3 hydrogeological conceptual model and analysis of predictive performance of a numerical model the conceptual model of the study area was built taking into account the available geological hydrogeological and geophysical information and the results of field work and water balance this conceptual model with its geometry was imported to the numerical model using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1983 the horizontal grid was determined with a cell width of 300 m two aquifer layers were defined the upper one corresponding to the phreatic aquifer and the lower one to the semiconfined aquifer up to the bottom the boundary conditions were assigned whose function is to take into account the exchange of water between the aquifer and the surroundings some of these boundaries coincide with the geographic limits of the study area for the northern and southern limits the constant head condition was established according to the historical groundwater levels registered for the eastern and western limits the condition of no flow was assigned and since they are parallel to groundwater flow there is no water passage through them the superficial recharge which enters the aquifer as percolation water from the rain was distributed in 3 sectors according to the geomorphology high medium and low zone the main streams were assigned as boundary of rivers the same hydraulic conductivity k was used for the two layers for the semiconfined aquifer the storage coefficient s was obtained from hydraulic tests and the specific storage coefficient was determined by taking into account the thicknesses of the aquifer depending on the zone for the phreatic aquifer s was obtained using brassington 2007 method the porosity was obtained as an average of the values characteristic of the lithology of the pampeano aquifer the calibration of the numerical model was carried out the static piezometric levels observed in the wells were compared with the levels calculated by the numerical model in order to adjust the hydrogeological parameters the calibration was performed in a qualitative form comparing the maps of the observed and calculated heads and the flow directions and quantitatively through the statistics rms root mean square error using as a criterion to reach a value less than 5 once the calibration was completed a set of simulations of the dynamic levels were carried out with the incorporation of the georeferenced wells with their depths and flow rates in all the cases the simulations were carried out in permanent regime in order to determine the zones or sectors where the greatest level decreases occur simulations of different scenarios of pumping rate for irrigation were carried out for each one of them the flow balance was made to analyze the variations of inputs and outputs between the different compartments that exchange water with the aquifer system streams mountain system lagoon system recharge pumping wells to consider that these balances are adequate it was taken as a criterion that the level of discrepancy between incoming and outgoing flow is close to 0 in order to have a better approximation to the effect of pumping in the most affected areas simulations were carried out with different increasing flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatology and water balance the average annual rainfall was 801 mm for the coronel suárez weather station and 814 mm for pigüé the maximum average temperature corresponding to january was 28 9 c and 27 4 c respectively while the minimum july was 0 3 c and 1 2 c respectively evapotranspiration et has the highest values in january summer for both coronel suárez and pigué station with 124 5 mm and 125 7 mm respectively the lowest rates were for july winter with 15 3 mm and 15 4 mm respectively the water balance is shown in the graph of fig 4 for both the stations it can be seen that in the most part of the year the precipitation rate is above the et so there is no water deficit during the year on the contrary there is a period of excess between september and november for coronel suárez and between august and november for pigüé the excess corresponds to 55 2 and 55 7 mm respectively depending on the characteristics of the study area especially as regards agricultural land use and the depth of the water table the amount of excesses estimated will be available as a potential recharge to the aquifer system which equals to an average amount of 72 9 mm which corresponds to 9 of the annual rainfall of the area 3 2 static levels equipotential map and hydraulic tests fig 5 shows the map with the inventory of wells and the static levels in april 2015 as well as the resulting isolines when comparing the static levels of december 2014 before the irrigation campaign with those measured in april 2015 after the campaign it was established that after the irrigation they recovered their original level the groundwater flow directions were similar before and after the complementary irrigation the area of recharge is placed in the high zone ventania system there is another zone of conduction towards the north foothill and plain sector and the discharge zone is located in the area of the chained lagoons of the sw fig 5 also shows the location of the hydraulic tests 3 pumping tests and 8 slug tests and their estimated values of k saturated hydraulic conductivity these values are in the range of 4 13 12 39 m day and according to brassington 2007 the classification corresponds to a permeability of the aquifer between medium and high fig 6 shows two representative curves from a total of 8 obtained through the slug tests it is observed how the water level rises for each set of slugs introduced into the well 3 peaks in the figure the short recovery time of the original static level less than 1 min is verified as well as the maximum elevation reached less than half a meter 3 3 interpretation of geophysical results fig 7 shows some of the most representative curves of experimental apparent resistivity from a total of 16 ves carried out by losinno et al 2016 in the area located in fig 8 with the fitting curves of the models the tables indicate the resistivity and the thickness of the final 1d model of the fitting the depth of the water level represented by the first significant decrease in the resistivity of the models of the ves wlv was compared with the depth of the static level measured in the nearby wells wlw both levels would approximately coincide taking into account the connection between the phreatic and the semiconfined aquifer in all the cases the unsaturated zone has resistivity values between 30 and 100 ω m according to its lithology fine sands silts except in some cases where an increase in resistivity 400 ω m may be associated with the presence of calcareous layers for example for ves 11 near pigüé town in all the soundings below the unsaturated zone a more conductive layer average resistivity 16 ω m is located which would correspond to the pampeano aquifer followed below in most cases by a more conductive layer which could be indicating an increase interface in the salinity of the water or also a basement cracked with water the last increase in resistivity in the models is associated with the hydrogeological basement which is the lower limit of the aquifers and the exploitation of the water resource whose depth is located for each ves in fig 7 it is necessary to consider that the zone is crossed by some faults see fig 2 that can vary the conditions even in wells located at small distances from one another from the interpretation of these ves results and the models obtained from ves soundings of rizzolo 2011 per com it was possible to determine a more complete map of the isolines of equal depth m of the hydrogeological basement fig 8 which gives an idea of the thickness of the aquifers also counting the unsaturated zone a deepening of the basement from the ventania system can be appreciated to the north of coronel suarez coinciding on a regional scale with the gravimetric negative bouguer anomalies obtained in the area with a minimum along a nw se axis álvarez 2007 this orientation also coincides with the basin axis and faults of claromecó basin shown in fig 2 the decrease in the depth of basement observed near ves4 and ves5 coincides with the increase of the gravimetric anomaly towards the north part of the area which indicates a thinner sedimentary thickness towards the northeast ves 4 and 23 the depth of the basement decreases reaching similar values to those of the sw zone ves 11 17 18 20 and 22 closest to the hilly outcrop all the ves carried out 1 16 from losinno et al 2016 and those reported by rizzolo 2011 per com 17 23 show that the highest resistivity of the aquifer occur in the southern zone near the ventania system to the north the resistivity of the aquifer decreases below 11 ω m on average see fig 7 for ves 4 5 7 and 14 the salinity of the aquifer shows a tendency to increase towards the north with lower resistivity greater conductivity that is salinity coinciding with the previous information the soundings also indicate that the water quality decreases in most of the sites with depth 3 4 hydrochemistry the water classification prior to the irrigation campaign december 2014 was sodium bicarbonated in all the counted wells once the irrigation operations were completed april 2015 the water classification changed being in most part of the study area sodium chlorinated fig 9 a e shows the percentage variations in the contents of the main ions in groundwater comparing the two measurement campaigns 2014 vs 2015 the variation in the electric conductivity is also shown fig 9f each water sample is identified with the letter m the bicarbonate content fig 9a decreased in a generalized way in the area while increasing the chloride cl fig 9d for example in the case of cl it showed an increase between 50 and 270 in most of the study area while in the east and west these variations were up to 380 about electrical conductivity ec as an indicator of water salinity level higher values were recorded in the central zone in the first instance of measurement so the variation in 2015 shows a decrease between 15 and 40 fig 9f on the other hand at the west of the study zone the ec showed an increase greater than 10 reaching values higher than 60 for both years of sampling the water had a moderate risk of salinization fao 1985 fig 10 shows how the ec values april 2015 increase from the high areas ventania system to the low areas chained lagoons of the sw this gradient was related to the geophysical results where the resistivity of the pampeano aquifer decreased to the north the value of the sar sodium absorption ratio and the risk of sodification of the soil are shown in fig 11 each sample of the groundwater has a value of sar associated and the table indicates the risk of sodification of the soil for each sector thus the values of 2015 revealed that the risk of sodification was moderate and remained stable with respect to values of 2014 only three samples highlighted in the figure m18 m30 m31 increased their condition to high risk when checking the water quality for irrigation it should be stated that there is no high risk of soil salinization and sodification however it must be taken into account that in both cases the samples represent a quasi stationary situation of the chemical characteristics of groundwater 3 5 hydrogeological conceptual model the background information and the results generated from field work allowed to establish a preliminary hydrogeological conceptual model of the aquifer system corresponding to the most part of the area destined for complementary irrigation in the zone of coronel suárez a first hydrogeological unit hu1 including the unsaturated zone was identified with a free aquifer behavior with an average thickness of 40 m mainly used to install wells of low depth water mills for domestic use and animal drink the unit has the topography as the upper limit and the semi confined semi free aquifer as the base the second unit hu2 with greater hydrogeological interest because it contains the most productive aquifer and good quality of water corresponds to the pampeano aquifer with a semi confined and semi free behavior mostly comprising a multilayer unit from which the groundwater for irrigation is extracted its minimum thickness average 60 m is located next to the hilly outcrop of ventania and its maximum approximately 240 m between the cities of coronel suárez and huanguelén the base of the aquifer corresponds to the hydrogeological basement hu3 which according to the previous information has secondary porosity with null to very low productivity the greater thicknesses of the pampeano aquifer might be associated with higher water productivity the groundwater flow has a south north direction from the zone of the hilly area 290 m a s l to the sector of the chained lagoons of the sw 110 m a s l where the aquifer discharges the direction of flow coincides with the ec gradient where the ec values increase as the water becomes loaded with salts in its advance towards the discharge zone the borders of the system correspond to conditions of no flow one in the impermeable limit at the outcrop of ventania and the other on the east and west sectors where there is no exchange of groundwater with the external limit the last edge corresponds to the discharge sector of the aquifer northern zone which acquires a condition of constant height given by historical static levels sala and cavalié 1993 based on the preliminary water balance it was established that the main recharge mechanism is the precipitation p while the discharge is the evapotranspiration et there is an exit of water from the system towards the streams and superficial bodies through the underground base flow bodies and streams with winning behavior on the other hand the hydrochemistry allowed the classification of groundwater as sodium bicarbonated type for most of the year when the aquifer is not disturbed for irrigation confirming the hypothesis of rainfall as the principal contribution of the recharge of groundwater the excess water balance resulted in 72 9 mm year 1 the excess corresponds to the sum of the direct runoff rund and the recharge rech it was considered that rund is equivalent to 4 of the annual precipitation for the study area kruse and laurencena 2005 then it was calculated that for a precipitation of 807 6 mm year 1 the rund would be 32 3 mm year 1 resulting in a rech of 40 6 mm year 1 which represents 5 of annual precipitation in fig 12 the representation of the conceptual hydrogeological model is shown corresponding to the aquifer system that supplies groundwater to the agricultural activity in the coronel suarez zone for the application of complementary irrigation 3 6 numerical model and simulations in order to obtain a good calibration of the numerical model it was necessary to include internal boundary conditions assigning to the stream a source character supplying water to the aquifer the results of the calibration of the numerical model are shown in fig 13 a and b where the map of calculated static levels without pumping coincides approximately with the corresponding measured levels in the wells the correlation coefficient between calculated and observed levels is 0 998 rms 2032 then it may be considered that the calibration was acceptable at the study zone there are no data of dynamic levels while pumping so it is not possible to do a calibration for this condition nevertheless an approximation of the probable drawdowns of the levels due to pumping may be assessed through the simulation of this scenario it is important to detect the areas where these drawdowns may be a risk for environmental sustainability the farmer surveys in the area reported an average flow applied to the main crops during the irrigation period of 3240 m3 day this value was entered in the model for each of the 210 existing wells fig 13c and d shows the simulation of the isolines of dynamic levels with pumping superimposed to the initial observed static levels for the layer 1 the phreatic aquifer and the layer 2 semiconfined aquifer respectively a decrease of dynamic levels of phreatic aquifer may be observed at the zone of greater concentration of pumping wells the model simulates at some sectors a dynamic level below the bottom of phreatic aquifer dry cells this behavior is not observed at the areas with wells near the streams which would indicate that the last ones would be giving water to the aquifer the same behavior of the isolines may be detected for the layer 2 it may be observed qualitatively the divergence of lines of groundwater flow over the streams indicating the source character of them in the period of irrigation fig 14 shows the effect of increasing flow of pumping on groundwater system it shows different simulations of scenarios for the descent of the groundwater piezometric levels from situation without pumping a to the maximum simulated flow f the main properties described in the figure are pumping wells streams depth of the water table isoline where the phreatic aquifer dries up the scenario a without pumping shows a water table of less than 10 m depth for the entire study area only in some sectors it is located between 10 and 30 m depth the scenario b corresponds to the current irrigation context where all the 210 wells are active with the average flow rate of 3240 m3 day there are 3 zones where the levels drawdown due to pumping and they exceed the thickness of the phreatic aquifer represented in the model by layer 1 one of the zones with a high density of wells 57 occurs in the central area on the map where groundwater depressions range from 20 m outside blue to 50 m inside green taking into consideration that the thickness of the phreatic aquifer in this sector is 40 m it dries out in the area delimited by the red line zone 1 inside this area the depression reaches the semi confined aquifer layer 2 of the model however this layer does not dry out because it has the greatest layer thickness sedimentary sequence of 240 m see fig 8 in this zone of the study area it can be noted that in the other sectors also with a high presence of wells there are no drawdowns with dry out the fact that the wells are very close to the streams allows the entry of surface water into the phreatic aquifer during the period of groundwater pumping this can be corroborated in the mass balance of the model see fig 15 the two remaining zones where the phreatic aquifer dries up due to pumping can be seen at the west zone 2 and south zone 3 in the map although the wells are more distant from the streams guamini and las tunas zone 2 and 3 respectively the thickness of the phreatic aquifer is lower because the hydrogeological basement rises towards the borders of the study area that in the case of zone 2 it outcrops closely in the ventania system the scenario c corresponds to a flow 30 higher than the current one b as expected the effect is intensified and more clearly seen on the map the area where the water table dries up increases its surface and the cone of dejection deepens reaching depths of 60 m green and even 70 m yellow in zone 2 although in a very small area in the remaining scenarios d e f the flows increase 40 50 and 60 with respect to the current one in all the cases the areas of the three critical zones seem to remain constant due to the contribution of surface water from the nearby streams although in the center of them the descents increase and reach the semi confined aquifer see scenario f with 80 m in the west orange and 110 m in one of the wells in zone 1 fig 15 shows the flow balances and the water inlet and outlet percentages for the entire study area and the five scenarios in all the scenarios the model shows a 0 percentage of discrepancy between the inflows in and outflows out therefore it is confirmed that the flow conditions are consistent in the non pumping scenario a the main source of inflow to the aquifer system is the recharge which represents 68 of the total flow 24 is contributed by streams and 8 by underground flow which has origin in the hilly zone in the south see fig 1 regarding the outflow the streams drain water representing the largest flow 65 while the rest corresponds to the groundwater 35 it discharges into the important system of chained lagoons in the north from scenario b in the output column the extraction of groundwater by pumping is evident orange it can be seen that while the percentage by pumping grows through the scenarios the entry of water from the streams also grows in similar proportions highlighting the important role of streams in the water balance during the irrigation this is consistent with the location of many wells which are aligned on both margins of the most important streams such as sauce corto el huascar and hinojo chico streams this agrees with the divergence of piezometric levels over the streams see fig 13 c however these conditions imply a modification in two other important components of the balance the output of water through the streams decreases strongly from 65 without pumping to 8 scenario f the behavior is similar for the underground flow outlet 35 11 the chained lagoons of the west contributes to the economic activity of several towns in the area that depend on the conservation of the eco hydrological system the situation described in the simulated scenarios acquires environmental implications it could be found that a significant increase in pumping flows noticeably reduces the proportion of water that the aquifer gives to streams that under natural conditions supply the lagoon systems in the area in addition there is a reduction of the underground flow which is directly connected to this water body through its bed on the other hand the important decreases produced in the three zones described in fig 14 at a local level could cause problems such as compaction and reduction of storage in the phreatic aquifer causing subsidence problems which directly affects the capacity of the soil to provide services such as crops and could affect local wetlands it is necessary to take into account that the simulations carried out correspond to an extreme situation with respect to the extraction flows since it is considered that all the wells in the study area are in operation therefore based on our results it could be considered that for an eventual operation of all the installed wells these should be operated with a flow rate not exceeding 3240 m3 day 1 on the other hand it should be considered that given the possibility of an eventual increase in pumping flows it is necessary to reduce the number of active wells especially within the areas identified as critical among other actions to be considered are the control of the volumes exploited through flow meters and assigned according to local properties such as the thickness of the aquifer layers the maximum flow rates could be established according to the drops generated in each group of wells for example for a thickness of 40 m it should be determined the flow that generates a descent of 30 m as the phreatic aquifer is the most affected the possibility of designing wells with a deepest pump could be considered for example in the most productive zone where the thickness of the semi confined aquifer is the greatest see zone 1 in fig 14 another important consideration is the role of streams as providers of water for irrigation it s known that the ventania system with its secondary porosity has the ability to progressively release rainwater and maintain the base flow of the streams all year corroborated by the rural farmers in the surveys it should also be considered the frequent flood events influenced by the hydro morphology of the area gil et al 2016 an environmental assessment process will be necessary to analyze to what extent the use of streams as an input for agricultural activity is feasible while minimizing negative effects on the environment or directly answering questions such as is agricultural activity sustainable in the area without the current contribution of streams in this sense simulations will be an important tool to help decision making for example how the aquifer would be affected if the wells were located further away from the streams the descent of groundwater levels would be also related to its chemical composition as said before there are two areas where the drawdown is stronger zone 1 and 2 in fig 14 these areas coincide with the sectors of greater decrease of bicarbonate concentration after irrigation see fig 9a and increase of chloride concentration fig 9d the measured ec shows a slight increase in the west zone after irrigation fig 9f it may be concluded that the decrease in the dynamic levels may cause in these areas a change in water classification previously observed in the hydrochemical results from sodium bicarbonate to chloride type water probably due to a higher input of water from greater depths similarly an increase in the ec in almost the entire study area greater in the western zone could be related with the groundwater pumping from great depths where it is known that salinity is higher from these results the changes in the interaction between superficial water and groundwater are evident being the first one a drain or source depending on the dry or irrigation period respectively 4 conclusions the hydrogeological conceptual model of the aquifer system at the agricultural zone with complementary irrigation around coronel suarez buenos aires province was obtained from geophysical and hydrogeological information and it was validated numerically for permanent regime and without pumping the pampeano hydrogeological unit is the most productive aquifer with good quality of water and a semi confined behavior mostly comprising a multilayer unit the groundwater flow has a south north direction coincident with the gradient of electrical conductivity the simulation of the dynamic of the phreatic aquifer while wells are being pumped with different flows in permanent regime showed that the aquifer might get dried it was demonstrated that the current pumping flows in the area constitute a maximum possible value to avoid the dry out this might produce a deterioration of the structure and functionality of the aquifer over time this condition might also harm the farmers who use this aquifer for irrigation the alternating condition of source or drain of the streams was demonstrated depending on the irrigation or the dry period respectively great drawdowns of piezometric levels at some areas might be the cause of changes in water classification and could affect wetlands and as consequence the ecohydrological conditions these results warrant the need of planning the use of groundwater in agricultural activity it is important to consider the need that farmers should have records of levels during irrigation times in order to verify the existence of critical areas and have the necessary data for the implementation of a model in transitory state that allows to verify in a more adequate way the impact of the irrigation activity in the area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12005,in argentina the complementary irrigation has increased in most agricultural regions where it is necessary to minimize possible negative impacts on the quantity and quality of groundwater numerical modeling techniques are used to obtain projections of the aquifer dynamics for which a conceptual model is needed that provides the input data in the numerical simulations a hydrogeological conceptual model for a rural area of buenos aires province argentina where complementary irrigation has caused significant depletion of groundwater levels during the irrigation season has been developed it was based on available geophysical and hydrogeological information and measurements of piezometric levels and hydraulic parameters of the aquifer together with the geochemical analysis of groundwater this model was imported to a numerical model and the hydrogeological parameters were adjusted by the calibration with static piezometric levels measured in the wells the conceptual model was validated satisfactorily using a fitting criterion to reach a value of root mean square error less than 5 different simulations of the probable drawdowns of the levels due to pumping were performed in the study area the main hydrogeological unit is semi confined mostly comprising of a multilayer unit with good quality of water its minimum and maximum thickness was 60 and 240 m respectively the groundwater flows northwards from the hilly area to the plains the recharge was 4 6 mm year 1 representing 5 of annual precipitation dynamic simulations show that the aquifer gets dried which questions its sustainability the alternating condition of the source or drain of the streams depends on the irrigation period or the dry season respectively great drawdowns of piezometric levels in some areas might be the cause of changes in water classification these results lead to the need of planning the use of groundwater as a complement to agricultural activity considering sustainable employment of the resource keywords conceptual hydrogeological model complementary irrigation aquifer geophysics 1 introduction in latin america groundwater is a vital resource that plays a strategic role for sustainable development which will be even more important in the next years as water shortages and increased climate variability become significant worldwide concerns oas 2004 1 1 oas organization of american states adverse effects of groundwater overexploitation include water level reduction and storage quality degradation reduction of flow in streams wetlands and springs subsidence of the land uneconomical pumping conditions interference with preexisting uses lamsoge et al 2014 according to fao 2 2 fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations for a global population that will reach 9 billion in 2050 it is obvious that more water will be needed to produce 60 of additional food that will be necessary fao 2017 although in recent years it was possible to provide better quality of food to more people this is often achieved at the expense of water resources and the health of the ecosystems they support fao 2017 in argentina the use of groundwater for irrigation has increased in most of the regions particularly in sub humid and humid regions where complementary irrigation may be strengthened with an integrated approach which maximizes and optimizes its use minimizing possible negative impacts on the quantity and quality of groundwater ministry of agriculture of argentina 2015 overexploitation of groundwater has caused increasing pressure to develop more sophisticated techniques for sustainable management of the aquifers modern numerical modeling techniques have been used to obtain projections of future aquifer conditions in response to a set of proposed scenarios once the model has been developed and calibrated the effects on the aquifer dynamics can be analyzed by altering and testing the model jones et al 2015 for this a correct characterization of groundwater in the study area is necessary in order to obtain a conceptual model that provides the input data for numerical simulations jones et al 2015 therefore the elaboration of the conceptual model is an indispensable step in planning the use of groundwater as a complement to agricultural activity for sustainable use of the resource in the study area numerous workers have applied conceptual models to develop numerical description of groundwater flow related to the overexploitation of water for agricultural irrigation e g liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 li et al 2017 alfaro et al 2017 singh 2014 and farhadi et al 2016 during the last decade in the southwestern sw part of the province of buenos aires argentina more precisely in the rural area around the city of coronel suarez installation of sprinkler irrigation systems has grown steadily that partly explains the growth in the production of extensive crops these production systems use groundwater for complementary irrigation the lack of a management plan and even the knowledge of aquifer characteristics has let do a series of negative environmental impacts viz significant reduction of water levels during the irrigation season pia 3 3 pia pampeano irrigation association coronel suárez group 2013 personal communication there is a lack of knowledge about the effect that the set of pumping wells for irrigation may produce in the level drawdowns in the area the study area is located in an extensive inter hill sedimentary basin the general hydrogeological information is provided by auge 2004 and gonzález 2005 but there is no study at a more localized scale specifically the rural area of coronel suarez more recently a geophysical survey of this zone was carried out by losinno et al 2016 who determined with vertical electrical soundings the depth and thicknesses of the aquifers in some sectors of the study area however more geophysical and hydrogeological information is needed to build the conceptual model the calibration and validation of a numerical model for the simulation of the system is not possible while pumping because of the lack of available data on dynamic levels in the wells nevertheless an estimation of probable drawdown levels due to pumping can be done this objective may constitute the basis for the future study of the possible changes on groundwater dynamics due to irrigation contributing to a sustainable agricultural practice and minimizing the negative impacts on ecohydrological systems the application of geophysics to describe the morphology of aquifers has been used by several authors in different environments viz hasan et al 2018 levi et al 2018 and boiero et al 2010 in the study area that has geological complexity due to the proximity of the hill system of ventania and the limited number of wells the background hydrogeological information was collected through field works a previous preliminary geophysical survey was complemented with other geophysical information from the study area pumping tests and physico chemical groundwater analysis 2 methodology for the construction of the conceptual model a detailed review of the local geology and hydrogeology and climate data was performed the field work consisted of inventory of wells measurement of piezometric levels hydraulic tests integration of different geophysical surveys previously carried out analysis of water samples and physicochemical characterization of surface and groundwater and their interaction following hydrogeological characterization of the aquifer system considering all the attributes together a preliminary water balance was established in this way the conceptual model takes into account the natural system adequately and determines the accuracy of the predictive capacity of the subsequent numerical model sea 2012 the conceptual model of the study area with its geometrical configuration was imported to the numerical model using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1983 and the calibration was performed by comparing the calculated static piezometric levels with the ones measured in the wells in order to adjust the hydrogeological parameters of the model following this a simulation of dynamic piezometric levels was carried out through taking into account the flow rates and depth of groundwater wells used for complementary irrigation consequently the impact of agricultural activity of irrigation over groundwater resources could be assessed 2 1 study area and regional framework the study area is located in the southwestern sw part of the buenos aires province in argentina between 37 91 and 36 82 s and 61 32 and 62 55 w covering an approximate area of 9200 km2 around the city of coronel suárez the northern limit of the study is marked by the system of the so called chained lagoons of sw while its southern limit is the orographic system of ventania its eastern boundary is defined by the quinihual and salado streams while the pigüé stream forms its western boundary fig 1 the surface hydrology of the study area that mostly belongs to the basin of the chained lagoons of the sw is characterized by enclosed lagoons which receive streams coming down from the hills of ventania flowing in south north direction fig 1 the sauce corto stream is the main course in the middle basin the stream el huascar flows in northeast direction through the vallimanca stream basin and discharges outside the study area ministry of internal affairs 2017 these streams and other ones of lesser extension such as guaminí cura malal grande hinojo chico and las tunas maintain a permanent regime ign 2020 2 1 1 climate in order to estimate the recharge to the aquifer system calculation of monthly water balance custodio and llamas 1996 was used the potential evapotranspiration the maximum amount of water that can return from the soil to the atmosphere by evaporation through the vegetation cover was estimated by the thornthwaite method thornthwaite and mather 1955 the data of temperature and precipitation correspond to coronel suarez and pigüé weather stations for a period between 1982 and 2016 34 years national meteorological service nms 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology fig 2 shows the geological framework of the study area it is located in the claromecó sedimentary basin between the orographic system of ventania precambrian and paleozoic rocks and the outcrop of the hilly system of tandilia both from the upper paleozoic this basin is asymmetric with maximum depth of 6000 m estimated using geophysical studies showing a minimum in the gravimetric and magnetic anomalies along a nw se axis in agreement with claromecó trench fig 2 kostadinoff 2007 gravimetric anomalies increase towards the ventania system sw and lamadrid ne according to selles martínez 1987 between the towns of c suarez lamadrid and benito juárez the crystalline basement remains very high this characteristic could have prevented the drainage towards the atlantic ocean and on the contrary could have driven part of its drainage to the north geological information from two well reports were taken into account don pedro and la colina wells see fig 1 stratigraphically postpampeano sediments consist of silty sand and fine sand with consolidated calcareous rocks decreasing consolidation with depth the pampeano sediments are approximately 18 56 m depth with sandy silts and scarce fine sand loess of pliopleistocene according to auge 2004 the study area corresponds mainly to the inter hilly plane hydrogeological region between the orographic systems of ventania and tandilia fig 3 the pospampeano sediments with reduced thickness usually less than 5 m constitute the unsaturated zone underlying this the pampeano sedimentary unit is of greatest hydrogeological interest because it hosts the most productive and good quality aquifer widely used in both rural and urban areas the perforation for the wells in the study area is difficult due to the existence of up to 5 m thick massive calcareous layers the upper section of the pampeano sedimentary unit hosts the free aquifer while in the lower levels the degree of confinement increases generating semi confined aquifers with the thickness exceeding 40 or 50 m the pampean aquifer rests directly on the hydrogeological basement formed by paleozoic or proterozoic rocks without tertiary units paraná or olivos formations the hydrogeological basement forms a discontinuous anisotropic and heterogeneous medium with water in fissures and null to very low productivity in azul foothills of tandilia system the hydrogeological basement is located at 150 m depth and in laprida inter hilly plane region at 170 m the aquifer characteristics of the inter hilly plane region are summarized in table 1 for the study area gonzález 2005 agrees with the hydrogeological horizons previously described and recognizes a direct autochthon recharge and another one by underground flow from the hilly region towards the north chained lagoons of sw and ne through vallimanca basin the local discharge occurs towards the streams with an inflowing behavior near the hills the pampeano aquifer water has low salinity 2000 mg l in the inter hilly plane due to the very slow circulation salinity is likely to exceed 2000 mg l another hydrogeological region with smaller extension within the study area is the endorheic region in the sw coinciding with the endorheic basin of the chained lagoons of the sw fig 3 in that part the pampeano aquifer is semiconfined at depth underlying the paraná formation comprising of clays forms an aquiclude whereas a sandy packet below the clay layer from the same formation contains saline waters and shows positive potentiometric levels the basement is composed of paleozoic rocks the recharge of the system is directly autochthonous due to the good permeability of the outcrops sands the underground flow has a centripetal behavior towards the lagoons being the discharge of the system exclusively consumptive evapotranspiration evaporation 2 1 3 geophysics according to rizzolo 2011 personalcommunication who performed vertical electrical soundings ves at the study zone the depth of the hydrogeological basement decreases towards huanguelén and guaminí cities given the geological complexity observed in fig 2 where the zone includes a lot of faults and the nearby system of ventania together with the lack of a complete geophysical information a set of sixteen ves were carried out previously by our group losinno et al 2016 covering the study area in order to have a more homogeneous distribution of soundings the schlumberger allred et al 2008 configuration was used with a maximum opening up to 2000m in order to ensure the end points in the curves corresponding to the increase in resistivity caused by the presence of the hydrogeological basement the 1d layer models were obtained by inversion of experimental data these results were compared with previous geophysical information and the geological and hydrogeological background and ended up completing the information coming from the inventory of wells the determination of water table depth was estimated from geoelectrical models 2 2 field work 2 2 1 well inventory measurement of piezometric levels and hydrochemistry although the study area has a large number of rural farmers who use groundwater for complementary irrigation a subset of these wells were surveyed grouped in the pampeano irrigation association pia 2014 the characteristics of pumping equipment and flow rates were obtained for thirty wells the well depths are in the range of 80 100 m tapping the pampeano aquifer it must be considered that inside the well there is an interconnection between the phreatic and the deeper aquifers because most of the wells are not piped the static piezometric levels were measured before and after the irrigation season in december 2014 and april 2015 respectively in the same campaigns december 2014 and april 2015 thirty five water samples were extracted the hydrochemistry allows a better understanding of the dynamics of the groundwater flows and allowed to evaluate the variation of groundwater quality before and after the irrigation period the parameters analyzed were electrical conductivity ec ph and the concentration of major ions according to the standard methods s m 2018 bicarbonate chloride sulfate calcium magnesium sodium and potassium water classification was carried out using the dominant ion method with the piper hill langelier diagram custodio and llamas 1996 the sar sodium adsorption ratio was also determined in order to evaluate the risk of sodification of the soils under irrigation as well as the danger of salinization was estimated through the measurement of ec fao 1985 2 2 2 hydraulic parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity k of the pampeano aquifer was estimated by pumping tests at three wells distributed according to the topography high middle and low zone while the storage coefficient s was obtained from hydraulic tests according to the hydrogeological information and type of construction of the wells the theis method for free aquifers was used with the correction of dupuit to verify the trials the methodology of constant recharge of recovery of theis was also applied kruseman and de ridder 2000 they were carried out at constant flow for periods of 22 41 h according to the well and to the stabilization of the level drops in addition to get more hydrogeological information slug test studies were also carried out in eight complementary wells in the area the k was estimated by the method of hvorslev 1951 slug test consists of the introduction of slugs inside the well to produce a sudden rise of the water and then through a diver the successive drops are registered as a function of time until the recovery of the original level subsequently the k of the aquifer was calculated using equation 1 1 k r t 2 l n l r f 2 l t 37 hvorslev 1951 where k is the aquifer permeability rt is the casing radius of the well l is the length of the filter in the well rf is the radius of the filtering zone and t37 is the time in which 37 of the initial ascent remains 2 3 hydrogeological conceptual model and analysis of predictive performance of a numerical model the conceptual model of the study area was built taking into account the available geological hydrogeological and geophysical information and the results of field work and water balance this conceptual model with its geometry was imported to the numerical model using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1983 the horizontal grid was determined with a cell width of 300 m two aquifer layers were defined the upper one corresponding to the phreatic aquifer and the lower one to the semiconfined aquifer up to the bottom the boundary conditions were assigned whose function is to take into account the exchange of water between the aquifer and the surroundings some of these boundaries coincide with the geographic limits of the study area for the northern and southern limits the constant head condition was established according to the historical groundwater levels registered for the eastern and western limits the condition of no flow was assigned and since they are parallel to groundwater flow there is no water passage through them the superficial recharge which enters the aquifer as percolation water from the rain was distributed in 3 sectors according to the geomorphology high medium and low zone the main streams were assigned as boundary of rivers the same hydraulic conductivity k was used for the two layers for the semiconfined aquifer the storage coefficient s was obtained from hydraulic tests and the specific storage coefficient was determined by taking into account the thicknesses of the aquifer depending on the zone for the phreatic aquifer s was obtained using brassington 2007 method the porosity was obtained as an average of the values characteristic of the lithology of the pampeano aquifer the calibration of the numerical model was carried out the static piezometric levels observed in the wells were compared with the levels calculated by the numerical model in order to adjust the hydrogeological parameters the calibration was performed in a qualitative form comparing the maps of the observed and calculated heads and the flow directions and quantitatively through the statistics rms root mean square error using as a criterion to reach a value less than 5 once the calibration was completed a set of simulations of the dynamic levels were carried out with the incorporation of the georeferenced wells with their depths and flow rates in all the cases the simulations were carried out in permanent regime in order to determine the zones or sectors where the greatest level decreases occur simulations of different scenarios of pumping rate for irrigation were carried out for each one of them the flow balance was made to analyze the variations of inputs and outputs between the different compartments that exchange water with the aquifer system streams mountain system lagoon system recharge pumping wells to consider that these balances are adequate it was taken as a criterion that the level of discrepancy between incoming and outgoing flow is close to 0 in order to have a better approximation to the effect of pumping in the most affected areas simulations were carried out with different increasing flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatology and water balance the average annual rainfall was 801 mm for the coronel suárez weather station and 814 mm for pigüé the maximum average temperature corresponding to january was 28 9 c and 27 4 c respectively while the minimum july was 0 3 c and 1 2 c respectively evapotranspiration et has the highest values in january summer for both coronel suárez and pigué station with 124 5 mm and 125 7 mm respectively the lowest rates were for july winter with 15 3 mm and 15 4 mm respectively the water balance is shown in the graph of fig 4 for both the stations it can be seen that in the most part of the year the precipitation rate is above the et so there is no water deficit during the year on the contrary there is a period of excess between september and november for coronel suárez and between august and november for pigüé the excess corresponds to 55 2 and 55 7 mm respectively depending on the characteristics of the study area especially as regards agricultural land use and the depth of the water table the amount of excesses estimated will be available as a potential recharge to the aquifer system which equals to an average amount of 72 9 mm which corresponds to 9 of the annual rainfall of the area 3 2 static levels equipotential map and hydraulic tests fig 5 shows the map with the inventory of wells and the static levels in april 2015 as well as the resulting isolines when comparing the static levels of december 2014 before the irrigation campaign with those measured in april 2015 after the campaign it was established that after the irrigation they recovered their original level the groundwater flow directions were similar before and after the complementary irrigation the area of recharge is placed in the high zone ventania system there is another zone of conduction towards the north foothill and plain sector and the discharge zone is located in the area of the chained lagoons of the sw fig 5 also shows the location of the hydraulic tests 3 pumping tests and 8 slug tests and their estimated values of k saturated hydraulic conductivity these values are in the range of 4 13 12 39 m day and according to brassington 2007 the classification corresponds to a permeability of the aquifer between medium and high fig 6 shows two representative curves from a total of 8 obtained through the slug tests it is observed how the water level rises for each set of slugs introduced into the well 3 peaks in the figure the short recovery time of the original static level less than 1 min is verified as well as the maximum elevation reached less than half a meter 3 3 interpretation of geophysical results fig 7 shows some of the most representative curves of experimental apparent resistivity from a total of 16 ves carried out by losinno et al 2016 in the area located in fig 8 with the fitting curves of the models the tables indicate the resistivity and the thickness of the final 1d model of the fitting the depth of the water level represented by the first significant decrease in the resistivity of the models of the ves wlv was compared with the depth of the static level measured in the nearby wells wlw both levels would approximately coincide taking into account the connection between the phreatic and the semiconfined aquifer in all the cases the unsaturated zone has resistivity values between 30 and 100 ω m according to its lithology fine sands silts except in some cases where an increase in resistivity 400 ω m may be associated with the presence of calcareous layers for example for ves 11 near pigüé town in all the soundings below the unsaturated zone a more conductive layer average resistivity 16 ω m is located which would correspond to the pampeano aquifer followed below in most cases by a more conductive layer which could be indicating an increase interface in the salinity of the water or also a basement cracked with water the last increase in resistivity in the models is associated with the hydrogeological basement which is the lower limit of the aquifers and the exploitation of the water resource whose depth is located for each ves in fig 7 it is necessary to consider that the zone is crossed by some faults see fig 2 that can vary the conditions even in wells located at small distances from one another from the interpretation of these ves results and the models obtained from ves soundings of rizzolo 2011 per com it was possible to determine a more complete map of the isolines of equal depth m of the hydrogeological basement fig 8 which gives an idea of the thickness of the aquifers also counting the unsaturated zone a deepening of the basement from the ventania system can be appreciated to the north of coronel suarez coinciding on a regional scale with the gravimetric negative bouguer anomalies obtained in the area with a minimum along a nw se axis álvarez 2007 this orientation also coincides with the basin axis and faults of claromecó basin shown in fig 2 the decrease in the depth of basement observed near ves4 and ves5 coincides with the increase of the gravimetric anomaly towards the north part of the area which indicates a thinner sedimentary thickness towards the northeast ves 4 and 23 the depth of the basement decreases reaching similar values to those of the sw zone ves 11 17 18 20 and 22 closest to the hilly outcrop all the ves carried out 1 16 from losinno et al 2016 and those reported by rizzolo 2011 per com 17 23 show that the highest resistivity of the aquifer occur in the southern zone near the ventania system to the north the resistivity of the aquifer decreases below 11 ω m on average see fig 7 for ves 4 5 7 and 14 the salinity of the aquifer shows a tendency to increase towards the north with lower resistivity greater conductivity that is salinity coinciding with the previous information the soundings also indicate that the water quality decreases in most of the sites with depth 3 4 hydrochemistry the water classification prior to the irrigation campaign december 2014 was sodium bicarbonated in all the counted wells once the irrigation operations were completed april 2015 the water classification changed being in most part of the study area sodium chlorinated fig 9 a e shows the percentage variations in the contents of the main ions in groundwater comparing the two measurement campaigns 2014 vs 2015 the variation in the electric conductivity is also shown fig 9f each water sample is identified with the letter m the bicarbonate content fig 9a decreased in a generalized way in the area while increasing the chloride cl fig 9d for example in the case of cl it showed an increase between 50 and 270 in most of the study area while in the east and west these variations were up to 380 about electrical conductivity ec as an indicator of water salinity level higher values were recorded in the central zone in the first instance of measurement so the variation in 2015 shows a decrease between 15 and 40 fig 9f on the other hand at the west of the study zone the ec showed an increase greater than 10 reaching values higher than 60 for both years of sampling the water had a moderate risk of salinization fao 1985 fig 10 shows how the ec values april 2015 increase from the high areas ventania system to the low areas chained lagoons of the sw this gradient was related to the geophysical results where the resistivity of the pampeano aquifer decreased to the north the value of the sar sodium absorption ratio and the risk of sodification of the soil are shown in fig 11 each sample of the groundwater has a value of sar associated and the table indicates the risk of sodification of the soil for each sector thus the values of 2015 revealed that the risk of sodification was moderate and remained stable with respect to values of 2014 only three samples highlighted in the figure m18 m30 m31 increased their condition to high risk when checking the water quality for irrigation it should be stated that there is no high risk of soil salinization and sodification however it must be taken into account that in both cases the samples represent a quasi stationary situation of the chemical characteristics of groundwater 3 5 hydrogeological conceptual model the background information and the results generated from field work allowed to establish a preliminary hydrogeological conceptual model of the aquifer system corresponding to the most part of the area destined for complementary irrigation in the zone of coronel suárez a first hydrogeological unit hu1 including the unsaturated zone was identified with a free aquifer behavior with an average thickness of 40 m mainly used to install wells of low depth water mills for domestic use and animal drink the unit has the topography as the upper limit and the semi confined semi free aquifer as the base the second unit hu2 with greater hydrogeological interest because it contains the most productive aquifer and good quality of water corresponds to the pampeano aquifer with a semi confined and semi free behavior mostly comprising a multilayer unit from which the groundwater for irrigation is extracted its minimum thickness average 60 m is located next to the hilly outcrop of ventania and its maximum approximately 240 m between the cities of coronel suárez and huanguelén the base of the aquifer corresponds to the hydrogeological basement hu3 which according to the previous information has secondary porosity with null to very low productivity the greater thicknesses of the pampeano aquifer might be associated with higher water productivity the groundwater flow has a south north direction from the zone of the hilly area 290 m a s l to the sector of the chained lagoons of the sw 110 m a s l where the aquifer discharges the direction of flow coincides with the ec gradient where the ec values increase as the water becomes loaded with salts in its advance towards the discharge zone the borders of the system correspond to conditions of no flow one in the impermeable limit at the outcrop of ventania and the other on the east and west sectors where there is no exchange of groundwater with the external limit the last edge corresponds to the discharge sector of the aquifer northern zone which acquires a condition of constant height given by historical static levels sala and cavalié 1993 based on the preliminary water balance it was established that the main recharge mechanism is the precipitation p while the discharge is the evapotranspiration et there is an exit of water from the system towards the streams and superficial bodies through the underground base flow bodies and streams with winning behavior on the other hand the hydrochemistry allowed the classification of groundwater as sodium bicarbonated type for most of the year when the aquifer is not disturbed for irrigation confirming the hypothesis of rainfall as the principal contribution of the recharge of groundwater the excess water balance resulted in 72 9 mm year 1 the excess corresponds to the sum of the direct runoff rund and the recharge rech it was considered that rund is equivalent to 4 of the annual precipitation for the study area kruse and laurencena 2005 then it was calculated that for a precipitation of 807 6 mm year 1 the rund would be 32 3 mm year 1 resulting in a rech of 40 6 mm year 1 which represents 5 of annual precipitation in fig 12 the representation of the conceptual hydrogeological model is shown corresponding to the aquifer system that supplies groundwater to the agricultural activity in the coronel suarez zone for the application of complementary irrigation 3 6 numerical model and simulations in order to obtain a good calibration of the numerical model it was necessary to include internal boundary conditions assigning to the stream a source character supplying water to the aquifer the results of the calibration of the numerical model are shown in fig 13 a and b where the map of calculated static levels without pumping coincides approximately with the corresponding measured levels in the wells the correlation coefficient between calculated and observed levels is 0 998 rms 2032 then it may be considered that the calibration was acceptable at the study zone there are no data of dynamic levels while pumping so it is not possible to do a calibration for this condition nevertheless an approximation of the probable drawdowns of the levels due to pumping may be assessed through the simulation of this scenario it is important to detect the areas where these drawdowns may be a risk for environmental sustainability the farmer surveys in the area reported an average flow applied to the main crops during the irrigation period of 3240 m3 day this value was entered in the model for each of the 210 existing wells fig 13c and d shows the simulation of the isolines of dynamic levels with pumping superimposed to the initial observed static levels for the layer 1 the phreatic aquifer and the layer 2 semiconfined aquifer respectively a decrease of dynamic levels of phreatic aquifer may be observed at the zone of greater concentration of pumping wells the model simulates at some sectors a dynamic level below the bottom of phreatic aquifer dry cells this behavior is not observed at the areas with wells near the streams which would indicate that the last ones would be giving water to the aquifer the same behavior of the isolines may be detected for the layer 2 it may be observed qualitatively the divergence of lines of groundwater flow over the streams indicating the source character of them in the period of irrigation fig 14 shows the effect of increasing flow of pumping on groundwater system it shows different simulations of scenarios for the descent of the groundwater piezometric levels from situation without pumping a to the maximum simulated flow f the main properties described in the figure are pumping wells streams depth of the water table isoline where the phreatic aquifer dries up the scenario a without pumping shows a water table of less than 10 m depth for the entire study area only in some sectors it is located between 10 and 30 m depth the scenario b corresponds to the current irrigation context where all the 210 wells are active with the average flow rate of 3240 m3 day there are 3 zones where the levels drawdown due to pumping and they exceed the thickness of the phreatic aquifer represented in the model by layer 1 one of the zones with a high density of wells 57 occurs in the central area on the map where groundwater depressions range from 20 m outside blue to 50 m inside green taking into consideration that the thickness of the phreatic aquifer in this sector is 40 m it dries out in the area delimited by the red line zone 1 inside this area the depression reaches the semi confined aquifer layer 2 of the model however this layer does not dry out because it has the greatest layer thickness sedimentary sequence of 240 m see fig 8 in this zone of the study area it can be noted that in the other sectors also with a high presence of wells there are no drawdowns with dry out the fact that the wells are very close to the streams allows the entry of surface water into the phreatic aquifer during the period of groundwater pumping this can be corroborated in the mass balance of the model see fig 15 the two remaining zones where the phreatic aquifer dries up due to pumping can be seen at the west zone 2 and south zone 3 in the map although the wells are more distant from the streams guamini and las tunas zone 2 and 3 respectively the thickness of the phreatic aquifer is lower because the hydrogeological basement rises towards the borders of the study area that in the case of zone 2 it outcrops closely in the ventania system the scenario c corresponds to a flow 30 higher than the current one b as expected the effect is intensified and more clearly seen on the map the area where the water table dries up increases its surface and the cone of dejection deepens reaching depths of 60 m green and even 70 m yellow in zone 2 although in a very small area in the remaining scenarios d e f the flows increase 40 50 and 60 with respect to the current one in all the cases the areas of the three critical zones seem to remain constant due to the contribution of surface water from the nearby streams although in the center of them the descents increase and reach the semi confined aquifer see scenario f with 80 m in the west orange and 110 m in one of the wells in zone 1 fig 15 shows the flow balances and the water inlet and outlet percentages for the entire study area and the five scenarios in all the scenarios the model shows a 0 percentage of discrepancy between the inflows in and outflows out therefore it is confirmed that the flow conditions are consistent in the non pumping scenario a the main source of inflow to the aquifer system is the recharge which represents 68 of the total flow 24 is contributed by streams and 8 by underground flow which has origin in the hilly zone in the south see fig 1 regarding the outflow the streams drain water representing the largest flow 65 while the rest corresponds to the groundwater 35 it discharges into the important system of chained lagoons in the north from scenario b in the output column the extraction of groundwater by pumping is evident orange it can be seen that while the percentage by pumping grows through the scenarios the entry of water from the streams also grows in similar proportions highlighting the important role of streams in the water balance during the irrigation this is consistent with the location of many wells which are aligned on both margins of the most important streams such as sauce corto el huascar and hinojo chico streams this agrees with the divergence of piezometric levels over the streams see fig 13 c however these conditions imply a modification in two other important components of the balance the output of water through the streams decreases strongly from 65 without pumping to 8 scenario f the behavior is similar for the underground flow outlet 35 11 the chained lagoons of the west contributes to the economic activity of several towns in the area that depend on the conservation of the eco hydrological system the situation described in the simulated scenarios acquires environmental implications it could be found that a significant increase in pumping flows noticeably reduces the proportion of water that the aquifer gives to streams that under natural conditions supply the lagoon systems in the area in addition there is a reduction of the underground flow which is directly connected to this water body through its bed on the other hand the important decreases produced in the three zones described in fig 14 at a local level could cause problems such as compaction and reduction of storage in the phreatic aquifer causing subsidence problems which directly affects the capacity of the soil to provide services such as crops and could affect local wetlands it is necessary to take into account that the simulations carried out correspond to an extreme situation with respect to the extraction flows since it is considered that all the wells in the study area are in operation therefore based on our results it could be considered that for an eventual operation of all the installed wells these should be operated with a flow rate not exceeding 3240 m3 day 1 on the other hand it should be considered that given the possibility of an eventual increase in pumping flows it is necessary to reduce the number of active wells especially within the areas identified as critical among other actions to be considered are the control of the volumes exploited through flow meters and assigned according to local properties such as the thickness of the aquifer layers the maximum flow rates could be established according to the drops generated in each group of wells for example for a thickness of 40 m it should be determined the flow that generates a descent of 30 m as the phreatic aquifer is the most affected the possibility of designing wells with a deepest pump could be considered for example in the most productive zone where the thickness of the semi confined aquifer is the greatest see zone 1 in fig 14 another important consideration is the role of streams as providers of water for irrigation it s known that the ventania system with its secondary porosity has the ability to progressively release rainwater and maintain the base flow of the streams all year corroborated by the rural farmers in the surveys it should also be considered the frequent flood events influenced by the hydro morphology of the area gil et al 2016 an environmental assessment process will be necessary to analyze to what extent the use of streams as an input for agricultural activity is feasible while minimizing negative effects on the environment or directly answering questions such as is agricultural activity sustainable in the area without the current contribution of streams in this sense simulations will be an important tool to help decision making for example how the aquifer would be affected if the wells were located further away from the streams the descent of groundwater levels would be also related to its chemical composition as said before there are two areas where the drawdown is stronger zone 1 and 2 in fig 14 these areas coincide with the sectors of greater decrease of bicarbonate concentration after irrigation see fig 9a and increase of chloride concentration fig 9d the measured ec shows a slight increase in the west zone after irrigation fig 9f it may be concluded that the decrease in the dynamic levels may cause in these areas a change in water classification previously observed in the hydrochemical results from sodium bicarbonate to chloride type water probably due to a higher input of water from greater depths similarly an increase in the ec in almost the entire study area greater in the western zone could be related with the groundwater pumping from great depths where it is known that salinity is higher from these results the changes in the interaction between superficial water and groundwater are evident being the first one a drain or source depending on the dry or irrigation period respectively 4 conclusions the hydrogeological conceptual model of the aquifer system at the agricultural zone with complementary irrigation around coronel suarez buenos aires province was obtained from geophysical and hydrogeological information and it was validated numerically for permanent regime and without pumping the pampeano hydrogeological unit is the most productive aquifer with good quality of water and a semi confined behavior mostly comprising a multilayer unit the groundwater flow has a south north direction coincident with the gradient of electrical conductivity the simulation of the dynamic of the phreatic aquifer while wells are being pumped with different flows in permanent regime showed that the aquifer might get dried it was demonstrated that the current pumping flows in the area constitute a maximum possible value to avoid the dry out this might produce a deterioration of the structure and functionality of the aquifer over time this condition might also harm the farmers who use this aquifer for irrigation the alternating condition of source or drain of the streams was demonstrated depending on the irrigation or the dry period respectively great drawdowns of piezometric levels at some areas might be the cause of changes in water classification and could affect wetlands and as consequence the ecohydrological conditions these results warrant the need of planning the use of groundwater in agricultural activity it is important to consider the need that farmers should have records of levels during irrigation times in order to verify the existence of critical areas and have the necessary data for the implementation of a model in transitory state that allows to verify in a more adequate way the impact of the irrigation activity in the area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12006,the quality of groundwater in the lower anayari catchment was assessed for its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes the lower anayari catchment lies in a semi arid region in ghana and covers an area of about 253 km2 the area is predominantly an agricultural area and groundwater is the main source of water for domestic and agricultural purposes sixty six groundwater samples were collected from boreholes and hand dug wells the samples were analysed for their physico chemical properties calcium ca2 and bicarbonate hco3 were the most abundant cation and anion respectively the major water types in the study area are of ca mg hco3 and the mixed ca mg cl type the water chemistry is mainly controlled by reverse ion exchange dissolution of minerals and evaporation the quality of groundwater for drinking and domestic use was assessed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index wqi approach and the values showed that 94 of the samples were of good quality while 6 were of poor quality the groundwater was generally good for drinking except for some few samples which showed elevated f and no3 concentrations above the who guideline values of 1 5 mg l and 50 mg l respectively the quality of groundwater for irrigation was also assessed and the ec na sar and rsc ranged between 240 and 710 μs cm 23 54 38 93 0 47 1 04 and 1 9 to 0 09 respectively the groundwater in the area has low sodicity with medium salinization and can generally be used for irrigation without prior treatment groundwater quality in the anayari catchment is influenced by geology with little anthropogenic influence hence proper groundwater management strategies and policies are needed to protect the aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water types mineral dissolution anthropogenic activities anayari catchment 1 introduction groundwater is an important resource for human development it is a dependable source of water supply in many areas of the world in arid and semi arid areas it is the most reliable source of water for irrigation household use and other economic activities as it is the most available the anayari catchment located in the upper east region is predominantly an agricultural area and during the dry season the farmers largely depend on groundwater for irrigation and domestic activities dickson 2016 the demand for groundwater continues to increase due to the effects of pollution industrial contamination irrigation and urbanization egbi et al 2018 kortatsi et al 2009 the constituents of groundwater are a result of its interactions in the hydrological cycle this interaction could result in degradation of groundwater from undesired constituents resulting in concentrations of constituents that affect the quality groundwater is also affected by human activities that introduce contaminants into the environment it is important to understand the hydrochemistry and quality of groundwater for efficient management and protection of the resource groundwater hydrochemistry has been used to identify and interpret groundwater quality the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality and to determine the water chemistry loh et al 2019 li et al 2016 gibrilla et al 2011 zakaria et al 2012 kortatsi et al 2008 anku et al 2009 loh et al 2019 studied the hydrochemistry of some aquifers in northern ghana and their study revealed that dissolution of silicates and the influence of anthropogenic activities such as agrochemicals and domestic wastewater were the main processes that influenced the hydrochemistry in the area anim gyampo et al 2018 assessed the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in the atankwidi basin and identified silicate weathering and cationic exchange as the main chemical controls that alter groundwater chemistry with anthropogenic activities contributing insignificantly to the groundwater chemistry the study of egbi et al 2018 in the lower volta river basin of ghana revealed that silicate weathering evaporate dissolution cation exchange and salinity influenced the groundwater chemistry the presence of salts in irrigation water can affect the soil structure and crop yield arid and semi arid regions are particularly vulnerable to salinity and sodicity because of low annual rainfall levels and high daily temperatures which leads to high water evaporation adhanom 2019 jalali 2007 assessment of salinity and sodicity hazards is essential for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture the suitability of water for irrigation has been investigated by a number of researchers using such parameters as electrical conductivity ec residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium adsorption ratio sar loh et al 2019 egbi et al 2018 houatmia et al 2016 li et al 2013 kortatsi et al 2009 the investigation of salinity and sodicity hazards by loh et al 2019 in northern ghana identified the groundwater in the area to be of low sodicity s1 and ranged between low to high salinity c1 c3 in the volta region of ghana banoeng yakubu et al 2009 evaluated the suitability of groundwater for irrigation and established that the groundwater in the area ranged from medium salinity to low sodicity c1 s1 and to a lesser extent low salinity to low sodicity c3 s1 anku et al 2009 also assessed the salinity and sodicity of the groundwater in crystalline basement rocks in northern ghana and found that the aquifers exhibited low sodicity low salinity and low sodicity medium salinity characteristics a number of studies have been carried out for the assessment of water resources in the upper east region of ghana antwi et al 2017 quantified the surface and groundwater resources in the catchment and estimated a sustainable groundwater irrigation capacity to be about 4500 ha ofosu 2011 also characterized the productivities of the different irrigation technologies in the area and suggested that with adequate fertilizer application the technologies used in small farms resulted in higher productivity apambire et al 1997 has also studied the geochemistry genesis and distribution of fluoride and attributed the source of fluoride in the groundwater to dissolution of fluorite and anion exchange this study is therefore aimed at evaluating the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the anayari catchment and its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes this study will help to identify the hydrogeochemical processes that are responsible for the formation of major ions in the groundwater and also improve our understanding of the factors that control groundwater quality in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the anayari river lies within the white volta river basin it is a transboundary river and takes its source from burkina faso and flows through the upper east region of ghana the study area is the downstream end of the catchment which is in the upper east region of ghana and constitute about 47 of the total area of anayari catchment kadyampakeni et al 2017 antwi et al 2017 dickson 2016 ofosu et al 2010 it covers an area of about 253 km2 the catchment extends from latitude 10 50 0 11 0 0 n and longitude 1 7 30 0 57 30 w fig 1 the climate of the study area is mainly semi arid the area has a mono modal rainfall distribution which begins approximately in early may and ends in late october the mean annual rainfall in the area is about 993 mm the highest temperatures are usually observed from early march and the lowest temperatures caused by the harmattan winds occur in december and january the average annual evaporation is about 1723 mm which is about twice the annual precipitation high relative humidity of about 65 is observed during the rainy season the high humidity decreases rapidly to less than 10 after the end of the rainy season in october martin 2006 wrc 2011 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is underlain mainly by the birimian supergroup strata of volcanic rocks and synvolcanic intrusive rocks which are strongly foliated and were intruded by large granitoid masses during the palaeoproterozoic snc lavalin 2011 the main rocks in the area are biotite granitoid and volcanic flow subvolcanic rock and minor interbedded volcaniclastics ggs 2009 the dominant geology in the area is the precambrian basement pcb rocks these rocks have low primary porosities and permeabilities groundwater flow is mainly controlled by secondary porosity and occurs in the weathered zone and fractured zone snc lavalin 2011 three categories of aquifers have been described in the study area these are the perched regolith and fractured aquifers liebe 2002 the perched aquifers occur at shallow depths and are discontinuous with an average thickness of about 1 m the perched aquifer dries up during the dry season the regolith aquifers are unconfined continuous and occur at depth averaging to about 23m with hydraulic conductivity of 0 2 2 2 m d martin and van de giesen 2005 barry et al 2010 the regolith aquifer constitutes about 80 of groundwater resources in unconfined regolith aquifers the fractured aquifers are semi confined in nature the regolith and fractured aquifers form an integrated aquifer system however the regolith aquifer can exhibit a higher transmissivity than the fractured rock aquifer due to its greater saturated thickness transmissivity in birimian aquifers ranges between 0 1 and 143 3 m2 d with an average of 16 6 m2 d snc lavalin 2011 2 3 field work and laboratory analysis sixty six borehole bh and hand dug well hdw samples were collected from the study area for physiochemical analyses the samples were collected into sterilized 500 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles by filtering the water through 0 45 μm filter membranes the temperature ph electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids tds were measured on the field ph and temperature were tested with the hm 200 ph meter and the electrical conductivity and tds were measured with the wtw multi 3320 multi parameter instrument samples were then transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until analysis the cations na k ca and mg were analysed with the hplc shimadzu lc 20ad ion chromatograph the anions nitrate sulphate and phosphate were determined with the shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer alkalinity was determined by titration using 0 1n hcl chloride concentrations were determined by argentometric titration and fluoride was tested using spadns with the hach dr 900 colorimeter sample blanks duplicates and standards were routinely analysed to ensure quality control of analytical data the electroneutrality of the data was assessed by calculating the charge balance error e using equation 1 and only sample data with

the analytical data was plotted on the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 using diagrammes version 6 5 silva filho et al 2009 simler 2009 to study the hydrogeochemical facies the piper diagram includes two triangle fields a cation field and an anion field the plotting from the two triangle fields is extended into a diamond field which gives the overall characteristics of the water bivariate relationships of the major ions ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 ca2 vs so4 2 cl vs na k total cations vs na k were also plotted to study the mechanisms that control groundwater chemistry in the study area 2 4 2 water quality index wqi the groundwater was assessed for its suitability for drinking using the weighted arithmetic water quality index wawqi method brown et al 1972 the who 2011 standard for drinking water was used to calculate the water quality index the physicochemical parameters were each assigned a weight wi based on their effects on the overall quality of drinking water weights between 1 and

total number of parameters a quality rating qi was then calculated for each water parameter using equation 7 7 q i c i s i 100 where qi is the quality ci is the concentration of each water parameter

computed using equations 10 11 12 and 13 respectively soluble sodium percentage na defined by doneen 1964 as 10 na na k ca mg na k 100 the sodium adsorption ratio sar by richards 1954 is defined as 11

results and discussion 3 1 water chemistry results of the analysed parameters are presented as a statistical summary in table 1 and box plots in fig 2 the ph of the bh and hdw samples range from 7 10 to 8 73 and 7 84 to 7 63 with averages of 7 84 and 7 96 respectively ph values between 6 5 and 8 5 indicate good quality water who 2004 the highest ph value is recorded in nagtunia while the lowest is recorded in pungu central the value of groundwater ph does not have a direct human health effect however groundwater in the acidic medium ph 6 could increase the dissolution and leaching of heavy metals while higher ph is likely to enhance the precipitation of calcite minerals ansari et al 2015 nishtha 2012 singh et al 2011 the tds values range between 132 and 391 mg l and 180 360 mg l with averages of 244 05 and 263 67 mg l for bh and hdw respectively from the classification of groundwater by freeze and cherry 1979 the groundwater samples in the area are freshwater as the tds values are less than 1000 mg l the total hardness values for bh and hdw are from 54 95 to 172 55 mg l and 81 41 to 139 21 respectively the general guidelines for classification of total hardness of water are as follows a range between 0 and 60 mg l caco3 is classified as soft 61 120 mg l as moderately hard 121 180 mg l as hard and more than 180 mg l as very hard mcgowan 2000 the groundwaters in the area are in an acceptable range for tds and hardness who 2011 the average concentrations of cations in both boreholes and hand dug wells decreased in the order ca2 na mg2 k and for the anions the average concentrations in boreholes and hand dug wells decreased in the order hco3 2 cl no3 so4 2 f and hco3 2 cl so4 2 no3 f respectively table 1 in general the average ion concentrations for bh samples are slightly lower than for hdw except for mg2 and no3 whose ion concentrations for bh were slightly higher than for hdw fig 2 calcium is the most abundant cation in the study area and the concentration ranges between 9 19 and 26 63 mg l with an average of 18 62 mg l for bh and for hdw samples the range is 15 34 28 23 and the average is 20 63 mg l the major source of ca2 in groundwater is ion exchange of minerals from the rocks in the area the presence of ca2 could also be due to the presence of caco3 and caso4 minerals calcite dolomite gypsum and anhydrite in the soil evaporation of soil water can also result in increased concentrations of these minerals in the soil which could leach into groundwater earle 2019 concentration of mg2 ranges from 7 13 to 27 98 mg l and 10 50 19 11 mg l with an averages of 16 27 and 15 31 mg l for bh and hdw respectively magnesium containing minerals like dolomite and magnesite can be weathered from rock into water it could also be present in water as a result of fertilizer application sodium in groundwater occurs from the dissolution of minerals or cation exchange or both keesari et al 2016 suggests that high sodium in groundwater could also result from sewage contamination and infiltration of agricultural runoff sodium concentration ranges between 10 7 and 27 10 mg l all the groundwater samples 100 have ca2 mg2 and na concentrations within the who 2011 desirable limit the ranges of k for bh and hdw are 5 85 12 18 mg l and 8 18 12 08 mg l with averages of 9 45 and 10 19 mg l respectively the who permissible limit for k is 12 mg l and about 98 5 of the samples are within this limit potassium occurs in minerals like feldspars which dissolve from weathering processes the feldspars are however not very significant potassium compound producers synthetic fertilizers such as potassium nitrate is also a source of potassium in groundwater the most abundant anion in the water is hco3 with ranges of 46 162 mg l and 71 134 mg l and averages of 91 88 mg l and 97 33 mg l for bh and hdw respectively hco3 occurrence in groundwater could be an indication of interaction of water with weathered granites and granitic gneisses chloride concentrations in bh and hdw range from 15 99 to 64 97 mg l and 21 99 53 97 mg l with averages of 31 32 and 38 65 mg l respectively cl occurrence in groundwater could result from anthropogenic activities such as the application of manure and chemical fertilizers over pumping of groundwater and leaching of chloride from top soil during irrigation the concentrations of hco3 and cl in all of the groundwater samples are within the who guideline limit of 600 mg l sulphate in the groundwater ranges from 7 32 to 28 34 mg l and 7 94 22 16 mg l with averages of 11 67 and 14 99 mg l respectively and all the samples 100 are below the maximum guideline value of 600 mg l so4 2 in groundwater could result from the interaction of rain water with soil the presence of reduced sulfide minerals nitrate reduction fertilization and organic matter are all some sources of so4 2 in groundwater the range of f in the bh and hdw are 0 14 1 98 mg l and 0 46 1 25 mg l with averages of 0 68 and 0 78 mg l respectively 3 of the samples have f concentration above the desirable limit f in groundwater generally result from weathering and dissolution of f bearing minerals mukherjee and singh 2018 raju et al 2009 suggests that alkaline waters tend to solubilize f minerals geological formations found in the area include variety of metamorphic and igneous rock formations with fluorite and apatite being the common fluorine bearing minerals in the formations alfredo et al 2014 nitrate concentration in the samples range between 0 0 and 51 6 mg l and 9 42 19 22 mg l with averages of 20 37 and 14 13 mg l respectively about 98 5 of the samples are within the desirable limit of the who 2011 the occurrence of nitrate in groundwater has been attributed to atmospheric nitrogen deposition animal waste and sewage discharge in agricultural areas like the anayari catchment nitrate sources in groundwater could be as a result of applications of organic and inorganic fertilizers and animal manure anornu et al 2017 xue et al 2009 3 2 hydrochemical facies the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 fig 3 was used for the interpretation of the inorganic constituents in the study area on the

exceed the alkali metals na k most of the samples also plot in sub division 3 where strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions the groundwater samples are of ca mg hco3 and the mixed ca mg cl type ca mg hco3 is the more dominant water type occurring in about 54 of the samples while ca mg cl water type constitutes about 45 ca mg hco3 type waters are characterized by temporary hardness and it indicates that the groundwater is undergoing recharge the dominant process associated with ca mg hco3 waters are silicate weathering reverse ion exchange and mineral dissolution raju and singh 2017 yidana 2010 3 3 processes influencing groundwater chemistry hydrogeochemistry of groundwater depend on several factors for protection of groundwater quality and development of the resource it is important to gain a clear understanding of the main factors that influence the chemistry to study the formation mechanisms of water gibbs proposed the well known gibbs diagram the gibbs diagram is useful for analyzing major natural factors influencing groundwater formation mechanisms according to the gibbs diagrams groundwater formation mechanisms include three types rock dominance precipitation dominance and evaporation dominance gibbs 1970 in fig 4 all the samples plot in the middle of the gibbs diagrams this suggests an interaction between the host rock and groundwater gaillardet et al 1999 suggested the na normalized molar ratio models to help identify the major weathering and dissolution mechanisms that influence the groundwater chemistry the models are made from a plot of na normalized ca2 versus hco3 and na normalized ca2 versus mg2 on a logarithmic scale waters draining carbonates have the na normalized ratios of ca na 50 mg na 10 and hco3 na 120 waters draining silicates have the following na normalized ratios ca na 0 35 0 15 mg na 0 24 0 2 and hco3 na 2 1 waters draining evaporites are depleted in hco3 relative to ca2 and mg2 and results in a downward deviation from the silicate carbonate line luo et al 2018 gaillardet et al 1999 from the na normalized ca2 versus hco3 and na normalized ca2 versus mg2 plots fig 5 a and b the groundwater samples plot closer to the silicate weathering domain than the carbonate or evaporate dissolution domains and this indicates that the groundwater is influenced by dissolution of silicate minerals 3 3 1 rock weathering when ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are derived from the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum a plot of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 will have plots near the 1 1 line plots above the 1 1 line indicates a reverse ion exchange reaction while plots below the 1 1 line indicates ion exchange reaction an observation of the plot in fig 6 a shows that some of the samples plotted close to the 1 1 indicating that excess of mg2 and ca2 may be due to dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum more of the samples however plot above the 1 1 line of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 6a plot suggesting that reverse ion exchange is the dominant reaction responsible for hco3 and so4 2 in the groundwater the samples however plot away from the 1 1 line of the ca2 versus so4 2 graph fig 6b which indicates that gypsum may not be a contributing factor to the ions the dissolution of calcite and dolomite is revealed by the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 mayo and loucks 1995 a ratio less than or equal to 1 indicates dissolution of dolomite rocks a ratio greater than 1 indicates contribution from a more dominant calcite from fig 6e most of the samples plotted below the line of ratio less than 1 suggesting that dissolution of dolomite rocks is a dominant factor contributing to ions in the groundwater on a plot of na k against cl data plotting along the 1 1 equiline suggests the occurrence of evaporite dissolution if the data plot below the 1 1 line then silicate weathering is occurring and data plots above the 1 1 suggests the occurrence of reverse ion exchange reactions on fig 6c most of the data plots below the 1 1 line suggesting silicate weathering as a dominant process which contributes ions to groundwater some of the data also plot above the 1 1 line indicating reverse ion exchange also influences the presence of ions in the groundwater some of the samples however plot along the line this could be an indication of the occurrence of evaporation processes and the influence of anthropogenic activities sajil kumar et al 2019 also when silicate weathering is involved in a geochemical process sample data would plot above the 1 1 line of a na k versus total cation graph from fig 6d the data plot above the line which confirms that weathering of silicate minerals contribute to the groundwater chemistry 3 3 2 ion exchange index plot of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 versus na k cl has been used by a number of authors to study the contribution of ion exchange to groundwater chemistry jalali 2007 yidana 2010 qian et al 2016 li et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 if ion exchange between na and ca2 mg2 is a significant process contributing to the groundwater chemistry the relation between them should be linear with a slope close to 1 fig 6f shows that most of the samples plot within the first and fourth quadrants this indicates an absence of ionic exchange and suggests that reverse ion exchange is a dominant process that contributes to the groundwater chemistry the chloroalkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 was calculated to confirm the reverse ion exchange process an ion exchange between na or k with mg2 or ca2 in groundwater will result in positive values for both cai 1 and cai 2 and the exchange is a direct base exchange and for the occurrence of reverse ion exchange both cai 1 and cai 2 values will be negative and the exchange is indirect which suggests chloroalkaline imbalance thakur et al 2016 schoeller 1965 fig 7 shows that about 71 of the samples had an indirect exchange reaction and about 29 had direct base reaction reverse ion exchange is therefore a major contributor to the groundwater chemistry 3 4 groundwater suitability for drinking and for domestic use brown et al 1972 classified the computed wqi into excellent 0 25 good 26 50 poor 51 75 very poor 76 100 and unsuitable for drinking above 100 the wqi calculated for the area ranged between 30 03 and 56 14 the area exhibits two kinds of groundwater quality as shown on the spatial distribution map fig 8 about 94 of the groundwater samples are categorized as good and 6 categorized as poor the poor quality groundwater samples are characterized by relatively high bicarbonate sulphate nitrate and fluoride ions and are from boreholes located in paga kakug paga chania and zenga all in the north western portion of the area fig 8 3 5 groundwater suitability for irrigation the mineral constituents of water used for irrigation has effects on both soil and plants irrigation water with excess salt can alter the physical and chemical structure of soil and affect plants growth adhanom 2019 the suitability of water for irrigation in the catchment was therefore assessed using the ec sodium percentage na the wilcox diagram sodium adsorption ratio sar and the residual sodium carbonate rsc the statistical summary of irrigated water quality indices is presented on table 3 according to the tds classification by ayers and westcott 1985 water with tds less than 450 mg l is classified as none and is suitable for irrigation water with tds value between 450 and 2000 mg l is classified slight to moderate and water with tds value greater than 2000 mg l is classified severe and not suitable for irrigation the tds of the sampled groundwater ranged between 132 and 391 mg l and are therefore suitable for irrigation groundwater with ec value less than 700 μs cm is classified as excellent and suitable for irrigation ec value between 700 and 3000 μs cm is good while ec value greater than 3000 μs cm is fair ayers and westcott 1985 the ec of sampled groundwater ranged between 240 and 710 μs cm and are suitable for irrigation the residual sodium carbonate rsc is used to determine the effect of bicarbonate on the quality of water for agricultural purposes water with rsc values less than 1 25 is safe for irrigation and water with rsc greater than 2 5 is not suitable for irrigation the rsc values for groundwater in the area ranged between 1 9 and 0 09 with an average of 0 75 table 4 and are therefore suitable for irrigation the negative rsc values also negate the possibility of na build up in soil ramesh and elango 2011 the na of the samples ranges between 23 55 and 38 93 with an average of 30 93 table 4 the maximum na content for irrigation has been set to 60 groundwater samples are good for irrigation with respect to na the wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 classifies water irrigation suitability based on the na meq l and the ec on fig 9 all samples fell in the field of excellent to good indicating that all of the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation sodium adsorption ratio sar is also an important parameter used to determine groundwater suitability for irrigation it is a measure of the alkali or sodium hazard to crops water with sar values greater than 9 is not suitable for irrigation as it could lead to the development of saline or alkaline soils todd 1980 the sar values for the area ranged between 0 5 and 1 table 4 and suggests that based on sar the groundwater is suitable for irrigation the groundwater samples plotted on the us salinity diagram ussl fig 10 showed that most of the samples are within the c2 s1 category indicating a medium salinity and low sodicity water the water can be used for irrigation on almost all soils with little risk of harmful exchangeable sodium and can also be used to grow most crops with moderate salt tolerance dhok et al 2011 the use of groundwater for irrigation has significantly increased food production in the anayari catchment vegetables such as tomatoes pepper cabbage and carrot are mainly cultivated through irrigation during the dry season dickson 2016 ofosu 2011 it is therefore reassuring to observe that the quality of groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation this outcome will greatly support the ghana government initiative on planting for food and jobs pfj which largely hinges on irrigation since rainfall pattern in the study area does not reliably support commercial production of food crops all year round tanko et al 2019 a comprehensive study is however required to help determine the groundwater age residence time and recharge rate in order to protect the groundwater from overexploitation rising water table and quality deterioration 4 conclusion statistical analysis reveals the relative concentrations of the groundwater constituents as na ca2 mg2 k for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f for anions the groundwater samples are fresh with tds values less 1000 mg l the water types are of ca mg hco3 and the mixed ca mg cl type the groundwater in the study area is mainly influenced by rock dominance but reverse ion exchange and dissolution of dolomite minerals also control the groundwater chemistry the water quality index of the groundwater was calculated and it shows that 94 of the samples are of good and 6 are of poor quality the groundwater in the area is largely of good quality and suitable for drinking and domestic purposes high values of fluoride and nitrate at few sampling sites however make water from these sites unsuitable for drinking and domestic use based on the assessment of the ec sodium percentage na sodium adsorption ratio sar and the residual sodium carbonate rsc the groundwater samples are of medium salinity and low sodicity and are all 100 suitable for irrigation groundwater in the anayari catchment can mostly be used for drinking and irrigation without prior treatment or special agricultural intervention in general the groundwater quality in the catchment is influenced by geology with little anthropogenic influence hence proper groundwater management strategies and policies are needed to protect the aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors

12006,the quality of groundwater in the lower anayari catchment was assessed for its suitability for drinking domestic and irrigation purposes the lower anayari catchment lies in a semi arid region in ghana and covers an area of about 253 km2 the area is predominantly an agricultural area and groundwater is the main source of water for domestic and agricultural purposes sixty six groundwater samples were collected from boreholes and hand dug wells the samples were analysed for their physico chemical properties calcium ca2 and bicarbonate hco3 were the most abundant cation and anion respectively the major water types in the study area are of ca mg hco3 and the mixed ca mg cl type the water chemistry is mainly controlled by reverse ion exchange dissolution of minerals and evaporation the quality of groundwater for drinking and domestic use was assessed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index wqi approach and the values showed that 94 of the samples were of good quality while 6 were of poor quality the groundwater was generally good for drinking except for some few samples which showed elevated f and no3 concentrations above the who guideline values of 1 5 mg l and 50 mg l respectively the quality of groundwater for irrigation was also assessed and the ec na sar and rsc ranged between 240 and 710 μs cm 23 54 38 93 0 47 1 04 and 1 9 to 0 09 respectively the groundwater in the area has low sodicity with medium salinization and can generally be used for irrigation without prior treatment groundwater quality in the anayari catchment is influenced by geology with little anthropogenic influence hence proper groundwater management strategies and policies are needed to protect the aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water types mineral dissolution anthropogenic activities anayari catchment 1 introduction groundwater is an important resource for human development it is a dependable source of water supply in many areas of the world in arid and semi arid areas it is the most reliable source of water for irrigation household use and other economic activities as it is the most available the anayari catchment located in the upper east region is predominantly an agricultural area and during the dry season the farmers largely depend on groundwater for irrigation and domestic activities dickson 2016 the demand for groundwater continues to increase due to the effects of pollution industrial contamination irrigation and urbanization egbi et al 2018 kortatsi et al 2009 the constituents of groundwater are a result of its interactions in the hydrological cycle this interaction could result in degradation of groundwater from undesired constituents resulting in concentrations of constituents that affect the quality groundwater is also affected by human activities that introduce contaminants into the environment it is important to understand the hydrochemistry and quality of groundwater for efficient management and protection of the resource groundwater hydrochemistry has been used to identify and interpret groundwater quality the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality and to determine the water chemistry loh et al 2019 li et al 2016 gibrilla et al 2011 zakaria et al 2012 kortatsi et al 2008 anku et al 2009 loh et al 2019 studied the hydrochemistry of some aquifers in northern ghana and their study revealed that dissolution of silicates and the influence of anthropogenic activities such as agrochemicals and domestic wastewater were the main processes that influenced the hydrochemistry in the area anim gyampo et al 2018 assessed the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in the atankwidi basin and identified silicate weathering and cationic exchange as the main chemical controls that alter groundwater chemistry with anthropogenic activities contributing insignificantly to the groundwater chemistry the study of egbi et al 2018 in the lower volta river basin of ghana revealed that silicate weathering evaporate dissolution cation exchange and salinity influenced the groundwater chemistry the presence of salts in irrigation water can affect the soil structure and crop yield arid and semi arid regions are particularly vulnerable to salinity and sodicity because of low annual rainfall levels and high daily temperatures which leads to high water evaporation adhanom 2019 jalali 2007 assessment of salinity and sodicity hazards is essential for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture the suitability of water for irrigation has been investigated by a number of researchers using such parameters as electrical conductivity ec residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium adsorption ratio sar loh et al 2019 egbi et al 2018 houatmia et al 2016 li et al 2013 kortatsi et al 2009 the investigation of salinity and sodicity hazards by loh et al 2019 in northern ghana identified the groundwater in the area to be of low sodicity s1 and ranged between low to high salinity c1 c3 in the volta region of ghana banoeng yakubu et al 2009 evaluated the suitability of groundwater for irrigation and established that the groundwater in the area ranged from medium salinity to low sodicity c1 s1 and to a lesser extent low salinity to low sodicity c3 s1 anku et al 2009 also assessed the salinity and sodicity of the groundwater in crystalline basement rocks in northern ghana and found that the aquifers exhibited low sodicity low salinity and low sodicity medium salinity characteristics a number of studies have been carried out for the assessment of water resources in the upper east region of ghana antwi et al 2017 quantified the surface and groundwater resources in the catchment and estimated a sustainable groundwater irrigation capacity to be about 4500 ha ofosu 2011 also characterized the productivities of the different irrigation technologies in the area and suggested that with adequate fertilizer application the technologies used in small farms resulted in higher productivity apambire et al 1997 has also studied the geochemistry genesis and distribution of fluoride and attributed the source of fluoride in the groundwater to dissolution of fluorite and anion exchange this study is therefore aimed at evaluating the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the anayari catchment and its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes this study will help to identify the hydrogeochemical processes that are responsible for the formation of major ions in the groundwater and also improve our understanding of the factors that control groundwater quality in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the anayari river lies within the white volta river basin it is a transboundary river and takes its source from burkina faso and flows through the upper east region of ghana the study area is the downstream end of the catchment which is in the upper east region of ghana and constitute about 47 of the total area of anayari catchment kadyampakeni et al 2017 antwi et al 2017 dickson 2016 ofosu et al 2010 it covers an area of about 253 km2 the catchment extends from latitude 10 50 0 11 0 0 n and longitude 1 7 30 0 57 30 w fig 1 the climate of the study area is mainly semi arid the area has a mono modal rainfall distribution which begins approximately in early may and ends in late october the mean annual rainfall in the area is about 993 mm the highest temperatures are usually observed from early march and the lowest temperatures caused by the harmattan winds occur in december and january the average annual evaporation is about 1723 mm which is about twice the annual precipitation high relative humidity of about 65 is observed during the rainy season the high humidity decreases rapidly to less than 10 after the end of the rainy season in october martin 2006 wrc 2011 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is underlain mainly by the birimian supergroup strata of volcanic rocks and synvolcanic intrusive rocks which are strongly foliated and were intruded by large granitoid masses during the palaeoproterozoic snc lavalin 2011 the main rocks in the area are biotite granitoid and volcanic flow subvolcanic rock and minor interbedded volcaniclastics ggs 2009 the dominant geology in the area is the precambrian basement pcb rocks these rocks have low primary porosities and permeabilities groundwater flow is mainly controlled by secondary porosity and occurs in the weathered zone and fractured zone snc lavalin 2011 three categories of aquifers have been described in the study area these are the perched regolith and fractured aquifers liebe 2002 the perched aquifers occur at shallow depths and are discontinuous with an average thickness of about 1 m the perched aquifer dries up during the dry season the regolith aquifers are unconfined continuous and occur at depth averaging to about 23m with hydraulic conductivity of 0 2 2 2 m d martin and van de giesen 2005 barry et al 2010 the regolith aquifer constitutes about 80 of groundwater resources in unconfined regolith aquifers the fractured aquifers are semi confined in nature the regolith and fractured aquifers form an integrated aquifer system however the regolith aquifer can exhibit a higher transmissivity than the fractured rock aquifer due to its greater saturated thickness transmissivity in birimian aquifers ranges between 0 1 and 143 3 m2 d with an average of 16 6 m2 d snc lavalin 2011 2 3 field work and laboratory analysis sixty six borehole bh and hand dug well hdw samples were collected from the study area for physiochemical analyses the samples were collected into sterilized 500 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles by filtering the water through 0 45 μm filter membranes the temperature ph electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids tds were measured on the field ph and temperature were tested with the hm 200 ph meter and the electrical conductivity and tds were measured with the wtw multi 3320 multi parameter instrument samples were then transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until analysis the cations na k ca and mg were analysed with the hplc shimadzu lc 20ad ion chromatograph the anions nitrate sulphate and phosphate were determined with the shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer alkalinity was determined by titration using 0 1n hcl chloride concentrations were determined by argentometric titration and fluoride was tested using spadns with the hach dr 900 colorimeter sample blanks duplicates and standards were routinely analysed to ensure quality control of analytical data the electroneutrality of the data was assessed by calculating the charge balance error e using equation 1 and only sample data with charge balance error within 5 were used for data analysis 1 e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 where ionic concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per litre meq l 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 groundwater classification gibbs 1970 proposed two diagrams to interpret such hydrogeochemical processes as precipitation rock water interaction and evaporation in groundwater geochemistry the diagrams consist of plots of the ratios of cations and anions against their corresponding tds the ratios are calculated using equations 2 and 3 below 2 ratio 1 cations na k na k ca 3 ratio 2 anions cl cl hco 3 the exchange of ions between the groundwater and its host environment during its course in the aquifer can be studied using the chloroalkaline indices proposed by schoeller 1965 the chloroalkaline indices 1 and 2 cai 1 and cai 2 were calculated using equations 4 and 5 and plotted in fig 7 4 cai 1 cl na k cl 5 cai 2 cl na k so 4 hco 3 no 3 values are expressed in meq l the analytical data was plotted on the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 using diagrammes version 6 5 silva filho et al 2009 simler 2009 to study the hydrogeochemical facies the piper diagram includes two triangle fields a cation field and an anion field the plotting from the two triangle fields is extended into a diamond field which gives the overall characteristics of the water bivariate relationships of the major ions ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 ca2 vs so4 2 cl vs na k total cations vs na k were also plotted to study the mechanisms that control groundwater chemistry in the study area 2 4 2 water quality index wqi the groundwater was assessed for its suitability for drinking using the weighted arithmetic water quality index wawqi method brown et al 1972 the who 2011 standard for drinking water was used to calculate the water quality index the physicochemical parameters were each assigned a weight wi based on their effects on the overall quality of drinking water weights between 1 and 5 were assigned to each water parameter table 2 and the relative weight wi calculated using equation 6 6 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the weight of each parameter n is the total number of parameters a quality rating qi was then calculated for each water parameter using equation 7 7 q i c i s i 100 where qi is the quality ci is the concentration of each water parameter si is the who 2011 drinking water standard the water quality index wqi is then computed from summation of the sub indices si of each chemical parameter using equations 8 and 9 8 s i i w i q i 9 w q i s i i n where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter wi is the relative weight of the ith parameter qi is the rating based on concentration of the ith parameter n is the number of chemical parameters 2 4 3 irrigation water quality the irrigation water quality parameters sodium percentage na the sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi were computed using equations 10 11 12 and 13 respectively soluble sodium percentage na defined by doneen 1964 as 10 na na k ca mg na k 100 the sodium adsorption ratio sar by richards 1954 is defined as 11 sar meq l na ca mg 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc by eaton 1950 and richards 1954 12 rsc meq l hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 permeability index pi by doneen 1964 13 pi na hco 3 na mg ca 100 the wilcox 1955 and united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 diagrams were used to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation the wilcox diagram was generated using diagrammes version 6 5 silva filho et al 2009 simler 2009 by plotting the sar values against their corresponding ec values the ussl diagram was also generated from microsoft excel by plotting the na against their corresponding ec values 3 results and discussion 3 1 water chemistry results of the analysed parameters are presented as a statistical summary in table 1 and box plots in fig 2 the ph of the bh and hdw samples range from 7 10 to 8 73 and 7 84 to 7 63 with averages of 7 84 and 7 96 respectively ph values between 6 5 and 8 5 indicate good quality water who 2004 the highest ph value is recorded in nagtunia while the lowest is recorded in pungu central the value of groundwater ph does not have a direct human health effect however groundwater in the acidic medium ph 6 could increase the dissolution and leaching of heavy metals while higher ph is likely to enhance the precipitation of calcite minerals ansari et al 2015 nishtha 2012 singh et al 2011 the tds values range between 132 and 391 mg l and 180 360 mg l with averages of 244 05 and 263 67 mg l for bh and hdw respectively from the classification of groundwater by freeze and cherry 1979 the groundwater samples in the area are freshwater as the tds values are less than 1000 mg l the total hardness values for bh and hdw are from 54 95 to 172 55 mg l and 81 41 to 139 21 respectively the general guidelines for classification of total hardness of water are as follows a range between 0 and 60 mg l caco3 is classified as soft 61 120 mg l as moderately hard 121 180 mg l as hard and more than 180 mg l as very hard mcgowan 2000 the groundwaters in the area are in an acceptable range for tds and hardness who 2011 the average concentrations of cations in both boreholes and hand dug wells decreased in the order ca2 na mg2 k and for the anions the average concentrations in boreholes and hand dug wells decreased in the order hco3 2 cl no3 so4 2 f and hco3 2 cl so4 2 no3 f respectively table 1 in general the average ion concentrations for bh samples are slightly lower than for hdw except for mg2 and no3 whose ion concentrations for bh were slightly higher than for hdw fig 2 calcium is the most abundant cation in the study area and the concentration ranges between 9 19 and 26 63 mg l with an average of 18 62 mg l for bh and for hdw samples the range is 15 34 28 23 and the average is 20 63 mg l the major source of ca2 in groundwater is ion exchange of minerals from the rocks in the area the presence of ca2 could also be due to the presence of caco3 and caso4 minerals calcite dolomite gypsum and anhydrite in the soil evaporation of soil water can also result in increased concentrations of these minerals in the soil which could leach into groundwater earle 2019 concentration of mg2 ranges from 7 13 to 27 98 mg l and 10 50 19 11 mg l with an averages of 16 27 and 15 31 mg l for bh and hdw respectively magnesium containing minerals like dolomite and magnesite can be weathered from rock into water it could also be present in water as a result of fertilizer application sodium in groundwater occurs from the dissolution of minerals or cation exchange or both keesari et al 2016 suggests that high sodium in groundwater could also result from sewage contamination and infiltration of agricultural runoff sodium concentration ranges between 10 7 and 27 10 mg l all the groundwater samples 100 have ca2 mg2 and na concentrations within the who 2011 desirable limit the ranges of k for bh and hdw are 5 85 12 18 mg l and 8 18 12 08 mg l with averages of 9 45 and 10 19 mg l respectively the who permissible limit for k is 12 mg l and about 98 5 of the samples are within this limit potassium occurs in minerals like feldspars which dissolve from weathering processes the feldspars are however not very significant potassium compound producers synthetic fertilizers such as potassium nitrate is also a source of potassium in groundwater the most abundant anion in the water is hco3 with ranges of 46 162 mg l and 71 134 mg l and averages of 91 88 mg l and 97 33 mg l for bh and hdw respectively hco3 occurrence in groundwater could be an indication of interaction of water with weathered granites and granitic gneisses chloride concentrations in bh and hdw range from 15 99 to 64 97 mg l and 21 99 53 97 mg l with averages of 31 32 and 38 65 mg l respectively cl occurrence in groundwater could result from anthropogenic activities such as the application of manure and chemical fertilizers over pumping of groundwater and leaching of chloride from top soil during irrigation the concentrations of hco3 and cl in all of the groundwater samples are within the who guideline limit of 600 mg l sulphate in the groundwater ranges from 7 32 to 28 34 mg l and 7 94 22 16 mg l with averages of 11 67 and 14 99 mg l respectively and all the samples 100 are below the maximum guideline value of 600 mg l so4 2 in groundwater could result from the interaction of rain water with soil the presence of reduced sulfide minerals nitrate reduction fertilization and organic matter are all some sources of so4 2 in groundwater the range of f in the bh and hdw are 0 14 1 98 mg l and 0 46 1 25 mg l with averages of 0 68 and 0 78 mg l respectively 3 of the samples have f concentration above the desirable limit f in groundwater generally result from weathering and dissolution of f bearing minerals mukherjee and singh 2018 raju et al 2009 suggests that alkaline waters tend to solubilize f minerals geological formations found in the area include variety of metamorphic and igneous rock formations with fluorite and apatite being the common fluorine bearing minerals in the formations alfredo et al 2014 nitrate concentration in the samples range between 0 0 and 51 6 mg l and 9 42 19 22 mg l with averages of 20 37 and 14 13 mg l respectively about 98 5 of the samples are within the desirable limit of the who 2011 the occurrence of nitrate in groundwater has been attributed to atmospheric nitrogen deposition animal waste and sewage discharge in agricultural areas like the anayari catchment nitrate sources in groundwater could be as a result of applications of organic and inorganic fertilizers and animal manure anornu et al 2017 xue et al 2009 3 2 hydrochemical facies the piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 fig 3 was used for the interpretation of the inorganic constituents in the study area on the cation ternary diagram most of the samples plot in the no dominant field indicating that the groundwaters are mostly of mixed type few of the samples however plot on the mg type field on the anion diagram the samples scatter on the hco3 type no dominant type and cl type fields on the central diamond shaped diagram all the samples plot in sub division 1 where the alkaline earth metals ca mg exceed the alkali metals na k most of the samples also plot in sub division 3 where strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions the groundwater samples are of ca mg hco3 and the mixed ca mg cl type ca mg hco3 is the more dominant water type occurring in about 54 of the samples while ca mg cl water type constitutes about 45 ca mg hco3 type waters are characterized by temporary hardness and it indicates that the groundwater is undergoing recharge the dominant process associated with ca mg hco3 waters are silicate weathering reverse ion exchange and mineral dissolution raju and singh 2017 yidana 2010 3 3 processes influencing groundwater chemistry hydrogeochemistry of groundwater depend on several factors for protection of groundwater quality and development of the resource it is important to gain a clear understanding of the main factors that influence the chemistry to study the formation mechanisms of water gibbs proposed the well known gibbs diagram the gibbs diagram is useful for analyzing major natural factors influencing groundwater formation mechanisms according to the gibbs diagrams groundwater formation mechanisms include three types rock dominance precipitation dominance and evaporation dominance gibbs 1970 in fig 4 all the samples plot in the middle of the gibbs diagrams this suggests an interaction between the host rock and groundwater gaillardet et al 1999 suggested the na normalized molar ratio models to help identify the major weathering and dissolution mechanisms that influence the groundwater chemistry the models are made from a plot of na normalized ca2 versus hco3 and na normalized ca2 versus mg2 on a logarithmic scale waters draining carbonates have the na normalized ratios of ca na 50 mg na 10 and hco3 na 120 waters draining silicates have the following na normalized ratios ca na 0 35 0 15 mg na 0 24 0 2 and hco3 na 2 1 waters draining evaporites are depleted in hco3 relative to ca2 and mg2 and results in a downward deviation from the silicate carbonate line luo et al 2018 gaillardet et al 1999 from the na normalized ca2 versus hco3 and na normalized ca2 versus mg2 plots fig 5 a and b the groundwater samples plot closer to the silicate weathering domain than the carbonate or evaporate dissolution domains and this indicates that the groundwater is influenced by dissolution of silicate minerals 3 3 1 rock weathering when ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are derived from the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum a plot of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 will have plots near the 1 1 line plots above the 1 1 line indicates a reverse ion exchange reaction while plots below the 1 1 line indicates ion exchange reaction an observation of the plot in fig 6 a shows that some of the samples plotted close to the 1 1 indicating that excess of mg2 and ca2 may be due to dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum more of the samples however plot above the 1 1 line of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 6a plot suggesting that reverse ion exchange is the dominant reaction responsible for hco3 and so4 2 in the groundwater the samples however plot away from the 1 1 line of the ca2 versus so4 2 graph fig 6b which indicates that gypsum may not be a contributing factor to the ions the dissolution of calcite and dolomite is revealed by the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 mayo and loucks 1995 a ratio less than or equal to 1 indicates dissolution of dolomite rocks a ratio greater than 1 indicates contribution from a more dominant calcite from fig 6e most of the samples plotted below the line of ratio less than 1 suggesting that dissolution of dolomite rocks is a dominant factor contributing to ions in the groundwater on a plot of na k against cl data plotting along the 1 1 equiline suggests the occurrence of evaporite dissolution if the data plot below the 1 1 line then silicate weathering is occurring and data plots above the 1 1 suggests the occurrence of reverse ion exchange reactions on fig 6c most of the data plots below the 1 1 line suggesting silicate weathering as a dominant process which contributes ions to groundwater some of the data also plot above the 1 1 line indicating reverse ion exchange also influences the presence of ions in the groundwater some of the samples however plot along the line this could be an indication of the occurrence of evaporation processes and the influence of anthropogenic activities sajil kumar et al 2019 also when silicate weathering is involved in a geochemical process sample data would plot above the 1 1 line of a na k versus total cation graph from fig 6d the data plot above the line which confirms that weathering of silicate minerals contribute to the groundwater chemistry 3 3 2 ion exchange index plot of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 versus na k cl has been used by a number of authors to study the contribution of ion exchange to groundwater chemistry jalali 2007 yidana 2010 qian et al 2016 li et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 if ion exchange between na and ca2 mg2 is a significant process contributing to the groundwater chemistry the relation between them should be linear with a slope close to 1 fig 6f shows that most of the samples plot within the first and fourth quadrants this indicates an absence of ionic exchange and suggests that reverse ion exchange is a dominant process that contributes to the groundwater chemistry the chloroalkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 was calculated to confirm the reverse ion exchange process an ion exchange between na or k with mg2 or ca2 in groundwater will result in positive values for both cai 1 and cai 2 and the exchange is a direct base exchange and for the occurrence of reverse ion exchange both cai 1 and cai 2 values will be negative and the exchange is indirect which suggests chloroalkaline imbalance thakur et al 2016 schoeller 1965 fig 7 shows that about 71 of the samples had an indirect exchange reaction and about 29 had direct base reaction reverse ion exchange is therefore a major contributor to the groundwater chemistry 3 4 groundwater suitability for drinking and for domestic use brown et al 1972 classified the computed wqi into excellent 0 25 good 26 50 poor 51 75 very poor 76 100 and unsuitable for drinking above 100 the wqi calculated for the area ranged between 30 03 and 56 14 the area exhibits two kinds of groundwater quality as shown on the spatial distribution map fig 8 about 94 of the groundwater samples are categorized as good and 6 categorized as poor the poor quality groundwater samples are characterized by relatively high bicarbonate sulphate nitrate and fluoride ions and are from boreholes located in paga kakug paga chania and zenga all in the north western portion of the area fig 8 3 5 groundwater suitability for irrigation the mineral constituents of water used for irrigation has effects on both soil and plants irrigation water with excess salt can alter the physical and chemical structure of soil and affect plants growth adhanom 2019 the suitability of water for irrigation in the catchment was therefore assessed using the ec sodium percentage na the wilcox diagram sodium adsorption ratio sar and the residual sodium carbonate rsc the statistical summary of irrigated water quality indices is presented on table 3 according to the tds classification by ayers and westcott 1985 water with tds less than 450 mg l is classified as none and is suitable for irrigation water with tds value between 450 and 2000 mg l is classified slight to moderate and water with tds value greater than 2000 mg l is classified severe and not suitable for irrigation the tds of the sampled groundwater ranged between 132 and 391 mg l and are therefore suitable for irrigation groundwater with ec value less than 700 μs cm is classified as excellent and suitable for irrigation ec value between 700 and 3000 μs cm is good while ec value greater than 3000 μs cm is fair ayers and westcott 1985 the ec of sampled groundwater ranged between 240 and 710 μs cm and are suitable for irrigation the residual sodium carbonate rsc is used to determine the effect of bicarbonate on the quality of water for agricultural purposes water with rsc values less than 1 25 is safe for irrigation and water with rsc greater than 2 5 is not suitable for irrigation the rsc values for groundwater in the area ranged between 1 9 and 0 09 with an average of 0 75 table 4 and are therefore suitable for irrigation the negative rsc values also negate the possibility of na build up in soil ramesh and elango 2011 the na of the samples ranges between 23 55 and 38 93 with an average of 30 93 table 4 the maximum na content for irrigation has been set to 60 groundwater samples are good for irrigation with respect to na the wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 classifies water irrigation suitability based on the na meq l and the ec on fig 9 all samples fell in the field of excellent to good indicating that all of the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation sodium adsorption ratio sar is also an important parameter used to determine groundwater suitability for irrigation it is a measure of the alkali or sodium hazard to crops water with sar values greater than 9 is not suitable for irrigation as it could lead to the development of saline or alkaline soils todd 1980 the sar values for the area ranged between 0 5 and 1 table 4 and suggests that based on sar the groundwater is suitable for irrigation the groundwater samples plotted on the us salinity diagram ussl fig 10 showed that most of the samples are within the c2 s1 category indicating a medium salinity and low sodicity water the water can be used for irrigation on almost all soils with little risk of harmful exchangeable sodium and can also be used to grow most crops with moderate salt tolerance dhok et al 2011 the use of groundwater for irrigation has significantly increased food production in the anayari catchment vegetables such as tomatoes pepper cabbage and carrot are mainly cultivated through irrigation during the dry season dickson 2016 ofosu 2011 it is therefore reassuring to observe that the quality of groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation this outcome will greatly support the ghana government initiative on planting for food and jobs pfj which largely hinges on irrigation since rainfall pattern in the study area does not reliably support commercial production of food crops all year round tanko et al 2019 a comprehensive study is however required to help determine the groundwater age residence time and recharge rate in order to protect the groundwater from overexploitation rising water table and quality deterioration 4 conclusion statistical analysis reveals the relative concentrations of the groundwater constituents as na ca2 mg2 k for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f for anions the groundwater samples are fresh with tds values less 1000 mg l the water types are of ca mg hco3 and the mixed ca mg cl type the groundwater in the study area is mainly influenced by rock dominance but reverse ion exchange and dissolution of dolomite minerals also control the groundwater chemistry the water quality index of the groundwater was calculated and it shows that 94 of the samples are of good and 6 are of poor quality the groundwater in the area is largely of good quality and suitable for drinking and domestic purposes high values of fluoride and nitrate at few sampling sites however make water from these sites unsuitable for drinking and domestic use based on the assessment of the ec sodium percentage na sodium adsorption ratio sar and the residual sodium carbonate rsc the groundwater samples are of medium salinity and low sodicity and are all 100 suitable for irrigation groundwater in the anayari catchment can mostly be used for drinking and irrigation without prior treatment or special agricultural intervention in general the groundwater quality in the catchment is influenced by geology with little anthropogenic influence hence proper groundwater management strategies and policies are needed to protect the aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors

the literature survey synthesis of ferric hydroxide and activated alumina impregnated artocarpus hirsutus sawdust was not reported in any of the studies for the removal of arsenate and fluoride from groundwater by adsorption method and to make it potable in the present study an economic adsorbent sfaa has been prepared by impregnating ferric hydroxide and activated alumina in to the locally available anjili tree sawdust and is assessed for adsorption of both arsenic and fluoride from groundwater highly porous sfaa has higher bet surface area 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade the arsenic stock solution of 10 mg l was prepared from sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o using demineralized dm water this stock solution was diluted with dm water to prepare the arsenic solution of desired concentration fluoride standard for ion selective electrode was obtained from anatech labs india pvt ltd mumbai india fluoride stock solution of 100 mg l was prepared using sodium fluoride and demineralized dm water 2 2 sawdust the preparation of different trees sawdust samples obtained from local origin were explained in our previous paper dhanasekaran et al 2016a a adsorption capacities of these samples from a solution of 1 mg l as v 25 6 mg l fluoride separately have been analyzed and presented in table 3 based on the results artocarpus hirsutus called anjili locally was selected for the preparation of the adsorbent it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of artocarpus hirsutus tree sawdust is 13 43 for fluoride and 38 for as v at the concentration specified above and the bet surface area was found to be 22 5 m2 g which is quite appreciable for base material see table 3 2 3 adsorbent sfaa preparation to ensure reproducibility a sufficient quantity of sawdust of artocarpus hirsutus was treated and used for the preparation of adsorbent for all the experiments treated sawdust ferric hydroxide and activated alumina were taken after optimization in the desired mass ratio 1 5 1 1 and made into a paste with an adequate quantity of water junlian et al 2014 the paste was dried in an oven to constant weight and the dried mass has been sieved to obtain different particle sizes after finalizing the composition an adequate quantity of the adsorbent was prepared and samples from the same lot have been used for all the experiments 3 experimental 3 1 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments were performed by adding dry adsorbent of 0 1 g 10 ml of a solution containing as v and f the sample vials were agitated at 40 rpm in a thermostatically controlled orbital shaker remi india the temperature was maintained at 303 k by an automatic temperature control system samples have removed at predetermined time intervals centrifuged filtered using 90 mmφ whatman filter paper and analyzed for residual arsenic and fluoride concentration some of the experiments were repeated to check the reproducibility which was found to be within 2 the amount of arsenic and fluoride adsorbed at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated by 1 q e c i c e v m where ci is the initial concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g 3 2 fixed bed experiments a glass column of 0 5 or 1 0 cm inner diameter di and 50 cm height was used for evaluating the column performance of sfaa for the arsenic and fluoride adsorption from water nearly 1 or 2 g of sfaa was filled in the column the bottom of the column was filled with glass wool to provide support to sfaa synthetic water with known arsenic and fluoride concentration was passed through the column with a constant flow rate using a peristaltic pump the treated water drawn from the bottom of the column was collected in a storage vessel and samples were analyzed at regular intervals to describe the fixed bed column behavior and scale it up for industrial applications various breakthrough models viz thomas clark bohart adam and yoon nelson models have been used to fit the experimental data of the column studies 3 3 analytical methods arsenic concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms model elan 250 a ph ise meter meter lab model phm240 expandable ion analyzer u s a equipped with a combination fluoride selective electrode phoenix electrode co model pf 1 u s a was employed for the determination of fluoride a ph meter elico model li 120 india equipped with elico ph electrode was used to measure the ph of solutions surface area and pore volume were evaluated by sorptomatic 1990 bet analyzer france in which the liquid nitrogen was used for degassing the samples x ray photoelectron spectroscopy a highly surface sensitive tool was employed to investigate the trace level presence of as v and f ions in addition to iron and their oxidations states in the sawdust matrix the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was performed with xps spectrometer m s specs germany provided with monochromatic alkα radiation and a hemispherical analyzer the base vacuum was observed to be better than 5 0 10 10 mbar during the analysis the selected area scans were collected with 20 ev pass energy before analysis the xps pattern of silver has been recorded and the spectrometer was calibrated the full width at half maximum fwhm of the ag 3d5 2 was around 1 ev as the samples were insulated an electron flood gun was used to compensate for the charging effect during data acquisition and the electron energy for the flood gun has been adjusted appropriately the c1s peak position of 285 0 ev for the adventitious carbon was used to calibrate the recorded spectra moulder et al 1992 the xps patterns of as 3p o 1s f 1s and fe 2p levels were recorded at room temperature 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of adsorbent sem edx the surface morphology before and after as v and f adsorption were characterized separately using a philips xl 30 scanning electron microscope sem at 15 kv which is shown in fig 1 a and b it can be seen from fig 1 a that the pores vary in the range of 0 1 2 μm in diameter macroporous of sawdust with ferric hydroxide and activated alumina before the adsorption process after uptake of arsenate and fluoride only a few pores are remaining on the sfaa surface fig 1 b the energy dispersive x ray edx analysis was conducted for before and after adsorption process shown in fig 1 c and d the edx spectra confirms that adsorption of fluoride and as v on the sfaa surface from fig 1 c it was found that the sfaa contains an atomic percentage of al and fe is 35 9 and 37 1 the treated adsorbent shows the presence of arsenic and fluoride on its surface which confirms the adsorption of both fig 1 d 4 2 pore size distribution pore size distribution by liquid nitrogen adsorption and mercury porosimetry method has been presented in fig 2 a and b it can be seen that the sawdust has substantial macropore volume fig 2 a and a micropore surface area fig 2 b as a result the combination adsorbent sfaa has a well balanced pore size distribution with the pore volumes and surface areas distributed in macro meso and micropore regions 4 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the xps patterns of as 3p o 1s f 1s al 2s and fe 2p levels was recorded at room temperature the xps survey scans of sfaa arsenic and fluoride loaded specimens were shown in fig 3 selected area scans have been performed in fig 4 a b c and d for c 1s fe 2p as 3p and f 1s along with the auger lines of arsenic oxygen and fe are marked in fig 3 the c1s peak position of 285 0 ev for the adventitious carbon was used to calibrate the recorded spectra also there is a broad peak starting from 265 with a peak center at 269 ev is characteristic of the auger line of as fig 4 a this is evidence for the reduction in the intensity of the auger peak of as in simultaneously loaded arsenic specimen as observed in fig 4 a this confirms the presence of as in the specimens as it is absent for only sfaa specimen as seen in fig 3 iron and aluminium hydro oxide are present on the sfaa surface which was confirmed by the corresponding peaks fe 2p patterns have been recorded to investigate the oxidation state of fe under the influence of arsenic or fluoride ions fig 4 b fe 2p1 2 fe 2p3 2 and their respective satellites have seen from the graph for both the specimens fe 2p1 2 fe 2p3 2 peaks have been obtained at 710 8 724 8 ev similarly al 2s peak at 117 9 ev besides an additional satellite at 736 ev appears for both the specimens the positions of the peaks and the satellite at 736 ev confirm that fe is present in 3 valence state and does not undergo any change it is clear that fe in a single valence state the patterns are similar for both the specimens indicating neither fluoride nor arsenic changes the valence state of fe to confirm the presence of arsenic the region for as 3p was scanned and patterns have been recorded for the arsenic loaded specimens and shown in fig 4 c the graph can be fitted with gaussian functions marking 3p3 2 and 3p1 2 components of as and the analysis of peak position at 146 2 ev shows that as in 5 valence state this again confirms that as is trapped in the matrix and that the oxidation state of as is 5 the selected area was scanned for f 1s region for adsorbed fluoride present in the adsorbent which has been recorded for the arsenic and fluoride loaded specimens fluoride peak was observed near 685 ev of binding energy fig 4 d 4 4 optimization of sawdust ferric hydroxide and activated alumina ratio mass ratios 2 1 1 1 5 1 1 and 1 1 1 of sawdust ferric hydroxide activated alumina was studied the preparation of sawdust with ferric hydroxide was not stable while mixed with water ferric hydroxide can dissolve in water also sawdust and activated alumina could not be mixed into a paste form because both are in solid state without the addition of ferric hydroxide from the results it can be seen that adsorbent of 1 5 1 1 ratio of sawdust ferric hydroxide activated alumina results in effective removal of arsenic as well as fluoride by adsorption the uptake of arsenic and fluoride by sfaa being higher than that of only activated alumina junlian et al 2014 4 5 effect of ph in literature ph 6 5 was found to be suitable for arsenic adsorption and as well suggested up to ph 7 was suitable for fluoride adsorption moulder et al 1992 dhanasekaran et al 2016a 2016b according to that the removal of arsenic and fluoride ph was maintained between 6 5 and 7 at ph 6 0 arsenate exists as the anions haso4 2 and h2aso4 pka 6 7 are the predominant species consequently they can be more readily adsorbed on positively charged surface the probable mechanism for the surface complexation reaction for arsenate as v is given below fe oh h2aso4 fe haso4 h2o fe oh haso4 2 fe aso4 h2o al oh h2aso4 al haso4 h2o al oh haso4 2 al aso4 h2o similarly for fluoride adsorption fe oh h fe oh2 fe oh2 f fe f h2o al oh h al oh2 al oh2 f al f h2o in case of as v and f adsorption by sfaa both electrostatic attraction and chemical bonding take place in sfaa fe oh2 fe oh al oh2 al oh are present in the ph range 6 7 ph larger than 7 the uptake of arsenate and fluoride drops rapidly due to the repulsion from the sfaa surface 4 6 effect of contact time the effect of contact time for as v and f adsorption on sfaa was studied with an adsorbent dose of 0 1 g per 10 ml solution the as v and f adsorption capacity of the sfaa with time is shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that within 10 min sfaa reaches equilibrium in as v adsorption but for fluoride it takes more time 50 min to reach equilibrium the adsorption capacity increased from 0 59 to 0 70 mg g by increasing the contact time different kinetic models like pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion adsorption kinetic models have been tested by various researchers to find the mechanisms of the adsorption and rate controlling steps chunhui et al 2018 rathore and mondal 2007 kowanga et al 2016 pseudo first order lagergren model linear form given by 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 where q e q t adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and time t k1 rate constant of the pseudo first order adsorption min 1 the plot of log q e q t versus t as shown in fig 6 should give a linear relation from which k 1 and qe can be determined from the slope and intercept respectively pseudo second order linear form kinetic rate equation may be expressed as 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e q t adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and time t k 2 pseudo second order rate constant g mg min from the slope and intercept of the straight line obtained from the plot of t qt versus t fig 7 the values of qe and k2 are calculated and presented in tables 2 and 4 the intraparticle diffusion model rahdar et al 2019 is applied to describe competitive arsenic and fluoride adsorption by sfaa this intraparticle diffusion occurs in macro meso and micropores present within the adsorbent sfaa see fig 8 the linearization of the curve qt f t0 5 gives the initial rate of intraparticle diffusion the plot of qt against t0 5 gives the adsorption may be due to pore diffusion or film diffusion or combination of both 4 q t k id t 1 2 c where qt adsorption capacity mg g at time t kid intraparticle pore diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c intercept that gives an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer larger c value implies a greater boundary layer effect 4 7 effect of initial concentration the initial concentration of fluoride varied from 5 to 50 mg l which is mixed with constant arsenic concentration 1 mg l solution both containing solutions added with 0 1 g of sfaa in 15 ml sample vials was agitated at 40 rpm in a thermostatically controlled orbital shaker the temperature for the equilibrium was maintained at 303 k result values obtained from the experiments have plotted as shown in fig 9 from figs 9 and 10 and fig 11 it can be observed that arsenic adsorption was constant but the fluoride adsorption varies base on initial concentration equilibrium uptake of arsenic was not affected by the presence of fluoride so the equilibrium uptake and removal percentage of arsenic remains constant the result confirmed that arsenic was more attractive by the adsorbent sfaa which is not disturbed or interfered by the presence of fluoride similarly the initial concentration of arsenic varied from 0 1 to 2 mg l it is mixed with constant fluoride concentration 20 mg l solution the experiment was carried out as per the procedure mentioned in the initial part of section 4 7 the results from the experiments were plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 it has been observed that arsenic adsorption was constant but the fluoride adsorption decreases with an increase in arsenic initial concentration equilibrium uptake of fluoride is affected by the presence of arsenic hence the fluoride uptake and removal percentage decreases with increase in arsenic concentration the plots confirm that fluoride adsorption by sfaa is disturbed by presence of arsenic it has been also noticed that sfaa gives first preference to arsenic than fluoride while increasing the arsenic concentration in solution arsenic occupies more active sites of sfaa and reduces the fluoride adsorption 4 8 adsorption mechanisms it is confirms that the formation of inner sphere surface complexes with the surface hydroxyl sites is the major role for the adsorption of arsenate and fluoride by ferric and aluminum hydr oxides the surface hydroxyl groups which are considered as the most abundant and active adsorption sites for adsorption of anions during the surface complexes formation qiao et al 2014 will be replaced by the adsorbed anions as expressed below fe oh f fe f oh fe oh h2aso4 fe h2aso4 oh al oh f alf oh al oh h2aso4 al h2aso4 oh in the above equations one surface hydroxyl group is replaced by one arsenate ion similarly one surface hydroxyl group is replaced by one fluoride ion 4 9 adsorption isotherms to examine the adsorption mechanism langmuir and freundlich isotherms model was employed brahman et al 2013a 2013b based on sorption on a heterogeneous surface an isotherm freundlich is expressed as 5 q e k f c e 1 n where qe equilibrium uptake of as and f per unit mass of adsorbent mg g kf freundlich constant mg g l mg 1 n ce equilibrium concentration mg l and n constant for monolayer adsorption langmuir isotherm used which is given by 6 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where qe equilibrium uptake of arsenic per unit mass adsorbent mg g qm maximum value of q kl langmuir constant l mg and ce equilibrium concentration mg l the interference of the presence of arsenic during the isotherm study of fluoride adsorption by sfaa was studied which showed in fig 14 and fig 15 similarly the interference of fluoride in the arsenic adsorption isotherm was analyzed and presented in fig 16 and fig 17 the freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherm parameters are calculated and mentioned in table 5 and table 6 for both the experiments adsorption of arsenate and fluoride follows freundlich adsorption isotherm as well as r2 value found to be high this confirms that the adsorption of both as v and f follows chemisorptions on the basis of r2 value the adsorption of as v and f from groundwater by an adsorbent sfaa favours multilayer type of adsorption so this novel adsorbent sfaa has advantage of higher adsorption capacity if we use in individual adsorption of arsenate and fluoride as compared to other costlier adsorbents in the adsorption of as v and f from groundwater sfaa works efficiently for the removal of both degradation and disposal is easier for sfaa adsorbent because sfaa contains around 43 natural materials sawdust on its own weight finally this low cost and ecofriendly working adsorbent is suitable for the removal of most hazardous elements such as arsenate and fluoride from groundwater and bring the standard within the who bis standard and make it potable 4 10 column study the continuous uptake study was carried out for both arsenic and fluoride containing water is shown in fig 18 the arsenic and fluoride containing water passed through the adsorbent sfaa with the help of a peristaltic pump at the desired flow rate and treated water collected at the bottom the periodical analysis of as and f results meet the drinking water as and f range listed by bureau of indian standard bis and who hence the treated water is potable the breakthrough curves for simultaneous elimination of as and f as shown in fig 19 with continuous removal at a specific time the adsorbent becomes saturated with as and f concentration was determined with adsorption capacity the experimental data was tested with four different models thomas yoon nelson bohart adam and clark model each one of these models was different from the other in terms of the type of adsorption isotherm inclusion or exclusion of chemical reaction significant or negligible mass transfer resistance and the type of rate law used the adsorption result obtained from packed bed was well fitted with the clark model at low percentage error and high regression coefficient r2 value presented in fig 20 and table 7 this confirms that real time removal of as and f by sfaa follows freundlich adsorption isotherm the non linear model explained by a differential equation called two parameter logistic model used to examine mass transfer of arsenic and fluoride in columns ritz et al 2008 kirisci et al 1994 this model expression described by 7 ln c c 0 c k t τ where c0 c are concentration at time 0 and t mg l k rate constant min 1 t time min τ time at which the exit concentration equals to 50 of the initial concentration min a plot of ln c c0 c versus t has been drawn for as v and f adsorption by sfaa based on two parameter logistic model the slope k and intercept τ parameter are obtained and listed in table 8 the r2 values indicate that experimental points and calculated points are adequately and well fitted with model the breakthrough curve for as v and f adsorption by sfaa obtained from model has been plotted in fig 21 5 conclusion it can be concluding that artocarpus hirsutus sawdust impregnated with ferric hydroxide and activated alumina sfaa was found to be effective for arsenic and fluoride removal from groundwater the experimental results conformed drinking water standards laid down by who and bis the maximum removal of as v and fluoride was observed in the optimum ph range of 6 7 the adsorption capacity of sfaa for both as v and fluoride was found to be better than other adsorbents reported in literature adsorption of both arsenic and fluoride from water by sfaa shows that sfaa can remove both pollutants together effectively to meet the drinking water standards bis and who from the batch kinetic and equilibrium studies it was observed that removal of as v and fluoride by sfaa follows pseudo second order kinetics and freundlich adsorption isotherm which confirms the adsorption process is multilayer chemisorption column studies show that the sfaa is effective for the removal of as v and fluoride from groundwater

performance and the relatively low secondary waste generation biological materials mineral oxides activated carbons and polymer resins were extensively investigated as adsorbents for arsenic and

including amorphous hydrous ferric oxide fe o oh goethite feo oh and hematite fe2o3 are known for their ability to remove both arsenic and fluoride from aqueous solutions litter et al 2010 sujana and mohanty 2010 fluoride has a high electronegativity small ionic size strong affinity towards metal ions including al3 and fe3 chen et al 2011 kumar et al 2011 simultaneous removal of arsenic and

was explored as an alternate adsorbent for arsenic modified calcined bauxite was also used for as iii and as v remediation from groundwater arsenic removal using activated alumina showed substantial results and has been effectively used for arsenic removal from drinking water singh and pant 2006 given the growing demand for drinking water the application of naturally available resources for water purification is warranted for cost effective process development though activated carbon was used extensively for arsenic removal the process is not economic chemically treated natural adsorbents have been reported for arsenic and fluoride removal from drinking water table 2 as an alternative to activated carbon arias et al 2008 jeong et al 2007 simsek et al 2013 viswanathan et al 2010a 2010b from the literature survey synthesis of ferric hydroxide and activated alumina impregnated artocarpus hirsutus sawdust was not reported in any of the studies for the removal of arsenate and fluoride from groundwater by adsorption method and to make it potable in the present study an economic adsorbent sfaa has been prepared by impregnating ferric hydroxide and activated alumina in to the locally available anjili tree sawdust and is assessed for adsorption of both arsenic and fluoride from groundwater highly porous sfaa has higher bet surface area 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade the arsenic stock solution of 10 mg l was prepared from sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o using demineralized dm water this stock solution was diluted with dm water to prepare the arsenic solution of desired concentration fluoride standard for ion selective electrode was obtained from anatech labs india pvt ltd mumbai india fluoride stock solution of 100 mg l was prepared using sodium fluoride and demineralized dm water 2 2 sawdust the preparation of different trees sawdust samples obtained from local origin were explained in our previous paper dhanasekaran et al 2016a a adsorption capacities of these samples from a solution of 1 mg l as v 25 6 mg l fluoride separately have been analyzed and presented in table 3 based on the results artocarpus hirsutus called anjili locally was selected for the preparation of the adsorbent it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of artocarpus hirsutus tree sawdust is 13 43 for fluoride and 38 for as v at the concentration specified above and the bet surface area was found to be 22 5 m2 g which is quite appreciable for base material see table 3 2 3 adsorbent sfaa preparation to ensure reproducibility a sufficient quantity of sawdust of artocarpus hirsutus was treated and used for the preparation of adsorbent for all the experiments treated sawdust ferric hydroxide and activated alumina were taken after optimization in the desired mass ratio 1 5 1 1 and made into a paste with an adequate quantity of water junlian et al 2014 the paste was dried in an oven to constant weight and the dried mass has been sieved to obtain different particle sizes after finalizing the composition an adequate quantity of the adsorbent was prepared and samples from the same lot have been used for all the experiments 3 experimental 3 1 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments were performed by adding dry adsorbent of 0 1 g 10 ml of a solution containing as v and f the sample vials were agitated at 40 rpm in a thermostatically controlled orbital shaker remi india the temperature was maintained at 303 k by an automatic temperature control system samples have removed at predetermined time intervals centrifuged filtered using 90 mmφ whatman filter paper and analyzed for residual arsenic and fluoride concentration some of the experiments were repeated to check the reproducibility which was found to be within 2 the amount of arsenic and fluoride adsorbed at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated by 1 q e c i c e v m where ci is the initial concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g 3 2 fixed bed experiments a glass column of 0 5 or 1 0 cm inner diameter di and 50 cm height was used for evaluating the column performance of sfaa for the arsenic and fluoride adsorption from water nearly 1 or 2 g of sfaa was filled in the column the bottom of the column was filled with glass wool to provide support to sfaa synthetic water with known arsenic and fluoride concentration was passed through the column with a constant flow rate using a peristaltic pump the treated water drawn from the bottom of the column was collected in a storage vessel and samples were analyzed at regular intervals to describe the fixed bed column behavior and scale it up for industrial applications various breakthrough models viz thomas clark bohart adam and yoon nelson models have been used to fit the experimental data of the column studies 3 3 analytical methods arsenic concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms model elan 250 a ph ise meter meter lab model phm240 expandable ion analyzer u s a equipped with a combination fluoride selective electrode phoenix electrode co model pf 1 u s a was employed for the determination of fluoride a ph meter elico model li 120 india equipped with elico ph electrode was used to measure the ph of solutions surface area and pore volume were evaluated by sorptomatic 1990 bet analyzer france in which the liquid nitrogen was used for degassing the samples x ray photoelectron spectroscopy a highly surface sensitive tool was employed to investigate the trace level presence of as v and f ions in addition to iron and their oxidations states in the sawdust matrix the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was performed with xps spectrometer m s specs germany provided with monochromatic alkα radiation and a hemispherical analyzer the base vacuum was observed to be better than 5 0 10 10 mbar during the analysis the selected area scans were collected with 20 ev pass energy before analysis the xps pattern of silver has been recorded and the spectrometer was calibrated the full width at half maximum fwhm of the ag 3d5 2 was around 1 ev as the samples were insulated an electron flood gun was used to compensate for the charging effect during data acquisition and the electron energy for the flood gun has been adjusted appropriately the c1s peak position of 285 0 ev for the adventitious carbon was used to calibrate the recorded spectra moulder et al 1992 the xps patterns of as 3p o 1s f 1s and fe 2p levels were recorded at room temperature 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of adsorbent sem edx the surface morphology before and after as v and f adsorption were characterized separately using a philips xl 30 scanning electron microscope sem at 15 kv which is shown in fig 1 a and b it can be seen from fig 1 a that the pores vary in the range of 0 1 2 μm in diameter macroporous of sawdust with ferric hydroxide and activated alumina before the adsorption process after uptake of arsenate and fluoride only a few pores are remaining on the sfaa surface fig 1 b the energy dispersive x ray edx analysis was conducted for before and after adsorption process shown in fig 1 c and d the edx spectra confirms that adsorption of fluoride and as v on the sfaa surface from fig 1 c it was found that the sfaa contains an atomic percentage of al and fe is 35 9 and 37 1 the treated adsorbent shows the presence of arsenic and fluoride on its surface which confirms the adsorption of both fig 1 d 4 2 pore size distribution pore size distribution by liquid nitrogen adsorption and mercury porosimetry method has been presented in fig 2 a and b it can be seen that the sawdust has substantial macropore volume fig 2 a and a micropore surface area fig 2 b as a result the combination adsorbent sfaa has a well balanced pore size distribution with the pore volumes and surface areas distributed in macro meso and micropore regions 4 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the xps patterns of as 3p o 1s f 1s al 2s and fe 2p levels was recorded at room temperature the xps survey scans of sfaa arsenic and fluoride loaded specimens were shown in fig 3 selected area scans have been performed in fig 4 a b c and d for c 1s fe 2p as 3p and f 1s along with the auger lines of arsenic oxygen and fe are marked in fig 3 the c1s peak position of 285 0 ev for the adventitious carbon was used to calibrate the recorded spectra also there is a broad peak starting from 265 with a peak center at 269 ev is characteristic of the auger line of as fig 4 a this is evidence for the reduction in the intensity of the auger peak of as in simultaneously loaded arsenic specimen as observed in fig 4 a this confirms the presence of as in the specimens as it is absent for only sfaa specimen as seen in fig 3 iron and aluminium hydro oxide are present on the sfaa surface which was confirmed by the corresponding peaks fe 2p patterns have been recorded to investigate the oxidation state of fe under the influence of arsenic or fluoride ions fig 4 b fe 2p1 2 fe 2p3 2 and their respective satellites have seen from the graph for both the specimens fe 2p1 2 fe 2p3 2 peaks have been obtained at 710 8 724 8 ev similarly al 2s peak at 117 9 ev besides an additional satellite at 736 ev appears for both the specimens the positions of the peaks and the satellite at 736 ev confirm that fe is present in 3 valence state and does not undergo any change it is clear that fe in a single valence state the patterns are similar for both the specimens indicating neither fluoride nor arsenic changes the valence state of fe to confirm the presence of arsenic the region for as 3p was scanned and patterns have been recorded for the arsenic loaded specimens and shown in fig 4 c the graph can be fitted with gaussian functions marking 3p3 2 and 3p1 2 components of as and the analysis of peak position at 146 2 ev shows that as in 5 valence state this again confirms that as is trapped in the matrix and that the oxidation state of as is 5 the selected area was scanned for f 1s region for adsorbed fluoride present in the adsorbent which has been recorded for the arsenic and fluoride loaded specimens fluoride peak was observed near 685 ev of binding energy fig 4 d 4 4 optimization of sawdust ferric hydroxide and activated alumina ratio mass ratios 2 1 1 1 5 1 1 and 1 1 1 of sawdust ferric hydroxide activated alumina was studied the preparation of sawdust with ferric hydroxide was not stable while mixed with water ferric hydroxide can dissolve in water also sawdust and activated alumina could not be mixed into a paste form because both are in solid state without the addition of ferric hydroxide from the results it can be seen that adsorbent of 1 5 1 1 ratio of sawdust ferric hydroxide activated alumina results in effective removal of arsenic as well as fluoride by adsorption the uptake of arsenic and fluoride by sfaa being higher than that of only activated alumina junlian et al 2014 4 5 effect of ph in literature ph 6 5 was found to be suitable for arsenic adsorption and as well suggested up to ph 7 was suitable for fluoride adsorption moulder et al 1992 dhanasekaran et al 2016a 2016b according to that the removal of arsenic and fluoride ph was maintained between 6 5 and 7 at ph 6 0 arsenate exists as the anions haso4 2 and h2aso4 pka 6 7 are the predominant species consequently they can be more readily adsorbed on positively charged surface the probable mechanism for the surface complexation reaction for arsenate as v is given below fe oh h2aso4 fe haso4 h2o fe oh haso4 2 fe aso4 h2o al oh h2aso4 al haso4 h2o al oh haso4 2 al aso4 h2o similarly for fluoride adsorption fe oh h fe oh2 fe oh2 f fe f h2o al oh h al oh2 al oh2 f al f h2o in case of as v and f adsorption by sfaa both electrostatic attraction and chemical bonding take place in sfaa fe oh2 fe oh al oh2 al oh are present in the ph range 6 7 ph larger than 7 the uptake of arsenate and fluoride drops rapidly due to the repulsion from the sfaa surface 4 6 effect of contact time the effect of contact time for as v and f adsorption on sfaa was studied with an adsorbent dose of 0 1 g per 10 ml solution the as v and f adsorption capacity of the sfaa with time is shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that within 10 min sfaa reaches equilibrium in as v adsorption but for fluoride it takes more time 50 min to reach equilibrium the adsorption capacity increased from 0 59 to 0 70 mg g by increasing the contact time different kinetic models like pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion adsorption kinetic models have been tested by various researchers to find the mechanisms of the adsorption and rate controlling steps chunhui et al 2018 rathore and mondal 2007 kowanga et al 2016 pseudo first order lagergren model linear form given by 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 where q e q t adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and time t k1 rate constant of the pseudo first order adsorption min 1 the plot of log q e q t versus t as shown in fig 6 should give a linear relation from which k 1 and qe can be determined from the slope and intercept respectively pseudo second order linear form kinetic rate equation may be expressed as 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e q t adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and time t k 2 pseudo second order rate constant g mg min from the slope and intercept of the straight line obtained from the plot of t qt versus t fig 7 the values of qe and k2 are calculated and presented in tables 2 and 4 the intraparticle diffusion model rahdar et al 2019 is applied to describe competitive arsenic and fluoride adsorption by sfaa this intraparticle diffusion occurs in macro meso and micropores present within the adsorbent sfaa see fig 8 the linearization of the curve qt f t0 5 gives the initial rate of intraparticle diffusion the plot of qt against t0 5 gives the adsorption may be due to pore diffusion or film diffusion or combination of both 4 q t k id t 1 2 c where qt adsorption capacity mg g at time t kid intraparticle pore diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c intercept that gives an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer larger c value implies a greater boundary layer effect 4 7 effect of initial concentration the initial concentration of fluoride varied from 5 to 50 mg l which is mixed with constant arsenic concentration 1 mg l solution both containing solutions added with 0 1 g of sfaa in 15 ml sample vials was agitated at 40 rpm in a thermostatically controlled orbital shaker the temperature for the equilibrium was maintained at 303 k result values obtained from the experiments have plotted as shown in fig 9 from figs 9 and 10 and fig 11 it can be observed that arsenic adsorption was constant but the fluoride adsorption varies base on initial concentration equilibrium uptake of arsenic was not affected by the presence of fluoride so the equilibrium uptake and removal percentage of arsenic remains constant the result confirmed that arsenic was more attractive by the adsorbent sfaa which is not disturbed or interfered by the presence of fluoride similarly the initial concentration of arsenic varied from 0 1 to 2 mg l it is mixed with constant fluoride concentration 20 mg l solution the experiment was carried out as per the procedure mentioned in the initial part of section 4 7 the results from the experiments were plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 it has been observed that arsenic adsorption was constant but the fluoride adsorption decreases with an increase in arsenic initial concentration equilibrium uptake of fluoride is affected by the presence of arsenic hence the fluoride uptake and removal percentage decreases with increase in arsenic concentration the plots confirm that fluoride adsorption by sfaa is disturbed by presence of arsenic it has been also noticed that sfaa gives first preference to arsenic than fluoride while increasing the arsenic concentration in solution arsenic occupies more active sites of sfaa and reduces the fluoride adsorption 4 8 adsorption mechanisms it is confirms that the formation of inner sphere surface complexes with the surface hydroxyl sites is the major role for the adsorption of arsenate and fluoride by ferric and aluminum hydr oxides the surface hydroxyl groups which are considered as the most abundant and active adsorption sites for adsorption of anions during the surface complexes formation qiao et al 2014 will be replaced by the adsorbed anions as expressed below fe oh f fe f oh fe oh h2aso4 fe h2aso4 oh al oh f alf oh al oh h2aso4 al h2aso4 oh in the above equations one surface hydroxyl group is replaced by one arsenate ion similarly one surface hydroxyl group is replaced by one fluoride ion 4 9 adsorption isotherms to examine the adsorption mechanism langmuir and freundlich isotherms model was employed brahman et al 2013a 2013b based on sorption on a heterogeneous surface an isotherm freundlich is expressed as 5 q e k f c e 1 n where qe equilibrium uptake of as and f per unit mass of adsorbent mg g kf freundlich constant mg g l mg 1 n ce equilibrium concentration mg l and n constant for monolayer adsorption langmuir isotherm used which is given by 6 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where qe equilibrium uptake of arsenic per unit mass adsorbent mg g qm maximum value of q kl langmuir constant l mg and ce equilibrium concentration mg l the interference of the presence of arsenic during the isotherm study of fluoride adsorption by sfaa was studied which showed in fig 14 and fig 15 similarly the interference of fluoride in the arsenic adsorption isotherm was analyzed and presented in fig 16 and fig 17 the freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherm parameters are calculated and mentioned in table 5 and table 6 for both the experiments adsorption of arsenate and fluoride follows freundlich adsorption isotherm as well as r2 value found to be high this confirms that the adsorption of both as v and f follows chemisorptions on the basis of r2 value the adsorption of as v and f from groundwater by an adsorbent sfaa favours multilayer type of adsorption so this novel adsorbent sfaa has advantage of higher adsorption capacity if we use in individual adsorption of arsenate and fluoride as compared to other costlier adsorbents in the adsorption of as v and f from groundwater sfaa works efficiently for the removal of both degradation and disposal is easier for sfaa adsorbent because sfaa contains around 43 natural materials sawdust on its own weight finally this low cost and ecofriendly working adsorbent is suitable for the removal of most hazardous elements such as arsenate and fluoride from groundwater and bring the standard within the who bis standard and make it potable 4 10 column study the continuous uptake study was carried out for both arsenic and fluoride containing water is shown in fig 18 the arsenic and fluoride containing water passed through the adsorbent sfaa with the help of a peristaltic pump at the desired flow rate and treated water collected at the bottom the periodical analysis of as and f results meet the drinking water as and f range listed by bureau of indian standard bis and who hence the treated water is potable the breakthrough curves for simultaneous elimination of as and f as shown in fig 19 with continuous removal at a specific time the adsorbent becomes saturated with as and f concentration was determined with adsorption capacity the experimental data was tested with four different models thomas yoon nelson bohart adam and clark model each one of these models was different from the other in terms of the type of adsorption isotherm inclusion or exclusion of chemical reaction significant or negligible mass transfer resistance and the type of rate law used the adsorption result obtained from packed bed was well fitted with the clark model at low percentage error and high regression coefficient r2 value presented in fig 20 and table 7 this confirms that real time removal of as and f by sfaa follows freundlich adsorption isotherm the non linear model explained by a differential equation called two parameter logistic model used to examine mass transfer of arsenic and fluoride in columns ritz et al 2008 kirisci et al 1994 this model expression described by 7 ln c c 0 c k t τ where c0 c are concentration at time 0 and t mg l k rate constant min 1 t time min τ time at which the exit concentration equals to 50 of the initial concentration min a plot of ln c c0 c versus t has been drawn for as v and f adsorption by sfaa based on two parameter logistic model the slope k and intercept τ parameter are obtained and listed in table 8 the r2 values indicate that experimental points and calculated points are adequately and well fitted with model the breakthrough curve for as v and f adsorption by sfaa obtained from model has been plotted in fig 21 5 conclusion it can be concluding that artocarpus hirsutus sawdust impregnated with ferric hydroxide and activated alumina sfaa was found to be effective for arsenic and fluoride removal from groundwater the experimental results conformed drinking water standards laid down by who and bis the maximum removal of as v and fluoride was observed in the optimum ph range of 6 7 the adsorption capacity of sfaa for both as v and fluoride was found to be better than other adsorbents reported in literature adsorption of both arsenic and fluoride from water by sfaa shows that sfaa can remove both pollutants together effectively to meet the drinking water standards bis and who from the batch kinetic and equilibrium studies it was observed that removal of as v and fluoride by sfaa follows pseudo second order kinetics and freundlich adsorption isotherm which confirms the adsorption process is multilayer chemisorption column studies show that the sfaa is effective for the removal of as v and fluoride from groundwater

12008,the present study had an objective to approximate radon and uranium as naturally occurring radioactive constituents in spring water samples and assessment of aed annual effective dose radiological risks and chemical toxicity when spring water is the source of drinking water based on the population density in study area bageshwar district of uttarakhand india random sampling process was adopted for the collection of water samples from eighty natural springs the concentration of radon was estimated using advanced smart rnduo while for estimation of uranium led fluorimeter was used the observed values were subjected to statistical analysis to illustrate the spatial distribution of radon and uranium in the study area as well as for determination of associated health risks for inhabitants the results revealed that radon activity in spring water samples varies from 3 4 to 101 3 bq l with a mean value of 34 4 3 8 bq l while the uranium concentration in water samples ranges from 0 1 to 28 4 μg l with the mean value of 1 6 μg l in 35 samples radon concentration has been found more than the permissible limit prescribed by unscear the observed values of electrical conductivity ec and total dissolve solids tds were also found within the recommended limits of who therefore the relatively higher observed concentration of radon in spring water than the permissible limits of health regulatory agencies may be a matter of concern in radiological prospective as well as for chemical toxicity in infants and children inhibiting the study area keywords chemical toxicity drinking water human health radiological dose radon spring water 1 introduction quality of air and water are very curial issues all over the world kumar et al 2020 arora et al 2014 wolkoff 2018 muoio et al 2020 and radioactive contamination in drinking water is most important issue because of its radiological as well as chemical toxic effects radioactive contamination of water sources caused by naturally occurring radiological substances is a thrust area of research in water quality monitoring and health risk assessment numerous natural and artificial radionuclides have been found in water in varying quantities but alpha emitting radionuclides such as radon and uranium have been most studied due to their high linear energy transfer radon isotopes principally result in from the radioactive decay of naturally occurring radium uranium and thorium deposits primarily the minerals constituents in rocks serve as a key source for distribution of natural radionuclides to the ambient environment agbalagba et al 2013 el arabi 2007 anjos et al 2005 kandari et al 2018 semwal et al 2018 uranium in natural settings is more soluble in alkaline carbonate rich water and sparingly soluble in acidic water that has reducing properties bajwa et al 2017 duggal et al 2017 the radioactive radon and uranium are taken up by ambient ground water during the groundwater transient process across the rock course and soil media that hold such chemical species uranium exodus in water rock soil media is mainly governed by uranium solution mineral equilibrium and sorption processes upon contact of groundwater with underlying stratum bampaiti et al 2016 merkel and hasche berger 2006 radioactive species within underlying rock and sediment may significantly contribute to the extent of radioactivity of groundwater if they are dissolved or leached out of the source rocks and or sediment and continue in solution i e are not later affected by precipitation or sorption processes hence the levels of radiologicals like uranium and thorium in groundwater considerably depend upon the travel time of aquifer dissolution adsorption desorption and recoil processes the radon concentration in groundwater gradually increases with an increase in the uranium content of the soil and bedrock salih et al 2002 gall et al 1995 but this feature is greatly dependent upon changes in aquifer characteristics bedrock geology water chemistry and other prevailing circumstances therewith andrews and wood 1972 juntunen 1991 thus their mobility is susceptible to existing aqueous geochemical conditions in an environment several studies carried out in india kumar et al 2017 choubey et al 2007 walia et al 2003 panghal et al 2017 prasad et al 2018 and at global level todorovic et al 2012a fonollosa et al 2016a pereira et al 2015a waller and steininger 2007 for estimation of radon and uranium content in water sources for assessment of ingestion dose clearly indicated the mobilization of natural radon and uranium in groundwater system as a result of mineral dissolution or anthropogenic activity or their combined effect the radionuclides are found as trace elements in most rocks and soils in natural terrains and are formed principally by the radioactive decay of u238 and th232 that are long lived parent elements of the decay series these parent elements produce intermediate radioactive daughter elements with shorter half lives the geochemical behavior of a daughter element in groundwater varies greatly from that of the parent element however the parent may administer the incidence and distribution of the daughter element that is principally controlled by the local geology and geochemistry missimer et al 2019 furthermore the concentration of uranium in groundwater is greatly influenced by the geochemical conditions such as redox berk and fu 2017 therefore geochemical behavior of any radionuclide in an aquifer is the principal basis for probable concentration levels of radionuclides in spring water or water from any underground source the harmful effects of radon and uranium on human health can be classified into two categories viz carcinogenic and non carcinogenic this categorization is primarily based on the radiological hazards by radiation of their isotopes and the chemical risk as a heavy metal due to them as well as their progenies kurttio et al 2005 higher concentration of radon and uranium in drinking water may result in harmful biological effects in human beings due its characteristic property to deter with internal organs uranium has been recognized as a nephrotoxic by the world health organisation implying it is a naturally produced chemical which may cause kidney damage world health organization 2011 the intake of radon and uranium through drinking water has been reported to be the probable reason cause for numerous health hazards like cancer increased defective birth rate early greying of hair and cardiovascular diseases sinitsky 2014 principally being an alpha emitter uranium can cause intense damage to dna if it reaches the cell nuclei bones kidneys and liver are the principal sites of uranium accumulation in the human body and it is removed from the body through urine at a faster rate from blood and at a slower rate from organ deposits quantification of radon and uranium contents in natural water sources used for drinking serves two major purposes at the outset it provides an idea of hydro geochemical constitution of water and successively allows the assessment of population exposure to radiation by the consumption of water the area under the study the bageshwar district of uttarakhand has a very complex geological set up due to the repeated tectonic disturbances caused by different orogenic cycles there is still a lack of data on geochemical behavior of radionuclides in spring water in bageshwar region because the incidence and concentration levels may vary significantly from place to place natural springs are the only source of drinking water for native population in bageshwar region no research work for assessment of radiological quality of spring water in bageshwar has been undertaken in recent past thus the present study was undertaken to approximate the spatial distribution of radon and uranium concentrations in spring water with its associated water quality parameters ec and tds and to assess the ingestion dose radiological and chemical through the intake of spring water for drinking purposes at selected sites in study area 2 material and methods 2 1

hydrological conditions such as in channel and alluvial terraces of river valleys joints fractures and fissures of crystalline and metasedimentary rocks ground water emerges as springs and seepage locally called srots and naolas under favorable physiographic conditions such as in gently sloping areas broad valleys of rivers and along the lithological contacts rainfall is the principal source of ground water replenishment in hilly areas ground water flows out as springs and seepage where the water table intersects the ground surface cgwb 2009 2 4 sample collection a total of eighty samples were taken from eighty different natural springs which were frequently used by local inhabitants as a drinking water resource the water samples were taken carefully following the guidelines of water sampling as prescribed by board of research in nuclear sciences mumbai gaware et al 2011 radon concentration in these samples was measured by using smart rnduo within 1 h of sampling time rnduo is a scintillation based detector which detects the alpha particles emitted during decay chain of radon and daughter products gaware et al 2011 the detailed working principle and experimental procedure is explained in prasad et al 2018 further the uranium concentration was estimated by using led fluorometer total dissolved solids tds and electric conductivity ec were estimated by microprocessor based digital water and soil analysis kit esico model 1160 following the standard methods of apha 2012 rice et al 2012 2 5 estimation of radiation dose and risk for different age groups the annual effective dose for different age groups was calculated by standard protocol of unscear united nations scientific 2000 while radiological risk as excess cancer risk and annual effective radiation dose for different organs lung colon stomach gonads liver kidney and skin were calculated by using standard estimation methods of unscear united nations scientific 2000 the equivalent ingestion dose and equivalent inhalation dose were calculated by using ingestion dose and inhalation dose equations kaur et al 2019 2 6 estimation of chemical toxicity the chemical risk of uranium in different age groups through water intake was estimated as life time average daily dose ladd of uranium by using ladd equation kaur et al 2019 the hazard quotient was calculated to compare the chemical risk with the reference values given by who world health organization 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 radon distribution in drinking water the geological distribution of radon and its dynamics in environmental media is the major issue of concern because the element is having environmental and exposure health impacts in present study the radon activity in water samples varied from 3 4 1 2 to 101 2 17 6 bq l with a mean sd value of 34 4 20 bq l it is important to note that in 84 of the total samples the values of radon activity were observed beyond the reference value 11 1 bq l as recommended by united states environmental protection agency united states environmental protection agency 2001 while in 35 samples radon activity was above the permissible limit 40 bq l as recommended by united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation united nations scientific 2000 only 2 samples contained radon activity level above the safe limits 100 bq l as prescribed by european commission european commission 200 2001 and world health organisation world health organization 2011 fig 1 a the detailed of radon distribution in bageshwar region is represented in fig 1 b 3 2 uranium distribution in drinking water the presence of uranium in drinking water is a potential source of radiation as well as chemical toxicity in this study uranium concentration in drinking water ranged from 0 1 to 28 4 μg l with the mean value of 1 6 0 7 μg l which is well within the safe limit 30 μg l as recommended by usepa united states environmental protection agency 2001 and who world health organization 2011 but in 20 of the total samples uranium concentration was found to be higher than the limit 1 90 μg l as recommended by international commission on radiological protection international commission 1993 corresponding to observations the uranium activity varied from 0 003 to 0 72 bq l with the mean value of 0 04 0 02 bq l the values of different statistical parameters for uranium are summarised in table 1 frequency distribution of uranium concentration in total 80 samples can be shown as pie chart in fig 2 a the figure noticeably illustrates that in 28 of the total samples the values of uranium concentration exceeded 1 μg l while in 26 of the total samples taken the uranium concentration was observed to be higher than 1 25 μg l a contour plot fig 2 b on the map of bageshwar district was plotted by using arc gis software demonstrating various sampling sites and their respective uranium distribution 3 3 distribution of electrical conductivity ec and total dissolve solids tds in water high tds and high ionic conductivity enhances the solubility of uranium which may be accountable for the higher levels of uranium concentration in spatial observations kumar et al 2011 the water from underground sources having a high tds value is probably contaminated with natural radioactivity that is undesirable in drinking water as natural radionuclides from thorium and uranium decay progression are naturally found in the geological stratum that may further solublize in ground water resulting from solution mineral equilibrium and sorption processes naturally most of the dissolved constituents in groundwater are due water rock interactions occurring within a lithological outline kumar et al 2020 thus ec and tds as water quality parameters were also estimated in the present study the values of ec ranged from 2 0 to 690 μs cm with the mean value of 164 8 17 8 μs cm which is within the safe limit according to the regulation on hygiene of drinking water 1 ec 1000 μs cm act 1956 total dissolve minerals in water was calculated in the form of tds the value of tds in water samples varied from 11 9 to 404 0 mg l with the mean value of 89 4 10 2 mg l in all samples the tds values were observed below the safe limit 600 mg l as recommended by who world health organization 2011 fig 3 indicates the distribution of ec and tds in bageshwar district relatively higher values of ec as well as tds were found in a particular region of bageshwar the statistical values of ec and tds are summarised in table 1 3 4 statistical analysis the linear correlation between uranium radon activity concentration ec and tds in water samples have been calculated by using r open source statistical software which is shown in fig 4 the extent of dissolved solids in water is closely related to fluctuation of electrical conductivity values in water figure clearly depicts a strong and positive correlation between observed tds and ec values with the pearson s r value of 0 91 similarly a positive and moderately strong correlation of uranium concentration with both ec and tds was observed with pearson s r value of 0 74 for the parameters although radon concentration was observed to be relatively less correlated with ec and tds but it is worth to note that pearson s r value was positive in all three cases 3 5 radiological dose of radon ingestion dose via drinking water is a direct function of quantity of water intake radiological effective dose due to intake of radon for different age groups are represented numerically as well as graphically in table 2 and fig 5 respectively it can be clearly observed that radiological dose due to radon ingestion have relatively wider range for infants the observation for mean values of radon ingestion dose for different age groups revealed that the highest values were noticed for infants this was due to the high value of dose conversion factor 0 023 μsv bq for infants measured values of annual effective dose aed for radon ingestion have been found to be varied from 15 to 466 μsv y with an arithmetic mean standard error of 158 18 μsv y for infants 5 155 with a mean value of 53 6 μsv y and 6 179 μsv y with a mean value of 61 7 μsv y for children of age groups 1 3 and 4 8 years respectively the dose was found to be in the range of 4 124 μsv y mean se 42 5 μsv y 1 57 μsv y 72 8 μsv y and 2 69 μsv y 88 10 μsv y for age group 9 13 years 14 18 years and adults respectively for both males as well as females the mean values of radon ingestion in different age groups followed the trend as infants adults children depending upon the specified age as 0 12 months for infants 1 13 years for children and from 14 to 69 years for adults of both sexes the statistical distribution of doses in different age groups is represented in fig 5 through whiskers box plots from fig 5 it can be seen that span as well as first and third quartile values 62 and 248 μsv y for infants are relatively higher than the other age groups while the values of third quartile are under 100 μsv y for children therefore it may be concluded that infants are more radiosensitive all these values are within the recommended range 1msv y proposed by united nations scientific committee on the effect of atomic radiation unscear as well as world health organisation 3 6 radiological dose of uranium in drinking water statistical distribution of aed through ingestion of uranium is represented in fig 6 in figure the whiskers length is representing the span of the data values and the size of the box is representing the mean standard error values as well as median value as can see the mean values of uranium ingestion dose were estimated to be highest for infants but the median values haven t much difference for different age group measured values of uranium ingestion aed were found to be varied from 0 2 to 48 8 μsv y for infants in children group this range was from 0 1 to 41 μsv y and 0 1 17 2 μsv y for 1 3 and 4 8 years age groups respectively in male and females of age groups 9 13 years 14 18 years and adults aed ranged from 0 1 to 17 1 μsv y 0 1 28 9 μsv y and 0 1 23 6 μsv y respectively aed due to ingestion of uranium was observed to be in the following order infants adults children the statistical distribution of the data is represented in fig 6 and it can be seen that there is a large difference between mean and median values the median values are shifted towards first quartile while mean values are above the third quartile that means only in few samples dose values are relatively high primarily intake of uranium may result in two types of health hazards viz radiological risks and chemical toxicity radiological risks can be estimated in terms of excess cancer risk ecr in present study the value of ecr ranged from 3 10 8 to 894 10 8 with the mean value of 50 0 21 10 8 the calculated values of ecr were considerably below the safe level for radiological risk ye shin et al 2004 chemical toxicity was observed in terms of lifetime average daily dose ladd and hazard quotient hq estimated values of ladd for different age groups are summarised in table 2 and statistical distribution is represented in fig 7 through whiskers box plots the values of ladd were found to be in the following range 0 01 2 5 μg kg 1day 1 and 0 01 μg kg 1day 1 to 1 7 μg kg 1day 1 for infants of age group 0 6 months and 7 12 months respectively 0 01 1 6 μg kg 1 day 1 and 0 01 1 1 μg kg 1 day 1 for children with age groups 1 3 years and 4 8 years respectively it is important to note that the prescribed limit for ladd is 1 μg kg 1 day 1 world health organization 2011 and the reference dose recommended by aerb is 4 53 μg kg 1 day 1 therefore in a few samples the values of ladd were found beyond the reference level as recommended by who for infants children and adult females as well but all samples were found within the reference level recommended by aerb to calculate the hazardous level hq estimated ladd have divided by the reference dose given by aerb the range of hazard quotient was found from 0 01 to 08 for teen agers and adults but for infants and children of age group 1 3 years its upper range is more than 1 the values of uranium concentration activity ecr ladd hq and aed are summarised in table 2 3 7 dose contribution percentage contribution of radon and uranium ingestion for the total dose received by different age groups is shown in fig 8 the figure shows that the proportion of radon ingestion was highest among others in all age categories with peak dose contribution for infants 99 simultaneously the maximum dose contribution 7 for u was observed in case of females of age group 13 18 years and children of age group 1 3 years 6 this is clear that the radon activity is a major radiological dose contributor in the water samples of bageshwar region while uranium content is relatively low 3 8 annual mean effective dose for various organs as per the above results suggest that radon is a major contributor for radiation dose received by human through drinking water in study region therefore to major the effects on human body the effective dose for different organs due to radon activity in water also calculated table 3 annual effective radiation dose due to inhalation of waterborne radon for lungs and kidney were found to be varied from 1 01 to 30 62 and 0 42 12 76 μsv y with a mean values of 10 4 7 56 and 4 34 3 15 μsv y respectively the aed of stomach gonads liver and skin due to ingestion of radon is varies as 0 08 2 55 0 14 4 25 0 04 1 06 and 0 01 0 21 respectively from fig 9 it is clear that the radiation dose for lung and kidney is relatively higher than the dose for other organs although the total dose is varied from 1 79 to 54 01 μsv y with a mean value of 18 35 13 34 μsv y 4 comparison with the other indian studies the current scenario of radon level as a contamination in drinking water in indian himalayan region is shown in fig 10 the average radon concentration is above the recommended level by uspea in maximum regions from table 5 it can be seen that only in haridwar and roorkee regions radon level is below that level the geological formation could be a reason of this because these two regions are in plane area and the others are the part of indian mountains the major rock contents in indian himalaya are prophyroclastic granite gneiss garnetiferous mica schist amphibolite mylonitizedaugen gneiss mica schist amphibolite phyllonite and schist prasad et al 2019 quartzite with associated volcanics mica talc schist limestone conglomerate slate quartzite granodiorite augen gneiss migmatite and granite gneiss in doon valley mandakini valley and kumaun himalaya radon level is above the reference level given by unscear although all study indicates that average radon level is well below 100 bq l safe permissible limit given by who and ec the comparison of radon concentration with worldwide as well as indian studies is summarised in table 4 and table 5 5 conclusion this present investigation determined an apparent trend of radon as well as uranium concentration in natural spring water that was the sole drinking water resource in bageshwar region it may be concluded that in 84 35 and 2 samples radon concentration was found to be above the limits recommended by usepa unscear and who respectively similarly uranium concentration in drinking water was below the reference limit proposed by usepa and who but in 20 samples uranium concentration was higher than the standards proposed by icrp the observations for tds and ec were found to be in safer limits as proposed in water act 1956 uranium activity ec and tds were found to be strong and positively correlated with each other while radon concentration has a moderate correlation with both aforementioned parameters the values for aed of radiation due to the ingestion of radon and uranium with drinking water were within the recommended dose value guidelines of icrp but relatively high for infants it can also be concluded that radon is a higher contributor for total radiation dose than the uranium the lungs and kidney receives the maximum dose compared to other organs in human body a potential risk of chemical toxicity in children and infants was estimated due to uranium content in 5 water samples that resulted due to ladd and hq values higher than that of permissible limits who and ye shin et al 2004 only hence the spring water utilized for drinking purposes

12008,the present study had an objective to approximate radon and uranium as naturally occurring radioactive constituents in spring water samples and assessment of aed annual effective dose radiological risks and chemical toxicity when spring water is the source of drinking water based on the population density in study area bageshwar district of uttarakhand india random sampling process was adopted for the collection of water samples from eighty natural springs the concentration of radon was estimated using advanced smart rnduo while for estimation of uranium led fluorimeter was used the observed values were subjected to statistical analysis to illustrate the spatial distribution of radon and uranium in the study area as well as for determination of associated health risks for inhabitants the results revealed that radon activity in spring water samples varies from 3 4 to 101 3 bq l with a mean value of 34 4 3 8 bq l while the uranium concentration in water samples ranges from 0 1 to 28 4 μg l with the mean value of 1 6 μg l in 35 samples radon concentration has been found more than the permissible limit prescribed by unscear the observed values of electrical conductivity ec and total dissolve solids tds were also found within the recommended limits of who therefore the relatively higher observed concentration of radon in spring water than the permissible limits of health regulatory agencies may be a matter of concern in radiological prospective as well as for chemical toxicity in infants and children inhibiting the study area keywords chemical toxicity drinking water human health radiological dose radon spring water 1 introduction quality of air and water are very curial issues all over the world kumar et al 2020 arora et al 2014 wolkoff 2018 muoio et al 2020 and radioactive contamination in drinking water is most important issue because of its radiological as well as chemical toxic effects radioactive contamination of water sources caused by naturally occurring radiological substances is a thrust area of research in water quality monitoring and health risk assessment numerous natural and artificial radionuclides have been found in water in varying quantities but alpha emitting radionuclides such as radon and uranium have been most studied due to their high linear energy transfer radon isotopes principally result in from the radioactive decay of naturally occurring radium uranium and thorium deposits primarily the minerals constituents in rocks serve as a key source for distribution of natural radionuclides to the ambient environment agbalagba et al 2013 el arabi 2007 anjos et al 2005 kandari et al 2018 semwal et al 2018 uranium in natural settings is more soluble in alkaline carbonate rich water and sparingly soluble in acidic water that has reducing properties bajwa et al 2017 duggal et al 2017 the radioactive radon and uranium are taken up by ambient ground water during the groundwater transient process across the rock course and soil media that hold such chemical species uranium exodus in water rock soil media is mainly governed by uranium solution mineral equilibrium and sorption processes upon contact of groundwater with underlying stratum bampaiti et al 2016 merkel and hasche berger 2006 radioactive species within underlying rock and sediment may significantly contribute to the extent of radioactivity of groundwater if they are dissolved or leached out of the source rocks and or sediment and continue in solution i e are not later affected by precipitation or sorption processes hence the levels of radiologicals like uranium and thorium in groundwater considerably depend upon the travel time of aquifer dissolution adsorption desorption and recoil processes the radon concentration in groundwater gradually increases with an increase in the uranium content of the soil and bedrock salih et al 2002 gall et al 1995 but this feature is greatly dependent upon changes in aquifer characteristics bedrock geology water chemistry and other prevailing circumstances therewith andrews and wood 1972 juntunen 1991 thus their mobility is susceptible to existing aqueous geochemical conditions in an environment several studies carried out in india kumar et al 2017 choubey et al 2007 walia et al 2003 panghal et al 2017 prasad et al 2018 and at global level todorovic et al 2012a fonollosa et al 2016a pereira et al 2015a waller and steininger 2007 for estimation of radon and uranium content in water sources for assessment of ingestion dose clearly indicated the mobilization of natural radon and uranium in groundwater system as a result of mineral dissolution or anthropogenic activity or their combined effect the radionuclides are found as trace elements in most rocks and soils in natural terrains and are formed principally by the radioactive decay of u238 and th232 that are long lived parent elements of the decay series these parent elements produce intermediate radioactive daughter elements with shorter half lives the geochemical behavior of a daughter element in groundwater varies greatly from that of the parent element however the parent may administer the incidence and distribution of the daughter element that is principally controlled by the local geology and geochemistry missimer et al 2019 furthermore the concentration of uranium in groundwater is greatly influenced by the geochemical conditions such as redox berk and fu 2017 therefore geochemical behavior of any radionuclide in an aquifer is the principal basis for probable concentration levels of radionuclides in spring water or water from any underground source the harmful effects of radon and uranium on human health can be classified into two categories viz carcinogenic and non carcinogenic this categorization is primarily based on the radiological hazards by radiation of their isotopes and the chemical risk as a heavy metal due to them as well as their progenies kurttio et al 2005 higher concentration of radon and uranium in drinking water may result in harmful biological effects in human beings due its characteristic property to deter with internal organs uranium has been recognized as a nephrotoxic by the world health organisation implying it is a naturally produced chemical which may cause kidney damage world health organization 2011 the intake of radon and uranium through drinking water has been reported to be the probable reason cause for numerous health hazards like cancer increased defective birth rate early greying of hair and cardiovascular diseases sinitsky 2014 principally being an alpha emitter uranium can cause intense damage to dna if it reaches the cell nuclei bones kidneys and liver are the principal sites of uranium accumulation in the human body and it is removed from the body through urine at a faster rate from blood and at a slower rate from organ deposits quantification of radon and uranium contents in natural water sources used for drinking serves two major purposes at the outset it provides an idea of hydro geochemical constitution of water and successively allows the assessment of population exposure to radiation by the consumption of water the area under the study the bageshwar district of uttarakhand has a very complex geological set up due to the repeated tectonic disturbances caused by different orogenic cycles there is still a lack of data on geochemical behavior of radionuclides in spring water in bageshwar region because the incidence and concentration levels may vary significantly from place to place natural springs are the only source of drinking water for native population in bageshwar region no research work for assessment of radiological quality of spring water in bageshwar has been undertaken in recent past thus the present study was undertaken to approximate the spatial distribution of radon and uranium concentrations in spring water with its associated water quality parameters ec and tds and to assess the ingestion dose radiological and chemical through the intake of spring water for drinking purposes at selected sites in study area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the present study was conducted in bageshwar district of uttarakhand province of india having an area of about 2034 sq km in central himalayan region the data regarding climate rainfall bedrock geology and hydrogeology of the study area is briefly mentioned below as stated by cgwb 2009 cgwb 2009 in district groundwater brochure of uttarakhand state 2 2 climate and rainfall bageshwar experiences temperate to sub humid climate the northern part of the district features sub zero temperature almost throughout the year whereas the central and southern parts are comparatively warm and humid severe winter is the chief climatic feature in the district most of the rainfall about 75 of the annual value occurs during monsoon months of june to september july is the rainiest month followed by august the annual rainfall ranges from 1051 to 1705 mm and the annual average rainfall is 1331 4 mm cgwb 2009 2 3 bedrock geology and hydrogeology the geological set up is very complex due to the repeated tectonic disturbances caused by different orogenic cycles the rock units exposed in various parts of bageshwar district comprise current bedded quartzite with associated volcanics mica talc schist limestone conglomerate slate quartzite granodiorite augen gneiss migmatite and granite gneiss ground water in general occurs locally within disconnected bodies under favorable geo hydrological conditions such as in channel and alluvial terraces of river valleys joints fractures and fissures of crystalline and metasedimentary rocks ground water emerges as springs and seepage locally called srots and naolas under favorable physiographic conditions such as in gently sloping areas broad valleys of rivers and along the lithological contacts rainfall is the principal source of ground water replenishment in hilly areas ground water flows out as springs and seepage where the water table intersects the ground surface cgwb 2009 2 4 sample collection a total of eighty samples were taken from eighty different natural springs which were frequently used by local inhabitants as a drinking water resource the water samples were taken carefully following the guidelines of water sampling as prescribed by board of research in nuclear sciences mumbai gaware et al 2011 radon concentration in these samples was measured by using smart rnduo within 1 h of sampling time rnduo is a scintillation based detector which detects the alpha particles emitted during decay chain of radon and daughter products gaware et al 2011 the detailed working principle and experimental procedure is explained in prasad et al 2018 further the uranium concentration was estimated by using led fluorometer total dissolved solids tds and electric conductivity ec were estimated by microprocessor based digital water and soil analysis kit esico model 1160 following the standard methods of apha 2012 rice et al 2012 2 5 estimation of radiation dose and risk for different age groups the annual effective dose for different age groups was calculated by standard protocol of unscear united nations scientific 2000 while radiological risk as excess cancer risk and annual effective radiation dose for different organs lung colon stomach gonads liver kidney and skin were calculated by using standard estimation methods of unscear united nations scientific 2000 the equivalent ingestion dose and equivalent inhalation dose were calculated by using ingestion dose and inhalation dose equations kaur et al 2019 2 6 estimation of chemical toxicity the chemical risk of uranium in different age groups through water intake was estimated as life time average daily dose ladd of uranium by using ladd equation kaur et al 2019 the hazard quotient was calculated to compare the chemical risk with

environmental media is the major issue of concern because the element is having environmental and exposure health impacts in present study the radon activity in water samples varied from 3 4 1 2 to

prescribed by european commission european commission 200 2001 and world health organisation world health organization 2011 fig 1 a the detailed of radon distribution in bageshwar region is represented in fig 1 b 3 2 uranium distribution in drinking water the presence of uranium in drinking water is a potential source of radiation as well as chemical toxicity in this study uranium concentration in drinking water ranged from 0 1 to 28 4 μg l with the mean value of 1 6 0 7 μg l which is well within the safe limit 30 μg l as recommended by usepa united states environmental protection agency 2001 and who world health organization 2011 but in 20 of the total samples uranium concentration was found to be higher than the limit 1 90 μg l as recommended by international commission on radiological protection international commission 1993 corresponding to observations the uranium activity varied from 0 003 to 0 72 bq l with the mean value of 0 04 0 02 bq l the values of different statistical parameters for uranium are summarised in table 1 frequency distribution of uranium concentration in total 80 samples can be shown as pie chart in fig 2 a the figure noticeably illustrates that in 28 of the total samples the values of uranium concentration exceeded 1 μg l while in 26 of the total samples taken the uranium concentration was observed to be higher than 1 25 μg

and ec values with the pearson s r value of 0 91 similarly a positive and moderately strong correlation of uranium concentration with both ec and tds was observed with pearson s r value of 0 74 for the parameters although radon concentration was observed to be relatively less correlated with ec and tds but it is worth to note that pearson s r value was positive in all three cases 3 5 radiological dose of radon ingestion dose via drinking water is a direct function of quantity of water intake radiological effective dose due to intake of radon for different age groups are represented numerically as well as graphically in table 2 and fig 5 respectively it can be clearly observed that radiological dose due to radon ingestion have relatively wider range for infants the observation for mean values of radon ingestion dose for different age groups revealed that the highest values were noticed for infants this was due to the high value of dose conversion factor 0 023

respectively it is important to note that the prescribed limit for ladd is 1 μg kg 1 day 1 world health organization 2011 and the reference dose recommended by aerb is 4 53 μg kg 1 day 1 therefore in a few samples the values of ladd were found beyond the reference level as recommended by who for infants children and adult females as well but all samples were found within the reference level recommended by aerb to calculate the hazardous level hq estimated ladd have divided by the reference dose given by aerb the range of hazard quotient was found from 0 01 to 08 for teen agers and adults but for infants and children of age group 1 3 years its upper range is more than 1 the values of uranium concentration activity ecr ladd hq and aed are summarised in table 2 3 7 dose contribution percentage contribution of radon and uranium ingestion for the total dose received by different age groups is shown in fig 8 the figure shows that the proportion of radon ingestion was highest among others in all age categories with peak dose contribution for infants 99 simultaneously the maximum dose contribution 7 for u was observed in case of females of age group 13 18 years and children of age group 1 3 years 6 this is clear that the radon activity is a major radiological dose contributor in the water samples of bageshwar region while uranium content is relatively low 3 8 annual mean effective dose for various organs as per the above results suggest that radon is a major contributor for radiation dose received by human through drinking water in study region therefore to major the effects on human body the effective dose for different organs due to radon activity in water also calculated table 3 annual effective radiation dose due to inhalation of waterborne radon for lungs and kidney were found to be varied from 1 01 to 30 62 and 0 42 12 76 μsv y with a mean values of 10 4 7 56 and 4 34 3 15 μsv y respectively the aed of stomach gonads liver and skin due to ingestion of radon is varies as 0 08 2 55 0 14 4 25 0 04 1 06 and 0 01 0 21 respectively from fig 9 it is clear that the radiation dose for lung and kidney is relatively higher than the dose for other organs although the total dose is varied from 1 79 to 54 01 μsv y with a mean value of 18 35 13 34 μsv y 4 comparison with the other indian studies the current scenario of radon level as a contamination in drinking water in indian himalayan region is shown in fig 10 the average radon concentration is above the recommended level by uspea in maximum regions from table 5 it can be seen that only in haridwar and roorkee regions radon level is below that level the geological formation could be a reason of this because these two regions are in plane area and the others are the part of indian mountains the major rock contents in indian himalaya are prophyroclastic granite gneiss garnetiferous mica schist amphibolite mylonitizedaugen gneiss mica schist amphibolite phyllonite and schist prasad et al 2019 quartzite with associated volcanics mica talc schist limestone conglomerate slate quartzite granodiorite augen gneiss migmatite and granite gneiss in doon valley mandakini valley and kumaun himalaya radon level is above the reference level given by unscear although all study indicates that average radon level is well below 100 bq l safe permissible limit given by who and ec the comparison of radon concentration with worldwide as well as indian studies is summarised in table 4 and table 5 5 conclusion this present investigation determined an apparent trend of radon as well as uranium concentration in natural spring water that was the sole drinking water resource in bageshwar region it may be concluded that in 84 35 and 2 samples radon concentration was found to be above the limits recommended by usepa unscear and who respectively similarly uranium concentration in drinking water was below the reference limit proposed by usepa and who but in 20 samples uranium concentration was higher than the standards proposed by icrp the observations for tds and ec were found to be in safer limits as proposed in water act 1956 uranium activity ec and tds were found to be strong and positively correlated with each other while radon concentration has a moderate correlation with both aforementioned parameters the values for aed of radiation due to the ingestion of radon and uranium with drinking water were within the recommended dose value guidelines of icrp but relatively high for infants it can also be concluded that radon is a higher contributor for total radiation dose than the uranium the lungs and kidney receives the maximum dose compared to other organs in human body a potential risk of chemical toxicity in children and infants was estimated due to uranium content in 5 water samples that resulted due to ladd and hq values higher than that of permissible limits who and ye shin et al 2004 only hence the spring water utilized for drinking purposes in study region is safe in radiological prospective but chemical toxicity for infants and children could be a matter to concern declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12009,the exploitation of water requires their transport from their production points in pvc pipes a scaling process is initiated in the pipes and the clogging rate may exceed in some cases 60 after a few years of operation the formation of scale on surfaces in contact with water depends on several factors such as the hardness of water and the temperature calcium carbonate being the main component of encrusted tartar to avoid this problem of precipitation of calcium carbonate the addition of inhibitor in water systems is the most efficient and economical method using the lcge method we have evaluated the effect of the commercial product levall 28 on the inhibition of scaling s water this study was carried out a first step at a temperature of 25 c on the calco carbonic pure water at 40 f

have allowed us to conclude that levall 28 has effectiveness with respect to calcium carbonate the complete inhibition of scale formation is obtained in the case of water at 40 f for a concentration of 0 3 mg l the application of levall 28 to real tiznit region s water water t made it possible to conclude that 0 3 mg l of this inhibitor prevents any precipitation of calcium carbonate under conditions of experience graphical abstract image 1 keywords scaling power lcge levall 28 commercial product inhibitor tiznit 1 introduction the drinking water needs of tiznit region are met by groundwater spring water boreholes and wells and shallow water dam water the treatment of these water samples varies according to their quality and origin belattar et al 2016 ben aazza et al 2017 ben aazza et al 2020 it should be noted that the scaling character of groundwater in tiznit region has a negative impact on the state of drinking water supply infrastructure berné and cordonnier 1991 this is probably due on the one hand to the geological nature which surrounds these sources which is situated at the foot of the massif dominated by calcareous formations volmer and weber 1926 and on the other hand to aeration of the water at the source and tarpaulins thus several cases of clogging pipes or pumping groups due to scaling have been observed gholizadeha et al 2017 to prevent or delay the formation of scale deposits the use of chemical inhibitors remains one of the best techniques menzri et al 2017 hadfi et al 2018 ben aazza et al 2019 it is therefore decisive to find scale inhibitor which is characterized by a better inhibitory efficacy of calcium carbonate and their effect due to the respect of health and environmental standards xiaoshuang et al 2010 lourteau et al 2019 after selecting four representative samples of drinking water of tiznit region the method lcge allowed us then to conduct a study of the powers of the selected drinking water it also allowed us to evaluate the effect of the commercial product levall 28 on the scaling power of water this product is in solid white form and used for various food applications the dosage depends on individual recipes and national restrictions the study was carried out at first at a temperature of 25 c on pure calco carbonic water at 40 f 1 f french degrees corresponds to 10 mg l of dissolved calcium carbonate or 4 mg

of tca measured before the start of the experiment the measurement of tca tac and ph values as a function of time makes to describe the precipitation kinetics of calcium carbonate dimitri et al 2015

indicating the date and time of collection 2 2 materials table 2 indicates the different products and materials used in handling 2 3 experimental method lcge this method fig 1 was developed by roques roques 1964 dedieu et al 1994 hort and martin 1995 at the laboratory of chemistry and environmental engineering lcge its principle is to cause the precipitation of calcium carbonate under the effect of degassing of the solution to be studied by a working gas usually atmospheric air according to the following reaction ca2 2 hco3 caco3 s co2 g h2o the principle of this rapid precipitation technique has the advantage of being as close as possible to the main cause of the phenomenon of water scaling which is their natural degassing monitoring the evolution of ph the concentration of calcium tca and the hydrogen carbonate concentration hco3 of the studied water as a function of time allows the description of the kinetics belonging to scaling phenomenon a change in ph is observed as a function of the degassing and stops abruptly at the time tg defined as the practical germination time of water studied the working cell 6 is a pvc cylinder with a capacity of 500 cm3 the glx is an interface to take measurements and editing a graph it accepts sensors simultaneously it can be used alone or connected to a computer through software datastudio the degassing technique is intended for studying the mechanisms of precipitation of caco3 the procedure is divided into two stages in a first step a known amount of caco3 dissolved by bubbling pure of co2 the solution thus obtained is aggressive if we refer to the calco carbonic equilibrium with respect to calcite in a second step the bubbling of co2 is replaced by a gas mixture at low pressure of co2 the degassing of co2 makes it possible to displace the calco carbonic equilibrium to formation of caco3 moreover all manipulations are carried out under gaseous atmosphere of known composition in order to perfectly control the concentration variations in dissolved co2 which is the main motor of an evolution of the system leading to scaling 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetic study of the scaling power of selected water samples the procedure consists of placing about 500 cm3 of the water to be studied in the research cell the research gas which is simply air is produced by an air compressor and is brought to research temperature by passing it through a copper coil then through a humidifier and then through the droplet separators to obtain pure dry air at research temperature this air is then sent to the research cell which is cylindrical in shape and contains in its lower part a diffuser that allows the research gas to be dispersed homogeneously the cell is in a thermostatically controlled bath set at the research temperature the kinetic modelling of the results of scaling power of four water samples selected lead to the values presented in table 3 the analysis of these kinetic parameters shows that all these water samples r r b t and r t b are very scaling low germination time tg does not exceed 24 mn hort and martin 1995 it is noted that the supersaturation coefficient β for each of the water samples r r b t and r t b is greater than 40 varies between 98 92 and 174 95 according to the correlation coefficient r2 the study of the scaling power of these water samples follows a diffusional calcite model it should be noted that the evaluation of the scaling power by the lcge method confirms that these water samples are calyfying types belattar et al 2020 3 2 inhibition of chemical scaling by phosphate product levall 28 the levall 28 is a food product complies with the requirements of the current ec food additives regulation codex food chemicals fcc and codex alimentarius jecfa is a food that is compound complex pulverulent and soluble in the water with a white powdery appearance it contains 64 5 of phosphoric anhydride p2o5 and 28 5 of na2o this product is currently used as a food additive 3 2 1 application for a calco carbonic water at 40 f the experimental data of the tests carried out at 25 c on pure calco carbonic water with increasing amounts of levall 28 the statement of the ph values concentration of ca2 hco3 βcal and pco2 according to the time allow making a description of the precipitation kinetics of calcium carbonate figs 2 6 represent respectively the results obtained when monitoring the ph tca tac βcal and pco2 as a function of time in tests with levall 28 inhibitor study by monitoring the variation of ph the temporal evolution of the ph in the presence of increasing concentrations of levall 28 is shown in fig 2 in the presence and absence of inhibitor levall 28 the ph increases rapidly as a function of time during the first minutes then reaches a maximum value and then shows a fall which is slightly low this variation in ph reflects the two responses of gas transfer at the gas liquid interface and chemical reaction in the liquid phase precipitation begins when the ph begins to drop after reaching its maximum value target ph study by monitoring the variation of tca and tac the evolution according to time of the concentration of ca2 tca and tac within the solution studied and in the presence of increasing concentrations of levall 28 is shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the tca and tac begin to decrease at the same time as the ph indicating the start of precipitation we note that the germination time deduced from the curve tca f t is equal to that deduced from the curve ph f t a slight difference between these two values is sometimes observed the first germs are difficult to detect by volumetric dosing which is done every 2 min at the beginning of the precipitation of caco3 the precipitation rate is relatively high significant drop in tca it then gradually decreases when we approach the equilibrium conditions figs 3 and 4 study by monitoring the variation of the rate of supersaturation β cal the variation as a function of time of the supersaturation coefficient βcal with respect to the calcite of the solution studied and in the presence of increasing concentrations of levall 28 is shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it s noted that the variation of supersaturation coefficient βcal for each curve comprises three parts first phase called degassing phase where β increases in this stage there is no precipitation yet second phase which corresponds to a drop in the supersaturation coefficient therefore a start of precipitation the third phase which corresponds to the end of precipitation charged by the supersaturation coefficient tends to a constant value study by monitoring the variation of p co2 the variation of the partial pressure of co2 in the water studied compared to that of equilibrium and in the presence of increasing concentrations of levall 28 is shown in fig 6 the pressure of co2 fig 6 reaches a maximum just after the breakaway point of the precipitation and then fall again indicating that germination starts before the degassing is complete we also note that the variation of the partial pressure of co2 for each curve comprises three parts the first which corresponds to a decrease in co2 pressure in this stage we have no precipitation yet the second phase corresponds to the start of precipitation marked by an increase in the partial pressure of co2 due to a significant precipitation rate that overrides the speed of degassing the last step corresponds to the end of the precipitation when the degassing speed exceeds that of the precipitation after reaching a maximum the pco2 begins to decrease gradually the analysis of these curves figs 2 6 and the kinetic modelling lead to the values presented in table 4 the kinetic models of precipitation of calcium carbonate have been evaluated thus we have systematically exploited the experimental results obtained with respect to the reddy s model and with respect to the diffusional model with regard to calcite the correlation line is established in each case by a linear regression program which gives the rate constant and the correlation coefficient r2 for comparing the realized adjustments belattar et al 2020 the global rate constant kt and the pseudo order n can be obtained by identification from the experimental results hort and martin 1995 expressing the concentration of ca2 in french hydrometric degree will give the diffusional model 1st order described by the following equation ln tca tceq tca 0 tca eq k d t the reddy model 2nd order is given by the following equation 1 tca 0 tca eq 1 tca 0 tca eq k r t k i rate constant i d or r tca eq concentration at thermodynamic equilibrium tca 0 initial concentration of ca2 we note that the inhibitor levall 28 acts at very low concentrations it should be concluded that the fall in ph is evident for the test without inhibitor whereas for increasing concentrations this fall becomes less remarkable a stage is obtained before precipitation which proves that the duration of the germination phase exceeds that of degassing the ph at the germination point increases with inhibitor concentration from 7 96 for 0 mg l to 8 28 for 0 2 mg l the time of germination increases with the concentration of levall 28 from the concentrations higher or equal to 0 3 mg l effective concentration the inhibition becomes total and the precipitation is not observed during the test the rate of supersaturation at the time of germination undergoes an increase after the introduction of levall 28 it then ranges from 26 92 to test at 0 mg l to 64 67 at 0 2 mg l of levall 28 after the starts of precipitation the co2 pressure reaches a maximum and then again show a fall notify that the germination begins before degassing is complete the precipitation follows a reddy model concerning the test without inhibitor it is modeled by the diffusion model for tests with the inhibitor the experimental results obtained make it possible to conclude that the addition of 0 3 mg l of levall 28 to the calco carbonic solution at 40 f prevents the precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment i e total inhibition of scaling the mechanism suggested for this inhibition is the adsorption of pyrophosphate p2o7 4 on the calcite surface which blocks the active crystal growth sites the inhibition of calcite crystal growth by pyrophosphate can be explained by blockage of surface crystal growth sites by adsorbed pyrophosphate ions aglaia et al 1992 xiaoshuang et al 2010 the adsorption of pyrophosphate can be described by a simple langmuir adsorption model lin and singer 2005 giving rise to preventing any precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment 3 2 2 application to natural water of tiznit region s in our current study we are interested in the influence of levall 28 on natural water of tiznit region s this study was carried out on the most scaling water which is the water of talaint water t by means of the lcge at a temperature of 25 c figs 7 10 show the lcge curves for natural water of tiznit region s after adding increasingly quantities of levall 28 from this curve ph t it can be seen that the ph drop is evident in the test without inhibitor whereas with increasing concentrations of inhibitor the drop becomes less noticeable a plateau is obtained before precipitation which proves that the duration of the germination phase exceeds that of degassing the ph at the germination point of the treated water increases with the concentration of inhibitor it goes from 8 83 for 0 mg l to 9 23 for 0 2 mg l this reflects a delay in precipitation and also slower growth kinetics lédion et al 1997 the germination time increases with the concentration of levall 28 it increases from 18 min for the test without inhibitor to 74 min for a concentration of 0 2 mg l this reflects the anti scaling treatment which results in a delay in precipitation lédion et al 1997 at the beginning of the degassing phase no change in the hco3 concentration is noticeable the drop in tac is observed for concentrations up to 0 2 mg l of levall 28 this decrease is due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate with the release of proton h following the reaction image 2 from a concentration of 0 3 mg l of levall 28 efficiency concentration inhibition becomes complete and no further calcium carbonate precipitation is observed under the conditions of the experiment the analysis of these curves and the kinetic modelling lead to the values presented in table 5 we note that the inhibitor levall 28 acts in the case of water t at very low concentrations it should be concluded that the germination time is significantly higher compared to the control test scaling is totally inhibited at a concentration of 0 3 mg l under the conditions of the experiment the scaling rate decreases depending on the content of the inhibitor introduced into the solution zhiming et al 2018 the germination ph increase from 8 83 to 9 23 for inhibitor concentrations of 0 mg l to 0 2 mg l respectively the drop in ph is clearly apparent for the test without inhibitor whereas for increasing concentrations this drop becomes less noticeable a plateau is obtained before precipitation which proves that the duration of the germination phase exceeds that of degassing for the co2 pressure after the break point of the precipitation it goes through a maximum and then it shows again a fall signaling that the germination begins before the degassing is complete the degree of supersaturation at the time of germination is increased after introduction of the tartrifuge it then varies from 320 for the 0 mg l test to 745 for 0 2 mg l in levall 28 the precipitation kinetic follows a reddy model for the test without inhibitor and is better modeled by the diffusion model in the presence of the inhibitor levall 28 according to the chemical formula of the product levall 28 fig 11 its inhibitory effect on the precipitation of calcium carbonate can be directly bound to the presence of the pyrophosphate group p2o7 4 table 6 show the content of p2o7 4 contained in 1 ppm of product levall 28 to explain this result we compared the results obtained with other studies to the literature hadfi et al 2018 zhiming et al 2018 the effectiveness of this inhibitor is directly bound to the content of active group p2o7 4 which proves that this inhibition can be explained by the adsorption of pyrophosphate ions p2o7 4 on the surface of calcite according to the simple langmuir adsorption model lin and philip singer 2005 the growth sites are then blocked thus giving rise to the prevention of any precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment 4 conclusion the lcge technique based on the accelerated formation of deposits of calcium carbonate under the effect of degassing of the studied water allowed us to evaluate the power scaling of thus water indeed the application of this technique on the pure calco carbonic water 40 f allowed us to essentially bring out the inhibiting character of scaling of the levall 28 the experimental results allowed us to conclude that germination time in the case of the calco carbonic solution at 40 f is 16 min without inhibitor the addition of 0 3 mg l of levall 28 to the latter makes it possible to avoid the precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment which is the total inhibition of scaling the study carried out on the water of talaint showed that 0 3 mg l of levall 28 completely inhibits the precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment from the results obtained it is concluded that the effectiveness of inhibitor levall 28 can be explained by the adsorption of pyrophosphate ions p2o7 4 on the surface of the calcite it can act on the growth phase by blocking active sites by adsorption on the calcium carbonate germs present declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

precipitation rate that overrides the speed of degassing the last step corresponds to the end of the precipitation when the degassing speed exceeds that of the precipitation after reaching a maximum the pco2 begins to decrease gradually the analysis of these curves figs 2 6 and the kinetic modelling lead to the values presented in table 4 the kinetic models of precipitation of calcium carbonate have been evaluated thus we have systematically exploited the experimental results obtained with respect to the reddy s model and with respect to the diffusional model with regard to calcite the correlation line is established in each case by a linear regression program which gives the rate constant and the correlation coefficient r2 for comparing the realized adjustments belattar et al 2020 the global rate constant kt and the pseudo order n can be obtained by identification from the experimental results hort and martin 1995 expressing the concentration of ca2 in french hydrometric degree will give the diffusional model 1st order described by the following equation ln tca tceq tca 0 tca eq k d t the reddy model 2nd order is given by the following equation 1 tca 0 tca eq 1 tca 0 tca eq k r t k i rate constant i d or r tca eq concentration at thermodynamic equilibrium tca 0 initial concentration of ca2 we note that the inhibitor levall 28 acts at very low concentrations it should be concluded that the fall in ph is evident for the test without inhibitor whereas for increasing concentrations this fall becomes less remarkable a stage is obtained before precipitation which proves that the duration of the germination phase exceeds that of degassing the ph at the germination point increases with inhibitor concentration from 7 96 for 0 mg l to 8 28 for 0 2 mg l the time of germination increases with the concentration of levall 28 from the concentrations higher or equal to 0 3 mg l effective concentration the inhibition becomes total and the precipitation is not observed during the test the rate of supersaturation at the time of germination undergoes an increase after the introduction of levall 28 it then ranges from 26 92 to test at 0 mg l to 64 67 at 0 2 mg l of levall 28 after the starts of precipitation the co2 pressure reaches a maximum and then again show a fall notify that the germination begins before degassing is complete the precipitation follows a reddy model concerning the test without inhibitor it is modeled by the diffusion model for tests with the inhibitor the experimental results obtained make it possible to conclude that the addition of 0 3 mg l of levall 28 to the calco carbonic solution at 40 f prevents the precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment i e total inhibition of scaling the mechanism suggested for this inhibition is the adsorption of pyrophosphate p2o7 4 on the calcite surface which blocks the active crystal growth sites the inhibition of calcite crystal growth by pyrophosphate can be explained by blockage of surface crystal growth sites by adsorbed pyrophosphate ions aglaia et al 1992 xiaoshuang et al 2010 the adsorption of pyrophosphate can be described by a simple langmuir adsorption model lin and singer 2005 giving rise to preventing any precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment 3 2 2 application to natural water of tiznit region s in our current study we are interested in the influence of levall 28 on natural water of tiznit region s this study was carried out on the most scaling water which is the water of talaint water t by means of the lcge at a temperature of 25 c figs 7 10 show the lcge curves for natural water of tiznit region s after adding increasingly quantities of levall 28 from this curve ph t it can be seen that the ph drop is evident in the test without inhibitor whereas with increasing concentrations of inhibitor the drop becomes less noticeable a plateau is obtained before precipitation which proves that the duration of the germination phase exceeds that of degassing the ph at the germination point of the treated water increases with the concentration of inhibitor it goes from 8 83 for 0 mg l to 9 23 for 0 2 mg l this reflects a delay in precipitation and also slower growth kinetics lédion et al 1997 the germination time increases with the concentration of levall 28 it increases from 18 min for the test without inhibitor to 74 min for a concentration of 0 2 mg l this reflects the anti scaling treatment which results in a delay in precipitation lédion et al 1997 at the beginning of the degassing phase no change in the hco3 concentration is noticeable the drop in tac is observed for concentrations up to 0 2 mg l of levall 28 this decrease is due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate with the release of proton h following the reaction image 2 from a concentration of 0 3 mg l of levall 28 efficiency concentration inhibition becomes complete and no further calcium carbonate precipitation is observed under the conditions of the experiment the analysis of these curves and the kinetic modelling lead to the values presented in table 5 we note that the inhibitor levall 28 acts in the case of water t at very low concentrations it should be concluded that the germination time is significantly higher compared to the control test scaling is totally inhibited at a concentration of 0 3 mg l under the conditions of the experiment the scaling rate decreases depending on the content of the inhibitor introduced into the solution zhiming et al 2018 the germination ph increase from 8 83 to 9 23 for inhibitor concentrations of 0 mg l to 0 2 mg l respectively the drop in ph is clearly apparent for the test without inhibitor whereas for increasing concentrations this drop becomes less noticeable a plateau is obtained before precipitation which proves that the duration of the germination phase exceeds that of degassing for the co2 pressure after the break point of the precipitation it goes through a maximum and then it shows again a fall signaling that the germination begins before the degassing is complete the degree of supersaturation at the time of germination is increased after introduction of the tartrifuge it then varies from 320 for the 0 mg l test to 745 for 0 2 mg l in levall 28 the precipitation kinetic follows a reddy model for the test without inhibitor and is better modeled by the diffusion model in the presence of the inhibitor levall 28 according to the chemical formula of the product levall 28 fig 11 its inhibitory effect on the precipitation of calcium carbonate can be directly bound to the presence of the pyrophosphate group p2o7 4 table 6 show the content of p2o7 4 contained in 1 ppm of product levall 28 to explain this result we compared the results obtained with other studies to the literature hadfi et al 2018 zhiming et al 2018 the effectiveness of this inhibitor is directly bound to the content of active group p2o7 4 which proves that this inhibition can be explained by the adsorption of pyrophosphate ions p2o7 4 on the surface of calcite according to the simple langmuir adsorption model lin and philip singer 2005 the growth sites are then blocked thus giving rise to the prevention of any precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment 4 conclusion the lcge technique based on the accelerated formation of deposits of calcium carbonate under the effect of degassing of the studied water allowed us to evaluate the power scaling of thus water indeed the application of this technique on the pure calco carbonic water 40 f allowed us to essentially bring out the inhibiting character of scaling of the levall 28 the experimental results allowed us to conclude that germination time in the case of the calco carbonic solution at 40 f is 16 min without inhibitor the addition of 0 3 mg l of levall 28 to the latter makes it possible to avoid the precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment which is the total inhibition of scaling the study carried out on the water of talaint showed that 0 3 mg l of levall 28 completely inhibits the precipitation of calcium carbonate under the conditions of the experiment from the results obtained it is concluded that the effectiveness of inhibitor levall 28 can be explained by the adsorption of pyrophosphate ions p2o7 4 on the surface of the calcite it can act on the growth phase by blocking active sites by adsorption on the calcium carbonate germs present declaration of competing
