3060,water flowpaths caused by incident rainfall onto forest canopy surfaces have a notable effect on the water budgets and chemistry of wooded ecosystems this study revealed varying canopy flowpaths and residence times at the intra event scale and across the phenological transition from leafed to leafless states for a set of three american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh trees in a multilayered canopy simultaneous measurements of raindrops and throughfall drops by fifteen laser disdrometers over five rain events were analyzed during the transition from leafed to leafless phenophases throughfall was partitioned into free throughfall splash throughfall and canopy drip with four drop size classes throughfall drop size distributions and volume of each throughfall type varied at both intra event and inter event scales smaller canopy drips 5 5 mm in diameter were initiated earlier in rain events whereas more rainfall accumulation was necessary to generate larger canopy drips 5 5 mm in diameter smaller canopy drips were more dominant in the leafed phenophase when some structurally mediated woody surface drip points were more muted these results suggested throughfall from foliar surfaces generated smaller sized canopy drip with shorter residence time whereas throughfall from structurally mediated woody surface drip points generated larger sized canopy drip with longer residence time there was also an increase in both free throughfall and splash droplets from leafed to leafless states consistent with increased canopy gaps and direct interaction with woody surfaces in the leafless state based on the results a conceptualization of the genesis and development of leaf and branch flowpaths in canopies is proposed keywords canopy interception throughfall disdrometer residence time plant trait phenology 1 introduction storage in transit through and release of precipitation from forest canopy surfaces has great consequences for water budgets and ecosystems but the details of these processes remain poorly understood temporally varying water storage is a crucial factor controlling evaporation rates from wet canopies horton 1919 but is difficult to measure directly or to constrain through indirect methods the most common technique to estimate storage is through calibration using rainfall and throughfall data and a canopy interception model yet available models are generally useful only over long time periods e g klingaman et al 2007 van dijk et al 2015 linhoss and siegert 2020 because of flawed model structure e g raupach and finnigan 1988 klaassen et al 1998 vrugt et al 2003 schymanski and or 2017 development of better models of precipitation movement through canopies at finer spatial and temporal scales is hampered by lack of detail in the understanding of the canopy store poor model performance at the event scale compromises physical interpretability of derived parameters and limits extrapolation of model predictions beyond the calibration data in particular data are insufficient to differentiate among competing models of the nature of the canopy store despite multiple mutually exclusive conceptual models for example canopies have been treated conflictingly as stores that release no drip until some threshold storage volume mulder 1985 and as stores that release drip proportionally to storage up to a threshold maximum massman 1980 because of these uncertainties the most widely used model that of rutter et al 1971 and its simplification by gash 1979 and subsequent refinements avoids literal description of storage and defines it only in terms of its availability for evaporation some modelers have even completely avoided explicitly resolving canopy storage e g liu 1997 increasing the reliance on calibration canopy storage and release is important for evaporation but also for biogeochemical and ecological processes factors such as contact time and flow routing are important for biogeochemical transformations e g beier et al 1993 robson et al 1994 hansen 1996 tucker et al 2020 and epiphyte habitat e g garth 1964 gauslaa 2014 seasonally variable biological activity and canopy phenology cause strong variations in canopy surfaces and interactions between precipitation and dry deposition or leachate from plants puckett 1990 whelan et al 1998 michalzik et al 2016 klamerus iwan and witek 2018 poor representation of canopy storage and release means that canopy interception models cannot be used to make inferences to these related processes improving models of canopy storage routing and release requires novel data estimates of storage have been nearly universally based on coupled observations of rainfall and throughfall and both evaporation and storage are typically unmeasured the difficulties in making direct observations of evaporation and storage mean that indirect inference will likely still be required into the future but new ways to characterize throughfall may improve insights into canopy processes for example better detail about time varying throughfall rates can improve understanding of dynamic storage drip and evaporation keim and link 2018 and the use of chemical tracers in throughfall has similarly yielded insights allen et al 2017 herbstritt et al 2019 one throughfall characteristic that has great potential to reveal canopy storage and release processes is the drop size distribution dsd the dsds of throughfall are different from the dsds of the rainfall because canopies partition throughfall into free throughfall splash throughfall and canopy drip components moss and green 1987 nanko et al 2006 levia et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 for foliated trees canopy drip generally constitutes the largest volumes levia et al 2019 vegetative surface characteristics and topology especially inclination shape surface roughness the presence of trichomes on leaves and surface hydrophobicity generate characteristic throughfall dsds nanko et al 2006 konrad et al 2012 nanko et al 2013 levia et al 2017 levia et al 2019 lüpke et al 2019 pinos et al 2020 vegetative surfaces and water retention characteristics change with seasons e g klamerus iwan and błońska 2016 and thus dsds likely also vary through time the differing influences of foliar and woody surface flowpaths and subsequent drip points on throughfall dsd e g nanko et al 2016 levia et al 2019 present an opportunity to examine any effects of canopy phenophase on intra event changes in throughfall dsds that may shed light on throughfall generation processes dsds are an important tool for understanding the nature of canopy storage because throughfall drop sizes depend on interactions with vegetative surfaces high energy interactions typified by momentary impact and low residence time in the canopy favor generation of splash droplets whereas low energy interactions typified by longer residence time in storage and drip after flow along surfaces favor generation of larger droplets these relationships permit judicious extrapolation from the dsd to storage and residence times in the canopy the objective of this work is to use the phenological transition from leafed to leafless to determine the role of canopy and canopy phenophase in throughfall generation to accomplish this we quantified throughfall dsds under american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh trees in a forest in maryland usa before during and after autumnal leaf senescence we hypothesized that throughfall dsds change within events and by canopy phenophase because flowpaths through canopies vary by canopy state in particular we hypothesized there are multimodal dsds in throughfall as opposed to unimodal dsds for open rain in addition we hypothesized that dsds of canopy drip vary through events because the generation processes of canopy drip vary through events as canopy states change verification of these hypotheses would be consistent with the overall hypothesis that throughfall takes multiple paths through the canopy and that these change during events and with phenophase 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and study design the research was conducted at fair hill natural resources

estimated by a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences ne usa hudson et al 2017 the study trees occupied an intermediate layer between the understory and overstory as is common for some beech trees as a shade tolerant species fig 1 the lai measured with a lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer above each measuring point of raindrops ranged from 1 37 to 2 21 m2 m 2 on 7 november 2018 and from 0 75 to 2 11 m2 m 2 on 23 january 2019 due to litterfall these values are lower than those of the full growing season as listed above representing snapshots during litterfall and then dormancy the three study trees were in close proximity to each other the three trees had crown base heights of 0 6 1 2 and 1 2 m and overall tree heights of 9 4 7 7 and 8 4 m respectively the distances between the three trees ranged from 8 3 to 9 5 m clusters of four or five disdrometers 14 in total were positioned details are shown in section 2 2 60 cm above the ground within 0 26 2 76 m median 0 87 m of the stem of each of the three trees to measure throughfall tf drops one disdrometer for open rainfall op was positioned in an open field 120 130 m from the under canopy disdrometers 2 2 measuring raindrops and throughfall drops with laser disdrometers the laser disdrometers used to measure raindrop size and velocity in this study were originally developed by nanko et al 2006 and used by pinos et al 2020 each one is equipped with a pair of laser transmitters and receivers ib 30 keyence corporation osaka japan operated by a laser amplifier ib 1000 keyence corporation osaka japan drops were measured within a 4500 mm2 sampling area 30 mm wide and 150 mm long horizontally with 1 mm thickness of the laser beam when a drop passes through the laser beam the laser beam is ablated and the output voltage from the amplifier decreases in proportion to the intercepted area of the laser beam the output voltage 0 5 v from the laser amplifier was collected by a micro controller unit arduino uno every 50 μs 20 khz with 12 bit a d converting and recorded the output voltage data were converted into drop diameter and velocity data pinos et al 2020 while arduino based datalogging systems are cost effective and flexible they are not without their limitations the arduino logging system cannot record data for all drops that pass through sampling area pinos et al 2020 the hardware specifications chiefly a limited sampling rate introduce uncertainty under the following circumstances drops with diameter 0 8 mm a continuous stream of raindrops or throughfall drops an unlikely occurrence and several drops entering the sampling area simultaneously to overcome this a filtering procedure is used to exclude the unreliable data section 2 3 raindrops and tf drops were observed from 26 october to 26 december 2018 nine rain events were obtained with preceding dry intervals of 6 h for five of the nine rain events drop data were collected in both op and tf table 1 2 3 data analysis some of the drop data were removed before data analysis because of instrumental detectability or implausibility the first filter was to eliminate drop diameters 0 8 mm 3 6 in number and 0 6 in volume of the recorded data because the system could not reliably identify voltage decreases affiliated with these small drops pinos et al 2020 for open rainfall the volume fraction of drops with diameter 0 8 mm was 41 at rainfall intensity of 1 mm h 1 and 15 5 for intensity of 10 mm h 1 based on the estimated dsds by marshall and palmer 1948 the second filter was to eliminate drop diameter 10 0 mm although there were none in this study because 10 mm was assumed the maximum raindrop size and larger voltage drops are likely affiliated with multiple drops instead of only one the third filter was drop velocity 12 m s 1 0 2 in number and 2 2 in volume of the recorded data because the velocity was implausibly much higher than terminal velocity the fourth filter was drop velocity less than the theoretical velocity from a fall of 0 5 m laws 1941 6 2 in number and 3 9 in volume of the recorded data these errors likely originated from drops fallen from the disdrometer itself or objects other than drops passing through the laser beam after applying the filters the volume sum of disdrometer measured drops was 39 less than the totals collected below each disdrometer which is the same underestimate reported by pinos et al 2020 this under representation of splash droplets means that the data were best suited to analysis of canopy drip after the filters the drop data were post processed into 1 min intervals and 0 1 mm diameter classes rainfall and tf amounts were calculated from the volume of the measured drops and sampling area of the laser disdrometers throughfall was partitioned into free throughfall fr splash throughfall sp and canopy drip dr by drop size class using simultaneous 1 min interval dsds of both op and tf as described by levia et al 2019 and applied by nanko et al 2020 and pinos et al 2020 the partitioning in this study followed the protocol of pinos et al 2020 assuming the maximum diameter of sp was 2 0 mm and the minimum diameter of dr was 1 0 mm throughfall volume was thus assumed to vary by drop size class d mm at each 1 min interval t tf d t as the sum of fr d t sp d t and dr d t 1 t f d t f r d t s p d t d 1 0 f r d t s p d t d r d t 1 0 d 2 0 f r d t d r d t d 2 0 fr d t was calculated as 2 f r d t p t o p d t where pt is the free throughfall fraction dimensionless from 0 to 1 in each 1 min interval assumed to be the maximum value across all d for which tf d t pt op d t 0 sp d t d 1 0 mm and dr d t d 2 0 mm were calculated by mass balances in the ranges of eq 1 where they were assumed to be the only non fr components of throughfall sp d t 1 0 d 2 0 mm was determined by the weibull cumulative distribution function with weibull coefficients fitted for each 1 min interval and dr d t 1 0 d 2 0 mm then determined from mass balance furthermore dr d t was partitioned into four drop size classes dr d t 4 0 dr d t 4 0 5 5 dr d t 5 5 6 6 and dr d t 6 6 whose subscript indicates diameter mm 3 results 3 1 drop size and velocity at the event and intra event scales with phenophase at the event and intra event scales throughfall drops varied by phenophase as leaves abscised and fell from october to december figs 2 and 3 larger drops were observed in tf than op for example the maximum drop size in op was 5 mm in the events of october 26 and december 14 but many tf drops were 5 mm and some were 7 9 mm fig 2b and 3b in the leafless phenophase there was a gap in the tf dsd near 6 5 mm fig 3b that was not present with leaves on fig 2b at the cessation of op tf was still observed and the time lag between the last drops in op and tf was shorter in the leafless phenophase fig 3a b than the leafed phenophase fig 2a b the relationship between the diameter and the velocity of tf drops changed within events at the beginning of events most of the tf drops were near terminal velocity which is the theoretical velocity for op drops fig 2c and 3c after the canopy began to generate dr throughfall larger drops than the maximum size of op drops were observed with various velocities fig 2d g and 3d g during periods of higher rain rates tf was composed of drops with various sizes and velocities fig 2e and 3g in the absence of op velocities of large tf drops were slower fig 2f and 3f 3 2 drop size distributions dsds among rain events throughfall dsds varied with phenophase fig 4 in contrast with op in which dsds were unimodal fig 4a dsds of tf were multimodal with peaks at 1 2 mm 4 5 mm and 6 8 mm fig 4b tf volume in the 5 5 6 6 mm diameter class was lower than surrounding diameter classes fig 4b dr dsds indicated that dr was partitioned into four drop size classes dr 4 0 dr4 0 5 5 dr5 5 6 6 and dr6 6 fig 4c the tf dsd in diameter 2 mm corresponded with the op dsd fig 4a b two events 12 november and 14 december had smaller op dsds compared with the other three events fig 4a both events had higher tf volume ratio in diameter 2 mm fig 4b as for dr4 0 5 5 a higher volume ratio was observed in the first three events before mid november whereas a lower volume ratio was observed in the last two events after late november fig 4c the diameter at the peak of dr4 0 5 5 dsd became larger with the procession of the phenophases the diameter at the peak of each event was 4 4 4 5 4 9 4 9 and 5 0 mm for each of the five sampled rain events respectively fig 4c as for dr6 6 the shape of the dsds was similar among the events the total volume ratio in each event was 0 030 0 040 0 063 0 048 and 0 049 respectively with respect to dr5 5 6 6 the total volume ratio of dr5 5 6 6 decreased with the procession of the phenophases with values of 0 031 0 023 0 021 0 010 and 0 013 in successive rain events and the canopy progressing toward a leafless state respectively 3 3 throughfall generation processes the proportion of op represented by each of the inferred tf types fr sp and four dr size classes changed as op accumulated in each event fig 5 during the initial 5 mm of op fig 5f j tf increased as a proportion of op and did not reach a stable phase the proportion of op partitioned into fr also increased through the first 5 mm of op in the first two events greater leaf cover but reached a stable phase in last three events decreasing leaf cover the proportion of op partitioned into sp also increased through the first 5 mm of op in the first three events greater leaf cover but was higher at the beginning of the event and afterward decreased and stabilized in last two events decreasing leaf cover the proportions of op categorized as dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 also increased through the first 5 mm of op in all events but approaching stability in later events while the proportions of op categorized as dr5 5 6 6 and dr6 6 were relatively stable after being first generated over the course of entire events the tf volume ratio by op varied by event fig 5a e more op was necessary for tf volume ratio by op to reach a stable phase in earlier events leaf on 5 mm of op was necessary to reach a stable phase on 26 october fig 5a but around 5 mm of op on 14 december fig 5d e after a stable phase tf volume ratio by op did not always remain stable in the first three events greater leaf cover tf volume ratio by op increased in the end of the event or mid event fig 5a c drop size distributions during these periods were dominated by dr 4 0 dr4 0 5 5 and dr6 6 the proportion of op partitioned into fr and sp tended to increase with accumulating op in the 26 october event but changed little during the 9 and 12 november events once the stable phase was reached in the last two events decreasing leaf cover the proportion of op partitioned into dr was largely constant in the stable phase of tf fig 5d e tf volume ratio by op decreased after an initial stable phase in 24 november fig 5d this change was dominated by decreases in fr and sp not by decreases in dr the variability of tf volume ratio by op at the tf measuring points among the rain events varied through the phenophase transition fig 6 as leaf cover decreased the proportion of op partitioned into fr and sp increased dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 decreased and dr6 6 slightly increased the op amount required to initiate dr did not clearly vary across the phenological transition fig 6g j although there is some evidence that the smallest canopy drips were slightly delayed at the beginning of events with more leaves more op was necessary to generate larger dr drops across phenophases to reach 50 of maximum volume ratio a more stable estimate than the op necessary to reach the maximum more op was generally necessary for larger dr fig 6k p with the phenophase transition to leaf off less op was necessary for fr sp dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 but no clear trends were found for generation of dr5 5 6 6 and dr6 6 across the phenophase transition 4 discussion 4 1 leaf flowpaths and branch flowpaths not all canopy flowpaths or drip points are equal in fact per our hypothesis we found that tf dsds are multimodal and vary at both intra event and inter event scales as well as with phenophase for flowpaths ending at foliar or structurally mediated woody surface drip points transformations of drop sizes from those of open rainfall to those of throughfall give several important clues regarding the flowpaths that created the characteristic dsds in throughfall leaf flowpaths were apparently important for drops 5 5 mm because drops smaller than that decreased by 1 3 as the leaves dropped fig 4c branch flowpaths ending at structurally mediated woody surface drip points appeared to be more important for the largest drops 6 6 mm because the proportion of drops of that diameter increased by 1 6 times as leaves dropped fig 6f and exposed branches to more direct rainfall overall our data suggest that throughfall routed to the forest floor from foliar surfaces generated smaller sized dr with more canopy drip generating points and shorter residence time as compared to throughfall last in contact with branch surfaces at structurally mediated woody surface drip points nanko et al 2016 and levia et al 2019 witnessed the same phenomenon whereby the largest diameter canopy drip was generated at structurally mediated woody surface drip points based on the association of throughfall drop sizes with these two flowpaths we suggest a conceptual model of canopy residence time in which flowpath development depends on canopy characteristics fig 7 short residence flowpaths are probably mostly composed of leaf flowpaths because leaves tend to be more hydrophobic than branches and hydrophobic surfaces store less water holder 2013 these shorter residence flowpaths are apparently generally composed of smaller dr as indicated by greater dominance of small drops in the leaf on portion of our dataset fig 4c and 6c d the number of short residence flowpaths is therefore related to the amount of leaves conversely medium and longer residence flowpaths are apparently mostly branch flowpaths as evidenced by relatively stable generation of larger dr across the entire phenological transition the generation of branch dr is especially pronounced at structurally mediated woody surface drip points e g irregular rough points branch concavities which is related to branch architectural characteristics crockford and richardson 2000 herwitz 1987 more rainwater is required to generate branch dr than leaf dr fig 6g j and 6 m p likely because larger local storage capacities of bark are typically higher than leaves campellone et al 2020 it is important to draw a distinction between occasional woody surface drip points and structurally mediated woody surface drip points that tend to generate the largest median drip diameters levia et al 2019 in essence due to adhesive forces especially on saturated branches branchflow has a longer residence time and then accumulates more water volume as it is transported down the branch to a structurally mediated woody surface drip point where momentum transfer of incoming branchflow outweighs adhesive forces and produces larger diameter drops in greater volumes in contrast the initiation of canopy drip along the branch sometimes could be induced by wind or other a biotic mechanism or sometimes along a wetting front as the branch attains saturation at an occasional woody surface drip point occasional woody surface drip points tend to be spatially and temporally transitory while structurally mediated woody surface drip points tend to be fixed as they occur at specific locations once branch flowpaths are saturated herwitz 1987 levia et al 2019 canopy drip generated at an occasional woody surface drip point is of smaller diameter and volume than the canopy drip originating from structurally mediated woody surface drip points or even foliar drip points in many cases levia et al 2019 it is important to note that the range of canopy drip diameters between foliar drip points and woody surface drip points overlap and depending on local conditions e g timing within a discrete event wind species they may be more or less equal or one could exceed the other structurally mediated woody surface drip points may sometimes be amplified or dampened by foliage 4 2 intra event variation of canopy flowpaths from the evolution of drop sizes in throughfall we infer that canopy flowpaths vary throughout the progression of rain events this intra event variation of canopy flowpaths must be at least partly attributable to vertical wet up of the canopy especially for our sample trees positioned between the under and overstory at the onset of the event throughfall is mostly composed of fr and sp and less dr initial rain intercepted by the canopy mostly wets the upper canopy and starts to develop leaf and branch flowpaths soon as flowpaths in the upper canopy layer develop canopy drip from shorter residence flowpaths begins and drip points higher in the canopy generate dr sooner than lower portions of the canopy a crucial piece of evidence supporting this interpretation in our data is drop velocity approximately 12 14 m is necessary for drops of the size we measured to reach terminal velocity wang and pruppacher 1977 canopy height was approximately 23 m so only dr generated from the upper half of the canopy could obtain terminal velocity as we observed dr generated from the canopy at heights of 12 m would not reach terminal velocity as for water drops with a 5 mm diameter fall velocities would have reached 9 25 8 86 and 4 27 m s 1 with fall heights of 20 5 and 1 m respectively laws 1941 progressive wet up of lower canopy layers occurs by rainfall directly or by sp and dr routed from upper layers the progress of canopy wet up apparently increases the number of leaf flowpaths in all canopy layers and starts to generate branch flowpaths the evidence for this is that larger dr did not initiate early in events indicating that these pathways always required substantial wet up fig 2b 3b and 6 g j saturated branch pathways may route to stemflow all the way to the soil surface dunkerley 2014 but some stemflow pathways typically result in drip from the branch surface the conceptual model we present here is consistent with and helps explain observations in previous observations of throughfall drop generation and stemflow consistent with our conceptual model of progressive wetting nanko et al 2008 2011 found that the mean velocity of dr was lower from a saturated canopy than one undergoing canopy wetting this likely means that a saturated canopy generated dr from various canopy layers instead of only the higher layers typical of dr from wetting canopies another key conclusion from our research is that wetter canopies generate larger dr at structurally mediated woody surface drip points along branch flowpaths this conclusion is consistent with experimental observations that such woody surface drip points generate larger dr than foliar surfaces nanko et al 2016 levia et al 2019 the dr dsds are affected by canopy architecture water repellency and inclination of the plant surfaces konrad et al 2012 experimental work has consistently shown that bark surfaces are usually rougher campellone et al 2020 and more hydrophilic i e less water repellent than leaves herwitz 1987 both of which promote the retention of water in longer residence flowpaths levia et al 2019 showed the volume fraction of dr increased most gradually for coniferous species from the onset of simulated rain events during an indoor rainfall simulation when rain ceases the top canopy layer generates progressively fewer dr as storage empties but the lower canopy layers continue to generate longer dr by the supply of water via leaf and branch flowpaths from above this is why tf continues after the end of rainfall there are likely nonlinearities and thresholds in the relationships between precipitation characteristics and flowpaths rainfall intensity drop sizes and wind affect momentum of rainfall which therefore affects detention on vegetation aston 1979 calder et al 1996 hörmann et al 1996 keim et al 2006 and the generation of stemflow herwitz 1987 zhang et al 2021 4 3 seasonal variation of canopy flowpaths canopy flowpaths vary seasonally because of varying canopy morphology during the foliated season our observations are consistent with the conclusion that dr is generated more by drip points along leaf flowpaths and less by drip points along branch flowpaths with leaf abscission more rain fell directly on woody surfaces initiating longer residence branch flowpaths dr by leaf flowpaths decreased during leaf fall and finally leaf flowpaths disappeared dr during the unfoliated season was mostly generated at structurally mediated woody surface drip points along branch flowpaths this transformation is supported by the observation that the sizes of dr became larger through the phenological transition dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 in fig 4c and 6c d in addition dr dsds are influenced by plant surface traits especially leaf inclination and surface hydrophobicity konrad et al 2012 nanko et al 2013 nanko et al 2016 hydrophilic leaves generated larger dr than hydrophobic leaves nanko et al 2013 although we do not have data spanning the entire growing season it may be that the leaf generated drops we observed were larger than those generated in the early growing season klamerus iwan błońska 2017 showed that leaf surface hydrophobicity decreased for quercus robur as leaf surfaces changed over the course of the growing season as leaves fell our results show that more fr reached the forest floor but the proportion of fr we estimated was lower than the canopy openness we measured as leaves fell fr volume ratio by op increased from 0 1 to 0 2 but clearly leaves accounted for 10 of the initial contacts with rainfall when the canopy was in full leaf median canopy openness estimated by lai 2000 was 0 187 on 7 november and 0 328 on 23 january respectively these values are relatively higher than fr volume fractions by op the most likely reason that our estimates of fr were only 55 60 of the fr expected by canopy gaps is that rainfall is generally inclined by wind and therefore experiences a non vertical pathway through the canopy that is more likely to be intercepted by plant surfaces when estimating fr ratio from canopy coverage raindrop inclination wind direction and three dimensional canopy coverage should therefore be considered and vertical gap measurements are likely to be overestimates of fr although our data on splash droplets was limited by detectability problems below drop sizes of 0 8 mm we nonetheless observed more sp on the basis of cumulative drop volume reaching forest floor with defoliation the likely explanation for this is differences in the way sp is generated between leaves and branches the sizes of sp depend on surface and drop characteristics yarin 2006 when a raindrop impacts a leaf less water is detained on the surface and more splash droplets are generated compared to impact onto a branch herwitz 1987 on the other hand leaves are more elastic than branches and a part of the kinetic energy of a drop is converted into elastic energy ginebra solanellas et al 2020 holder et al 2020 lauderbaugh et al 2021 konrad et al 2021 and thus energy available for generating splash decreases and fewer splash droplets are generated if the surface wettability is same the less elastic organs generate more sp than more elastic ones roth nebelsick et al 2022 the balance of wettability between leaves and branches and vertical structures of canopy layers could be responsible for the seasonal change in sp amount it is an open question whether the same phenomenon would be observed in fine droplets 5 conclusions this study advanced our understanding of canopy storage and throughfall generation by utilizing a dense network of disdrometers at the intra event scale to examine the interrelationships among canopy phenophase and throughfall dsd this study has revealed the seasonal variation of the throughfall generation process based on simultaneous raindrop measurements at 14 points under the test trees from previous work we know that dsds reveal partitioning into free throughfall fr splash throughfall sp and canopy drip dr based on previous work on dsd generation and on the changes in dsds we observed through the phenological transition we inferred that dr was separated into dr from leaves and branches based on the sizes of dr the hypotheses that throughfall dsds changes within events and by canopy phenophase and throughfall had multimodal dsds due to various generation processes of canopy drip through events as canopy states change were supported we infer that flowpaths ending at foliar drip points had shorter residence times and generated smaller dr at more drip points in contrast we infer that branch flowpaths terminating at structurally mediated woody surface drip points had longer residence time that generated larger dr leaf flowpaths decreased and branch flowpaths increased with the leaf senescence and the transition to a leafless canopy

and residence times at the intra event scale and across the phenological transition from leafed to leafless states for a set of three american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh trees in a multilayered canopy simultaneous measurements of raindrops and throughfall drops by fifteen laser disdrometers over five rain events were analyzed during the transition from leafed to leafless phenophases throughfall was partitioned into free throughfall splash throughfall and canopy drip with four drop size classes throughfall drop size distributions and volume of each throughfall type varied at both

residence time there was also an increase in both free throughfall and splash droplets from leafed to leafless states consistent with increased canopy gaps and direct interaction with woody surfaces

residence time plant trait phenology 1 introduction storage in transit through and release of precipitation from forest canopy surfaces has great consequences for water budgets and ecosystems but the details of these processes remain poorly understood temporally varying water storage is a crucial factor controlling evaporation rates from wet canopies horton 1919 but is difficult to measure directly or to constrain through indirect methods the most common technique to estimate storage is through calibration using rainfall and throughfall data and a canopy interception model yet available models are generally useful only over long time periods e g klingaman et al 2007 van dijk et al 2015 linhoss and siegert 2020 because of flawed model structure e g raupach and finnigan 1988 klaassen et al 1998 vrugt et al 2003 schymanski and or 2017 development of better models of precipitation movement through canopies at finer spatial and temporal scales is hampered by lack of detail in the understanding of the canopy store poor model performance at the event scale compromises physical interpretability of derived parameters and limits extrapolation of model predictions beyond the calibration data in particular data are insufficient to differentiate among competing models of the nature of the canopy store despite multiple mutually exclusive conceptual models for example canopies have been treated conflictingly as stores that release no drip until some threshold storage volume mulder 1985 and as stores that release drip proportionally to storage up to a threshold maximum massman 1980 because of these uncertainties the most widely used model that of rutter et al 1971 and its simplification by gash 1979 and subsequent refinements avoids literal description of storage and defines it only in terms of its availability for evaporation some modelers have even completely avoided explicitly resolving canopy storage e g liu 1997 increasing the reliance on calibration canopy storage and release is important for evaporation but also for biogeochemical and ecological processes factors such as contact time and flow routing are important for biogeochemical transformations e g beier et al 1993 robson et al 1994 hansen 1996 tucker et al 2020 and epiphyte habitat e g garth 1964 gauslaa 2014 seasonally variable biological activity and canopy phenology cause strong variations in canopy surfaces and interactions between precipitation and dry deposition or leachate from plants puckett 1990 whelan et al 1998 michalzik et al 2016 klamerus iwan and witek 2018 poor representation of canopy storage and release means that canopy interception models cannot be used to make inferences to these related processes improving models of canopy storage routing and release requires novel data estimates of storage have been nearly universally based on coupled observations of rainfall and throughfall and both evaporation and storage are typically unmeasured the difficulties in making direct observations of evaporation and storage mean that indirect inference will likely still be required into the future but new ways to characterize throughfall may improve insights into canopy processes for example better detail about time varying throughfall rates can improve understanding of dynamic storage drip and evaporation keim and link 2018 and the use of chemical tracers in throughfall has similarly yielded insights allen et al 2017 herbstritt et al 2019 one throughfall characteristic that has great potential to reveal canopy storage and release processes is the drop size distribution dsd the dsds of throughfall are different from the dsds of the rainfall because canopies partition throughfall into free throughfall splash throughfall and canopy drip components moss and green 1987 nanko et al 2006 levia et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 for foliated trees canopy drip generally constitutes the largest volumes levia et al 2019 vegetative surface characteristics and topology especially inclination shape surface roughness the presence of trichomes on leaves and surface hydrophobicity generate characteristic throughfall dsds nanko et al 2006

błońska 2016 and thus dsds likely also vary through time the differing influences of foliar and woody surface flowpaths and subsequent drip points on throughfall dsd e g nanko et al 2016 levia et al 2019 present an opportunity to examine any effects of canopy phenophase on intra event changes in throughfall dsds that may shed light on throughfall generation processes dsds are an important tool for understanding the nature of canopy storage because throughfall drop sizes depend on interactions with vegetative surfaces high energy interactions typified by momentary impact and low residence time in the canopy favor generation of splash droplets whereas low energy interactions typified by longer residence time in storage and drip after flow along surfaces favor generation of larger droplets these relationships permit judicious extrapolation from the dsd to storage and residence times in the canopy the objective of this work is to use the phenological transition from leafed to leafless to determine the role of canopy and canopy phenophase in throughfall generation to accomplish this we quantified throughfall dsds under american beech fagus grandifolia ehrh trees in a forest in maryland usa before during and after autumnal leaf senescence we hypothesized that throughfall dsds change within events and by canopy phenophase because flowpaths through canopies vary by canopy state in particular we hypothesized there are multimodal dsds in throughfall as opposed to unimodal dsds for open rain in addition we hypothesized that dsds of canopy drip vary through events because the generation processes of canopy drip vary through events as canopy states change verification of these hypotheses would be consistent with the overall hypothesis that throughfall takes multiple paths through the canopy and that these change during events and with phenophase 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and study design the research was conducted at fair hill natural resources

stem of each of the three trees to measure throughfall tf drops one disdrometer for open rainfall op was positioned in an open field 120 130 m from the under canopy disdrometers 2 2 measuring raindrops and throughfall drops with laser disdrometers the laser disdrometers used to measure raindrop size and velocity in this study were originally developed by nanko et al 2006 and used by pinos et al 2020 each one is equipped with a pair of laser transmitters and receivers ib 30 keyence corporation osaka japan operated by a laser amplifier ib 1000 keyence corporation osaka japan drops were measured within a 4500 mm2 sampling area 30 mm wide and 150 mm long horizontally with 1 mm thickness of the laser beam when a drop passes through the laser beam the laser beam is ablated and the output voltage from the amplifier decreases in proportion to the intercepted area of the laser beam the output voltage 0 5 v from the laser amplifier was collected by a micro controller unit arduino uno every 50 μs 20 khz with 12 bit a d converting and recorded the output voltage data were converted into drop diameter and velocity data pinos et al 2020 while arduino based datalogging systems are cost effective and flexible they are not without their limitations the arduino logging system cannot record data for all drops that pass through sampling area pinos et al 2020 the hardware specifications chiefly a limited sampling rate introduce uncertainty under the following circumstances drops with diameter 0 8 mm a continuous stream of raindrops or throughfall drops an unlikely occurrence and several drops entering the sampling area simultaneously to overcome this a filtering procedure is used to exclude the unreliable data section 2 3 raindrops and tf drops were observed from 26 october to 26 december 2018 nine rain events were obtained with preceding dry intervals of 6 h for five of the nine rain events drop data were collected in both op and tf table 1 2 3 data analysis some of the drop data were removed before data analysis because of instrumental detectability or implausibility the first filter was to eliminate drop diameters 0 8 mm 3 6 in number and 0 6 in volume of the recorded data because the system could not reliably identify voltage decreases affiliated with these small drops pinos et al 2020 for open rainfall the volume fraction of drops with diameter 0 8 mm was 41 at rainfall intensity of 1 mm h 1 and 15 5 for intensity of 10 mm h 1 based on the estimated dsds by marshall and palmer 1948 the second filter was to eliminate drop diameter 10 0 mm although there were none in this study because 10 mm was assumed the maximum raindrop size and larger voltage drops are likely affiliated with multiple drops instead of only one the third filter was drop velocity 12 m s 1 0 2 in number and 2 2 in volume of the recorded data because the velocity was implausibly much higher than terminal velocity the fourth filter was drop velocity less than the theoretical velocity from a fall of 0 5 m laws 1941 6 2 in number and 3 9 in volume of the recorded data these errors likely originated from drops fallen from the disdrometer itself or objects other than drops passing through the laser beam after applying the filters the volume sum of disdrometer measured drops was 39 less than the totals collected below each disdrometer which is the same underestimate reported by pinos et al 2020 this under representation of splash droplets means that the data were best suited to analysis of canopy drip after the filters the drop data were post processed into 1 min intervals and 0 1 mm diameter classes rainfall and tf amounts were calculated from the volume of the measured drops and sampling area of the laser disdrometers throughfall was partitioned into free throughfall fr splash throughfall sp and canopy drip dr by drop size class using simultaneous 1 min interval dsds of both op and tf as described by levia et al 2019 and applied by nanko et al 2020 and pinos et al 2020 the partitioning in this study followed the protocol of pinos et al 2020 assuming the maximum diameter of sp was 2 0 mm and the minimum diameter of dr was 1 0 mm throughfall volume was thus assumed to vary by drop size class d mm at each 1 min interval t tf d t as the sum of fr d t sp d t and dr d t 1 t f d t f r d t s p d t d 1 0 f r d t s p d t d r d t 1 0 d 2 0 f r d t d r d t d 2 0 fr d t was calculated as 2 f r d t p t o p d t where pt is the free throughfall fraction dimensionless from 0 to 1 in each 1 min interval assumed to be the maximum value across all d for which tf d t pt op d t 0 sp d t d 1 0 mm and dr d t d 2 0 mm were calculated by mass balances in the ranges of eq 1 where they were assumed to be the only non fr components of throughfall sp d t 1 0 d 2 0 mm was determined by the weibull cumulative distribution function with weibull coefficients fitted for each 1 min interval and dr d t 1 0 d 2 0 mm then determined from mass balance furthermore dr d t was partitioned into four drop size classes dr d t 4 0 dr d t 4 0 5 5 dr d t 5 5 6 6 and dr d t 6 6 whose subscript indicates diameter mm 3 results 3 1 drop size and velocity at the event and intra event scales with phenophase at the event and intra event scales throughfall drops varied by phenophase as leaves abscised and fell from october to december figs 2 and 3 larger drops were observed in tf than op for example the maximum drop size in op was 5 mm in the events of october 26 and december 14 but many tf drops were 5 mm and some were 7 9 mm fig 2b and 3b in the leafless phenophase there was a gap in the tf dsd near 6 5 mm fig 3b that was not present with leaves on fig 2b at the cessation of op tf was still observed and the time lag between the last drops in op and tf was shorter in the leafless phenophase fig 3a b than the leafed phenophase fig 2a b the relationship between the diameter and the velocity of tf drops changed within events at the beginning of events most of the tf drops were near terminal velocity which is the theoretical velocity for op drops fig 2c and 3c after the canopy began to generate dr throughfall larger drops than the maximum size of op drops were observed with various velocities fig 2d g and 3d g during periods of higher rain rates tf was composed of drops with various sizes and velocities fig 2e and 3g in the absence of op velocities of large tf drops were slower fig 2f and 3f 3 2 drop size distributions dsds among rain events throughfall dsds varied with phenophase fig 4 in contrast with op in which dsds were unimodal fig 4a dsds of tf were multimodal with peaks at 1 2 mm 4 5 mm and 6 8 mm fig 4b tf volume in the 5 5 6 6 mm diameter class was lower than surrounding diameter classes fig 4b dr dsds indicated that dr was partitioned into four drop size classes dr 4 0 dr4 0 5 5 dr5 5 6 6 and dr6 6 fig 4c the tf dsd in diameter 2 mm corresponded with the op dsd fig 4a b two events 12 november and 14 december had smaller op dsds compared with the other three events fig 4a both events had higher tf volume ratio in diameter 2 mm fig 4b as for dr4 0 5 5 a higher volume ratio was observed in the first three events before mid november whereas a lower volume ratio was observed in the last two events after late november fig 4c the diameter at the peak of dr4 0 5 5 dsd became larger with the procession of the phenophases the diameter at the peak of each event was 4 4 4 5 4 9 4 9 and 5 0 mm for each of the five sampled rain events respectively fig 4c as for dr6 6 the shape of the dsds was similar among the events the total volume ratio in each event was 0 030 0 040 0 063 0 048 and 0 049 respectively with respect to dr5 5 6 6 the total volume ratio of dr5 5 6 6 decreased with the procession of the phenophases with values of 0 031 0 023 0 021 0 010 and 0 013 in successive rain events and the canopy progressing toward a leafless state respectively 3 3 throughfall generation processes the proportion of op represented by each of the inferred tf types fr sp and four dr size classes changed as op accumulated in each event fig 5 during the initial 5 mm of op fig 5f j tf increased as a proportion of op and did not reach a stable phase the proportion of op partitioned into fr also increased through the first 5 mm of op in the first two events greater leaf cover but reached a stable phase in last three events decreasing leaf cover the proportion of op partitioned into sp also increased through the first 5 mm of op in the first three events greater leaf cover but was higher at the beginning of the event and afterward decreased and stabilized in last two events decreasing leaf cover the proportions of op categorized as dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 also increased through the first 5 mm of op in all events but approaching stability in later events while the proportions of op categorized as dr5 5 6 6 and dr6 6 were relatively stable after being first generated over the course of entire events the tf volume ratio by op varied by event fig 5a e more op was necessary for tf volume ratio by op to reach a stable phase in earlier events leaf on 5 mm of op was necessary to reach a stable phase on 26 october fig 5a but around 5 mm of op on 14 december fig 5d e after a stable phase tf volume ratio by op did not always remain stable in the first three events greater leaf cover tf volume ratio by op increased in the end of the event or mid event fig 5a c drop size distributions during these periods were dominated by dr 4 0 dr4 0 5 5 and dr6 6 the proportion of op partitioned into fr and sp tended to increase with accumulating op in the 26 october event but changed little during the 9 and 12 november events once the stable phase was reached in the last two events decreasing leaf cover the proportion of op partitioned into dr was largely constant in the stable phase of tf fig 5d e tf volume ratio by op decreased after an initial stable phase in 24 november fig 5d this change was dominated by decreases in fr and sp not by decreases in dr the variability of tf volume ratio by op at the tf measuring points among the rain events varied through the phenophase transition fig 6 as leaf cover decreased the proportion of op partitioned into fr and sp increased dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 decreased and dr6 6 slightly increased the op amount required to initiate dr did not clearly vary across the phenological transition fig 6g j although there is some evidence that the smallest canopy drips were slightly delayed at the beginning of events with more leaves more op was necessary to generate larger dr drops across phenophases to reach 50 of maximum volume ratio a more stable estimate than the op necessary to reach the maximum more op was generally necessary for larger dr fig 6k p with the phenophase transition to leaf off less op was necessary for fr sp dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 but no clear trends were found for generation of dr5 5 6 6 and dr6 6 across the phenophase transition 4 discussion 4 1 leaf flowpaths and branch flowpaths not all canopy flowpaths or drip points are equal in fact per our hypothesis we found that tf dsds are multimodal and vary at both intra event and inter event scales as well as with phenophase for flowpaths ending at foliar or structurally mediated woody surface drip points transformations of drop sizes from those of open rainfall to those of throughfall give several important clues regarding the flowpaths that created the characteristic dsds in throughfall leaf flowpaths were apparently important for drops 5 5 mm because drops smaller than that decreased by 1 3 as the leaves dropped fig 4c branch flowpaths ending at structurally mediated woody surface drip points appeared to be more important for the largest drops 6 6 mm because the proportion of drops of that diameter increased by 1 6 times as leaves dropped fig 6f and exposed branches to more direct rainfall overall our data suggest that throughfall routed to the forest floor from foliar surfaces generated smaller sized dr with more canopy drip generating points and shorter residence time as compared to throughfall last in contact with branch surfaces at structurally mediated woody surface drip points nanko et al 2016 and levia et al 2019 witnessed the same phenomenon whereby the largest diameter canopy drip was generated at structurally mediated woody surface drip points based on the association of throughfall drop sizes with these two flowpaths we suggest a conceptual model of canopy residence time in which flowpath development depends on canopy characteristics fig 7 short residence flowpaths are probably mostly composed of leaf flowpaths because leaves tend to be more hydrophobic than branches and hydrophobic surfaces store less water holder 2013 these shorter residence flowpaths are apparently generally composed of smaller dr as indicated by greater dominance of small drops in the leaf on portion of our dataset fig 4c and 6c d the number of short residence flowpaths is therefore related to the amount of leaves conversely medium and longer residence flowpaths are apparently mostly branch flowpaths as evidenced by relatively stable generation of larger dr across the entire phenological transition the generation of branch dr is especially pronounced at structurally mediated woody surface drip points e g irregular rough points branch concavities which is related to branch architectural characteristics crockford and richardson 2000 herwitz 1987 more rainwater is required to generate branch dr than leaf dr fig 6g j and 6 m p likely because larger local storage capacities of bark are typically higher than leaves campellone et al 2020 it is important to draw a distinction between occasional woody surface drip points and structurally mediated woody surface drip points that tend to generate the largest median drip diameters levia et al 2019 in essence due to adhesive forces especially on saturated branches branchflow has a longer residence time and then accumulates more water volume as it is transported down the branch to a structurally mediated woody surface drip point where momentum transfer of incoming branchflow outweighs adhesive forces and produces larger diameter drops in greater volumes in contrast the initiation of canopy drip along the branch sometimes could be induced by wind or other a biotic mechanism or sometimes along a wetting front as the branch attains saturation at an occasional woody surface drip point occasional woody surface drip points tend to be spatially and temporally transitory while structurally mediated woody surface drip points tend to be fixed as they occur at specific locations once branch flowpaths are saturated herwitz 1987 levia et al 2019 canopy drip generated at an occasional woody surface drip point is of smaller diameter and volume than the canopy drip originating from structurally mediated woody surface drip points or even foliar drip points in many cases levia et al 2019 it is important to note that the range of canopy drip diameters between foliar drip points and woody surface drip points overlap and depending on local conditions e g timing within a discrete event wind species they may be more or less equal or one could exceed the other structurally mediated woody surface drip points may sometimes be amplified or dampened by foliage 4 2 intra event variation of canopy flowpaths from the evolution of drop sizes in throughfall we infer that canopy flowpaths vary throughout the progression of rain events this intra event variation of canopy flowpaths must be at least partly attributable to vertical wet up of the canopy especially for our sample trees positioned between the under and overstory at the onset of the event throughfall is mostly composed of fr and sp and less dr initial rain intercepted by the canopy mostly wets the upper canopy and starts to develop leaf and branch flowpaths soon as flowpaths in the upper canopy layer develop canopy drip from shorter residence flowpaths begins and drip points higher in the canopy generate dr sooner than lower portions of the canopy a crucial piece of evidence supporting this interpretation in our data is drop velocity approximately 12 14 m is necessary for drops of the size we measured to reach terminal velocity wang and pruppacher 1977 canopy height was approximately 23 m so only dr generated from the upper half of the canopy could obtain terminal velocity as we observed dr generated from the canopy at heights of 12 m would not reach terminal velocity as for water drops with a 5 mm diameter fall velocities would have reached 9 25 8 86 and 4 27 m s 1 with fall heights of 20 5 and 1 m respectively laws 1941 progressive wet up of lower canopy layers occurs by rainfall directly or by sp and dr routed from upper layers the progress of canopy wet up apparently increases the number of leaf flowpaths in all canopy layers and starts to generate branch flowpaths the evidence for this is that larger dr did not initiate early in events indicating that these pathways always required substantial wet up fig 2b 3b and 6 g j saturated branch pathways may route to stemflow all the way to the soil surface dunkerley 2014 but some stemflow pathways typically result in drip from the branch surface the conceptual model we present here is consistent with and helps explain observations in previous observations of throughfall drop generation and stemflow consistent with our conceptual model of progressive wetting nanko et al 2008 2011 found that the mean velocity of dr was lower from a saturated canopy than one undergoing canopy wetting this likely means that a saturated canopy generated dr from various canopy layers instead of only the higher layers typical of dr from wetting canopies another key conclusion from our research is that wetter canopies generate larger dr at structurally mediated woody surface drip points along branch flowpaths this conclusion is consistent with experimental observations that such woody surface drip points generate larger dr than foliar surfaces nanko et al 2016 levia et al 2019 the dr dsds are affected by canopy architecture water repellency and inclination of the plant surfaces konrad et al 2012 experimental work has consistently shown that bark surfaces are usually rougher campellone et al 2020 and more hydrophilic i e less water repellent than leaves herwitz 1987 both of which promote the retention of water in longer residence flowpaths levia et al 2019 showed the volume fraction of dr increased most gradually for coniferous species from the onset of simulated rain events during an indoor rainfall simulation when rain ceases the top canopy layer generates progressively fewer dr as storage empties but the lower canopy layers continue to generate longer dr by the supply of water via leaf and branch flowpaths from above this is why tf continues after the end of rainfall there are likely nonlinearities and thresholds in the relationships between precipitation characteristics and flowpaths rainfall intensity drop sizes and wind affect momentum of rainfall which therefore affects detention on vegetation aston 1979 calder et al 1996 hörmann et al 1996 keim et al 2006 and the generation of stemflow herwitz 1987 zhang et al 2021 4 3 seasonal variation of canopy flowpaths canopy flowpaths vary seasonally because of varying canopy morphology during the foliated season our observations are consistent with the conclusion that dr is generated more by drip points along leaf flowpaths and less by drip points along branch flowpaths with leaf abscission more rain fell directly on woody surfaces initiating longer residence branch flowpaths dr by leaf flowpaths decreased during leaf fall and finally leaf flowpaths disappeared dr during the unfoliated season was mostly generated at structurally mediated woody surface drip points along branch flowpaths this transformation is supported by the observation that the sizes of dr became larger through the phenological transition dr 4 0 and dr4 0 5 5 in fig 4c and 6c d in addition dr dsds are influenced by plant surface traits especially leaf inclination and surface hydrophobicity konrad et al 2012 nanko et al 2013 nanko et al 2016 hydrophilic leaves generated larger dr than hydrophobic leaves nanko et al 2013 although we do not have data spanning the entire growing season it may be that the leaf generated drops we observed were larger than those generated in the early growing season klamerus iwan błońska 2017 showed that leaf surface hydrophobicity decreased for quercus robur as leaf surfaces changed over the course of the growing season as leaves fell our results show that more fr reached the forest floor but the proportion of fr we estimated was lower than the canopy openness we measured as leaves fell fr volume ratio by op increased from 0 1 to 0 2 but clearly leaves accounted for 10 of the initial contacts with rainfall when the canopy was in full leaf median canopy openness estimated by lai 2000 was 0 187 on 7 november and 0 328 on 23 january respectively these values are relatively higher than fr volume fractions by op the most likely reason that our estimates of fr were only 55 60 of the fr expected by canopy gaps is that rainfall is generally inclined by wind and therefore experiences a non vertical pathway through the canopy that is more likely to be intercepted by plant surfaces when estimating fr ratio from canopy coverage raindrop inclination wind direction and three dimensional canopy coverage should therefore be considered and vertical gap measurements are likely to be overestimates of fr although our data on splash droplets was limited by detectability problems below drop sizes of 0 8 mm we nonetheless observed more sp on the basis of cumulative drop volume reaching forest floor with defoliation the likely explanation for this is differences in the way sp is generated between leaves and branches the sizes of sp depend on surface and drop characteristics yarin 2006 when a raindrop impacts a leaf less water is detained on the surface and more splash droplets are generated compared to impact onto a branch herwitz 1987 on the other hand leaves are more elastic than branches and a part of the kinetic energy of a drop is converted into elastic energy ginebra solanellas et al 2020 holder et al 2020 lauderbaugh et al 2021 konrad et al 2021 and thus energy available for generating splash decreases and fewer splash droplets are generated if the surface wettability is same the less elastic organs generate more sp than more elastic ones roth nebelsick et al 2022 the balance of wettability between leaves and branches and vertical structures of canopy layers could be responsible for the seasonal change in sp amount it is an open question whether the same phenomenon would be observed in fine droplets 5 conclusions this study advanced our understanding of canopy storage and throughfall generation by utilizing a dense network of disdrometers at the intra event scale to examine the interrelationships among canopy phenophase and throughfall dsd this study has revealed the seasonal variation of the throughfall generation process based on simultaneous raindrop measurements at 14 points under the test trees from previous work we know that dsds reveal partitioning into free throughfall fr splash throughfall sp and canopy drip dr based on previous work on dsd generation and on the changes in dsds we observed through the phenological transition we inferred that dr was separated into dr from leaves and branches based on the sizes of dr the hypotheses that throughfall dsds changes within events and by canopy phenophase and throughfall had multimodal dsds due to various generation processes of canopy drip through events as canopy states change were supported we infer that flowpaths ending at foliar drip points had shorter residence times and generated smaller dr at more drip points in contrast we infer that branch flowpaths terminating at structurally mediated woody surface drip points had longer residence time that generated larger dr leaf flowpaths decreased and branch flowpaths increased with the leaf senescence and the transition to a leafless canopy

planning most commonly applied machine learning ml procedures for pluvial flood risk assessment neglect to account for spatio temporal constraints leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error in this paper we propose a novel ml based methodology for pluvial flood risk prediction in the metropolitan city of venice which introducing a features selection process and spatio temporal cross validation permits to reduce overfitting of the resulting ml models spatio temporal characteristics of floods are derived from a dataset of 60 historical events occurred in the area between 1995 and 2020 logistic regression lr neural networks nn and random forest rf models are applied to identify and prioritize sub areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk considering the daily precipitation amount and 12 different triggering factors the models were validated using random cross validation r cv and leave location and time out cross validation llto cv that split data in training and validation set considering both time and space in addition a forward features selection procedure was applied to identify the features among the triggering factors that better face spatio temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on the area under the curve auc score results suggest that logistic regression and llto cv represent the most reliable model to predict pluvial flood events in new spatio temporal conditions while among the triggering factors distance to river and distance to road resulted the prominent ones keywords pluvial flood

generally larger and longer lasting events recent research suggested that due to the frequent nature of pluvial floods cumulative direct damages of such type of flood equals or may even exceed those derived from riverine and coastal ones eea 2020 nicklin et al 2019 pluvial flood distinguishes it from riverine and coastal flooding river flood are characterized by gradual riverbank overflows caused by extensive rainfall over an extended period while coastal flooding occurs as a consequence of extreme tidal conditions caused by severe weather e g storm surge strong winds maddox 2014 by contrast pluvial floods occur when intense rainfall cannot drain quickly enough by urban drainage system kalantari et al 2019 sperotto et al 2015 they are usually associated with high intensity rainfall rates but can also occur with low rainfall rates when the ground has low permeability and is urbanized falconer et al 2008 the intensification of heavy rainfall phenomena due to climate change ipcc 2021 accompanied by urbanization land use land cover change modification in river morphology agricultural practices and soil degradation is likely to exacerbate pluvial flood risks hoegh guldberg et al 2018 shahabi et al 2021 especially in urban areas where the formation of micro climates can further influence rainfall patterns kalantari et al 2019 shahabi et al 2021 being able to identify and predict pluvial flood prone areas at local level and how such areas will be shaped by future rainfall patterns is crucial to ensure sufficient time for people to respond to future floods as well as to set the basis for the prioritization of flood risk reduction investments accordingly pluvial flood risk mapping is becoming a key step in the development of flood mitigation and early warnings as well as climate change adaptation strategies informing the implementation of the sendai framework for drr 2015 2030 unisdr 2015 and the multi hazard risk assessments compelled by the eu civil protection mechanism according to the existing literature maragno et al 2021 multiple and diverse methodologies have been developed to study the pluvial flood risk in urban areas the most widely applied method for flood mapping involved the use of hydraulic and hydrodynamic models li 2011 to simulate the inundated areas and water depth based on historical or predicted rainfall data different kind of models have been employed so far including among others mike flood löwe et al 2017 kaspersen et al 2017 mike 21 wen et al 2013 rana et al 2012 shrestha et al 2020 mike 3 bolanos et al 2014 sørensen et al 2004 pietrzak et al 2002 hec ras shrestha et al 2020 ranaee et al 2009 thakur et al 2017 vojtek et al 2019 soil water assessment tool swat pagliero et al 2014 yoon et al 2021 info works icm cheng et al 2017 hydrotel ben aissa et al 2012 however despite hydraulic and hydrodynamic flooding models are characterized by a high level of accuracy their practical application for pluvial flood assessment is often hampered by the limited understanding of hydrological and hydrodynamic processes by complex input data requirements the high computational time and costs yan et al 2021 wagenaar et al 2020 beyer and laney 2012 these kinds of models require a high amount of data and variables for their calibration to be able to accurately represent the flood dynamic in the urban environment characterized by highly complex flow paths and microscale topographic features dramatically increasing the computational burden samela et al 2020 physical based models can simulate water flows at sub daily level and at multiple timescales e g hourly rate three or six hourly rate however it expands the computational resource demand which lead to inconsistent predictions when setups overlap in the time ranges boithias et al 2017 gauch et al 2021 moreover at present hydraulic and hydrodynamic models require a long calculation time problem which become prominent when working at the urban scale requiring high spatial resolution it represents a bottleneck of rapid pluvial flood mapping and especially for those application that require re iterative analysis guo et al 2020 or prediction over alternative precipitation scenarios leitao et al 2010 ke et al 2020 for such reason the use of process models may not always be feasible for real time flood mapping and operative flood warning to be used for urban flood risk assessment and emergency management when instead accurate and timely outputs become more important than system understanding wagenaar et al 2020 on the other hand geographic information system gis and remote sensing techniques have been developed as useful tools for spatial analysis in flood hazard assessment ghorbanzadeh et al 2019a multi criteria decision analysis mcda functions are commonly employed to develop indices and ranking alternatives starting from geographical indicators it is hence widely used in gis based models however a limiting factor of the approach is its high dependence on experts knowledge which increases the uncertainty while assessing the results chowdary et al 2013 khosravi et al 2019 reviewed and compared different mcdm methods e g topsis ahp anp saw used for mapping flood susceptibility respect to other data driven methods i e ml they present some weakness firstly they are data highly intensive in recording decision makers preferences secondly the weighting system for the variables requires strong assumptions from decision makers which could make them subjective velasquez and hester 2013 khosravi et al 2019 these are critical aspects to consider when selecting suitable methods for flood susceptibility modeling these intrinsic limitations of the traditional flood models have inspired the research community to explore and test new methodologies that leverage these challenges among these the ml models in the last years the use of machine learning ml methods to predict natural hazard risk has increased exponentially ml models are increasingly used as modeling tool because of their high performance and predictive capability ahmadlou et al 2019 ml embraces multiple disciplines such as informatic statistics environmental science mathematics permitting very diverse sources of data to be integrated to solve complex environmental problems nevertheless its increasing popularity stem from the fact that it does not need complex mathematical expression to describe and predict physical processes mosavi et al 2018 shahabi et al 2021 ml has been involved in the analysis of different natural hazards typologies including floods chen et al 2020 dodangeh et al 2020 mahato et al 2021 nandi et al 2016 landslides costanzo et al 2014 pradhan 2013 tien bui et al 2012 bui et al 2016 and wildfires dutta et al 2016 fiorucci et al 2019 ghorbanzadeh et al 2019b jaafari et al 2019 wagenaar et al 2020 claim that ml could have the potential to change the way flood assessment is performed thanks to the accuracy improvements and the reduction of calculating time and model development cost thanks to their high performances in processing big datasets with enough iteration detail and flexibility oxford sustainable finance programme 2018 ml is able to frame simpler and less computational models respect to traditional flood models opening their applicability a large range of contexts specifically ml present relative short computational time respect to physically based models making them particularly suitable for real time flood mapping in early warning systems and for short term flood forecasting supporting emergency response and preparation phases bonafilia et al 2020 wagenaar et al 2020 in addition ml models permit to jointly compute different timescales in a hierarchical process by integrating forcings of different temporal resolutions and generating accurate and consistent predictions these models require far smaller computations than individual physical flood models per timescale gauch et al 2021 according to khosravi et al 2019 ml methods outperform the mcdm techniques because of their greater accuracy and higher prediction performance finally thanks for their flexibility in integrating heterogeneous source of data they can benefit from the integration in a real time setting of data from emerging technologies including satellite imagery aerial imagery crowdsourcing social media and mobile gps and call data records cdr lee et al 2012 according with zennaro et al 2021 considering also climate change impacts ml can substantially improve current risk assessment procedures permitting to capture the complex interactions and causal nexus occurring among the variables that may alter the equilibrium of exposed systems affected by natural and anthropogenic drivers especially in the assessment of flood events that require deep exploration of the complex and site dependent mechanisms in the frame of climate change risk assessment ml algorithms can be used to link together the components of the risk i e hazard vulnerability and exposure specifically in the hazard appraisal ml has been adopted for instance for short term flood and flash flood forecasts and for monitoring phenomena in the long term under different climate change scenarios chen et al 2019 kim et al 2015 while ml has supported the vulnerability component to predict human related vulnerabilities e g demographic and socio economic conditions and for climate related vulnerability buckland et al 2019 saha and pal 2019 the exposure component mainly concerns the detection and prediction of exposed targets in time under changing climatic and land use scenarios karan and samadder 2018 oliveira et al 2017 therefore ml supports risk assessment in several ways integrating heterogeneous data separated in time and space zennaro et al 2021 for what concern pluvial flood risk different types of ml statistical approaches have been adopted and include logistic regression ettinger et al 2016 frequency ratio tehrany et al 2015a rahmati et al 2016 and fuzzy logic pierdicca et al 2010 non linear ml algorithms used in flood susceptibility models include artificial neural network kia et al 2012 random forest wang et al 2015 chapi et al 2017 gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b decision tree tehrany et al 2015b pham et al 2021 tehrany et al 2014 khosravi et al 2018 choubin et al 2019 convolutional neural network ghorbanzadeh et al 2019a wang et al 2020 and support vector machine tehrany et al 2014 choubin et al 2019 gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b wang et al 2020 any ml model has advantages and disadvantages and the model s performance largely depends on the dataset and its structure gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b the prediction of pluvial flood events can be a regression or a classification problem depending on the purpose of the assessment and on the historical data available in the preparation phase predictive models are mainly used for hazard mapping and emergency planning and thus information about the spatial extent of flooded areas can be sufficient in such cases flood prediction is a classification problem where we predict the occurrence or not of a pluvial flood event in a specific space and time by contrast during the response and recovery phase maximum flood depth and velocity should be modeled thus requiring a regression analysis in classification tasks each point in the area under assessment is characterized by a specific and unique combination of attributes the so called triggering factors e g aspect curvature distance to rivers land use elevation etc which are processed in the ml models the study area is hence represented by a set of observations characterized by triggering factors information values for each specific location and time point during an extreme precipitation event water might not be quickly absorbed by the ground determining a lengthening of the event that can last more than one day this fact may lead to temporal correlation between observations at the same location furthermore observations are also spatially correlated as areas close to each other tend to have the same characteristics and so similar probabilities of being affected by pluvial flood events meyer et al 2018 for this reason standard ml procedures that randomly split the dataset in train and test set could be not suitable for spatio temporal analysis and classification of pluvial flood risk as they violate the assumption of independence between train and test data hastie et al 2009 leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error drawing on such considerations the overall aim of the analysis presented here is to develop and test a ml based methodology for rapid pluvial flood risk prediction in the metropolitan city of venice northern italy considering both spatial and temporal constraints the novelty of the presented methodology is the development of a classification model that reduces the overfitting by introducing a features selection process and by involving spatio temporal cross validation ke et al 2020 developed a ml approach to predict the occurrence of pluvial flood in urban areas they defined a model able to determine the rainfall flooding thresholds providing a binary result of flooding or not flooding occurrence despite the proposed model is built on the 10 fold cross validation technique according to temporal rainfall accumulation they did not estimate the spatial component hence the correlation of the spatial distribution of inundation and inundation depth with the temporal occurrence of the events similarly guo et al 2022 developed a flood prediction model capable of generalizing different catchment areas and to generate flood predictions the data driven model is built on one rainfall event and considers maximum water depth and flow velocity as key factors while neglecting the temporal variable the convolutional neural network model was used for spatializing flood prediction also under different scenarios however a drawback of the model is that they performed a holdout validation instead of a k fold cross validation since it would have smoothed out the results and avoided misleading results which was compensated with a large dataset furthermore the model was oversimplified by focusing only on one main contributing factor i e the elevation and neglecting others as land cover and spatial distribution of precipitation intensity the model performed a good prediction accuracy and was able to generalize on different catchment areas and topographies despite being limited to few affecting features overall multiple studies have developed models able to detect the spatial component with accuracy even though a spatio temporal cross validation technique would be more reliable in reproducing and predicting unknown flood events drawing on such considerations the methodology propose demonstrates how spatio temporal cross validation should be used to improve the accuracy of pluvial flood mapping both across space and time a necessary improvement especially to support flood prediction over future scenarios and under a changing climate in which the spatial patterns intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events could be extremely different from current ones a further novelty is the selection of features i e triggering factors that might affect the occurrence of pluvial flood in the cross validation process and the consequent discard of those features that are not directly linked to flooding events the final output is represented by a suite of risk maps of the flood prone areas in the metropolitan city of venice indeed in the past the metropolitan city of venice has been hit by recurrent extreme pluvial flood events and given the future climate scenarios and the urbanization rate worsening conditions and extreme events are expected requiring therefore an assessment of pluvial flood risks and the mapping of the most vulnerable areas to identify suitable measures to include in the definition of the emergency and adaptation plan currently under development after a brief introduction of the case study area the historical pluvial flood extreme events and the available input data section 2 the paper describes the cross validation approaches and ml models applied to the case study area to create the pluvial flood risk mapping section 3 and finally discusses the prediction error with different models and the risk mapping for 60 historical extreme events in the metropolitan city of venice section 4 2 case study area 2 1 the metropolitan city of venice the metropolitan city of venice cmv is located in veneto region in the north east coast of the adriatic sea it is placed in the venetian plane consists of 44 municipalities and has an overall extension of 2467 km2 with a population of 848 829 inhabitants istat 2020 fig 1 b figure a supplementary material mainly concentrated in the west side of the urban area adjacent to the city of venice multiple economic activities take place in the study area ranging from industry i e mestre and marghera district tourism seaport activities shipping and fishing along the coastal area dipartimento per gli affari regionali e le autonomie 2017 the cmv is a highly urbanized area whose development was driven by the economic growth after world war ii and the expansion of the petrochemical plant of porto marghera the rapid urbanization rate led in the past to a growing demand of residential spaces and infrastructures determining radical changes of entire areas of the city and causing the rapid conversion of green areas into urban zones the extended development determined structural hydraulic criticalities venice province 2011 that in recent years the administrators tried to overcome also through environmental restoration actions such as the creation of green public areas e g bissuola park mestre wood san giuliano park however despite the implementation of such measures there are still many criticalities due to the inappropriateness of the sewer and drainage systems which became evident in the last decade when different portions of the urban area have been flooded in concomitance with severe rainfall events the increasing frequency and intensity in extreme rainfall events expected for the mediterranean region blöschl et al 2019 exposes the study area to a potential increase of pluvial flood risk specifically climate projections foreseen for the long term a reduction of precipitation for the summer period and an increase during the winter months in northern italy spano et al 2020 according to the national adaptation plan to climate change pnacc 2018 extreme precipitation events are expected to occur for more than 100 days during the winter season as well as more than 20 days per year of precipitation above the 95th percentile in the area of concern beside the climatic drivers the social and structural components e g the urbanization degree the rate of population growth in urban areas the appropriateness of the drainage and sewer systems as well as the environmental geological and hydrological features of the territory will directly contribute to increase the vulnerability of the territory to pluvial floods events influencing the soil absorption rate and the water runoff huong and pathirana 2013 spano et al 2020 2 2 data collection and preprocessing ml models are data driven tools that offer an automated means of recognizing patterns in high dimensional data cracknell and reading 2014 ml models link a set of independent variables to the response variable and use only the independent variables for making predictions in predicting pluvial flood events ml models learn from variables called triggering factors to predict a response variable at a different time and location within a defined model domain meyer et al 2018 in the pluvial flood risk model developed for the mcv the response variable is represented by flooded areas while the triggering factors are represented by territory s features that might positively or negatively affect the flooding occurrence the triggering factors have a direct impact on the accuracy of the models in predicting pluvial flood areas therefore the collected data e g triggering factors and the pluvial flood areas constitute the dataset used to build up the model 2 2 1 historical events inventory the historical events inventory reports the locations of the pluvial flood areas and provides detailed information about the characteristics of historical flood events zazo et al 2018 a dataset of historical events recorded between 1995 and 2020 was provided by the metropolitan city of venice https webgis2 cittametropolitana ve it with detailed information regarding the date localization the municipalities affected the extension of flooded areas and the cause i e heavy rain coastal or riverine flood for each event the dataset has been built collecting the reports made by citizens hit by the flooding event to the firefighters fig 1a shows the number of historical events that occurred each year from 1995 to 2020 fig 1b represents the spatial distribution of flooded areas according to their frequency in the mcv the number of pluvial flood events has consistently increased in the last decade and a net peak has been registered in 2014 and 2019 most of the historical events reported in the case study area are close to the cities of portogruaro and bibione in the north and close to camponogara and mestre in the south center of the mcv to build up the ml model a sampling of 40 historical events were selected among the most relevant pluvial flood events i e when at least ten pluvial flood areas have been reported to the authorities in order to be sure to include only pluvial flood events only flood events associated with heavy rainfall have been selected from the historical dataset while riverine coastal or compounded flood have been excluded moreover other 20 non flood historical events in the time period 1995 2020 were randomly selected and added to the dataset to get a more exhaustive overview of the relationship among flooded areas non flooded areas and triggering factors 2 2 2 flood triggering factors based on literature e g arabameri et al 2019 wang et al 2020 shahabi et al 2021 and available data 12 triggering factors were initially selected as relevant for the assessment of pluvial flood risk in the mcv table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the triggering factors including their spatial and temporal resolution the number and the type of features derived from each variable and the data source used for their characterization in fact the variables can be classified in numerical if the values are numbers or in categorical if the values present or not a specific class of the variable itself aspect is the direction or orientation of the maximum slope of the surface different directions may face different effects in terms of precipitation and solar radiation thus affecting hydrological conditions bathrellos et al 2018 wang et al 2020 four categories of aspect have been considered according to different angle ranges north 45 135 west 135 225 south 225 315 and east 315 45 curvature is the degree of distortion of the slope surface computed from the digital terrain model dtm and reflects the morphology of a given area mojaddadi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 curvature has been differentiated into three categories flat concave or convex elevation has an inverse relationship with flooding fernandez and lutz 2010 shahabi et al 2021 lower elevations may lead to higher probability of pluvial flood bui et al 2019 elevation was treated as a numerical feature slope represents the inclination of the surface and has a direct effect on flooding because it affects surface runoff its velocity and water infiltration rates costache et al 2020 accordingly the lower the slope the higher the rate of infiltration and the lower the flow velocity slope was computed from the digital terrain model dtm and was differentiated into two categories presence or absence of slope soil is the classification of specific areas based on their morphology granulometry of sediments and age of surfaces carta dei suoli del veneto 2019 different soils imply different permeability and thus different flood potentials soil features have been collected from arpav database and were differentiated into four categories low ancient plain ba recent low plain br coastal plain cl and urban areas urb texture is a soil infiltration property classified by the percentage composition of its solid particles distinguished in granulometric categories and it is important in determining the total amount of surface run off during rainfall events kaspersen et al 2017 texture indicates the soil material at 50 cm under the surface and it was differentiated in 10 categories clayey clayey frank clayey sandy frank clayey silty clayey silty frank frank organic materials sandy sandy frank sandy loam and silty frank permeability measures the capacity of a surface to absorb or reject water thus it is an indicator of water infiltration permeability has been differentiated in 5 categories reporting the permeability range values expressed in millimeters per hour mm h very low 0 036 0 36 mm h low 0 36 3 6 mm h medium 3 6 36 mm h high 36 360 mm h very high 360 mm h land use can affect water absorption and thus runoff santos and reis 2018 land use data have been extracted from the corine land cover dataset for five years 1990 2000 2006 2012 and 2018 the 44 land types were aggregated into five main categories agriculture areas green areas industrial areas urban areas and water areas normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to study the vegetation density of the land surface rouse et al 1974 changes in ndvi indicate modifications in vegetation ahmed and akter 2017 it can be an important triggering factor as higher vegetation densities are assumed to have lower probabilities of flooding within the study area chapi et al 2017 ndvi data were extracted from three satellite sentinel2 images i e tiles t32tqq t32tqr and t33tul taken on may 5 2015 and downloaded from earthexplorer website ndvi is calculated as ndvi b 08 b 04 b 08 b 04 where b08 is the near infrared band and b04 is the red band ndvi can vary between 1 low vegetation density and 1 high vegetation density precipitation is the main triggering factor contributing to pluvial flood risk precipitation data were provided by the regional agency for environmental prevention and protection of veneto arpav and the cumulative daily precipitation and hourly maximum intensity was extracted for each of the 60 historical events since the meteorological stations do not cover all the study area the spatial distribution was computed by interpolating the 188 stations placed across veneto region using linear ordinary kriging method li et al 2011 yang 2015 precipitation data were treated as numerical features distance to road is an important feature to consider as the proximity to artificial infrastructure can impose a negative impact on pluvial flood vulnerability indeed roads can represent a proxy of highly impervious areas leading to higher probability of pluvial flood gaitan et al 2016 distance to road has been differentiated in three categories 0 m 250 m 250 m 500 m greater than500 m and it was also treated as a numerical feature distance to river indicates the euclidean distance in meters from river networks areas close to rivers are generally considered more susceptible to flooding compared to more distant areas chapi et al 2017 as rivers represent main pathways for flood discharge and expansion distance to the river has been differentiated in three categories 0 m 250 m 250 m 500 m greater than500 m and it was also treated as a numerical feature distance to sea was assessed because the case study includes areas close to the coast the distance to sea has been differentiated in three categories 0 m 250 m 250 m 500 m greater than500 m and it was also treated as a numerical feature each variable described above has a different unit of measure these differences between features require rescaling the values in order to ensure that all inputs are equally comparable when developing the ml models hastie et al 2009 therefore all categorical features were treated as binary features with a value of 1 if the category is present in that observation or 0 otherwise while the numerical features were scaled between 0 and 1 except for ndvi that is included between 1 and 1 the spatial distribution of the triggering factors in the case study domain is represented in figure b supplementary material 3 methods 3 1 machine learning models the pluvial flood risk assessment methodology proposed here allows a first assessment of the areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood in the metropolitan city of venice given specific precipitation events and the characteristics of the territory pluvial flood prediction in our case study is a classification task which aims to predict if an area is likely to be flooded or not and to explore the relationship existing between the features included in the dataset and the response variable that does not include the pluvial flood depth since historical events of pluvial flood areas are available supervised ml models can be used to learn the relationship between pluvial flood areas i e the response variable and the triggering factors i e the features to identify the most relevant patterns in the data in this paper three different ml models were considered and compared namely logistic regression neural networks and random forest 3 1 1 logistic regression logistic regression lr is a widely used model for classification i e when the response variable is dichotomous azzalini and scarpa 2012 lr is expressed as a linear combination η x of the selected features 1 η x β 1 x 1 β p x p x t β where xi i 1 p are the p features and βi i 1 p are the p weights from η x it is possible to calculate the probability π of pluvial flood occurrence as 2 π e η x 1 e η x where 0 π 1 3 1 2 neural networks a neural network nn is a complex ml model that approximates almost any nonlinear function azzalini and scarpa 2012 its basic architecture is made up of three layers i an input layer that includes the features ii one hidden layer that links the input layer with the output layer using nonlinear functions and optimized weights iii an output layer that includes the response variable a nn model is particularly used for its flexibility and good performances however it does not allow to identify the most important features that affect the model leading to a weak interpretation of the results 3 1 3 random forest random forest rf is an ensemble classification model that averages the predictions of a number k of classification trees breiman 2001 rf combines different models to decrease the unstable results arising from a single classification tree prediction which might be affected by a specific subset of data selected for the training set hastie et al 2009 indeed each classification tree is fit using a random subset of features and observations which make the final ensemble model more reliable 3 2 ml based methodology for pluvial flood risk mapping as in the assessment of pluvial flood risk the triggering factors and the response variable vary both in time and in space a specific methodology considering spatio temporal constraints needs to be developed the flowchart in fig 2 is meant to guide the reader through the methodology applied to identify pluvial flood risk areas the aim of the proposed approach is to develop a ml model that is reliable to predict pluvial flood occurrence in different locations and time periods for this reason the triggering factors and the historical events introduced in section 2 were collected for the case study to create the dataset used to fit the ml models the dataset in ml approaches is usually split in two folds training and test set the training set is used to fit the parameters of the model while the test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the prediction errors of the model fit on the training set however a frequent problem in ml models is overfitting i e when the model has a high performance in predicting training data but it fails to predict new data that the model has never seen before hastie et al 2009 a way to reduce overfitting is to split the training set in two parts the training and the validation set the validation set is typically used to estimate the prediction error on independent data and to optimize the hyperparameters of the ml models the hyperparameters of a ml model define its structure and are used to control the learning process of the model this process is called hyperparameters tuning that is the research of the ideal model architecture lecun et al 2015 in this specific case study the validation set is used for hyperparameters tuning but also to select the most important features to consider to improve the pluvial flood area prediction a limitation of splitting the dataset in training validation and test set might occur when working with spatial data because the assumption of independence between these three folds is not respected in a geographical domain roberts et al 2017 furthermore when the dataset is scarce cross validation is applied to measure the model s accuracy to predict new data in more than one configuration of training validation and test set in this study since the data of flooded and non flooded areas in the cmv were limited cross validation was applied to provide a better appraisal of the prediction error cross validation can be distinguished in outer and inner cross validation outer cross validation allows different configuration of test set while inner cross validation allows different configuration of training and validation set moreover the inner cross validation methods in this case study are distinguished in random cross validation r cv and spatio temporal cross validation llto cv to compare the first approach widely used in literature with a different approach that takes into consideration both space and time to evaluate the performances of the model as described in fig 2 triggering factors and historical events data were preprocessed to construct the dataset which has been split in training and test set then two different inner cross validation approaches r cv and llto cv were used to additionally split the training set into training and validation set three different machine learning models were thus applied using both cross validation techniques in order to select the best features and hyperparameters based on the area under the curve auc score in the validation set auc is a measure of accuracy commonly used to evaluate machine learning models in binary classification problems and it ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates the maximum accuracy score in addition an outer cross validation was applied leading to the reiteration of the whole process until all the observations in the dataset have been part of the test set exactly once finally the best model was selected and used to predict pluvial flood events based on the best auc score in the validation set 3 2 1 dataset folds ml models were compared based on their accuracy to spatial temporally predict a new pluvial flood event hence the dataset was split in t s folds where t is the number of time periods in which the historical events are grouped and s is the number of spatial areas in which the case study areas are split time intervals and spatial areas were chosen to guarantee an almost equal distribution of pluvial flood areas in each fold indeed the time periods were calculated using the quantile distribution of the flooded observation dates in particular the limits of the time period classes are the 0 t 1 t t t quantile of the historical events with pluvial flood areas reported where the 0 t quantile is the first event and the t t quantile is the last one regarding the spatial areas pluvial flood areas were labeled according to the location i e the city where the flood occurred while the latitude of the city center was used as criteria to split the areas in s groups in particular the quantile distribution of the latitude of cities in which the pluvial flood occurred was used to split the data in s spatial areas and the limits of the spatial classes were the 0 s 1 s s s quantile of the cities latitude where the 0 s quantile is the highest latitude and s s quantile is the lowest one once the folds were defined the dataset was split into training and test sets 3 2 2 cross validation to get a reliable estimation of the model performance that is not biased by a specific configuration of training and test set we applied a nested cross validation nested cross validation is an approach for hyperparameter optimization features selection and model selection that attempts to overcome the problem of overfitting the training set hence cross validation is applied in order to select the most important variables to optimize the hyperparameters of the models and to select the most appropriate model nested cross validation includes two typologies of cross validation the outer cross validation used to estimate the prediction error in different configurations of the training and test set and the inner cross validation used for hyperparameters tuning and to select the most important features based on the model performance in different configuration of training and validation set 3 2 2 1 outer leave location and time out cross validation outer cross validation allows to take advantage of all the available data to measure the accuracy of the models in different test sets as the three ml models are compared by their ability to predict a new spatio temporal event outer leave location and time out cross validation was considered at each step one fold kt s between the t s folds is selected to be part of the test set t 1 s 1 folds that have in common the time period or the spatial area with the test set were excluded from the analysis while the t 1 s 1 independent folds are selected to be part of the training set until all folds have been exactly once part of the test set then the training set used to fit the model was split into a training and validation set to apply forward features selection and hyperparameters tuning fig 3 a shows the outer cross validation procedure in the case of t 4 and s 4 at each step one of the 16 folds was used as test set while 9 independent folds were part of the training set the same number of folds were used in the case study which means that at each step roughly 56 25 of the data were used as training set and 6 25 as test set for outer cross validation while the remaining 37 5 of the data were excluded 3 2 2 2 inner cross validation the inner cross validation is applied to select the most relevant features and to optimize the hyperparameters based on the performances of the model in different configurations of training and validation set in this paper inner cross validation is differentiated in inner random cross validation and inner leave location and time out cross validation we applied both methodologies to understand which one better performs in forecasting new flooded areas in consequence of extreme events in the inner random cross validation r cv approach the training set is randomly split in kr roughly equal size folds at each step one of the kr folds was used as validation set and the remaining kr 1 folds were used to fit the model until all the folds have been part of the validation set exactly once a limitation of r cv is the assumption of independence between training and validation observations that if it is not satisfied leads to optimistic accuracy in the validation set where the model selection will favor the most complex models roberts et al 2017 in pluvial flood problems the assumption of independence could not be satisfied since observations are correlated both in time and space hence they cannot be split in training and validation set randomly this approach determines that r cv could overestimate the predictions accuracy in the validation set as it is correlated with the training set but it may lead to bad predictions in an independent test set from a different spatio temporal domain that the model has never seen before fig 3b shows the inner random cross validation procedure in the case of t 4 and s 4 where the test set is set to be the k1 1 the 9 folds in the training set independent from the test set are merged and split in 4 random folds when cross validation is applied at each step one of the random folds is chosen as validation set and the remaining 3 folds are used as training set to fit the model until all the folds have been part of the validation set exactly once inner leave location and time out cross validation llto cv is an approach that faces the spatio temporal problems considering both time and space in the creation of the folds for the training and validation set indeed the training set initially includes t 1 s 1 folds independent from the test set and when cross validation is applied at each step a fold kt s folds is chosen to be part of the validation set t 2 s 2 folds that have in common the time period or the spatial area with the validation set were excluded from the analysis and the remaining t 2 s 2 folds are used to fit the ml model the procedure is repeated until all the folds have been part of the validation set exactly once fig 3c shows a llto cv example for t 4 s 4 and where k1 1 fold is chosen as test set at each step one of the 9 folds of the training set is chosen as a validation set 4 folds are discarded and 4 independent folds are used to fit the model the same number of folds were used in the case study which means that at each step roughly 44 44 of the data were used as training set and 11 11 as test set for inner cross validation while the remaining 44 45 of the data were excluded 3 3 forward features selection and hyperparameters tuning usually cross validation is used to estimate the model performances in predicting different validation sets but also to research the best architecture of the model the research of the architecture that maximizes the accuracy of the model in the validation set is called hyperparameters tuning as one or more parameters of the model are optimized to find the best configuration in this paper we add to the hyperparameters tuning the research of the best features that improves the accuracy of the model in predicting pluvial flood areas in this procedure called forward features selection at each step the best feature is added to the model until no more features are useful to improve predictions 3 3 1 forward features selection most of the features collected in the dataset describe the properties of a location e g curvature elevation slope etc these features vary in space but not in time which means that each pixel has a unique combination of static features and it has unique properties comparable with quasi unique ids of the pixels meyer et al 2018 features that lead to overfitting can be automatically identified and removed using a forward feature selection method to exclude the misleading ones from the models meyer et al 2018 the forward features selection method at each step includes in the model the feature that mostly improves the accuracy of the model in classification tasks or mostly reduces the prediction error in regression tasks until no improvements are shown when adding a new feature in this case study at each step the feature that mostly improves the auc a recommended metric used instead of the overall accuracy to compare different ml algorithms in classification problems bradley and andrew 1997 was introduced the forward features selection process ends when no more features can add enough value to the model to improve the auc score at least by 0 01 with respect to the previous step this methodology strongly reduces the number of features by selecting the most representative ones resulting in simpler and more understandable models 3 3 2 hyperparameters tuning hyperparameters setting is a fundamental step in building machine learning models lecun et al 2015 some ml models need to optimize specific hyperparameters to find the best architecture that maximizes the auc score through inner cross validation as the forward features selection methodology leads to a sensible increase of the computational time to fit the models hyperparameters are fixed before the features selection process and the tuning is computed only at the end of the process even though the procedure does not guarantee to obtain the best hyperparameters configuration indeed for each of the ml models initial hyperparameters are manually set in particular logistic regression is set with a regularization hyperparameter equal to 1 random forest nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure and neural networks are set with one hidden layer and 2 nodes at the end of the forward features selection process hyperparameters tuning is computed to research the best configuration of each model considering a regularization hyperparameter c 0 01 0 1 1 10 or 100 for logistic regression one hidden layer with a number between 2 and 9 nodes for neural networks a maximum depth between 2 and 20 nodes for random forest the hyperparameters that are not considered in the hyperparameters tuning process are set to be equal to their standard value defined by the package sklearn in python 3 4 model selection the three ml models introduced in section 3 1 were fitted with two different cross validation approaches and following the flowchart in fig 3 were compared for the accuracy assessment through the auc score the auc is a measure of accuracy of the predictions compared to the real values and it is computed using the validation set as all the observations of the training set become part of the validation set exactly once the auc can evaluate the model accuracy including all the observations available in the training set hence at the end of the inner cross validation the best features and hyperparameters are chosen based on the auc score but if the model selection is based only on one auc score the selected model is biased by a specific configuration of the training set and test set for this reason outer cross validation returns t s different configurations of the training and test set that permit the computation of t s auc score then the model with the highest auc score averaged between the t s folds is selected to perform pluvial flood risk mapping 3 5 pluvial flood risk mapping the ml model selected in the previous step was finally tested to check its ability in estimating the occurrence of pluvial flood in selected historical events and thus to create a pluvial flood risk map each map represents the probability that a pluvial flood occurs in a specific pixel of the study area the final aim was to investigate if the model is able to properly reproduce the events occurred in the case study and thus if it is suitable to be used for future predictions 4 results 4 1 dataset and cross validation the dataset was created from 60 historical events that includes 47 219 280 observations i e pixels that represent the case study area in different days the number of pluvial flood areas is much lower than the non flooded areas as only 0 49 of the observations represent pluvial flood areas 231 420 pixels in this case the dataset is unbalanced so in order to reduce the number of non flooded areas a random subset of 10 000 non flooded observations for each of the 60 dates in addition to all the flooded observations was selected accordingly the final dataset includes 831 420 observations 600 000 non flooded pixels and 231 420 flooded pixels and 47 attributes 46 features and the response variable the dataset was split in four time periods t and in four spatial locations s for a total of 16 folds s t the t folds were created by dividing the events with flooded observations in quartiles and grouped as follows 1995 01 01 2007 09 30 it includes 28 of the flooded pixels 2007 09 30 2014 01 31 it includes 21 of the flooded pixels 2014 01 31 2016 02 29 it includes 23 of the flooded pixels 2016 02 29 2020 12 31 it includes 28 of the flooded pixels for the spatial distribution the s groups were created according to the latitude of the city s center the spatial folds are the following s1 it includes 27 of the flooded pixels s2 it includes 24 of the flooded pixels s3 it includes 28 of the flooded pixels s4 it includes 21 of the flooded pixels in summary there are t 4 time periods folds and s 4 spatial folds resulting in t s 16 spatio temporal folds figure c and table a supplementary material following the methodology described in section 3 2 one of the 16 folds was chosen as the test set 6 folds were excluded as they have time or space in common with the test set and the remaining 9 folds were part of the training set the outer cross validation allowed the models to fit on 16 different configurations of training and test set as at each step a different fold was part of the test set then when inner random cross validation was applied the 9 folds of the training set were merged together the observations were shuffled and 4 roughly equal flooded pixels size folds were created on the other side when inner spatio temporal cross validation was applied at each step one of the 9 folds was used as validation set while the remaining t 2 s 2 4 folds that did not have location and time period in common with the test and validation set were used as training set 4 2 forward features selection and hyperparameters tuning 4 2 1 forward features selection when applying the forward features selection method the features selected can vary according to the machine learning model and the observations in the training set thereby as 16 folds exist also 16 configurations of training and test set are possible so that each feature can be selected from 0 to 16 times indicating a proxy of its importance to predict pluvial flood fig 4 shows the most selected features in the two cross validation approaches for each of the three ml models previously introduced on the left the boxplots represent the number of candidate features in each step of 16 feature selection processes for each model and approach on the right the dot plots show the features importance based on the number of times they were selected in 16 features selection processes in the logistic regression model the forward features selection process selected daily cumulative precipitation for 16 times making it a key feature for pluvial flood predictions another feature considered important by the lr model was the distance to the river selected 12 times in the llto cv and 13 times in the r cv the remaining features were selected less than 50 times both with the llto cv and r cv approaches hence were considered negligible for the model for predicting pluvial flood on the other hand the neural network model selected only the daily cumulative precipitation as a key feature while the remaining ones received low importance scores among the remaining candidates only the hourly maximum precipitation was selected more than 2 times finally in the random forest model with r cv approach daily cumulative precipitation hourly maximum precipitation distance to sea and elevation were selected as relevant features interestingly neither distance to sea nor elevation resulted relevant in the llto cv approach so it is possible that these features perform better in a random cross validation approach while they fail to predict new spatio temporal conditions hence in the llto cv approach the random forest model considers the daily cumulative precipitation 10 times distance to river 6 times hourly maximum precipitation 6 times and a sandy texture 5 times as significant characteristics in estimating pluvial flood overall the three ml models selected as key features almost the same variables i e daily cumulative precipitation precipitation intensity and distance to river simplifying the models structure and resulting in only three variables useful to predict pluvial flood and affecting the occurrence of flooding events other relevant considerations can be drawn from fig 4 at step 0 all the 46 features are suitable to be added to the model in the next steps the most important feature is selected the features that decrease auc are removed while the remaining features are candidates for the next selection step it can be noticed that llto cv procedure for all the three models has an earlier drop out of the useless features compared to the r cv approach r cv approach tends to build more complex models keeping more features as candidates in the procedure until it reaches an excellent auc score however this process leads to overfitting 4 2 2 hyperparameters tuning hyperparameters tuning output shows clear differences between the two approaches of cross validation for logistic regression the median regularization coefficient is 0 1 for llto cv and 1 for r cv i e a stronger regularization of the coefficient is applied in the llto cv approach while for neural networks the median number of nodes of the hidden layer is 6 5 for llto cv and 9 for r cv this confirms that r cv tends to build a more complex neural networks architecture using the maximum number of nodes in the available domain imposed on this hyperparameter finally for random forest the median maximum depth of the tree is 4 for llto cv and 20 for r cv the llto approach prunes the classification trees to an earlier stage resulting in a simpler model with regards to r cv it is worth notice that in the r cv approach each classification tree is pruned at a depth of 20 which is the maximum value available in the domain imposed to this hyperparameter 4 3 model selection table 2 reports the auc score obtained for the training validation and test set for the two configurations i e r cv and llto cv of the three ml models differences in the performance of the inner cross validation approaches can be observed when assessing validation and test set in the validation set inner r cv outperforms inner llto cv for each of the three models but in the test set we get the opposite performance indeed in the test set inner llto cv approach performs better than inner r cv for each of the three ml models with an auc score of 0 860 and 0 855 in the lr model 0 843 and 0 837 in the nn model and 0 846 and 0 722 in the rf model these results show the limitation of r cv in performing spatio temporal analysis as it gets excellent performances on the validation set but it fails to predict with accuracy the observations in the test set the selection of the most suitable model to predict pluvial flood risk in the mcv was based on the auc score in the validation set using the llto cv approach as it is clear that it better approximates the auc score of the observations in the test set hence the lr model resulted in the best model having the highest auc score in the validation set and accordingly it was selected as the reference model for pluvial flood risk mapping the logistic regression model was finally implemented for the last features selection by applying an llto cross validation approach to the whole dataset the final auc score is 0 864 which means that the model is good at distinguishing between the flood and non flooded areas across all possible classification thresholds the best regularization coefficient is 0 05 and among the 13 triggering factors the features selected by the model are the daily cumulative precipitation the distance to river and the distance to roads over 500 m these three features were tested to detect a possible multicollinearity between them but the variance inflaction factor vif calculated did not find any correlation all vif scores lower than 1 07 this model does not consider the remaining 10 triggering factors as relevant to predict pluvial flood events the final logistic regression model used has the following linear combination η x η x 0 048 precipitation daily mm 0 001 distance to river numerical m 0 560 distance to road 500 m regarding the feature s importance the main factor that contributes to the model performances is daily precipitation auc 0 859 while distance to river and distance to road add just 0 005 to the final auc score previous similar ml analysis identified rainfall as the most prominent factor involved in pluvial flooding samanta et al 2018 meliho 2022 for instance samanta et al 2018 concluded that rainfall together with twi was the most important flood conditioning factors in a study that used the frequency ratio technique in the subarnarekha river basin india meliho et al 2022 applied rf extreme gradient boost xgb ann and knn to predict vulnerability to flooding in the ourika watershed in the high atlas of morocco a process of forward feature selection was performed to select variables to be included in each model drainage density rainfall and distance resulted the prominent predisposing factors in the ourika watershed for most of the considered models at the same time distance to river is considered to be one of the most important conditioning factors in most of previous flood susceptibility assessments youssef et al 2016 ahmadlou et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019b pham et al 2020 used credal decision tree cdt as a base classifier along with four ensemble models for flood modeling in markazi province iran they results concluded that distance to river was the most important factor for flood incidence in their study area distance to road has been previously considered only in few studies gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b however janizadeh et al 2021 mapped the spatial and temporal variability of flood hazard affected by climate and land use changes in the future using several machine learning techniques and their ensembles in iran according to their analysis distance to road resulted one the most import important feature to predict future flood risk based on the ensemble model 4 4 pluvial flood risk mapping the last step of the analysis consists in creating pluvial flood risk maps for each of the 60 major historical events that occurred in the case study area the final aim was to investigate if the model is able to properly reproduce events that occurred in the case study and thus if it is suitable to be used for further predictions i e future risk scenarios therefore the selected lr model calculated for each pixel of the study area the probability of occurrence of pluvial flood considering the three previously selected features i e daily cumulative precipitation distance to river and distance to road over 500 m for a better communication of the results pixels have been aggregated in six classes of pluvial flood risk very low 0 20 low 20 40 medium 40 60 high 60 80 very high 80 95 and very very high 95 100 also the historical events were aggregated in five classes of percentage of pluvial flood areas very small 0 1 small 1 2 medium 2 3 high 3 4 very high 4 5 fig 5 shows the percentage distribution of the pluvial flood risk predicted by the model for the 60 events as well as the percentage of flooded areas in gray chrome the model presents high accuracy and most of the events have been properly predicted while only few mismatches between the real date of the event and the reported flooding resulted indeed according to the results reported in fig 5 the event that occurred on september 26th 2007 reported the highest percentage of flooded areas 4 24 and it is classified from the ml model as the 4th biggest event in terms of number of pixels in the very high risk class a good match between the model and the historical event was registered also on the 16th september 2009 whose assessment of the risk corresponded to the historical data on the other hand some events present a mismatch between the model s prediction and the historical data for example on september 14th 2006 the model predicted a low risk of pluvial flood occurrence for the whole study area while the historical data recorded 89 pluvial flood areas for that day in this example it is realistic to suppose that the historical data do not correspond to the exact date for the pluvial flood event that it may be plausible to represent one of the following days indeed the daily average precipitation for september 14th was only 3 3 mm while the following days it was 50 5 mm on september 15th 23 6 mm on september 16th and 51 5 mm on september 17th also represented in fig 5 similarly on november 12th 2014 a gap between the high risk of flooding assessed by the model and the low number of pluvial flood areas registered only 26 was observed also in this case the mismatch could be explained by an error in reporting the flooded areas since they have been registered on the day before november 11th 2014 where there was a low probability of flooding and low precipitation a further evaluation can be done considering fig 6 that shows the spatial distribution of the model s predictions and the 6 historical events with the largest pluvial flood areas reported also spatially the model proved to have a high accuracy the model can identify the most vulnerable areas showing a good match between the spatial localization of the predicted areas and the historical events from fig 6 it may appear that the model s predictions overestimate the risk of pluvial flood as the number of pixels with an associated high probability of pluvial flood occurrence are always greater than the historical flooded areas predicting the areas in which a pluvial flood will occur with high precision is a hard task but by primarily considering the areas classified to be at very high risk of pluvial flood might help to prioritize the areas more exposed to these events for example on september 26th 2007 fig 6 all the historical flooded areas fall within the highest risk class assessed by the model with a class probability of 95 100 of pluvial flood occurrence this example shows the importance and usefulness of identifying the areas more exposed according to the estimated risk overall according to the results both figs 5 and 6 the model tends to overestimate the risk of pluvial flood even though the largest and affecting events were properly recognized by the model this suggests that the model is accurate and might be applied also for risk scenarios analysis at the present state of the authors knowledge no other studies applying ml tools for pluvial flood mapping are available in the case study however pluvial flood risk and vulnerability maps developed using multi criteria decision analysis and gis based indicators has been provided in maragno et al 2020 and sperotto et al 2016 for both the entire metropolitan city of venice and with a special focus on the venice municipality specifically maragno et al 2020 provided pluvial flood risk scenarios based on different rainfall volumes i e 50 and 150 mm of rain to analyze how different types of land use affect vulnerability to flooding sperotto et al 2016 instead provided a spatial analysis of areas that are more likely to be at risk of flooding in the future considering projected precipitation for 2041 2050 period and specific territory features i e slope soil permeability occurrence of critical hydraulic conditions in the past despite results from these studies cannot be considered fully comparable with the ml approach proposed here some similar conclusions can be drawn extremely vulnerable areas identified in maragno et al 2020 and sperotto et al 2016 under worse precipitation scenarios present a quite good spatial matching with the areas predicted by the ml model i e high very high and very very high probability of flood under the six worse historical events reported fig 6 these areas are represented mainly by industrial commercial and urban fabric located in the central i e mestre and venice urban centre and the industrial plan of porto marghera and in the north east part i e portogruaro san dona bibione of the metropolitan city of venice some small portions of agricultural areas at high risk are instead located along the coastline 5 conclusions the use of ml can substantially improve and speed up disaster risk assessment and mapping helping in overcoming most common bottlenecks of physically based simulations such as the computational complexity and time the need of large datasets of high resolution information however most of the standard ml procedures that randomly split the dataset in train and test are not suitable to account for the spatio temporal variation of pluvial flood as they risk to violate the assumption of independence between train and test leading to overoptimistic models the methodology presented in this paper represents a first attempt to build machine learning models able to incorporate the spatio temporal constraints typical of pluvial flood events and thus to improve rapid pluvial flood risk prediction and mapping capabilities accordingly two different types of cross validation approaches were applied to investigate the performances of three machine learning models built on historical pluvial flood data and a set of triggering factors representative of the territorial characteristic as the use of all the available triggering factors can lead to overfitting a forward features selection was also introduced to reduce the model s complexity logistic regression resulted in the most reliable model displaying lower overfitting and higher performances providing robust results both in the validation and test set while daily cumulative precipitation distance to rivers and distance to road were the most important features in contributing to pluvial flood risk estimation results also confirmed that the llto cv is a crucial step that needs to be considered in the selection of the most suitable ml model for spatio temporal modeling of pluvial flood risk and to avoid overfitting the developed model demonstrated to be able to properly reproduce both in spatial and temporal manner the most severe floods that occurred in the past in the case study despite some mismatches attributable to the low quality and incompleteness of the historical data collected however some limitations have to be acknowledged the analysis would have surely benefited from a higher spatial resolution of input data permitting ml models to better catch relationships between the features and the flooded areas furthermore the model was built on the inventory of historical flood events provided by the local fire brigades such dataset at the present state is the best information on past pluvial flood events for the metropolitan city of venice but however detailed only the extent of the flooded areas and source of such event while such variable can be considered enough for the purpose of the analysis i e rapid spatial flood mapping other important variables should be included i e flood depth flood velocity to extend the use of the model also for damage assessment and disaster preparation in this sense major efforts should be devoted in the collection of pluvial flood events records to build up the model the number of spatio temporal folds for cross validation was set up at 16 while a deeper analysis could find optimal numbers of folds that maximize the learning process of ml models more accurate methodologies to split the dataset in spatio temporal folds could also lead to avoid folds without any flooded areas samples as it occurred for some folds of this analysis future work is envisioned toward a comprehensive methodology that provides not only accurate flooding maps but also a deeper consideration of the interactions among the multiple factors occurring in the study area finally recognizing the role that other threats e g sea level rise storm surge urbanization can play in increasing pluvial flood risk future research efforts should be oriented towards a multi risk approach that considers the potential interaction of climate related hazards and land use change in the case study area overall the produced outputs represent a preliminary screening of potential risks posed by pluvial flood and for the identification of vulnerable areas to such impacts at local scale they can be used to mainstream the definition and implementation of the first phases of local climate change adaptation strategies and plans e g problem formulation identification of vulnerability and risk hotspots identification of adaptation priorities in this perspective they represent a climate and adaptation service useful to inform the implementation of the sendai framework for drr 2015 2030 unisdr 2015 as well as the multi hazard risk assessments compelled by the eu civil protection mechanism the present study must be considered a preparatory exercise for further analyses on pluvial flood risk under climate change conditions the proposed model has been validated demonstrating to be able to reproduce historical events paving the way for its application for predicting future pluvial flood events in the metropolitan city of venice indeed the outputs of regional climate models rcms as well as future land use scenarios could be integrated in the analyses to assess how future changes in precipitation patterns will affect the occurrence and frequency of pluvial flood events therefore the analyses will help to evaluate how urbanization rates influence flooding patterns and their extent becoming a useful tool for decision makers to identify adaptation measures to be incorporated in spatial planning and disaster risk reduction strategies in this sense further analyses could be focused on specific receptors of interest e g people buildings infrastructures agricultural fields cultural sites according to local actors perspectives and needs bonato et al 2021 this can be achieved by including the aforementioned receptors within the model which will predict not only the spatial distribution of flooded areas but will also assess the presence of receptors and the possible damages and losses arising in consequence of extreme events credit authorship contribution statement zanetti marco conceptualization methodology data curation software formal analysis writing

3061,due to a combination of climate change and urbanization the instances of pluvial flooding are expected to increase in the next decades posing raising threats to properties people and productive assets predicting and mapping pluvial flood prone areas is becoming a crucial step in flood mitigation and early warnings as well as climate change adaptation strategies to be incorporate in urban planning most commonly applied machine learning ml procedures for pluvial flood risk assessment neglect to account for spatio temporal constraints leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error in this paper we propose a novel ml based methodology for pluvial flood risk prediction in the metropolitan city of venice which introducing a features selection process and spatio temporal cross validation permits to reduce overfitting of the resulting ml models spatio temporal characteristics of floods are derived from a dataset of 60 historical events occurred in the area between 1995 and 2020 logistic regression lr neural networks nn and random forest rf models are applied to identify and prioritize sub areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk considering the daily precipitation amount and 12 different triggering factors the models were validated using random cross validation r cv and leave location and time out cross validation llto cv that split data in training and validation set considering both time and space in addition a forward features selection procedure was applied to identify the features among the triggering factors that better face spatio temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on the area under the curve auc score results suggest that logistic regression and llto cv represent the most reliable model to predict pluvial flood events in new spatio temporal conditions while among the triggering factors distance to river and distance to road resulted the prominent ones keywords pluvial flood risk machine learning spatio temporal cross validation triggering factors forward feature selection metropolitan city of venice data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction among the observed natural and anthropogenic calamities water related disasters i e floods droughts are undoubtedly the most recurrent ones posing increasing threats to human life assets and activities cred 2018 according with the united nation world water development report unesco 2020 the 74 of disasters registered worldwide in the last 20 years were water related with a total number of deaths caused only by floods and droughts exceeding 166 000 and a total economic damage of almost us 700 billion despite coastal and river flooding usually receive more attention as they are generally larger and longer lasting events recent research suggested that due to the frequent nature of pluvial floods cumulative direct damages of such type of flood equals or may even exceed those derived from riverine and coastal ones eea 2020 nicklin et al 2019 pluvial flood distinguishes it from riverine and coastal flooding river flood are characterized by gradual riverbank overflows caused by extensive rainfall over an extended period while coastal flooding occurs as a consequence of extreme tidal conditions caused by severe weather e g storm surge strong winds maddox 2014 by contrast pluvial floods occur when intense rainfall cannot drain quickly enough by urban drainage system kalantari et al 2019 sperotto et al 2015 they are usually associated with high intensity rainfall rates but can also occur with low rainfall rates when the ground has low permeability and is urbanized falconer et al 2008 the intensification of heavy rainfall phenomena due to climate change ipcc 2021 accompanied by urbanization land use land cover change modification in river morphology agricultural practices and soil degradation is likely to exacerbate pluvial flood risks hoegh guldberg et al 2018 shahabi et al 2021 especially in urban areas where the formation of micro climates can further influence rainfall patterns kalantari et al 2019 shahabi et al 2021 being able to identify and predict pluvial flood prone areas at local level and how such areas will be shaped by future rainfall patterns is crucial to ensure sufficient time for people to respond to future floods as well as to set the basis for the prioritization of flood risk reduction investments accordingly pluvial flood risk mapping is becoming a key step in the development of flood mitigation and early warnings as well as climate change adaptation strategies informing the implementation of the sendai framework for drr 2015 2030 unisdr 2015 and the multi hazard risk assessments compelled by the eu civil protection mechanism according to the existing literature maragno et al 2021 multiple and diverse methodologies have been developed to study the pluvial flood risk in urban areas the most widely applied method for flood mapping involved the use of hydraulic and hydrodynamic models li 2011 to simulate the inundated areas and water depth based on historical or predicted rainfall data different kind of models have been employed so far including among others mike flood löwe et al 2017 kaspersen et al 2017 mike 21 wen et al 2013 rana et al 2012 shrestha et al 2020 mike 3 bolanos et al 2014 sørensen et al 2004 pietrzak et al 2002 hec ras shrestha et al 2020 ranaee et al 2009 thakur et al 2017 vojtek et al 2019 soil water assessment tool swat pagliero et al 2014 yoon et al 2021 info works icm cheng et al 2017 hydrotel ben aissa et al 2012 however despite hydraulic and hydrodynamic flooding models are characterized by a high level of accuracy their practical application for pluvial flood assessment is often hampered by the limited understanding of hydrological and hydrodynamic processes by complex input data requirements the high computational time and costs yan et al 2021 wagenaar et al 2020 beyer and laney 2012 these kinds of models require a high amount of data and variables for their calibration to be able to accurately represent the flood dynamic in the urban environment characterized by highly complex flow paths and microscale topographic features dramatically increasing the computational burden samela et al 2020 physical based models can simulate water flows at sub daily level and at multiple timescales e g hourly rate three or six hourly rate however it expands the computational resource demand which lead to inconsistent predictions when setups overlap in the time ranges boithias et al 2017 gauch et al 2021 moreover at present hydraulic and hydrodynamic models require a long calculation time problem which become prominent when working at the urban scale requiring high spatial resolution it represents a bottleneck of rapid pluvial flood mapping and especially for those application that require re iterative analysis guo et al 2020 or prediction over alternative precipitation scenarios leitao et al 2010 ke et al 2020 for such reason the use of process models may not always be feasible for real time flood mapping and operative flood warning to be used for urban flood risk assessment and emergency management when instead accurate and timely outputs become more important than system understanding wagenaar et al 2020 on the other hand geographic information system gis and remote sensing techniques have been developed as useful tools for spatial analysis in flood hazard assessment ghorbanzadeh et al 2019a multi criteria decision analysis mcda functions are commonly employed to develop indices and ranking alternatives starting from geographical indicators it is hence widely used in gis based models however a limiting factor of the approach is its high dependence on experts knowledge which increases the uncertainty while assessing the results chowdary et al 2013 khosravi et al 2019 reviewed and compared different mcdm methods e g topsis ahp anp saw used for mapping flood susceptibility respect to other data driven methods i e ml they present some weakness firstly they are data highly intensive in recording decision makers preferences secondly the weighting system for the variables requires strong assumptions from decision makers which could make them subjective velasquez and hester 2013 khosravi et al 2019 these are critical aspects to consider when selecting suitable methods for flood susceptibility modeling these intrinsic limitations of the traditional flood models have inspired the research community to explore and test new methodologies that leverage these challenges among these the ml models in the last years the use of machine learning ml methods to predict natural hazard risk has increased exponentially ml models are increasingly used as modeling tool because of their high performance and predictive capability ahmadlou et al 2019 ml embraces multiple disciplines such as informatic statistics environmental science mathematics permitting very diverse sources of data to be integrated to solve complex environmental problems nevertheless its increasing popularity stem from the fact that it does not need complex mathematical expression to describe and predict physical processes mosavi et al 2018 shahabi et al 2021 ml has been involved in the analysis of different natural hazards typologies including floods chen et al 2020 dodangeh et al 2020 mahato et al 2021 nandi et al 2016 landslides costanzo et al 2014 pradhan 2013 tien bui et al 2012 bui et al 2016 and wildfires dutta et al 2016 fiorucci et al 2019 ghorbanzadeh et al 2019b jaafari et al 2019 wagenaar et al 2020 claim that ml could have the potential to change the way flood assessment is performed thanks to the accuracy improvements and the reduction of calculating time and model development cost thanks to their high performances in processing big datasets with enough iteration detail and flexibility oxford sustainable finance programme 2018 ml is able to frame simpler and less computational models respect to traditional flood models opening their applicability a large range of contexts specifically ml present relative short computational time respect to physically based models making them particularly suitable for real time flood mapping in early warning systems and for short term flood forecasting supporting emergency response and preparation phases bonafilia et al 2020 wagenaar et al 2020 in addition ml models permit to jointly compute different timescales in a hierarchical process by integrating forcings of different temporal resolutions and generating accurate and consistent predictions these models require far smaller computations than individual physical flood models per timescale gauch et al 2021 according to khosravi et al 2019 ml methods outperform the mcdm techniques because of their greater accuracy and higher prediction performance finally thanks for their flexibility in integrating heterogeneous source of data they can benefit from the integration in a real time setting of data from emerging technologies including satellite imagery aerial imagery crowdsourcing social media and mobile gps and call data records cdr lee et al 2012 according with zennaro et al 2021 considering also climate change impacts ml can substantially improve current risk assessment procedures permitting to capture the complex interactions and causal nexus occurring among the variables that may alter the equilibrium of exposed systems affected by natural and anthropogenic drivers especially in the assessment of flood events that require deep exploration of the complex and site dependent mechanisms in the frame of climate change risk assessment ml algorithms can be used to link together the components of the risk i e hazard vulnerability and exposure specifically in the hazard appraisal ml has been adopted for instance for short term flood and flash flood forecasts and for monitoring phenomena in the long term under different climate change scenarios chen et al 2019 kim et al 2015 while ml has supported the vulnerability component to predict human related vulnerabilities e g demographic and socio economic conditions and for climate related vulnerability buckland et al 2019 saha and pal 2019 the exposure component mainly concerns the detection and prediction of exposed targets in time under changing climatic and land use scenarios karan and samadder 2018 oliveira et al 2017 therefore ml supports risk assessment in several ways integrating heterogeneous data separated in time and space zennaro et al 2021 for what concern pluvial flood risk different types of ml statistical approaches have been adopted and include logistic regression ettinger et al 2016 frequency ratio tehrany et al 2015a rahmati et al 2016 and fuzzy logic pierdicca et al 2010 non linear ml algorithms used in flood susceptibility models include artificial neural network kia et al 2012 random forest wang et al 2015 chapi et al 2017 gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b decision tree tehrany et al 2015b pham et al 2021 tehrany et al 2014 khosravi et al 2018 choubin et al 2019 convolutional neural network ghorbanzadeh et al 2019a wang et al 2020 and support vector machine tehrany et al 2014 choubin et al 2019 gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b wang et al 2020 any ml model has advantages and disadvantages and the model s performance largely depends on the dataset and its structure gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b the prediction of pluvial flood events can be a regression or a classification problem depending on the purpose of the assessment and on the historical data available in the preparation phase predictive models are mainly used for hazard mapping and emergency planning and thus information about the spatial extent of flooded areas can be sufficient in such cases flood prediction is a classification problem where we predict the occurrence or not of a pluvial flood event in a specific space and time by contrast during the response and recovery phase maximum flood depth and velocity should be modeled thus requiring a regression analysis in classification tasks each point in the area under assessment is characterized by a specific and unique combination of attributes the so called triggering factors e g aspect curvature distance to rivers land use elevation etc which are processed in the ml models the study area is hence represented by a set of observations characterized by triggering factors information values for each specific location and time point during an extreme precipitation event water might not be quickly absorbed by the ground determining a lengthening of the event that can last more than one day this fact may lead to temporal correlation between observations at the same location furthermore observations are also spatially correlated as areas close to each other tend to have the same characteristics and so similar probabilities of being affected by pluvial flood events meyer et al 2018 for this reason standard ml procedures that randomly split the dataset in train and test set could be not suitable for spatio temporal analysis and classification of pluvial flood risk as they violate the assumption of independence between train and test data hastie et al 2009 leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error drawing on such considerations the overall aim of the analysis presented here is to develop and test a ml based methodology for rapid pluvial flood risk prediction in the metropolitan city of venice northern italy considering both spatial and temporal constraints the novelty of the presented methodology is the development of a classification model that reduces the overfitting by introducing a features selection process and by involving spatio temporal cross validation ke et al 2020 developed a ml approach to predict the occurrence of pluvial flood in urban areas they defined a model able to determine the rainfall flooding thresholds providing a binary result of flooding or not flooding occurrence despite the proposed model is built on the 10 fold cross validation technique according to temporal rainfall accumulation they did not estimate the spatial component hence the correlation of the spatial distribution of inundation and inundation depth with the temporal occurrence of the events similarly guo et al 2022 developed a flood prediction model capable of generalizing different catchment areas and to generate flood predictions the data driven model is built on one rainfall event and considers maximum water depth and flow velocity as key factors while neglecting the temporal variable the convolutional neural network model was used for spatializing flood prediction also under different scenarios however a drawback of the model is that they performed a holdout validation instead of a k fold cross validation since it would have smoothed out the results and avoided misleading results which was compensated with a large dataset furthermore the model was oversimplified by focusing only on one main contributing factor i e the elevation and neglecting others as land cover and spatial distribution of precipitation intensity the model performed a good prediction accuracy and was able to generalize on different catchment areas and topographies despite being limited to few affecting features overall multiple studies have developed models able to detect the spatial component with accuracy even though a spatio temporal cross validation technique would be more reliable in reproducing and predicting unknown flood events drawing on such considerations the methodology propose demonstrates how spatio temporal cross validation should be used to improve the accuracy of pluvial flood mapping both across space and time a necessary improvement especially to support flood prediction over future scenarios and under a changing climate in which the spatial patterns intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events could be extremely different from current ones a further novelty is the selection of features i e triggering factors that might affect the occurrence of pluvial flood in the cross validation process and the consequent discard of those features that are not directly linked to flooding events the final output is represented by a suite of risk maps of the flood prone areas in the metropolitan city of venice indeed in the past the metropolitan city of venice has been hit by recurrent extreme pluvial flood events and given the future climate scenarios and the urbanization rate worsening conditions and extreme events are expected requiring therefore an assessment of pluvial flood risks and the mapping of the most vulnerable areas to identify suitable measures to include in the definition of the emergency and adaptation plan currently under development after a brief introduction of the case study area the historical pluvial flood extreme events and the available input data section 2 the paper describes the cross validation approaches and ml models applied to the case study area to create the pluvial flood risk mapping section 3 and finally discusses the prediction error with different models and the risk mapping for 60 historical extreme events in the metropolitan city of venice section 4 2 case study area 2 1 the metropolitan city of venice the metropolitan city of venice cmv is located in veneto region in the north east coast of the adriatic sea it is placed in the venetian plane consists of 44 municipalities and has an overall extension of 2467 km2 with a population of 848 829 inhabitants istat 2020 fig 1 b figure a supplementary material mainly concentrated in the west side of the urban area adjacent to the city of venice multiple economic activities take place in the study area ranging from industry i e mestre and marghera district tourism seaport activities shipping and fishing along the coastal area dipartimento per gli affari regionali e le autonomie 2017 the cmv is a highly urbanized area whose development was driven by the economic growth after world war ii and the expansion of the petrochemical plant of porto marghera the rapid urbanization rate led in the past to a growing demand of residential spaces and infrastructures determining radical changes of entire areas of the city and causing the rapid conversion of green areas into urban zones the extended development determined structural hydraulic criticalities venice province 2011 that in recent years the administrators tried to overcome also through environmental restoration actions such as the creation of green public areas e g bissuola park mestre wood san giuliano park however despite the implementation of such measures there are still many criticalities due to the inappropriateness of the sewer and drainage systems which became evident in the last decade when different portions of the urban area have been flooded in concomitance with severe rainfall events the increasing frequency and intensity in extreme rainfall events expected for the mediterranean region blöschl et al 2019 exposes the study area to a potential increase of pluvial flood risk specifically climate projections foreseen for the long term a reduction of precipitation for the summer period and an increase during the winter months in northern italy spano et al 2020 according to the national adaptation plan to climate change pnacc 2018 extreme precipitation events are expected to occur for more than 100 days during the winter season as well as more than 20 days per year of precipitation above the 95th percentile in the area of concern beside the climatic drivers the social and structural components e g the urbanization degree the rate of population growth in urban areas the appropriateness of the drainage and sewer systems as well as the environmental geological and hydrological features of the territory will directly contribute to increase the vulnerability of the territory to pluvial floods events influencing the soil absorption rate and the water runoff huong and pathirana 2013 spano et al 2020 2 2 data collection and preprocessing ml models are data driven tools that offer an automated means of recognizing patterns in high dimensional data cracknell and reading 2014 ml models link a set of independent variables to the response variable and use only the independent variables for making predictions in predicting pluvial flood events ml models learn from variables called triggering factors to predict a response variable at a different time and location within a defined model domain meyer et al 2018 in the pluvial flood risk model developed for the mcv the response variable is represented by flooded areas while the triggering factors are represented by territory s features that might positively or negatively affect the flooding occurrence the triggering factors have a direct impact on the accuracy of the models in predicting pluvial flood areas therefore the collected data e g triggering factors and the pluvial flood areas constitute the dataset used to build up the model 2 2 1 historical events inventory the historical events inventory reports the locations of the pluvial flood areas and provides detailed information about the characteristics of historical flood events zazo et al 2018 a dataset of historical events recorded between 1995 and 2020 was provided by the metropolitan city of venice https webgis2 cittametropolitana ve it with detailed information regarding the date localization the municipalities affected the extension of flooded areas and the cause i e heavy rain coastal or riverine flood for each event the dataset has been built collecting the reports made by citizens hit by the flooding event to the firefighters fig 1a shows the number of historical events that occurred each year from 1995 to 2020 fig 1b represents the spatial distribution of flooded areas according to their frequency in the mcv the number of pluvial flood events has consistently increased in the last decade and a net peak has been registered in 2014 and 2019 most of the historical events reported in the case study area are close to the cities of portogruaro and bibione in the north and close to camponogara and mestre in the south center of the mcv to build up the ml model a sampling of 40 historical events were selected among the most relevant pluvial flood events i e when at least ten pluvial flood areas have been reported to the authorities in order to be sure to include only pluvial flood events only flood events associated with heavy rainfall have been selected from the historical dataset while riverine coastal or compounded flood have been excluded moreover other 20 non flood historical events in the time period 1995 2020 were randomly selected and added to the dataset to get a more exhaustive overview of the relationship among flooded areas non flooded areas and triggering factors 2 2 2 flood triggering factors based on literature e g arabameri et al 2019 wang et al 2020 shahabi et al 2021 and available data 12 triggering factors were initially selected as relevant for the assessment of pluvial flood risk in the mcv table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the triggering factors including their spatial and temporal resolution the number and the type of features derived from each variable and the data source used for their characterization in fact the variables can be classified in numerical if the values are numbers or in categorical if the values present or not a specific class of the variable itself aspect is the direction or orientation of the maximum slope of the surface different directions may face different effects in terms of precipitation and solar radiation thus affecting hydrological conditions bathrellos et al 2018 wang et al 2020 four categories of aspect have been considered according to different angle ranges north 45 135 west 135 225 south 225 315 and east 315 45 curvature is the degree of distortion of the slope surface computed from the digital terrain model dtm and reflects the morphology of a given area mojaddadi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 curvature has been differentiated into three categories flat concave or convex elevation has an inverse relationship with flooding fernandez and lutz 2010 shahabi et al 2021 lower elevations may lead to higher probability of pluvial flood bui et al 2019 elevation was treated as a numerical feature slope represents the inclination of the surface and has a direct effect on flooding because it affects surface runoff its velocity and water infiltration rates costache et al 2020 accordingly the lower the slope the higher the rate of infiltration and the lower the flow velocity slope was computed from the digital terrain model dtm and was differentiated into two categories presence or absence of slope soil is the classification of specific areas based on their morphology granulometry of sediments and age of surfaces carta dei suoli del veneto 2019 different soils imply different permeability and thus different flood potentials soil features have been collected from arpav database and were differentiated into four categories low ancient plain ba recent low plain br coastal plain cl and urban areas urb texture is a soil infiltration property classified by the percentage composition of its solid particles distinguished in granulometric categories and it is important in determining the total amount of surface run off during rainfall events kaspersen et al 2017 texture indicates the soil material at 50 cm under the surface and it was differentiated in 10 categories clayey clayey frank clayey sandy frank clayey silty clayey silty frank frank organic materials sandy sandy frank sandy loam and silty frank permeability measures the capacity of a surface to absorb or reject water thus it is an indicator of water infiltration permeability has been differentiated in 5 categories reporting the permeability range values expressed in millimeters per hour mm h very low 0 036 0 36 mm h low 0 36 3 6 mm h medium 3 6 36 mm h high 36 360 mm h very high 360 mm h land use can affect water absorption and thus runoff santos and reis 2018 land use data have been extracted from the corine land cover dataset for five years 1990 2000 2006 2012 and 2018 the 44 land types were aggregated into five main categories agriculture areas green areas industrial areas urban areas and water areas normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to study the vegetation density of the land surface rouse et al 1974 changes in ndvi indicate modifications in vegetation ahmed and akter 2017 it can be an important triggering factor as higher vegetation densities are assumed to have lower probabilities of flooding within the study area chapi et al 2017 ndvi data were extracted from three satellite sentinel2 images i e tiles t32tqq t32tqr and t33tul taken on may 5 2015 and downloaded from earthexplorer website ndvi is calculated as ndvi b 08 b 04 b 08 b 04 where b08 is the near infrared band and b04 is the red band ndvi can vary between 1 low vegetation density and 1 high vegetation density precipitation is the main triggering factor contributing to pluvial flood risk precipitation data were provided by the regional agency for environmental prevention and protection of veneto arpav and the cumulative daily precipitation and hourly maximum intensity was extracted for each of the 60 historical events since the meteorological stations do not cover all the study area the spatial distribution was computed by interpolating the 188 stations placed across veneto region using linear ordinary kriging method li et al 2011 yang 2015 precipitation data were treated as numerical features distance to road is an important feature to consider as the proximity to artificial infrastructure can impose a negative impact on pluvial flood vulnerability indeed roads can represent a proxy of highly impervious areas leading to higher probability of pluvial flood gaitan et al 2016 distance to road has been differentiated in three categories 0 m 250 m 250 m 500 m greater than500 m and it was also treated as a numerical feature distance to river indicates the euclidean distance in meters from river networks areas close to rivers are generally considered more susceptible to flooding compared to more distant areas chapi et al 2017 as rivers represent main pathways for flood discharge and expansion distance to the river has been differentiated in three categories 0 m 250 m 250 m 500 m greater than500 m and it was also treated as a numerical feature distance to sea was assessed because the case study includes areas close to the coast the distance to sea has been differentiated in three categories 0 m 250 m 250 m 500 m greater than500 m and it was also treated as a numerical feature each variable described above has a different unit of measure these differences between features require rescaling the values in order to ensure that all inputs are equally comparable when developing the ml models hastie et al 2009 therefore all categorical features were treated as binary features with a value of 1 if the category is present in that observation or 0 otherwise while the numerical features were scaled between 0 and 1 except for ndvi that is included between 1 and 1 the spatial distribution of the triggering factors in the case study domain is represented in figure b supplementary material 3 methods 3 1 machine learning models the pluvial flood risk assessment methodology proposed here allows a first assessment of the areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood in the metropolitan city of venice given specific precipitation events and the characteristics of the territory pluvial flood prediction in our case study is a classification task which aims to predict if an area is likely to be flooded or not and to explore the relationship existing between the features included in the dataset and the response variable that does not include the pluvial flood depth since historical events of pluvial flood areas are available supervised ml models can be used to learn the relationship between pluvial flood areas i e the response variable and the triggering factors i e the features to identify the most relevant patterns in the data in this paper three different ml models were considered and compared namely logistic regression neural networks and random forest 3 1 1 logistic regression logistic regression lr is a widely used model for classification i e when the response variable is dichotomous azzalini and scarpa 2012 lr is expressed as a linear combination η x of the selected features 1 η x β 1 x 1 β p x p x t β where xi i 1 p are the p features and βi i 1 p are the p weights from η x it is possible to calculate the probability π of pluvial flood occurrence as 2 π e η x 1 e η x where 0 π 1 3 1 2 neural networks a neural network nn is a complex ml model that approximates almost any nonlinear function azzalini and scarpa 2012 its basic architecture is made up of three layers i an input layer that includes the features ii one hidden layer that links the input layer with the output layer using nonlinear functions and optimized weights iii an output layer that includes the response variable a nn model is particularly used for its flexibility and good performances however it does not allow to identify the most important features that affect the model leading to a weak interpretation of the results 3 1 3 random forest random forest rf is an ensemble classification model that averages the predictions of a number k of classification trees breiman 2001 rf combines different models to decrease the unstable results arising from a single classification tree prediction which might be affected by a specific subset of data selected for the training set hastie et al 2009 indeed each classification tree is fit using a random subset of features and observations which make the final ensemble model more reliable 3 2 ml based methodology for pluvial flood risk mapping as in the assessment of pluvial flood risk the triggering factors and the response variable vary both in time and in space a specific methodology considering spatio temporal constraints needs to be developed the flowchart in fig 2 is meant to guide the reader through the methodology applied to identify pluvial flood risk areas the aim of the proposed approach is to develop a ml model that is reliable to predict pluvial flood occurrence in different locations and time periods for this reason the triggering factors and the historical events introduced in section 2 were collected for the case study to create the dataset used to fit the ml models the dataset in ml approaches is usually split in two folds training and test set the training set is used to fit the parameters of the model while the test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the prediction errors of the model fit on the training set however a frequent problem in ml models is overfitting i e when the model has a high performance in predicting training data but it fails to predict new data that the model has never seen before hastie et al 2009 a way to reduce overfitting is to split the training set in two parts the training and the validation set the validation set is typically used to estimate the prediction error on independent data and to optimize the hyperparameters of the ml models the hyperparameters of a ml model define its structure and are used to control the learning process of the model this process is called hyperparameters tuning that is the research of the ideal model architecture lecun et al 2015 in this specific case study the validation set is used for hyperparameters tuning but also to select the most important features to consider to improve the pluvial flood area prediction a limitation of splitting the dataset in training validation and test set might occur when working with spatial data because the assumption of independence between these three folds is not respected in a geographical domain roberts et al 2017 furthermore when the dataset is scarce cross validation is applied to measure the model s accuracy to predict new data in more than one configuration of training validation and test set in this study since the data of flooded and non flooded areas in the cmv were limited cross validation was applied to provide a better appraisal of the prediction error cross validation can be distinguished in outer and inner cross validation outer cross validation allows different configuration of test set while inner cross validation allows different configuration of training and validation set moreover the inner cross validation methods in this case study are distinguished in random cross validation r cv and spatio temporal cross validation llto cv to compare the first approach widely used in literature with a different approach that takes into consideration both space and time to evaluate the performances of the model as described in fig 2 triggering factors and historical events data were preprocessed to construct the dataset which has been split in training and test set then two different inner cross validation approaches r cv and llto cv were used to additionally split the training set into training and validation set three different machine learning models were thus applied using both cross validation techniques in order to select the best features and hyperparameters based on the area under the curve auc score in the validation set auc is a measure of accuracy commonly used to evaluate machine learning models in binary classification problems and it ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates the maximum accuracy score in addition an outer cross validation was applied leading to the reiteration of the whole process until all the observations in the dataset have been part of the test set exactly once finally the best model was selected and used to predict pluvial flood events based on the best auc score in the validation set 3 2 1 dataset folds ml models were compared based on their accuracy to spatial temporally predict a new pluvial flood event hence the dataset was split in t s folds where t is the number of time periods in which the historical events are grouped and s is the number of spatial areas in which the case study areas are split time intervals and spatial areas were chosen to guarantee an almost equal distribution of pluvial flood areas in each fold indeed the time periods were calculated using the quantile distribution of the flooded observation dates in particular the limits of the time period classes are the 0 t 1 t t t quantile of the historical events with pluvial flood areas reported where the 0 t quantile is the first event and the t t quantile is the last one regarding the spatial areas pluvial flood areas were labeled according to the location i e the city where the flood occurred while the latitude of the city center was used as criteria to split the areas in s groups in particular the quantile distribution of the latitude of cities in which the pluvial flood occurred was used to split the data in s spatial areas and the limits of the spatial classes were the 0 s 1 s s s quantile of the cities latitude where the 0 s quantile is the highest latitude and s s quantile is the lowest one once the folds were defined the dataset was split into training and test sets 3 2 2 cross validation to get a reliable estimation of the model performance that is not biased by a specific configuration of training and test set we applied a nested cross validation nested cross validation is an approach for hyperparameter optimization features selection and model selection that attempts to overcome the problem of overfitting the training set hence cross validation is applied in order to select the most important variables to optimize the hyperparameters of the models and to select the most appropriate model nested cross validation includes two typologies of cross validation the outer cross validation used to estimate the prediction error in different configurations of the training and test set and the inner cross validation used for hyperparameters tuning and to select the most important features based on the model performance in different configuration of training and validation set 3 2 2 1 outer leave location and time out cross validation outer cross validation allows to take advantage of all the available data to measure the accuracy of the models in different test sets as the three ml models are compared by their ability to predict a new spatio temporal event outer leave location and time out cross validation was considered at each step one fold kt s between the t s folds is selected to be part of the test set t 1 s 1 folds that have in common the time period or the spatial area with the test set were excluded from the analysis while the t 1 s 1 independent folds are selected to be part of the training set until all folds have been exactly once part of the test set then the training set used to fit the model was split into a training and validation set to apply forward features selection and hyperparameters tuning fig 3 a shows the outer cross validation procedure in the case of t 4 and s 4 at each step one of the 16 folds was used as test set while 9 independent folds were part of the training set the same number of folds were used in the case study which means that at each step roughly 56 25 of the data were used as training set and 6 25 as test set for outer cross validation while the remaining 37 5 of the data were excluded 3 2 2 2 inner cross validation the inner cross validation is applied to select the most relevant features and to optimize the hyperparameters based on the performances of the model in different configurations of training and validation set in this paper inner cross validation is differentiated in inner random cross validation and inner leave location and time out cross validation we applied both methodologies to understand which one better performs in forecasting new flooded areas in consequence of extreme events in the inner random cross validation r cv approach the training set is randomly split in kr roughly equal size folds at each step one of the kr folds was used as validation set and the remaining kr 1 folds were used to fit the model until all the folds have been part of the validation set exactly once a limitation of r cv is the assumption of independence between training and validation observations that if it is not satisfied leads to optimistic accuracy in the validation set where the model selection will favor the most complex models roberts et al 2017 in pluvial flood problems the assumption of independence could not be satisfied since observations are correlated both in time and space hence they cannot be split in training and validation set randomly this approach determines that r cv could overestimate the predictions accuracy in the validation set as it is correlated with the training set but it may lead to bad predictions in an independent test set from a different spatio temporal domain that the model has never seen before fig 3b shows the inner random cross validation procedure in the case of t 4 and s 4 where the test set is set to be the k1 1 the 9 folds in the training set independent from the test set are merged and split in 4 random folds when cross validation is applied at each step one of the random folds is chosen as validation set and the remaining 3 folds are used as training set to fit the model until all the folds have been part of the validation set exactly once inner leave location and time out cross validation llto cv is an approach that faces the spatio temporal problems considering both time and space in the creation of the folds for the training and validation set indeed the training set initially includes t 1 s 1 folds independent from the test set and when cross validation is applied at each step a fold kt s folds is chosen to be part of the validation set t 2 s 2 folds that have in common the time period or the spatial area with the validation set were excluded from the analysis and the remaining t 2 s 2 folds are used to fit the ml model the procedure is repeated until all the folds have been part of the validation set exactly once fig 3c shows a llto cv example for t 4 s 4 and where k1 1 fold is chosen as test set at each step one of the 9 folds of the training set is chosen as a validation set 4 folds are discarded and 4 independent folds are used to fit the model the same number of folds were used in the case study which means that at each step roughly 44 44 of the data were used as training set and 11 11 as test set for inner cross validation while the remaining 44 45 of the data were excluded 3 3 forward features selection and hyperparameters tuning usually cross validation is used to estimate the model performances in predicting different validation sets but also to research the best architecture of the model the research of the architecture that maximizes the accuracy of the model in the validation set is called hyperparameters tuning as one or more parameters of the model are optimized to find the best configuration in this paper we add to the hyperparameters tuning the research of the best features that improves the accuracy of the model in predicting pluvial flood areas in this procedure called forward features selection at each step the best feature is added to the model until no more features are useful to improve predictions 3 3 1 forward features selection most of the features collected in the dataset describe the properties of a location e g curvature elevation slope etc these features vary in space but not in time which means that each pixel has a unique combination of static features and it has unique properties comparable with quasi unique ids of the pixels meyer et al 2018 features that lead to overfitting can be automatically identified and removed using a forward feature selection method to exclude the misleading ones from the models meyer et al 2018 the forward features selection method at each step includes in the model the feature that mostly improves the accuracy of the model in classification tasks or mostly reduces the prediction error in regression tasks until no improvements are shown when adding a new feature in this case study at each step the feature that mostly improves the auc a recommended metric used instead of the overall accuracy to compare different ml algorithms in classification problems bradley and andrew 1997 was introduced the forward features selection process ends when no more features can add enough value to the model to improve the auc score at least by 0 01 with respect to the previous step this methodology strongly reduces the number of features by selecting the most representative ones resulting in simpler and more understandable models 3 3 2 hyperparameters tuning hyperparameters setting is a fundamental step in building machine learning models lecun et al 2015 some ml models need to optimize specific hyperparameters to find the best architecture that maximizes the auc score through inner cross validation as the forward features selection methodology leads to a sensible increase of the computational time to fit the models hyperparameters are fixed before the features selection process and the tuning is computed only at the end of the process even though the procedure does not guarantee to obtain the best hyperparameters configuration indeed for each of the ml models initial hyperparameters are manually set in particular logistic regression is set with a regularization hyperparameter equal to 1 random forest nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure and neural networks are set with one hidden layer and 2 nodes at the end of the forward features selection process hyperparameters tuning is computed to research the best configuration of each model considering a regularization hyperparameter c 0 01 0 1 1 10 or 100 for logistic regression one hidden layer with a number between 2 and 9 nodes for neural networks a maximum depth between 2 and 20 nodes for random forest the hyperparameters that are not considered in the hyperparameters tuning process are set to be equal to their standard value defined by the package sklearn in python 3 4 model selection the three ml models introduced in section 3 1 were fitted with two different cross validation approaches and following the flowchart in fig 3 were compared for the accuracy assessment through the auc score the auc is a measure of accuracy of the predictions compared to the real values and it is computed using the validation set as all the observations of the training set become part of the validation set exactly once the auc can evaluate the model accuracy including all the observations available in the training set hence at the end of the inner cross validation the best features and hyperparameters are chosen based on the auc score but if the model selection is based only on one auc score the selected model is biased by a specific configuration of the training set and test set for this reason outer cross validation returns t s different configurations of the training and test set that permit the computation of t s auc score then the model with the highest auc score averaged between the t s folds is selected to perform pluvial flood risk mapping 3 5 pluvial flood risk mapping the ml model selected in the previous step was finally tested to check its ability in estimating the occurrence of pluvial flood in selected historical events and thus to create a pluvial flood risk map each map represents the probability that a pluvial flood occurs in a specific pixel of the study area the final aim was to investigate if the model is able to properly reproduce the events occurred in the case study and thus if it is suitable to be used for future predictions 4 results 4 1 dataset and cross validation the dataset was created from 60 historical events that includes 47 219 280 observations i e pixels that represent the case study area in different days the number of pluvial flood areas is much lower than the non flooded areas as only 0 49 of the observations represent pluvial flood areas 231 420 pixels in this case the dataset is unbalanced so in order to reduce the number of non flooded areas a random subset of 10 000 non flooded observations for each of the 60 dates in addition to all the flooded observations was selected accordingly the final dataset includes 831 420 observations 600 000 non flooded pixels and 231 420 flooded pixels and 47 attributes 46 features and the response variable the dataset was split in four time periods t and in four spatial locations s for a total of 16 folds s t the t folds were created by dividing the events with flooded observations in quartiles and grouped as follows 1995 01 01 2007 09 30 it includes 28 of the flooded pixels 2007 09 30 2014 01 31 it includes 21 of the flooded pixels 2014 01 31 2016 02 29 it includes 23 of the flooded pixels 2016 02 29 2020 12 31 it includes 28 of the flooded pixels for the spatial distribution the s groups were created according to the latitude of the city s center the spatial folds are the following s1 it includes 27 of the flooded pixels s2 it includes 24 of the flooded pixels s3 it includes 28 of the flooded pixels s4 it includes 21 of the flooded pixels in summary there are t 4 time periods folds and s 4 spatial folds resulting in t s 16 spatio temporal folds figure c and table a supplementary material following the methodology described in section 3 2 one of the 16 folds was chosen as the test set 6 folds were excluded as they have time or space in common with the test set and the remaining 9 folds were part of the training set the outer cross validation allowed the models to fit on 16 different configurations of training and test set as at each step a different fold was part of the test set then when inner random cross validation was applied the 9 folds of the training set were merged together the observations were shuffled and 4 roughly equal flooded pixels size folds were created on the other side when inner spatio temporal cross validation was applied at each step one of the 9 folds was used as validation set while the remaining t 2 s 2 4 folds that did not have location and time period in common with the test and validation set were used as training set 4 2 forward features selection and hyperparameters tuning 4 2 1 forward features selection when applying the forward features selection method the features selected can vary according to the machine learning model and the observations in the training set thereby as 16 folds exist also 16 configurations of training and test set are possible so that each feature can be selected from 0 to 16 times indicating a proxy of its importance to predict pluvial flood fig 4 shows the most selected features in the two cross validation approaches for each of the three ml models previously introduced on the left the boxplots represent the number of candidate features in each step of 16 feature selection processes for each model and approach on the right the dot plots show the features importance based on the number of times they were selected in 16 features selection processes in the logistic regression model the forward features selection process selected daily cumulative precipitation for 16 times making it a key feature for pluvial flood predictions another feature considered important by the lr model was the distance to the river selected 12 times in the llto cv and 13 times in the r cv the remaining features were selected less than 50 times both with the llto cv and r cv approaches hence were considered negligible for the model for predicting pluvial flood on the other hand the neural network model selected only the daily cumulative precipitation as a key feature while the remaining ones received low importance scores among the remaining candidates only the hourly maximum precipitation was selected more than 2 times finally in the random forest model with r cv approach daily cumulative precipitation hourly maximum precipitation distance to sea and elevation were selected as relevant features interestingly neither distance to sea nor elevation resulted relevant in the llto cv approach so it is possible that these features perform better in a random cross validation approach while they fail to predict new spatio temporal conditions hence in the llto cv approach the random forest model considers the daily cumulative precipitation 10 times distance to river 6 times hourly maximum precipitation 6 times and a sandy texture 5 times as significant characteristics in estimating pluvial flood overall the three ml models selected as key features almost the same variables i e daily cumulative precipitation precipitation intensity and distance to river simplifying the models structure and resulting in only three variables useful to predict pluvial flood and affecting the occurrence of flooding events other relevant considerations can be drawn from fig 4 at step 0 all the 46 features are suitable to be added to the model in the next steps the most important feature is selected the features that decrease auc are removed while the remaining features are candidates for the next selection step it can be noticed that llto cv procedure for all the three models has an earlier drop out of the useless features compared to the r cv approach r cv approach tends to build more complex models keeping more features as candidates in the procedure until it reaches an excellent auc score however this process leads to overfitting 4 2 2 hyperparameters tuning hyperparameters tuning output shows clear differences between the two approaches of cross validation for logistic regression the median regularization coefficient is 0 1 for llto cv and 1 for r cv i e a stronger regularization of the coefficient is applied in the llto cv approach while for neural networks the median number of nodes of the hidden layer is 6 5 for llto cv and 9 for r cv this confirms that r cv tends to build a more complex neural networks architecture using the maximum number of nodes in the available domain imposed on this hyperparameter finally for random forest the median maximum depth of the tree is 4 for llto cv and 20 for r cv the llto approach prunes the classification trees to an earlier stage resulting in a simpler model with regards to r cv it is worth notice that in the r cv approach each classification tree is pruned at a depth of 20 which is the maximum value available in the domain imposed to this hyperparameter 4 3 model selection table 2 reports the auc score obtained for the training validation and test set for the two configurations i e r cv and llto cv of the three ml models differences in the performance of the inner cross validation approaches can be observed when assessing validation and test set in the validation set inner r cv outperforms inner llto cv for each of the three models but in the test set we get the opposite performance indeed in the test set inner llto cv approach performs better than inner r cv for each of the three ml models with an auc score of 0 860 and 0 855 in the lr model 0 843 and 0 837 in the nn model and 0 846 and 0 722 in the rf model these results show the limitation of r cv in performing spatio temporal analysis as it gets excellent performances on the validation set but it fails to predict with accuracy the observations in the test set the selection of the most suitable model to predict pluvial flood risk in the mcv was based on the auc score in the validation set using the llto cv approach as it is clear that it better approximates the auc score of the observations in the test set hence the lr model resulted in the best model having the highest auc score in the validation set and accordingly it was selected as the reference model for pluvial flood risk mapping the logistic regression model was finally implemented for the last features selection by applying an llto cross validation approach to the whole dataset the final auc score is 0 864 which means that the model is good at distinguishing between the flood and non flooded areas across all possible classification thresholds the best regularization coefficient is 0 05 and among the 13 triggering factors the features selected by the model are the daily cumulative precipitation the distance to river and the distance to roads over 500 m these three features were tested to detect a possible multicollinearity between them but the variance inflaction factor vif calculated did not find any correlation all vif scores lower than 1 07 this model does not consider the remaining 10 triggering factors as relevant to predict pluvial flood events the final logistic regression model used has the following linear combination η x η x 0 048 precipitation daily mm 0 001 distance to river numerical m 0 560 distance to road 500 m regarding the feature s importance the main factor that contributes to the model performances is daily precipitation auc 0 859 while distance to river and distance to road add just 0 005 to the final auc score previous similar ml analysis identified rainfall as the most prominent factor involved in pluvial flooding samanta et al 2018 meliho 2022 for instance samanta et al 2018 concluded that rainfall together with twi was the most important flood conditioning factors in a study that used the frequency ratio technique in the subarnarekha river basin india meliho et al 2022 applied rf extreme gradient boost xgb ann and knn to predict vulnerability to flooding in the ourika watershed in the high atlas of morocco a process of forward feature selection was performed to select variables to be included in each model drainage density rainfall and distance resulted the prominent predisposing factors in the ourika watershed for most of the considered models at the same time distance to river is considered to be one of the most important conditioning factors in most of previous flood susceptibility assessments youssef et al 2016 ahmadlou et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019b pham et al 2020 used credal decision tree cdt as a base classifier along with four ensemble models for flood modeling in markazi province iran they results concluded that distance to river was the most important factor for flood incidence in their study area distance to road has been previously considered only in few studies gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020a gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020b however janizadeh et al 2021 mapped the spatial and temporal variability of flood hazard affected by climate and land use changes in the future using several machine learning techniques and their ensembles in iran according to their analysis distance to road resulted one the most import important feature to predict future flood risk based on the ensemble model 4 4 pluvial flood risk mapping the last step of the analysis consists in creating pluvial flood risk maps for each of the 60 major historical events that occurred in the case study area the final aim was to investigate if the model is able to properly reproduce events that occurred in the case study and thus if it is suitable to be used for further predictions i e future risk scenarios therefore the selected lr model calculated for each pixel of the study area the probability of occurrence of pluvial flood considering the three previously selected features i e daily cumulative precipitation distance to river and distance to road over 500 m for a better communication of the results pixels have been aggregated in six classes of pluvial flood risk very low 0 20 low 20 40 medium 40 60 high 60 80 very high 80 95 and very very high 95 100 also the historical events were aggregated in five classes of percentage of pluvial flood areas very small 0 1 small 1 2 medium 2 3 high 3 4 very high 4 5 fig 5 shows the percentage distribution of the pluvial flood risk predicted by the model for the 60 events as well as the percentage of flooded areas in gray chrome the model presents high accuracy and most of the events have been properly predicted while only few mismatches between the real date of the event and the reported flooding resulted indeed according to the results reported in fig 5 the event that occurred on september 26th 2007 reported the highest percentage of flooded areas 4 24 and it is classified from the ml model as the 4th biggest event in terms of number of pixels in the very high risk class a good match between the model and the historical event was registered also on the 16th september 2009 whose assessment of the risk corresponded to the historical data on the other hand some events present a mismatch between the model s prediction and the historical data for example on september 14th 2006 the model predicted a low risk of pluvial flood occurrence for the whole study area while the historical data recorded 89 pluvial flood areas for that day in this example it is realistic to suppose that the historical data do not correspond to the exact date for the pluvial flood event that it may be plausible to represent one of the following days indeed the daily average precipitation for september 14th was only 3 3 mm while the following days it was 50 5 mm on september 15th 23 6 mm on september 16th and 51 5 mm on september 17th also represented in fig 5 similarly on november 12th 2014 a gap between the high risk of flooding assessed by the model and the low number of pluvial flood areas registered only 26 was observed also in this case the mismatch could be explained by an error in reporting the flooded areas since they have been registered on the day before november 11th 2014 where there was a low probability of flooding and low precipitation a further evaluation can be done considering fig 6 that shows the spatial distribution of the model s predictions and the 6 historical events with the largest pluvial flood areas reported also spatially the model proved to have a high accuracy the model can identify the most vulnerable areas showing a good match between the spatial localization of the predicted areas and the historical events from fig 6 it may appear that the model s predictions overestimate the risk of pluvial flood as the number of pixels with an associated high probability of pluvial flood occurrence are always greater than the historical flooded areas predicting the areas in which a pluvial flood will occur with high precision is a hard task but by primarily considering the areas classified to be at very high risk of pluvial flood might help to prioritize the areas more exposed to these events for example on september 26th 2007 fig 6 all the historical flooded areas fall within the highest risk class assessed by the model with a class probability of 95 100 of pluvial flood occurrence this example shows the importance and usefulness of identifying the areas more exposed according to the estimated risk overall according to the results both figs 5 and 6 the model tends to overestimate the risk of pluvial flood even though the largest and affecting events were properly recognized by the model this suggests that the model is accurate and might be applied also for risk scenarios analysis at the present state of the authors knowledge no other studies applying ml tools for pluvial flood mapping are available in the case study however pluvial flood risk and vulnerability maps developed using multi criteria decision analysis and gis based indicators has been provided in maragno et al 2020 and sperotto et al 2016 for both the entire metropolitan city of venice and with a special focus on the venice municipality specifically maragno et al 2020 provided pluvial flood risk scenarios based on different rainfall volumes i e 50 and 150 mm of rain to analyze how different types of land use affect vulnerability to flooding sperotto et al 2016 instead provided a spatial analysis of areas that are more likely to be at risk of flooding in the future considering projected precipitation for 2041 2050 period and specific territory features i e slope soil permeability occurrence of critical hydraulic conditions in the past despite results from these studies cannot be considered fully comparable with the ml approach proposed here some similar conclusions can be drawn extremely vulnerable areas identified in maragno et al 2020 and sperotto et al 2016 under worse precipitation scenarios present a quite good spatial matching with the areas predicted by the ml model i e high very high and very very high probability of flood under the six worse historical events reported fig 6 these areas are represented mainly by industrial commercial and urban fabric located in the central i e mestre and venice urban centre and the industrial plan of porto marghera and in the north east part i e portogruaro san dona bibione of the metropolitan city of venice some small portions of agricultural areas at high risk are instead located along the coastline 5 conclusions the use of ml can substantially improve and speed up disaster risk assessment and mapping helping in overcoming most common bottlenecks of physically based simulations such as the computational complexity and time the need of large datasets of high resolution information however most of the standard ml procedures that randomly split the dataset in train and test are not suitable to account for the spatio temporal variation of pluvial flood as they risk to violate the assumption of independence between train and test leading to overoptimistic models the methodology presented in this paper represents a first attempt to build machine learning models able to incorporate the spatio temporal constraints typical of pluvial flood events and thus to improve rapid pluvial flood risk prediction and mapping capabilities accordingly two different types of cross validation approaches were applied to investigate the performances of three machine learning models built on historical pluvial flood data and a set of triggering factors representative of the territorial characteristic as the use of all the available triggering factors can lead to overfitting a forward features selection was also introduced to reduce the model s complexity logistic regression resulted in the most reliable model displaying lower overfitting and higher performances providing robust results both in the validation and test set while daily cumulative precipitation distance to rivers and distance to road were the most important features in contributing to pluvial flood risk estimation results also confirmed that the llto cv is a crucial step that needs to be considered in the selection of the most suitable ml model for spatio temporal modeling of pluvial flood risk and to avoid overfitting the developed model demonstrated to be able to properly reproduce both in spatial and temporal manner the most severe floods that occurred in the past in the case study despite some mismatches attributable to the low quality and incompleteness of the historical data collected however some limitations have to be acknowledged the analysis would have surely benefited from a higher spatial resolution of input data permitting ml models to better catch relationships between the features and the flooded areas furthermore the model was built on the inventory of historical flood events provided by the local fire brigades such dataset at the present state is the best information on past pluvial flood events for the metropolitan city of venice but however detailed only the extent of the flooded areas and source of such event while such variable can be considered enough for the purpose of the analysis i e rapid spatial flood mapping other important variables should be included i e flood depth flood velocity to extend the use of the model also for damage assessment and disaster preparation in this sense major efforts should be devoted in the collection of pluvial flood events records to build up the model the number of spatio temporal folds for cross validation was set up at 16 while a deeper analysis could find optimal numbers of folds that maximize the learning process of ml models more accurate methodologies to split the dataset in spatio temporal folds could also lead to avoid folds without any flooded areas samples as it occurred for some folds of this analysis future work is envisioned toward a comprehensive methodology that provides not only accurate flooding maps but also a deeper consideration of the interactions among the multiple factors occurring in the study area finally recognizing the role that other threats e g sea level rise storm surge urbanization can play in increasing pluvial flood risk future research efforts should be oriented towards a multi risk approach that considers the potential interaction of climate related hazards and land use change in the case study area overall the produced outputs represent a preliminary screening of potential risks posed by pluvial flood and for the identification of vulnerable areas to such impacts at local scale they can be used to mainstream the definition and implementation of the first phases of local climate change adaptation strategies and plans e g problem formulation identification of vulnerability and risk hotspots identification of adaptation priorities in this perspective they represent a climate and adaptation service useful to inform the implementation of the sendai framework for drr 2015 2030 unisdr 2015 as well as the multi hazard risk assessments compelled by the eu civil protection mechanism the present study must be considered a preparatory exercise for further analyses on pluvial flood risk under climate change conditions the proposed model has been validated demonstrating to be able to reproduce historical events paving the way for its application for predicting future pluvial flood events in the metropolitan city of venice indeed the outputs of regional climate models rcms as well as future land use scenarios could be integrated in the analyses to assess how future changes in precipitation patterns will affect the occurrence and frequency of pluvial flood events therefore the analyses will help to evaluate how urbanization rates influence flooding patterns and their extent becoming a useful tool for decision makers to identify adaptation measures to be incorporated in spatial planning and disaster risk reduction strategies in this sense further analyses could be focused on specific receptors of interest e g people buildings infrastructures agricultural fields cultural sites according to local actors perspectives and needs bonato et al 2021 this can be achieved by including the aforementioned receptors within the model which will predict not only the spatial distribution of flooded areas but will also assess the presence of receptors and the possible damages and losses arising in consequence of extreme events credit authorship contribution statement zanetti marco conceptualization methodology data curation software formal analysis writing

3062,large scale modeling of coupled heat and water transfer chwt is challenging due to the spatial variabilities of soil hydraulic and thermal properties a multi scale finite element method msfem has been designed for simulating liquid water fluxes in unsaturated soils in this study the msfem approach is expanded as a new scheme that can handle chwt in soils two groups of msfem basis functions are constructed to incorporate the heterogeneities in soil hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity and a petrov galerkin formulation is adopted to implement the proposed msfem scheme the msfem scheme is also exploited as a sequential solver when heat transfer and water transfer are expressed in a partially coupled formulation wang et al 2022a numerical examples illustrate that without essentially increasing the computing load the msfem scheme can improve the accuracy by up to 30 compared to the standard finite element method fem especially for thermally driven water transfer some fine scale spatial variations in soil temperature can only be revealed with the msfem scheme if the msfem sequential solver is applied the coupled heat and water transfer model can be rewritten into a sequence of modules where liquid water transfer heat transfer and vapor transfer are solved step by step but the thermally driven liquid water is omitted due to its relatively small value wang et al 2022a with the msfem sequential solver a flexible modeling architecture can be achieved at the cost of a relatively small increase of error 5 therefore the msfem scheme presented in this study is an effective numerical approach to simulating chwt in heterogeneous soils keywords coupled heat and water transfer chwt multiscale finite element method msfem numerical simulation 1 introduction simulation of soil heat and water dynamics is important in agricultural and environmental science especially in arid and semiarid regions where heat transfer and water transfer are coupled and water transfer occurs in both liquid and vapor phases scanlon and milly 1994 zeng et al 2011a b besides the nonlinearity in the coupled heat and water transfer chwt governing models spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic and thermal properties becomes another challenge to numerical simulations especially when the study area is relatively large rienzner and gandolfi 2014 shangguan et al 2014 and when the soil is treated nonuniformly e g local compaction or consolidation in li et al 2021 wang et al 2022b or uneven soil water content and solute distributions in wang et al 2017a wang et al 2021a when the finite element method standard fem hereafter is used relatively fine spatial grids have to be adopted to elucidate the small scale soil variabilities and to accurately predict the spatial distributions of soil water content and temperature refining the spatial grid will tremendously increase the computing load execution time and the quantity of small scale soil water and temperature data which could be unnecessarily detailed for large scale regional soil management practices however using coarse grids may misrepresent soil heterogeneity and reduce the simulation accuracy even for large scale spatial domains therefore a multiscale numerical method that can map small scale soil properties onto coarse grids and perform soil chwt simulations on the coarse grids up to a required accuracy level is needed the multiscale finite element method msfem is a fine to coarse numerical approach efendiev and hou 2009 msfem is based on the multiscale variational method originally reported by babuska and osborn 1983 and then developed by hou and wu 1997 and hou et al 1999 for fluid mechanics in porous media in fine grids a series of localized numerical msfem basis functions are chosen to incorporate the small scale soil features in coarse grids the msfem basis functions rather than polynomial basis functions in standard fem are used to establish a discretized numerical scheme which is also referred to as the global formulation by doing that the small scale soil heterogeneities in the fine grid are first absorbed by the msfem basis functions and then transferred to the global formulation in the coarse grid which is to say fine to coarse basis functions and global formulations are two critical ingredients of msfem from one aspect msfem shares similarities with other multi scale models with respect to those two ingredients such as the upscaling homogenization method variational multiscale approach heterogeneous multiscale method and multiscale enrichment method durlofsky 1991 li et al 2016 arbogast and boyd 2006 e et al 2005 fish and yuan 2007 from another aspect development and applications of msfem especially for soil liquid water transfer rely on modifications and improvements of the basis functions and the global formulations from the perspective of msfem basis functions the boundary values of each basis function relate to the accuracy of the global solution he and ren 2006 applied and tested the oscillatory boundary conditions and the oversampling techniques proposed by hou and wu 1997 to construct basis functions since soil hydraulic conductivity may involve both spatial and temporal variations due to changes in soil water content he and ren 2009 adaptively updated the msfem basis functions during soil water transfer simulations moreover spiridonov et al 2020 applied multiscale methods to construct 2d and 3d basis functions for unstructured fine grids to enable the fem and discrete fracture approach in complex geometries additional endeavors to capture small scale features include multiscale mapping and the limited use of global information efendiev et al 2004 aarnes et al 2008 however related techniques have not been applied in soil water transfer models yet from the perspective of the global formulations galerkin and multiscale finite volume methods have been reported in he and ren 2005 2006 if global information is adopted a mixed fem is usually taken as the global formulation to ensure both local and global conservation of mass or energy in order to implement msfem for nonlinear soil water transfer problems some linearization should be incorporated to the global formulation and a commonly used scheme is the relaxation presented by slodicka 2002 and used in he and ren 2006 other types of multiscale methods exist however they may not belong to msfem in the narrow sense for example chen and ren 2008 proposed a finite difference heterogeneous multiscale method for soil water transfer modeling although the origin of such an algorithm is from the homogenization theory it includes procedures that transfer small scale properties from local representative volumes to the global formulations msfem has been used for unsaturated soil water transfer however it has not been fully developed for chwt problems especially for the thermally driven water fluxes in relatively dry soils despite the two phase water fluxes and the nonlinearity embedded in the governing models one difficulty in applying msfem is that the hydraulic conductivity and the thermal conductivity may not share the same spatial variations e g li et al 2019 although msfem approaches in two phase immiscible or miscible flows have been proposed for reservoir models see section 2 10 in efendiev and hou 2009 juanes and patzek 2010 in those cases the spatial heterogeneities can be simplified and represented by the flow in one phase using auxiliary parameters such as mobility saturation and water oil cut however for chwt problems two spatial variations in hydraulic and thermal conductivity cannot be simplified as they are in the reservoir models and they must be handled separately thus the objectives of this study are to develop a msfem scheme that can account for spatial variations of soil properties in both heat transfer and water transfer apply the msfem scheme to chwt simulations and present illustrative numerical examples 2 a msfem scheme for coupled heat and water transfer model in section 2 1 we review a chwt model i e the philip and de vries 1957 model and include the spatial heterogeneities of soil hydraulic conductivity and soil thermal conductivity into a set of governing equations the spatial variability of soil properties is usually expressed via a random field with a pre specified marginal distribution and spatial correlation functions which is introduced in section 2 2 in section 2 3 we establish a msfem scheme for the chwt model illustrative examples with result comparisons and error analyses among a range of grid sizes are provided in section 2 4 therefore sections 2 1 and 2 2 can be treated as the problem statement and sections 2 3 and 2 4 can be treated as the solution 2 1 review of the coupled water and heat transfer model when soil is relatively dry vapor transfer driven by temperature gradients rather than liquid water or vapor fluxes under water potential gradients becomes the dominant means for soil water flux due to the relatively large temperature gradients and high air filled porosity when vapor transfer governs the soil water redistribution it also contributes to sensible and latent heat fluxes hence in such cases the heat and water transfer in soil is fully coupled and can be expressed by the following philip and de vries

model have been reported for example nassar and horton 1989 1997 included the osmotic potential and provided a coupled heat water and solute transfer model in wettable soils heitman et al 2007 2008 used the philip and de vries 1957 model to investigate thermally driven soil water redistribution zeng et al 2011b included dry air flow and illustrated the impact of gas flow on heat and water exchanges between the atmosphere and shallow soil profiles the derivations of the philip and de vries 1957 model can be found in heitman et al 2008 and wang et al 2017b and detailed discussion on some soil hydraulic or thermal properties e g λ and d tl can be found in lu et al 2014 groenevelt and kay 1974 milly 1982 and wang et al 2022a two constitutive relations are implicitly assumed in eq 1 one is the soil water characteristic curve representing the relationship between h and θ and the other one represents how k h t varies with respect to h and t with the given saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat c m s 1 in this study spatial heterogeneities are assumed for both k sat and λ from the experimental perspective such spatial heterogeneities can be obtained by geospatial investigations for numerical modeling 2d random fields with pre specified marginal distributions and spatial covariances are used to represent the spatial variabilities simunek et al 1992 hereafter we use upper case letters to represent coefficients with spatial randomness and lower case letters to represent deterministic coefficients therefore replacing k h t k sat d tl h t d tl h t is related to k h t see the appendix in wang et al 2022a and λ in eq 1 by k h t k sat d tl h t and λ gives the following governing equations water equation c θ θ h t c θ t t t k h t d mv h t h d tv h t d tl h t t 2

random portions and the deterministic portions can be separated i e 3 k sat x c k sat x k sat λ x c λ x λ where x ω indicates the spatial position in a given soil sample then constructing 2d random fields of k sat and λ can be reduced to creating the two random fields for the coefficients c x s on ω where k sat λ if c x n μ 0 σ 2 with a pre defined spatial covariance the karhunen loeve kl expansion can be employed the intuition of the kl expansion is to separate the randomness and the spatial locations suppose c x are wide sense stationary such that the spatial covariance can be expressed with a kernel that only takes the distance between two positions x 1 x 2 ω i e d i s t x 1 x 2 and a correlation length η c m as inputs 4 e c x 1 c x 2 σ 2 exp d i s t x 1 x 2 η w h e r e k

eigenvalues and the orthonormal eigenfunctions of the covariance kernel in eq 4 ϖ n f n x n n can be determined via a characteristic equation shown in eq 6 which is also known as the homogeneous

x 1 y 1 x 2 x 2 y 2 ω and define the manhattan distance as d i s t x 1 x 2 def x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 the covariance kernel becomes σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 η and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be solved analytically starting with exp x 1 x 2 η assume f x η w cos w x sin w x and we can obtain 0 l exp x 1 x 2 η f x 1 d x 1 2 η f x 2 1 η 2 w 2 η 1 η 2 w 2 exp l x 2 η η 2 w 2 1 sin w l 2 η w cos w

s t x 1 x 2 def x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 2 the covariance kernel becomes σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 η compared to the manhattan distance the euclidean distance is more natural in physical applications however analytically solving the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be challenging hence a semi analytic method via 2d fourier expansion was proposed in li et al 2006 suppose the 2d fourier expansion of the eigen function can be expressed as f n x def i 0 n c i φ i x y for simplicity we use c i and φ i x y to represent the fourier coefficients and the 2d trigonometric bases where φ i x y 0 are orthonormal with respect to i the characteristic equation implies ω σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 η i 0 n c i φ i x 1 y 1 d x 1 d y 1 ϖ n j 0 n c j φ j x 2 y 2 multiply both side by φ k x 2 y 2 k 1 2 n and integrate over ω i 0 n c i σ 2 ω φ k x 2 y 2 ω exp x 1 x 2 η φ i x 1 y 1 d x 1 d y 1 d x 2 d y 2 φ k i ϖ n c k therefore the characteristic equation can be reformulated into a linear system φ c ϖ c where φ φ k i r n n and c c k r n and determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be transformed to computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix φ in soil physics studies k sat and λ hence c x s are usually assumed to follow lognormal distributions therefore the kl expansion should be modified as an iterative method phoon et al 2002 dai et al 2019 such that the marginal distribution at each spatial position follows the desired lognormal distributions the intuition of the iterative method is to use distribution transformations to approach the marginal distribution i e the lognormal distribution in this study and use latin hypercube sampling or similar methods to un correlate the random seeds ξ n n n in the kl expansion see eq 5 the iterative method can be summarized as follows a assume c x l o g n o r m a l μ 1 σ 2 define a shifted lognormal distribution as d x c x 1 such that the expectation and variance of d x are 0 and σ 2 generate m realizations of random numbers i e ξ n m n n m 1 2 m as the initial samples based on the distribution of d x b compute the random fields d p x m with eq 7 where p represents the number of iterations 7 d p x m n n ϖ n ξ n m f n x w h e r e k sat λ m 1 2 m c for a specific position x ω assume the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the marginal distribution of d p x m and the shifted log normal distribution are f d p and f l o g n respectively the random vector d p x m m 1 2 m can be transformed from its empirical distribution to the shifted log normal marginal distribution using eq 8 8 d p x m f l o g n 1 f d p d p x m w h e r e k s λ m 1 2 m x ω then ξ n m can be updated using eq 9 where e m indicates the expectation is taken with respect to the number of realizations m 9 ξ n m 1 ϖ n ω d p x m e m d p x m f n x d x w h e r e m 1 2 m without loss of generality ξ n m n n m 1 2 m has zero mean and unit variance otherwise ξ n m n n m 1 2 m can be simply standardized with respect to m possible correlations of ξ n m n n m 1 2 m with respect to n can be reduced following the method similar to latin hypercube sampling proposed in phoon et al 2005 where the correlations are measured with pearson product moment rather than spearman rank method d redo the computation of eq 7 using the updated ξ n m n n m 1 2 m and repeat eqs 7 9 for p iterations until the marginal distribution of d p x m at x ω approximates the target shifted log normal distribution then c x d p x m 1 is the desired random field although phoon et al 2005 strove to suppress the undesired heavy tails in the simulated marginal distributions in practice they may not be totally removed and need to be truncated at the end of the construction 2 3 construction of the msfem scheme recall the two ingredients of msfem are the basis functions and the global formulations the basis functions are determined in a fine grid to capture the small scale soil properties while the global formulations are established in a coarse grid to solve the governing equations eq 2 to clarify this exposition we first present a discretization of the spatial domain that includes a coarse grid and a fine grid in fig 1 the spatial domain is first discretized into a 4 4 coarse grid c 4 4 and each coarse element is further discretized into a 4 4 fine grid f 4 4 hereafter we use the format c m m f n n to describe the msfem grids in the msfem grids h m i t m i is used to denote the nodal values of the soil water potential and soil temperature for a coarse element m c m m and coarse node i i 1 2 3 4 see the lower diagram in fig 1 h t is used to represent the nodal soil water potential and soil temperature in the fine grid for standard fem only one scale is considered and the grid can be presented as c m m in this study when a grid is expressed in the format c m m f n n msfem will be used as the numerical solver when a grid is expressed in the format c m m the associated numerical method will be the standard fem for a given coarse element m fig 1 the basis functions namely φ m i i 1 2 3 4 can be solved based on the fine grid within the given coarse element in standard fem bilinear functions are usually adopted as the basis functions and we include them into a functional space v 0 φ 0 m i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 in order to represent the spatial variabilities of k sat and λ two groups of msfem basis functions must be obtained by solving the following homogeneous equations k sat φ h m i ζ d tl s a t φ t m i 0 10 a λ φ t m i 0 10 b φ h m i represents the msfem basis functions for soil water potential and φ t m i represents the msfem basis functions for soil temperature which satisfy φ h m i x j φ t m i x j δ ij i j 1 2 3 4 see fig 1 lower diagram d tl s a t is the saturated value of d tl h t with the initial soil temperature equation 10a indicates that φ h m i and φ t m i are correlated and the effects of spatial variations in k sat and λ on the chwt model are not independent we denote two functional spaces for the msfem basis functions as v h φ h m i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 and v t φ t m i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 ζ 0 01 is an empirical scaling factor from a mathematical perspective ζ is used to ensure that φ h m i 0 and φ t m i 0 from a physical perspective ζ exists because a the soil water potential has a scale of 10 3 10 4 c m and changes nonlinearly with respect to soil water content while the soil temperature has a scale of 101 c b based on measurements the liquid water flow under temperature gradient is typically 5 of the liquid water flow under water potential gradient prunty 2009 the values of the msfem basis functions along the boundaries of the coarse element m namely edges i ii iii and iv can reflect the goodness of the basis functions in representing the small scale soil properties and significantly affect the accuracy of the global msfem scheme failing to correctly define the boundary conditions may cause interactions between the soil heterogeneities and the coarse grid size and lead to errors known as scale resonance hou and wu 1997 applying the oscillatory boundary conditions i e a 1d form of eq 10 along the four edges or an oversampling technique can ameliorate the behaviors of the msfem basis functions and he and ren 2006 showed that both methods produce similar improvements in soil water transfer modeling in this study we focus on the oscillatory boundary conditions because they can be easily expressed with analytical solutions and lead to a conforming fem scheme in the global formulation for instance along edge i in coarse element m where x x 0 x 0 l the boundary values of φ h m 1 x and φ t m 1 x satisfy a 1d elliptic equation system degraded from eq 10 i e 11 x k sat x φ h m 1 ζ x d tl s a t x φ t m 1 0 x λ x φ t m 1 0 at the two ending points of edge i x 1 0 0 and x 2 0 l see fig 1 lower diagram φ h m 1 x 1 φ t m 1 x 1 1 and φ h m 1 x 2 φ t m 1 x 2 0 then the solution to eq 11 can be calculated analytically 12 φ h m 1 x 0 1 ζ 0 l 1 λ d s 0 x d tl h t k h t λ d s 1 0 l 1 k h t d s ζ 0 l 1 k h t d s 0 l 1 λ d s 0 l d tl h t k h t λ d s 0 x 1 k h t d s φ t m 1 x 0 1 1 0 l 1 λ d s 0 x 1 λ d s after solving φ h m 1 x and φ t m 1 x along edge i the values of φ h m 2 x and φ t m 2 x along edge i can be obtained via φ h m 2 x 1 φ h m 1 x and φ t m 2 x 1 φ t m 1 x respectively in addition φ h m 3 x φ t m 3 x φ h m 4 x φ t m 4 x 0 along edge i similar to the requirements in standard fem the procedures can be repeated for edges ii iii and iv in practice since h and t hence k sat d tl s a t and λ are discretized in the spatial domain ω the boundary values of the basis function can also be solved numerically based on the choice of the boundary conditions it is easy to show that i 1 2 3 4 φ h m i x i 1 2 3 4 φ t m i x 1 x in the coarse element m the target of the global formulation is to transform the governing equations eq 2 into a discretized scheme and solve the nodal soil water potential and temperature h m t m or equivalently soil water content and temperature θ m t m on the coarse grid c m m see fig 1 upper diagram where the small scale variabilities of soil properties are accounted for by the msfem basis functions since we have two groups of msfem basis functions v h and v t petrov galerkin fem can be used as the global formulation hou et al 2004 reddy 2006 let m c m m i 1 2 3 4 h m i φ h m i and m c m m i 1 2 3 4 t m i φ t m i be the msfem trial solutions for the soil water potential and the soil temperature where h m i and t m i are the nodal values the global formulation derived from eq 2 are shown as follows m c m m i 1 2 3 4 c θ θ h m i t ω φ h m i ψ d ω c θ θ t m i t ω φ t m i ψ d ω m c m m i 1 2 3 4 k d mv h m i ω φ h m i ψ d ω d tv d tl t m i ω φ t m i ψ d ω ω q k ext q k ext ψ d l external water or vapor fluxes as boundary conditions ψ v 0 13 a m c m m i 1 2 3 4 c t θ h m i t ω φ h m i ψ d ω c tt t m i t ω φ t m i ψ d ω m c m m i 1 2 3 4 λ h m i ω φ t m i ψ d ω ω c l p l q l t up t 0 l 0 p l q v

as boundary conditions ψ v 0 13 b on the right hand side of eq 13b t is replaced by the temperature from the upwind direction i e t up for the advective heat fluxes the time domain differentiation can be discretized using an explicit or an implicit euler scheme because the msfem basis functions φ h m i and φ t m i can be pre determined for each coarse element using eqs 10 12 all of the integrals shown in eq 13 can be pre calculated therefore compared to the standard fem the msfem scheme proposed in this study does not requires additional computing loads except for the time spent in initializing the msfem basis functions at the beginning of the simulation after obtaining the solutions on the coarse grid the msfem basis functions can be used to reconstruct the fine grid soil water potential and temperature where the x can take the positions of fine grid nodes 14 h m c m m i 1 2 3 4 h m i φ h m i x t m c m m i 1 2 3 4 t m i φ t m i x however the motivation of the msfem scheme is to use basis functions to absorb the small scale soil variabilities such that soil water potential and temperature can be solved for large scale applications without resolving small scale features hence reconstruction of the fine grid values is not the priority of the msfem scheme in this study 2 4 illustrative example in this section we provide examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the model presented in sections 2 1 to 2 3 applications of msfem on soil liquid water transfer have been reported in multiple studies e g he and ren 2005 2006 therefore in the following examples we focus on applications of the msfem scheme on chwt problems emphasizing on the thermally driven water flux example 2 3 soil water redistribution under temperature gradients consider a ω 0 100 c m 0 100 c m horizontally placed soil sample and the soil physical properties are listed in table 1 the 2d random fields that simulate the spatial variabilities of k sat and λ are lognormally distributed and a covariance kernel based on the manhattan distance see example 2 1 is used with the random variables ξ l o g n o r m a l μ 1 σ 2 10 4 and η 5 c m the lognormal distribution is truncated below the 0 01 fractile and above the 0 99 fractile to prevent extreme values in the random fields i e the tail distributions fig 2 presents the two 2d random fields used in this example namely c k sat and c λ the 2d random fields are positive and relatively uniform with only a few spikes reaching values near 100 the soil sample has an initial water content of 0 2 c m 3 c m 3 and an initial temperature of 25 c the boundary of the soil sample is assumed to be impermeable for liquid water and vapor transfer and two steady boundary temperatures 20 c and 30 c are imposed on the two opposite edges of the soil sample the msfem grid used for this simulation is c 20 20 f 5 5 and a 10 day simulation of soil water and temperature redistribution is performed the soil water content and temperature on both coarse and fine grids at the 10th day in the simulation are presented in fig 3 the soil water content near the low temperature edge y 0 c m reaches the highest value while near the high temperature edge y 100 c m the soil water content is relatively low that is because water near the high temperature edge tends to vaporize transfer under the temperature gradient and condense near the low temperature edge which is known as thermally driven soil water flux however due to the heterogeneities in soil hydraulic conductivity local fluctuations occur in the soil water content distribution for fig 3a and c the reconstructed soil water content in the fine grid is smoother than the soil water content distribution in the coarse grid some local maxima values in fig 3c are presented as spikes with relatively narrow spatial expansions that is reasonable since the local maxima in k sat and λ are also spikes shown in fig 2 for fig 3b and d the soil temperature distribution in the coarse grid changes almost linearly from the high temperature edge to the low temperature edge and some small variations presented by the contours can only be observed when the fine grid temperature solution is reconstructed in fig 3d example 2 4 scale selection and error analyses for a given soil sample if self similarity is assumed or soil properties are represented with fractal methods e g shen et al 2019 jin et al 2017 the characteristic scales of soil hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity may disappear therefore in soil modeling the choice of the coarse grid and the fine grid can be arbitrary and may even depend on the scales where measurements are performed rather than the characteristic scales of the soil properties moreover the small scale features in k sat and λ only contain their local information and intermediate structures such as pore connectivity and tortuosity may not be fully reflected based on the local variabilities of k sat and λ therefore with the selected coarse and fine scales some characteristics belonging to the intermediate scale can be missed thus rather than saying the usage of the msfem basis functions is to capture the small scale soil variabilities it is more appropriate to claim the msfem basis functions are for computing the effective soil hydraulic and thermal properties choosing a different spatial grid may exert effects on the chwt simulation results therefore in this example we redo the simulation in example 2 3 using msfem with three grids c 25 25 f 4 4 c 20 20 f 5 5 c 10 10 f 10 10 as well as using the standard fem with grids c 25 25 c 20 20 and c 10 10 to demonstrate the efficacy of the msfem scheme in upscaling the small scale features simulation results from the msfem scheme and the standard fem scheme are compared for reference the soil water content and temperature on the underlying grid c 100 100 are simulated with the standard fem scheme the differences are expressed in two ways a the root mean squared error rmse of simulation results is calculated with the nodal values on the coarse grid and b the rmse of sub grid capturing efendiev and hou 2009 is calculated on the underlying fine grid related to the reference soil water content and temperature values solved on c 100 100 errors exist because we apply a discretized scheme to approximate the continuous governing equations for the numerical scheme design demarcating the error magnitudes and studying how the errors change with respect to time are the critical issues a desirable numerical scheme should have a relatively small error and a relatively small error growth rate with respect to time the evolution of errors with respect to time is presented in fig 4 based on the msfem results the simulation errors and the sub grid capturing errors for soil water content are of the order 10 3 and the errors for soil temperature are of the order 10 1 considering the initial water content 0 2 c m 3 c m 3 and the initial temperature of 25 c the levels of relative errors of soil water content and soil temperature fall into the range of 10 3 10 2 which are similar to the literature results e g he and ren 2006 for soil water content the msfem scheme can increase the accuracy by as much as 30 compared to the standard fem scheme and the largest improvement of accuracy occurs on the c 10 10 coarse grid see fig 4a that indicates the msfem basis functions can provide better representations of the effective soil hydraulic and thermal properties than the bilinear basis functions used in the standard fem when the mesh size of the coarse grid is relatively big for soil temperature the advantage of using the msfem scheme is not profound two possible reasons are a the boundary conditions enforce a strong trend of soil temperature distribution b more importantly the magnitude of variations in λ with respect to soil water content and temperature is smaller than that for k i e k is more sensitive to the changes in soil water potential and temperature than λ therefore both the msfem and the standard fem simulated temperature stably approach the steady state values at the end of the simulation and the error values become constant with respect to time however we can still observe some benefits of msfem at the early stage of the simulation where the errors in the msfem results decrease faster than the errors produced by the standard fem scheme see fig 4b d and the small figure in fig 4d recall that in this study the msfem basis functions are pre calculated so there is only a limited or negligible increase in the computing load to achieve the accuracy promotion via the msfem scheme 3 partially coupled heat and water transfer and the msfem sequential solver implementation of msfem for chwt simulations has been described in section 2 however for numerical applications the heat and water transfer in soil is not always expressed as a fully coupled version but rather as a partially coupled version for example in hydrus the two equations in eq 1 or equivalently in eq 2 are solved one by one within a given time step saito et al 2006 zheng et al 2021 in 2dsoil eq 1 is decoupled into three steps which are liquid water transfer heat transfer and vapor flux wang et al 2022a solving water and heat transfer one by one in a discrete time step provides two advantages a to avoid solving high dimensional linear systems generated from the numerical schemes b to enable a design that assigns liquid water heat and vapor transfers into three separate modules which provides flexible programming architectures and adaptable controls for relatively complex soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat simulators e g timlin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c wang et al 2022a in this section a partially coupled version of chwt model used in 2dsoil is considered as an example and the msfem scheme proposed in section 2 is generalized as a solver that can sequentially compute soil water content and soil temperature 3 1 the partially coupled version of heat and water transfer model let eq 2 be the starting point the partially coupled version of soil heat and water transfer in wang et al 2022a is to rewrite eq 2 into the equations of the following three separate steps step i l i q u i d w a t e r t r a n s f e r c w h t k h t h 15 a s t e p i i h e a t t r a n s f e r c h t t λ t c l ρ l q l t t 0 15 b s t e p i i i v a p o r t r a n s f e r c θ θ h t c θ t t t d mv h t h d tv h t t 15 c c t θ h t c tt t t l 0 ρ l q v c v ρ l q v t t 0 15 d in eq 15 c w c m 1 represent the soil water capacity and c h j c m 3 k 1 is the soil volumetric heat capacity for each discrete time step the three steps are processed one by one when solving liquid water transfer step i eq 15a soil temperature is assumed to be unchanged with respect to time when soil temperature is computed step ii eq 15b soil water content is supposed to be steady and the liquid water flux q l can be determined from eq 15a finally in eqs 15c d both soil water potential and temperature are updated again based on the vapor flux as well as the sensible and latent heat carried by the vapor flux the thermally driven liquid water flow d tl h t is omitted in eq 15 because a d tl h t is not included in the initial version of 2dsoil timlin et al 1996 and b the liquid water flow under temperature gradient contributes 5 of the total liquid water flow prunty 2009 wang et al 2022a and it is often negligible in chwt problems as reported by lu et al 2020 solving steps i iii in eq 15 one by one in each discrete time step should provide results similar to the coupled version in eq 2 compared to the fully coupled version eq 2 the interaction between water transfer and heat transfer is weakened in the partially coupled version and it is only explicitly shown in the vapor transfer step eqs 15c d however interaction between water transfer and heat transfer can be included recursively through multiple time steps a comprehensive comparison between the fully coupled version eq 1 and the partially coupled version eq 15 of soil heat and water transfer is shown in wang et al 2022a 3 2 establishment of a msfem sequential solver for the partially coupled heat and water transfer the msfem basis functions for soil water potential and soil temperature can be computed individually following the leading differential terms in eqs 15a b respectively therefore for a given coarse element m fig 1 eq 10 can be converted as follows 16 k sat φ h m i 0 λ φ t m i 0 i 1 2 3 4 and the oscillatory boundary conditions for the msfem basis function along edge i in coarse element m see fig 1 lower diagram and eq 11 can also be simplified as 17 x k sat x φ h m 1 0 x λ x φ t m 1 0 apparently the connections between the two groups of basis functions v h and v t are neglected due to the elimination of d tl h t however the correlation between v h and v t always exists due to the interactions between soil water potential and soil temperature the petrov galerkin global formulation derived from eq 15 can be given as follows step i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 c w h m i t ω φ h m i ψ d ω m

the msfem sequential solver presented in section 3 2 we redo the simulation in example 2 3 using three methods the msfem scheme with c 20 20 f 5 5 grid the msfem sequential solver with c 20 20 f 5 5 grid and the standard fem with c 20 20 grid then the solution error and the sub grid capturing error of the three methods are computed relative to the standard fem solution on the underlying grid c 100 100 the evolution of errors with respect to time are presented in fig 5 due to the elimination of thermally driven liquid water flow and the decreasing of soil water and temperature interaction the errors produced by msfem sequential solver slightly increase about 5 compared to the msfem scheme however the msfem scheme and the msfem sequential solver still outperform the standard fem for both the soil water content and temperature solved on the coarse grid and the reconstructed values on the fine grid 4 summary and future topics the application of a multiscale finite element method msfem on coupled heat and water transfer chwt problems is investigated in this study two groups of msfem basis functions are constructed to absorb the local variabilities of soil hydraulic and thermal conductivity and a global formulation based on petrov galerkin finite element method fem is adopted to implement the proposed msfem scheme because partially coupled versions of heat and water transfer are used in existing soil simulators such as hydrus saito et al 2006 zheng et al 2021 and 2dsoil timlin et al 1996 wang et al 2021c the msfem scheme proposed in this study is exploited as a sequential solver to handle such variations since the msfem basis functions in this study can be determined in advance using the msfem scheme does not essentially increase the computing load and the illustration examples indicate that the msfem scheme can reduce the simulation errors by up to 30 compared to the standard fem especially for the soil water content therefore the msfem approach proposed in this study provides an effective numerical method for chwt simulations in soils spatial heterogeneities are only assumed in soil hydraulic and thermal conductivity in this study similar spatial variabilities may also occur for vapor transfer coefficients such as d mv or d tv unfortunately related soil studies are relatively rare however if those studies exist the msfem scheme proposed in this study can be generalized by simply revising the construction of the msfem basis functions eq 10 or 16 furthermore the msfem basis functions are pre calculated in this study and not changed during time evolution thus research on the adaptive updates of the basis functions can be a future development of the msfem scheme proposed in this study e g chung et al 2015 chung et al 2016 which can be fulfilled either with the conventional partial differential equation solvers or with learning based approaches credit authorship contribution statement chenyi luo writing original draft yuanyuan shi

3062,large scale modeling of coupled heat and water transfer chwt is challenging due to the spatial variabilities of soil hydraulic and thermal properties a multi scale finite element method msfem has been designed for simulating liquid water fluxes in unsaturated soils in this study the msfem approach is expanded as a new scheme that can handle chwt in soils two groups of msfem basis functions are constructed to incorporate the heterogeneities in soil hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity and a petrov galerkin formulation is adopted to implement the proposed msfem scheme the msfem scheme is also exploited as a sequential solver when heat transfer and water transfer are expressed in a partially coupled formulation wang et al 2022a numerical examples illustrate that without essentially increasing the computing load the msfem scheme can improve the accuracy by up to 30 compared to the standard finite element method fem especially for thermally driven water transfer some fine scale spatial variations in soil temperature can only be revealed with the msfem scheme if the msfem sequential solver is applied the coupled heat and water transfer model can be rewritten into a sequence of modules where liquid water transfer heat transfer and vapor transfer are solved step by step but the thermally driven liquid water is omitted due to its relatively small value wang et al 2022a with the msfem sequential solver a flexible modeling architecture can be achieved at the cost of a relatively small increase of error 5 therefore the msfem scheme presented in this study is an effective numerical approach to simulating chwt in heterogeneous soils keywords coupled heat and water transfer chwt multiscale finite element method msfem numerical simulation 1 introduction simulation of soil heat and water dynamics is important in agricultural and environmental science especially in arid and semiarid regions where heat transfer and water transfer are coupled and water transfer occurs in both liquid and vapor phases scanlon and milly 1994 zeng et al 2011a b besides the nonlinearity in the coupled heat and water transfer chwt governing models spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic and thermal properties becomes another challenge to numerical simulations especially when the study area is relatively large rienzner and gandolfi 2014 shangguan et al 2014 and when the soil is treated nonuniformly e g local compaction or consolidation in li et al 2021 wang et al 2022b or uneven soil water content and solute distributions in wang et al 2017a wang et al 2021a when the finite element method standard fem hereafter is used relatively fine spatial grids have to be adopted to elucidate the small scale soil variabilities and to accurately predict the spatial distributions of soil water content and temperature refining the spatial grid will tremendously increase the computing load execution time and the quantity of small scale soil water and temperature data which could be unnecessarily detailed for large scale regional soil management practices however using coarse grids may misrepresent soil heterogeneity and reduce the simulation accuracy even for large scale spatial domains therefore a multiscale numerical method that can map small scale soil properties onto coarse grids and perform soil chwt simulations on the coarse grids up to a required accuracy level is needed the multiscale finite element method msfem is a fine to coarse numerical approach efendiev and hou 2009 msfem is based on the multiscale variational method originally reported by babuska and osborn 1983 and then developed by hou and wu 1997 and hou et al 1999 for fluid mechanics in porous media in fine grids a series of localized numerical msfem basis functions are chosen to incorporate the small scale soil features in coarse grids the msfem basis functions rather than polynomial basis functions in standard fem are used to establish a discretized numerical scheme which is also referred to as the global formulation by doing that the small scale soil heterogeneities in the fine grid are first absorbed by the msfem basis functions and then transferred to the global formulation in the coarse grid which is to say fine to coarse basis functions and global formulations are two critical ingredients of msfem from one aspect msfem shares similarities with other multi scale models with respect to those two ingredients such as the upscaling homogenization method variational multiscale approach heterogeneous multiscale method and multiscale enrichment method durlofsky 1991 li et al 2016 arbogast and boyd 2006 e et al 2005 fish and yuan 2007 from another aspect development and applications of msfem especially for soil liquid water transfer rely on modifications and improvements of the basis functions and the global formulations from the perspective of msfem basis functions the boundary values of each basis function relate to the accuracy of the global solution he and ren 2006 applied and tested the oscillatory boundary conditions and the oversampling techniques proposed by hou and wu 1997 to construct basis functions since soil hydraulic conductivity may involve both spatial and temporal variations due to changes in soil water content he and ren 2009 adaptively updated the msfem basis functions during soil water transfer simulations moreover spiridonov et al 2020 applied multiscale methods to construct 2d and 3d basis functions for unstructured fine grids to enable the fem and discrete fracture approach in complex geometries additional endeavors to capture small scale features include multiscale mapping and the limited use of global information efendiev et al 2004 aarnes et al 2008 however related techniques have not been applied in soil water transfer models yet from the perspective of the global formulations galerkin and multiscale finite volume methods have been reported in he and ren 2005 2006 if global information is adopted a mixed fem is usually taken as the global formulation to ensure both local and global conservation of mass or energy in order to implement msfem for nonlinear soil water transfer problems some linearization should be incorporated to the global formulation and a commonly used scheme is the relaxation presented by slodicka 2002 and used in he and ren 2006 other types of multiscale methods exist however they may not belong to msfem in the narrow sense for example chen and ren 2008 proposed a finite difference heterogeneous multiscale method for soil water transfer modeling although the origin of such an algorithm is from the homogenization theory it includes procedures that transfer small scale properties from local representative volumes to the global formulations msfem has been used for unsaturated soil water transfer however it has not been fully developed for chwt problems especially for the thermally driven water fluxes in relatively dry soils despite the two phase water fluxes and the nonlinearity embedded in the governing models one difficulty in applying msfem is that the hydraulic conductivity and the thermal conductivity may not share the same spatial variations e g li et al 2019 although msfem approaches in two phase immiscible or miscible flows have been proposed for reservoir models see section 2 10 in efendiev and hou 2009 juanes and patzek 2010 in those cases the spatial heterogeneities can be simplified and represented by the flow in one phase using auxiliary parameters such as mobility saturation and water oil cut however for chwt problems two spatial variations in hydraulic and thermal conductivity cannot be simplified as they are in the reservoir models and they must be handled separately thus the objectives of this study are to develop a msfem scheme that can account for spatial variations of soil properties in both heat transfer and water transfer apply the msfem scheme to chwt simulations and present illustrative numerical examples 2 a msfem scheme for coupled heat and water transfer model in section 2 1 we review a chwt model i e the philip and de vries 1957 model and include the spatial heterogeneities of soil hydraulic conductivity and soil thermal conductivity into a set of governing equations the spatial variability of soil properties is usually expressed via a random field with a pre specified marginal distribution and spatial correlation functions which is introduced in section 2 2 in section 2 3 we establish a msfem scheme for the chwt model illustrative examples with result comparisons and error analyses among a range of grid sizes are provided in section 2 4 therefore sections 2 1 and 2 2 can be treated as the problem statement and sections 2 3 and 2 4 can be treated as the solution 2 1 review of the coupled water and heat transfer model when soil is relatively dry vapor transfer driven by temperature gradients rather than liquid water or vapor fluxes under water potential gradients becomes the dominant means for soil water flux due to the relatively large temperature gradients and high air filled porosity when vapor transfer governs the soil water redistribution it also contributes to sensible and latent heat fluxes hence in such cases the heat and water transfer in soil is fully coupled and can be expressed by the following philip and de vries 1957 model water e q u a t i o n c θ θ h t c θ t t t d mv h t h d tv h t t q v h t k h t h d tl h t t q l h t 1 a heat e q u a t i o n c t θ h t c tt t t λ t c l ρ l q l t t 0 l 0 ρ l q v c v ρ l q v

m 3 equivalently and soil temperature t k indicates the differential operator in a spatial domain ω in eq 1a d mv h t c m s 1 and d tv h t c m 2 s 1 k 1 represent vapor diffusivities under the water potential gradient and temperature gradient respectively hence q v c m s 1 is the net vapor flux similarly k h t c m s 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and d tl h t c m 2 s 1 k 1 is the coefficient for thermally driven liquid water diffusion hence q l h t represents the net liquid water flux in eq 1b λ w c m 1 k 1 is the soil thermal conductivity l 0 j g 1 is the heat of vaporization of water at a pre specified reference temperature t 0 k c l 4 187 j g 1 k 1 and c v 1 864 j g 1 k 1 are the specific heats of liquid water and vapor ρ l 1 0 g c m 3 is density of liquid water thus c l ρ l q l t t 0 and l 0 ρ l q v c v ρ l q v t t 0 represent the sensible heat fluxes carried by liquid water and the latent and sensible heat fluxes carried by vapor relative to the internal energy of liquid water at t 0 following that q h h t becomes the net soil heat flux the philip and de vries 1957 model is widely used in chwt simulations and multiple improvements and validations of such a model have been reported for example nassar and horton 1989 1997 included the osmotic potential and provided a coupled heat water and solute transfer model in wettable soils heitman et al 2007 2008 used the philip and de vries 1957 model to investigate thermally driven soil water redistribution zeng et al 2011b included dry air flow and illustrated the impact of gas flow on heat and water exchanges between the atmosphere and shallow soil profiles the derivations of the philip and de vries 1957 model can be found in heitman et al 2008 and wang et al 2017b and detailed discussion on some soil hydraulic or thermal properties e g λ and d tl can be found in lu et al 2014 groenevelt and kay 1974 milly 1982 and wang et al 2022a two constitutive relations are implicitly assumed in eq 1 one is the soil water characteristic curve representing the relationship between h and θ and the other one represents how k h t varies with respect to h and t with the given saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat c m s 1 in this study spatial heterogeneities are assumed for both k sat and λ from the experimental perspective such spatial heterogeneities can be obtained by geospatial investigations for numerical modeling 2d random fields with pre specified marginal distributions and spatial covariances are used to represent the spatial variabilities simunek et al 1992 hereafter we use upper case letters to represent coefficients with spatial randomness and lower case letters to represent deterministic coefficients therefore replacing k h t k sat d tl h t d tl h t is related to k h t see the appendix in wang et al 2022a and λ in eq 1 by k h t k sat d tl h t and λ gives the following governing equations water equation c θ θ h t c θ t t t k h t d mv h t h d tv h t d tl h t t 2

random portions and the deterministic portions can be separated i e 3 k sat x c k sat x k sat λ x c λ x λ where x ω indicates the spatial position in a given soil sample then constructing 2d random fields of k sat and λ can be reduced to creating the two random fields for the coefficients c x s on ω where k sat λ if c x n μ 0 σ 2 with a pre defined spatial covariance the karhunen loeve kl expansion can be employed the intuition of the kl expansion is to separate the randomness and the spatial locations suppose c x are wide sense stationary such that the spatial covariance can be expressed with a kernel that only takes the distance between two positions x 1 x 2 ω i e d i s t x 1 x 2 and a correlation length η c m as inputs 4 e c x 1 c x 2 σ 2 exp d i s t x 1 x 2 η w h e r e k sat λ then c x can be expanded by a group of uncorrelated random variables ξ n n n and a group of spatial deterministic functions f n x 5 c x n n ϖ n ξ n f n x w h e r e k sat λ ϖ n f n x n n are the eigenvalues and the orthonormal eigenfunctions of the covariance kernel in eq 4 ϖ n f n x n n can be determined via a characteristic equation shown in eq 6 which is also known as the homogeneous fredholm integral equation of the second kind 6 ϖ n f n x n ℕ ω σ 2 exp dist x 1 x 2 η f n x 1 d x 1 ϖ n f n x 2 characteristic equation and ω f i x f j x d x δ ij ξ n n ℕ ξ n n μ 0 σ 2 1 and e ξ m ξ n 0 m n where δ ij is the kronecker symbol solving eq 6 is the critical step in implementing the kl expansion and we provide two illustrative examples example 2 1 manhattan distance let ω 0 l 0 l x 1 x 1 y 1 x 2 x 2 y 2 ω and define the manhattan distance as d i s t x 1 x 2 def x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 the covariance kernel becomes σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 η and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be solved analytically starting with exp x 1 x 2 η assume f x η w cos w x sin w x and we can obtain 0 l exp x 1 x 2 η f x 1 d x 1 2 η f x 2 1 η 2 w 2 η 1 η 2 w 2 exp l x 2 η η 2 w 2 1 sin w l 2 η w cos w

n are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of exp x 1 x 2 η and exp y 1 y 2 η respectively example 2 2 euclidean distance let ω 0 l 0 l x 1 x 1 y 1 x 2 x 2 y 2 ω and define the euclidean distance as d i s t x 1 x 2 def x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 2 the covariance kernel becomes σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 η compared to the manhattan distance the euclidean distance is more natural in physical applications however analytically solving the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be challenging hence a semi analytic method via 2d fourier expansion was proposed in li et al 2006 suppose the 2d fourier expansion of the eigen function can be expressed as f n x def i 0 n c i φ i x y for simplicity we use c i and φ i x y to represent the fourier coefficients and the 2d trigonometric bases where φ i x y 0 are orthonormal with respect to i the characteristic equation implies ω σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 η i 0 n c i φ i x 1 y 1 d x 1 d y 1 ϖ n j 0 n c j φ j x 2 y 2 multiply both side by φ k x 2 y 2 k 1 2 n and integrate over ω i 0 n c i σ 2 ω φ k x 2 y 2 ω exp x 1 x 2 η φ i x 1 y 1 d x 1 d y 1 d x 2 d y 2 φ k i ϖ n c k therefore the characteristic equation can be reformulated into a linear system φ c ϖ c where φ φ k i r n n and c c k r n and determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be transformed to computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix φ in soil physics studies k sat and λ hence c x s are usually assumed to follow lognormal distributions therefore the kl expansion should be modified as an iterative method phoon et al 2002 dai et al 2019 such that the marginal distribution at each spatial position follows the desired lognormal distributions the intuition of the iterative method is to use distribution transformations to approach the marginal distribution i e the lognormal distribution in this study and use latin hypercube sampling or similar methods to un correlate the random seeds ξ n n n in the kl expansion see eq 5 the iterative method can be summarized as follows a assume c x l o g n o r m a l μ 1 σ 2 define a shifted lognormal distribution as d x c x 1 such that the expectation and variance of d x are 0 and σ 2 generate m realizations of random numbers i e ξ n m n n m 1 2 m as the initial samples based on the distribution of d x b compute the random fields d p x m with eq 7 where p represents the number of iterations 7 d p x m n n ϖ n ξ n m f n x w h e r e k sat λ m 1 2 m c for a specific position x ω assume the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the marginal distribution of d p x m and the shifted log normal distribution are f d p and f l o g n respectively the random vector d p x m m 1 2 m can be transformed from its empirical distribution to the shifted log normal marginal distribution using eq 8 8 d p x m f l o g n 1 f d p d p x m w h e r e k s λ m 1 2 m x ω then ξ n m can be updated using eq 9 where e m indicates the expectation is taken with respect to the number of realizations m 9 ξ n m 1 ϖ n ω d p x m e m d p x m f n x d x w h e r e m 1 2 m without loss of generality ξ n m n n m 1 2 m has zero mean and unit variance otherwise ξ n m n n m 1 2 m can be simply standardized with respect to m possible correlations of ξ n m n n m 1 2 m with respect to n can be reduced following the method similar to latin hypercube sampling proposed in phoon et al 2005 where the correlations are measured with pearson product moment rather than spearman rank method d redo the computation of eq 7 using the updated ξ n m n n m 1 2 m and repeat eqs 7 9 for p iterations until the marginal distribution of d p x m at x ω approximates the target shifted log normal distribution then c x d p x m 1 is the desired random field although phoon et al 2005 strove to suppress the undesired heavy tails in the simulated marginal distributions in practice they may not be totally removed and need to be truncated at the end of the construction 2 3 construction of the msfem scheme recall the two ingredients of msfem are the basis functions and the global formulations the basis functions are determined in a fine grid to capture the small scale soil properties while the global formulations are established in a coarse grid to solve the governing equations eq 2 to clarify this exposition we first present a discretization of the spatial domain that includes a coarse grid and a fine grid in fig 1 the spatial domain is first discretized into a 4 4 coarse grid c 4 4 and each coarse element is further discretized into a 4 4 fine grid f 4 4 hereafter we use the format c m m f n n to describe the msfem grids in the msfem grids h m i t m i is used to denote the nodal values of the soil water potential and soil temperature for a coarse element m c m m and coarse node i i 1 2 3 4 see the lower diagram in fig 1 h t is used to represent the nodal soil water potential and soil temperature in the fine grid for standard fem only one scale is considered and the grid can be presented as c m m in this study when a grid is expressed in the format c m m f n n msfem will be used as the numerical solver when a grid is expressed in the format c m m the associated numerical method will be the standard fem for a given coarse element m fig 1 the basis functions namely φ m i i 1 2 3 4 can be solved based on the fine grid within the given coarse element in standard fem bilinear functions are usually adopted as the basis functions and we include them into a functional space v 0 φ 0 m i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 in order to represent the spatial variabilities of k sat and λ two groups of msfem basis functions must be obtained by solving the following homogeneous equations k sat φ h m i ζ d tl s a t φ t m i 0 10 a λ φ t m i 0 10 b φ h m i represents the msfem basis functions for soil water potential and φ t m i represents the msfem basis functions for soil temperature which satisfy φ h m i x j φ t m i x j δ ij i j 1 2 3 4 see fig 1 lower diagram d tl s a t is the saturated value of d tl h t with the initial soil temperature equation 10a indicates that φ h m i and φ t m i are correlated and the effects of spatial variations in k sat and λ on the chwt model are not independent we denote two functional spaces for the msfem basis functions as v h φ h m i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 and v t φ t m i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 ζ 0 01 is an empirical scaling factor from a mathematical perspective ζ is used to ensure that φ h m i 0 and φ t m i 0 from a physical perspective ζ exists because a the soil water potential has a scale of 10 3 10 4 c m and changes nonlinearly with respect to soil water content while the soil temperature has a scale of 101 c b based on measurements the liquid water flow under temperature gradient is typically 5 of the liquid water flow under water potential gradient prunty 2009 the values of the msfem basis functions along the boundaries of the coarse element m namely edges i ii iii and iv can reflect the goodness of the basis functions in representing the small scale soil properties and significantly affect the accuracy of the global msfem scheme failing to correctly define the boundary conditions may cause interactions between the soil heterogeneities and the coarse grid size and lead to errors known as scale resonance hou and wu 1997 applying the oscillatory boundary conditions i e a 1d form of eq 10 along the four edges or an oversampling technique can ameliorate the behaviors of the msfem basis functions and he and ren 2006 showed that both methods produce similar improvements in soil water transfer modeling in this study we focus on the oscillatory boundary conditions because they can be easily expressed with analytical solutions and lead to a conforming fem scheme in the global formulation for instance along edge i in coarse element m where x x 0 x 0 l the boundary values of φ h m 1 x and φ t m 1 x satisfy a 1d elliptic equation system degraded from eq 10 i e 11 x k sat x φ h m 1 ζ x d tl s a t x φ t m 1 0 x λ x φ t m 1 0 at the two ending points of edge i x 1 0 0 and x 2 0 l see fig 1 lower diagram φ h m 1 x 1 φ t m 1 x 1 1 and φ h m 1 x 2 φ t m 1 x 2 0 then the solution to eq 11 can be calculated analytically 12 φ h m 1 x 0 1 ζ 0 l 1 λ d s 0 x

the values of φ h m 2 x and φ t m 2 x along edge i can be obtained via φ h m 2 x 1 φ h m 1 x and φ t m 2 x 1 φ t m 1 x respectively in addition φ h m 3 x φ t m 3 x φ h m 4 x φ t m 4 x 0 along edge i similar to the requirements in standard fem the procedures can be repeated for edges ii iii and iv in practice since h and t hence k sat d tl s a t and λ are discretized in the spatial domain ω the boundary values of the basis function can also be solved numerically based on the choice of the boundary conditions it is easy to show that i 1 2 3 4 φ h m i x i 1 2 3 4 φ t m i x 1 x in the coarse element m the target of the global formulation is to transform the governing equations eq 2 into a discretized scheme and solve the nodal soil water potential and temperature h m t m or equivalently soil water content and temperature θ m t m on the coarse grid c m m see fig 1 upper diagram where the small scale variabilities of soil properties are accounted for by the msfem basis functions since we have two groups of msfem basis functions v h and v t petrov galerkin fem can be used as the global formulation hou et al 2004 reddy 2006 let m c m m i 1 2 3 4 h m i φ h m i and m c m m i 1 2 3 4 t m i φ t m i be the msfem trial solutions for the soil water potential and the soil temperature where h m i and t m i are the nodal values the global formulation derived from eq 2 are shown as follows m c m m i 1 2 3 4 c θ θ h m i t ω φ h m i ψ d ω c θ θ t m i t ω φ t m i ψ d ω m c m m i 1 2 3 4 k d mv h m i ω φ h m i ψ d ω d tv d tl t m i ω φ t m i ψ d ω ω q k ext q k ext ψ d l external water or vapor fluxes as boundary conditions ψ v 0 13 a m c m m i 1 2 3 4 c t θ h m i t ω φ h m i ψ d ω c tt t m i t ω φ t m i ψ d ω m c m m i 1 2 3 4 λ h m i ω φ t m i ψ d ω ω c l p l q l t up t 0 l 0 p l q v

as boundary conditions ψ v 0 13 b on the right hand side of eq 13b t is replaced by the temperature from the upwind direction i e t up for the advective heat fluxes the time domain differentiation can be discretized using an explicit or an implicit euler scheme because the msfem basis functions φ h m i and φ t m i can be pre determined for each coarse element using eqs 10 12 all of the integrals shown in eq 13 can be pre calculated therefore compared to the standard fem the msfem scheme proposed in this study does not requires additional computing loads except for the time spent in initializing the msfem basis functions at the beginning of the simulation after obtaining the solutions on the coarse grid the msfem basis functions can be used to reconstruct the fine grid soil water potential and temperature where the x can take the positions of fine grid nodes 14 h m c m m i 1 2 3 4 h m i φ h m i x t m c m m i 1 2 3 4 t m i φ t m i x however the motivation of the msfem scheme is to use basis functions to absorb the small scale soil variabilities such that soil water potential and temperature can be solved for large scale applications without resolving small scale features hence reconstruction of the fine grid values is not the priority of the msfem scheme in this study 2 4 illustrative example in this section we provide examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the model presented in sections 2 1 to 2 3 applications of msfem on soil liquid water transfer have been reported in multiple studies e g he and ren 2005 2006 therefore in the following examples we focus on applications of the msfem scheme on chwt problems emphasizing on the thermally driven water flux example 2 3 soil water redistribution under temperature gradients consider a ω 0 100 c m 0 100 c m horizontally placed soil sample and the soil physical properties are listed in table 1 the 2d random fields that simulate the spatial variabilities of k sat and λ are lognormally distributed and a covariance kernel based on the manhattan distance see example 2 1 is used with the random variables ξ l o g n o r m a l μ 1 σ 2 10 4 and η 5 c m the lognormal distribution is truncated below the 0 01 fractile and above the 0 99 fractile to prevent extreme values in the random fields i e the tail distributions fig 2 presents the two 2d random fields used in this example namely c k sat and c λ the 2d random fields are positive and relatively uniform with only a few spikes reaching values near 100 the soil sample has an initial water content of 0 2 c m 3 c m 3 and an initial temperature of 25 c the boundary of the soil sample is assumed to be impermeable for liquid water and vapor transfer and two steady boundary temperatures 20 c and 30 c are imposed on the two opposite edges of the soil sample the msfem grid used for this simulation is c 20 20 f 5 5 and a 10 day simulation of soil water and temperature redistribution is performed the soil water content and temperature on both coarse and fine grids at the 10th day in the simulation are presented in fig 3 the soil water content near the low temperature edge y 0 c m reaches the highest value while near the high temperature edge y 100 c m the soil water content is relatively low that is because water near the high temperature edge tends to vaporize transfer under the temperature gradient and condense near the low temperature edge which is known as thermally driven soil water flux however due to the heterogeneities in soil hydraulic conductivity local fluctuations occur in the soil water content distribution for fig 3a and c the reconstructed soil water content in the fine grid is smoother than the soil water content distribution in the coarse grid some local maxima values in fig 3c are presented as spikes with relatively narrow spatial expansions that is reasonable since the local maxima in k sat and λ are also spikes shown in fig 2 for fig 3b and d the soil temperature distribution in the coarse grid changes almost linearly from the high temperature edge to the low temperature edge and some small variations presented by the contours can only be observed when the fine grid temperature solution is reconstructed in fig 3d example 2 4 scale selection and error analyses for a given soil sample if self similarity is assumed or soil properties are represented with fractal methods e g shen et al 2019 jin et al 2017 the characteristic scales of soil hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity may disappear therefore in soil modeling the choice of the coarse grid and the fine grid can be arbitrary and may even depend on the scales where measurements are performed rather than the characteristic scales of the soil properties moreover the small scale features in k sat and λ only contain their local information and intermediate structures such as pore connectivity and tortuosity may not be fully reflected based on the local variabilities of k sat and λ therefore with the selected coarse and fine scales some characteristics belonging to the intermediate scale can be missed thus rather than saying the usage of the msfem basis functions is to capture the small scale soil variabilities it is more appropriate to claim the msfem basis functions are for computing the effective soil hydraulic and thermal properties choosing a different spatial grid may exert effects on the chwt simulation results therefore in this example we redo the simulation in example 2 3 using msfem with three grids c 25 25 f 4 4 c 20 20 f 5 5 c 10 10 f 10 10 as well as using the standard fem with grids c 25 25 c 20 20 and c 10 10 to demonstrate the efficacy of the msfem scheme in upscaling the small scale features simulation results from the msfem scheme and the standard fem scheme are compared for reference the soil water content and temperature on the underlying grid c 100 100 are simulated with the standard fem scheme the differences are expressed in two ways a the root mean squared error rmse of simulation results is calculated with the nodal values on the coarse grid and b the rmse of sub grid capturing efendiev and hou 2009 is calculated on the underlying fine grid related to the reference soil water content and temperature values solved on c 100 100 errors exist because we apply a discretized scheme to approximate the continuous governing equations for the numerical scheme design demarcating the error magnitudes and studying how the errors change with respect to time are the critical issues a desirable numerical scheme should have a relatively small error and a relatively small error growth rate with respect to time the evolution of errors with respect to time is presented in fig 4 based on the msfem results the simulation errors and the sub grid capturing errors for soil water content are of the order 10 3 and the errors for soil temperature are of the order 10 1 considering the initial water content 0 2 c m 3 c m 3 and the initial temperature of 25 c the levels of relative errors of soil water content and soil temperature fall into the range of 10 3 10 2 which are similar to the literature results e g he and ren 2006 for soil water content the msfem scheme can increase the accuracy by as much as 30 compared to the standard fem scheme and the largest improvement of accuracy occurs on the c 10 10 coarse grid see fig 4a that indicates the msfem basis functions can provide better representations of the effective soil hydraulic and thermal properties than the bilinear basis functions used in the standard fem when the mesh size of the coarse grid is relatively big for soil temperature the advantage of using the msfem scheme is not profound two possible reasons are a the boundary conditions enforce a strong trend of soil temperature distribution b more importantly the magnitude of variations in λ with respect to soil water content and temperature is smaller than that for k i e k is more sensitive to the changes in soil water potential and temperature than λ therefore both the msfem and the standard fem simulated temperature stably approach the steady state values at the end of the simulation and the error values become constant with respect to time however we can still observe some benefits of msfem at the early stage of the simulation where the errors in the msfem results decrease faster than the errors produced by the standard fem scheme see fig 4b d and the small figure in fig 4d recall that in this study the msfem basis functions are pre calculated so there is only a limited or negligible increase in the computing load to achieve the accuracy promotion via the msfem scheme 3 partially coupled heat and water transfer and the msfem sequential solver implementation of msfem for chwt simulations has been described in section 2 however for numerical applications the heat and water transfer in soil is not always expressed as a fully coupled version but rather as a partially coupled version for example in hydrus the two equations in eq 1 or equivalently in eq 2 are solved one by one within a given time step saito et al 2006 zheng et al 2021 in 2dsoil eq 1 is decoupled into three steps which are liquid water transfer heat transfer and vapor flux wang et al 2022a solving water and heat transfer one by one in a discrete time step provides two advantages a to avoid solving high dimensional linear systems generated from the numerical schemes b to enable a design that assigns liquid water heat and vapor transfers into three separate modules which provides flexible programming architectures and adaptable controls for relatively complex soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat simulators e g timlin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c wang et al 2022a in this section a partially coupled version of chwt model used in 2dsoil is considered as an example and the msfem scheme proposed in section 2 is generalized as a solver that can sequentially compute soil water content and soil temperature 3 1 the partially coupled version of heat and water transfer model let eq 2 be the starting point the partially coupled version of soil heat and water transfer in wang et al 2022a is to rewrite eq 2 into the equations of the following three separate steps step i l i q u i d w a t e r t r a n s f e r c w h t k h t h 15 a s t e p i i h e a t t r a n s f e r c h t t λ t c l ρ l q l t t 0 15 b s t e p i i i v a p o r t r a n s f e r c θ θ h t c θ t t t d mv h t h d tv h t t 15 c c t θ h t c tt t t l 0 ρ l q v c v ρ l q v t t 0 15 d in eq 15 c w c m 1 represent the soil water capacity and c h j c m 3 k 1 is the soil volumetric heat capacity for each discrete time step the three steps are processed one by one when solving liquid water transfer step i eq 15a soil temperature is assumed to be unchanged with respect to time when soil temperature is computed step ii eq 15b soil water content is supposed to be steady and the liquid water flux q l can be determined from eq 15a finally in eqs 15c d both soil water potential and temperature are updated again based on the vapor flux as well as the sensible and latent heat carried by the vapor flux the thermally driven liquid water flow d tl h t is omitted in eq 15 because a d tl h t is not included in the initial version of 2dsoil timlin et al 1996 and b the liquid water flow under temperature gradient contributes 5 of the total liquid water flow prunty 2009 wang et al 2022a and it is often negligible in chwt problems as reported by lu et al 2020 solving steps i iii in eq 15 one by one in each discrete time step should provide results similar to the coupled version in eq 2 compared to the fully coupled version eq 2 the interaction between water transfer and heat transfer is weakened in the partially coupled version and it is only explicitly shown in the vapor transfer step eqs 15c d however interaction between water transfer and heat transfer can be included recursively through multiple time steps a comprehensive comparison between the fully coupled version eq 1 and the partially coupled version eq 15 of soil heat and water transfer is shown in wang et al 2022a 3 2 establishment of a msfem sequential solver for the partially coupled heat and water transfer the msfem basis functions for soil water potential and soil temperature can be computed individually following the leading differential terms in eqs 15a b respectively therefore for a given coarse element m fig 1 eq 10 can be converted as follows 16 k sat φ h m i 0 λ φ t m i 0 i 1 2 3 4 and the oscillatory boundary conditions for the msfem basis function along edge i in coarse element m see fig 1 lower diagram and eq 11 can also be simplified as 17 x k sat x φ h m 1 0 x λ x φ t m 1 0 apparently the connections between the two groups of basis functions v h and v t are neglected due to the elimination of d tl h t however the correlation between v h and v t always exists due to the interactions between soil water potential and soil temperature the petrov galerkin global formulation derived from eq 15 can be given as follows step i m c m m i 1 2 3 4 c w h m i t ω φ h m i ψ d ω m

water potential and temperature values on the fine grid can be reconstructed using eq 14 3 3 illustrative example example 2 5 application of the msfem sequential solver in this example to demonstrate the msfem sequential solver presented in section 3 2 we redo the simulation in example 2 3 using three methods the msfem scheme with c 20 20 f 5 5 grid the msfem sequential solver with c 20 20 f 5 5 grid and the standard fem with c 20 20 grid then the solution error and the sub grid capturing error of the three methods are computed relative to the standard fem solution on the underlying grid c 100 100 the evolution of errors with respect to time are presented in fig 5 due to the elimination of thermally driven liquid water flow and the decreasing of soil water and temperature interaction the errors produced by msfem sequential solver slightly increase about 5 compared to the msfem scheme however the msfem scheme and the msfem sequential solver still outperform the standard fem for both the soil water content and temperature solved on the coarse grid and the reconstructed values on the fine grid 4 summary and future topics the application of a multiscale finite element method msfem on coupled heat and water transfer chwt problems is investigated in this study two groups of msfem basis functions are constructed to absorb the local variabilities of soil hydraulic and thermal conductivity and a global formulation based on petrov galerkin finite element method fem is adopted to implement the proposed msfem scheme because partially coupled versions of heat and water transfer are used in existing soil simulators such as hydrus saito et al 2006 zheng et al 2021 and 2dsoil timlin et al 1996 wang et al 2021c the msfem scheme proposed in this study is exploited as a sequential solver to handle such variations since the msfem basis functions in this study can be determined in advance using the msfem scheme does not essentially increase the computing load and the illustration examples indicate that the msfem scheme can reduce the simulation errors by up to 30 compared to the standard fem especially for the soil water content therefore the msfem approach proposed in this study provides an effective numerical method for chwt simulations in soils spatial heterogeneities are only assumed in soil hydraulic and thermal conductivity in this study similar spatial variabilities may also occur for vapor transfer coefficients such as d mv or d tv unfortunately related soil studies are relatively rare however if those studies exist the msfem scheme proposed in this study can be generalized by simply revising the construction of the msfem basis functions eq 10 or 16 furthermore the msfem basis functions are pre calculated in this study and not changed during time evolution thus research on the adaptive updates of the basis functions can be a future development of the msfem scheme proposed in this study e g chung et al 2015 chung et al 2016 which can be fulfilled either with the conventional partial differential equation solvers or with learning based approaches credit authorship contribution statement chenyi luo writing original draft yuanyuan shi

3063,the pore morphology method pmm has been widely applied to simulate the quasi static drainage process of porous media which requires less computational time and computer memory compared to other two phase flow simulation methods however most of the existing pore morphology simulations were restricted to totally wetting systems i e contact angle is equal to zero here we propose a new pore morphology method lvca pmm enhanced by considering locally variable contact angles which now enables a reproduction of the primary drainage process for porous media under different wettability conditions featuring the full range of contact angle for wetting phase for various spatial distribution a series of simulations are performed by using the lvca pmm to a porous medium under different uniform and mixed wettability conditions the proposed lvca pmm presents a better result compared to the method by schulz et al 2014 for different wettability conditions the capillary pressure saturation relations as well as the pore scale fluid distributions can be well captured by the proposed lvca pmm keywords pore morphology method contact angle wettability capillary pressure saturation relation fluid distribution 1 introduction wettability the preference of a fluid to be in contact with a solid surface in the presence of another immiscible fluid is one of the most important factors that controls multiphase flow in porous media at both pore scale hoffman 1975 levaché and bartolo 2014 zhao et al 2018 and macroscopic scale stokes et al 1986 trojer et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 it therefore plays a fundamental role in a wide range of natural and industrial processes including geologic co2 sequestration szulczewski et al 2012 enhanced oil recovery orr and taber 1984 groundwater remediation cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 and transport in polymer electrolyte fuel cells yang et al 2004 for example wettability affects the capillary sealing efficiency with respect to co2 of the caprock and the transport properties of the water or brine and co2 phases in the reservoir rock chalbaud et al 2009 wettability is often characterized using the contact angle θ between the fluid fluid interface and the solid conventionally θ 90 corresponds to wetting phase wp and θ 90 corresponds to non wetting phase nwp a variety of different computational approaches are available to model the pore scale fluid fluid flow process including i models based on lattice or dissipative particle dynamics such as the lattice boltzmann method models chen et al 2018 liu et al 2012 and stochastic rotation dynamics models hiller et al 2016 jung et al 2016 ii continuum models such as volume of fluid methods pavuluri et al 2018 maes and geiger 2018 and phase field models cueto felgueroso and juanes 2012 cogswell and szulczewski 2017 iii topological methods such as pore network models knudsen et al 2002 holtzman and segre 2015 and iv morphological methods such as pore morphology method pmm models hilpert and miller 2001 liu et al 2020a b it has been noted that the first two approaches require extensively computational power vogel et al 2005 zhao et al 2019 and pore network models require a transformation of the three dimensional microstructure into an idealized network of pores connected by throats yuan and chareyre 2017 the pmm models on the other hand are less computationally demanding and can be applied directly to any given microstructure vogel et al 2005 liu et al 2020a b following the pioneering work from hilpert and miller 2001 the pmm has been widely extended to determine the capillary pressure saturation curves for different porous media including soils mu et al 2016 silin et al 2011 liu et al 2020a b and gas diffusion layer and micro porous layer of the polymer electrolyte fuel cell schulz et al 2007 wargo et al 2013 by using less computational efforts the pmm models can deliver results comparable to micro and macro experimental observations pore network models and lattice based models turner et al 2004 vogel et al 2005 liu et al 2020a b in early development of pmm models the wetting fluid wp is assumed to be completely wetting i e contact angle θ 0 however in practice media with non vanishing contact angles can be observed commonly siddiqui et al 2018 grundke et al 2015 which are widely employed for many applications such as drug dissolution cheema et al 2008 and lubrication painting and liquid coating prabhu et al 2009 in addition mixed wettability conditions are observed in experiments for many porous media such as fuel cell materials martínez et al 2009 and rocks alhammadi et al 2017 for example alhammadi et al 2017 measured the contact angle distributions in three carbonate reservoir rock samples the experimental results indicated a mixed wettability condition exists in all three rock samples as shown in fig 1 lattice particle based models chen et al 2018 liu et al 2012 continuum models pavuluri et al 2018 maes and geiger 2018 and pore network models knudsen et al 2002 holtzman and segre 2015 have been developed to accommodate the porous media with various wettability conditions to date partially wetting fluids in the pmm models have only been taken into account through rescaling the capillary pressure with a factor of c o s θ as in schulz et al 2007 and schulz et al 2014 however the method to consider partial wettability by rescaling the capillary pressure with a factor can only be valid if the solid surface is assumed as a plane substantial error occurs when applying this approach to more common scenarios with round and complex solid surfaces see section 3 1 for details therefore it is desirable to extend the pmm model to handle porous media with arbitrary pore geometry and fluids featuring different wettability in this paper the pmm is enhanced by considering locally variable contact angle lvca pmm to simulate the drainage process in partially wetting porous media with various wettability conditions in the proposed lvca pmm model we firstly implement an algorithm that quantitatively reproduces fluid fluid interface morphologies for circular or spherical in three dimensional cases solid surfaces by assembling disks or spheres three dimensional cases together to mimic irregularly shaped solid phase the lvca pmm model can be applied to more general cases to consider partially saturated porous media with arbitrary pore geometry and filled by fluids with different wettability this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the background of the pmm model hilpert and miller 2001 is reviewed briefly then to overcome the limitations from schulz s rescaling pmm model schulz et al 2014 we present the detailed algorithms of the proposed lvca pmm model to consider the spatial variation of contact angle in section 3 in section 4 results of lvca pmm simulations on uniform and mixed wettability porous media are presented and discussed and compared with the results modelled by schulz et al 2014 some key concluding remarks are presented in the last section 2 pore morphology method a brief review the pmm was established by hilpert and miller 2001 to simulate the quasistatic steps of a drainage process in totally wetting i e contact angle θ 0 porous media the physical model is a digital porous medium with one side connected to a non wetting phase nwp reservoir and the opposite side connected to a wetting phase wp reservoir the two dimensional pmm model uses a digital disk with a diameter φ as a probe to detect the pore space that is accessible by the nwp the diameter φ is calculated from young laplace equation 1 p c 2 γ φ where p c is the capillary pressure and γ is the interfacial tension two mathematical morphological operations namely erosion and dilation are employed in the pmm hilpert and miller 2001 by using the minkowski subtraction the morphological erosion e of a binary image a by a structure element b can be expressed as e b a a b similarly by using the minkowski addition the morphological dilation d of a by b is expressed as d b a a b the algorithm of the pmm can be decomposed into several calculation steps hilpert and miller 2001 as follows 1 at the beginning the porous medium is saturated with wp p c 0 2 then p c is increased incrementally the pore space p is eroded by the digital disk with diameter φ calculated from eq 1 see fig 2 a 3 from the erosion result separate eroded pore spaces are identified all subspaces that are not connected to the nwp reservoir are removed see fig 2b 4 remaining connected pores are dilated using the same digital disk used in step 2 see fig 2c saturation is then calculated and recorded 5 the entire process is repeated for the next pressure step using the morphological framework and considering the connectivity of nwp the saturation of nwp at capillary pressure p c becomes 2 s n φ v o l c p s φ s φ v o l p where p s φ is the erosion of the pore space by a disk of diameter φ c x represents the part of x that is connected to the nwp reservoir v o l x represents the volume of x the key advantage of the pmm model consists of the low memory requirements and the extremely low calculation times however the pmm model can be only applied to a vanishing contact angle θ 0 and thus a totally wetting system in addition the pmm may produce incorrect ruptured wp spaces see white circle in fig 2c which cannot exist in a real thermodynamic equilibrium system liu et al 2020a 3 extension of the pmm model to partially wetting porous media 3 1 the existing model schulz et al 2014 modified the pmm through rescaling the diameter of erosion by c o s θ to model the drainage process in porous media with various contact angles which is named as schulz s model in this article it has been then applied to a two dimensional porous medium consisted of disks with uniform and variable contact angles however scaling the diameter of erosion by c o s θ only works for solid phase with planer surface for cambered surface like disk or sphere significant error occurs fig 3 shows the illustration of schulz s model schulz et al 2014 for a two particle system point a is the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface since the diameter of erosion was scaled by c o s θ ac r c o s θ based on the cosine law the resulting contact angle α 1 is calculated as 3 α 1 π cos 1 r 1 2 r 2 r 1 r cos θ 2 2 r 1 r α 2 can be calculated similarly by replacing r 1 in eq 3 by r 2 it is clear that α 1 α 2 for particles with different radius and either α 1 or α 2 is not equal to θ fig 4 shows the resulted contact angle α with the change of presupposed contact angle θ at different ratio of the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface to the radius of particle d r r the difference between α and θ increased with the increases of θ and d it can be seen that α is larger than θ if θ 30 and d 1 therefore in the pmm simulation schulz s model can result in overestimation of the nwp saturation because of the difference between the resulted and presupposed contact angles there is another limitation of schulz s model in pmm simulation as shown fig 3 the wp nwp interface can only be formed in between the two specified particles when r r 1 r c o s θ r 1 and r r 2 r c o s θ r 2 therefore the ratio of the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface to the radius of particle d 2 1 c o s θ when r is significantly larger than r the predicted wp nwp interface cannot form in between the two specified particles but may forms on other particles instead resulting in unexpected contact angles see fig 5 3 2 lvca pmm model 3 2 1 the position of the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface the pmm enhanced by considering locally variable contact angle lvca pmm is proposed in this paper to simulate partially wetting porous media directly the lvca pmm is based on the geometrical relationship between the wp nwp interface and the surface of the solid phase fig 6 a shows the illustration of wp nwp interface existed between two different circular particles here the surface of solid phase is shown in orange and the interface between wp and nwp is shown in blue point a is the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface o 1 and o 2 are the center of the circular particles according to the cosine law the distance between a and the surface of the particle r 1 can be calculated as 4 r 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 r 1 r c o s θ r 1 the resulted contact angle α is precisely equal to the presupposed contact angle θ as shown in fig 4 besides r 1 r 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 r 1 r c o s θ which is larger than r r 1 at any given d and θ for wp therefore the resulted wp nwp interface would always form between the specified particles hence both limitations of schulz s model schulz et al 2014 i e the overestimation of contact angle and the limitation on the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface can be overcame by eq 4 as shown in fig 4 the resulted contact angle α predicted by lvca pmm is identical to the presupposed contact angle θ for any given θ and d it is worth noting that eq 4 can also apply to irregularly shaped particles by filling the volume of a real particle with overlapping disks or overlapping spheres in three dimensional cases ferellec and mcdowell 2010 wang et al 2007 lu and mcdowell 2007 price et al 2007 fig 6b shows the illustration of wp nwp interface exists at boundary walls the distance between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the wall r can be calculated as 5 r r c o s θ 3 2 2 algorithm to simulate the nwp distribution considering contact angle the lvca pmm algorithm is based on the geometry distance r between the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface and the solid surface for a totally wetting system r is constant and equal to r the radius of curvature of the wp nwp interface the locations of the centers of curvature of the wp nwp interface can be determined by eroding the pore space by a digital disk s φ with diameter φ 2 r i e the contour of e s p in fig 1a as in the step 2 of the original pmm for a partially wetting system however the porous medium often compose of polydisperse particles with different contact angles therefore r may change from particle to particle and from particle to boundary the way of erosion of pore space in the original pmm cannot apply to this scenario instead individual particles and boundary walls are dilated by the digital disk s φ with diameter φ 2 r i e d s g where g represents solid space at the contour of the remaining pore space p lies the centers of curvature of the wp nwp interface the remaining pore space is the complementary subspace of the dilation of solid space p can be expressed as 6 p d s g c p is corresponding to the erosion of the pore space by s φ in the original pmm for totally wetting system in the case of vanishing contact angle p is equal to e s p then the nwp filled portion of pore space can be determined by 7 p n c p s φ g w a straightforward dilation of c p with the disk of diameter φ would hit the solid space g since φ φ hence g should be subtracted from c p s in eq 7 w is the spaces occupied by the ruptured wp when applying the pmm to totally wetting system θ 0 liu et al 2020 proposed an algorithm to detect and remove the ruptured wp spaces see fig 2c as the ruptured wp always comes in pairs in the algorithm the ruptured wp spaces can be detected when following two conditions are satisfied liu et al 2020a 1 the separation distance between two wp spaces is less than 2 φ and 2 the separation distance between one wp space and the opposite solid surface is larger than φ for general cases of θ 0 w can be detected since a ruptured wp space w only connects to one particle or one boundary hence w can be expressed as 8 w w w g i g g j g i j d e w g i d e w g j where e is a digital disk with diameter of 2 pixels the corresponding nwp saturation is now calculated by 9 s n φ v o l c d s g c s φ g w v o l p the calculation steps for the lvca pmm model can be summarized as follows 1 at the beginning the porous medium is saturated with wp the capillary pressure p c is zero 2 then p c is increased incrementally for every individual particle and boundary wall the diameter φ of a digital disk in two dimensional cases is calculated by using eqs 4 and 5 respectively the particles and walls are dilated by the corresponding disks 3 from the solid dilation result separate remaining pore spaces are identified all subspaces that are not connected to the nwp reservoir are removed 4 remaining connected pores are dilated using a digital disk with diameter φ calculated by eq 1 the solid space is subtracting from the dilation result ruptured wp spaces are detected and then replaced by nwp 5 saturation is then calculated using eq 9 and recorded 6 the entire process is repeated for the next pressure step 3 2 3 lvca pmm simulation of locally different contact angles fig 7 compares the phase distribution results at the same capillary pressure for a medium consists of particles with different shapes with uniform contact angle 60 see fig 7a and 7b versus that with the contact angle varies locally on the solid surface 0 and 60 see fig 7c and 7d for the latter case fig 7c and 7d random pixels on the surface of the particles are assigned a contact angle of 60 marked in black the sizes of the black pixels are amplified in two times here for clarification all other surface pixels are assigned a contact angle of 0 now that there are multiple contact angles within the structure the diameter of the structuring element may change size when moving from pixel to pixel during the solid dilation procedure for such a case only the surface pixels of the solid i e pixels adjacent to the pore space should be considered during this procedure the surface pixels can be identified easily by eroding the solid features of the input image using a disk with diameter of 2 pixels and then subtracting the resulting image from the original the influence of the random surface pixels is captured by the lvca pmm model and yields different saturation results when comparing fig 7b versus fig 7d 3 2 4 experimental validation of lvca pmm the experimental results of primary drainage tests for pure silanized sand and a mixture of natural quartz sand and silanized sand in a volume ratio of 1 1 denoted by qs 1 1 were reported in ustohal et al 1998 the natural quartz sand and silanized sand have narrow and similar grain size distributions 0 25 0 50 mm but strongly different surface properties the silanized sand was resulted by treating the surface of the natural quartz sand with a silylating agent but did not affect its grain size distribution the contact angles of quartz sand and silanized sand were 0 and 50 respectively to reproduce the experimental capillary pressure saturation curves the sand packings are firstly simulated by using the three dimensional dem model liu et al 2020b following the grain size statistics with a porosity of 0 38 ustohal et al 1998 because the pure silanized sand packing and the qs 1 1 mixture packing shared the same grain size distribution and porosity the simulated packings of pure silanized sand and qs 1 1 mixture have the same solid skeleton the sand particles were simplified as spheres and a total of 9044 spheres were generated the packing systems were represented by 4663 voxels in digital space with a resolution of 0 015 mm voxel the lvca pmm is then applied to the discretization of 4663 voxels to reproduce the capillary pressure saturation curves and nwp wp distributions when applying lvca pmm model to these three dimensional systems the structuring element that is used in the dilation of the solid and the remaining pore space is a digital sphere of radius r or r r is calculated by using the modified young laplace equation p c 4 γ φ r is calculated by eqs 4 or 5 for the pure silanized sand system all the particles are assigned with a contact angle of 50 for the qs 1 1 mixture system randomly selected 4522 particles are assigned with a contact angle of 50 silanized sand and the rest of the particles are assigned with a contact angle of 0 quartz sand the surface tension of the air water system is 0 073 n m the top of the systems in y direction is assumed to connected to nwp air reservoir and the bottom of the systems is connected to wp water reservoir fig 8 shows the comparison between the capillary pressure saturation curves modelled by the lvca pmm and the laboratory test results ustohal et al 1998 the maximum saturations of the experimental materials were lower than 1 0 because of the immobile air content at the beginning of the drainage nevertheless as shown in fig 8 the lvca pmm model can appropriately reproduce the capillary pressure saturation curves observed in the experimental tests particularly the difference of the capillary pressure saturation curves due to the variation in contact angles the two insets in fig 8 show the slices of unsaturated pure silanized sand and qs 1 1 samples in x direction at capillary pressure of 24 8 cm h2o the quartz sand particles θ 0 and silanized sand θ 50 are marked in red and orange respectively it can be observed that the nwp invasion pattern of the qs system significantly differs from the pure silanized sand system due to the difference in contact angles 4 application and comparison 4 1 application of the lvca pmm model to porous media with locally variable wetting conditions as shown in fig 9 the lvca pmm is applied to a two dimensional porous medium that consists of polydisperse disks with various wettability conditions it is worth noting that lvca pmm can easily be applied to three dimensional cases while only two dimensional examples are presented herein for clearer demonstration and illustration the two dimensional porous medium has dimensions of 400 400 mm the disk sizes range from 10 mm to 20 mm a resolution of 0 125 mm pixel is chosen and the capillary pressure is determined for an air water system surface tension γ 0 073 n m fig 9a and b have the same solid structure but different wettability conditions in fig 9a all disks are assigned uniform contact angles θ 0 30 60 or 85 in fig 9b disks are randomly assigned contact angles of 0 30 60 and 85 five simulations are performed on the porous medium using the lvca pmm model where four simulations are conducted with the constant contact angle ranges from 0 to 85 and one simulation with randomly assigned contact angle as shown in fig 10 with the increase of constant contact angle the p c s w curve shifts left where s w 1 s n the p c s w curve of the randomly assigned contact angles case is at the slightly right of the curve for θ 60 the discrepancy between the two curves is increased with decreasing saturation the shift of the p c s w curves with contact angle can be explained as follows as shown in fig 6a if a wp nwp interface can be formed in the throat between two disks in this case nwp is unable to invade through the throat the sum of the distances between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the surfaces of the two disks r 1 and r 2 should at least be equal to if not larger than the separation distance between the two disks b i e r 1 r 2 b according to eq 4 with the increase of contact angle θ an increased radius of curvature of the wp nwp interface r corresponding to a smaller capillary pressure is required to maintain the value of r 1 r 2 and thus maintain the non drainage state of the wp therefore the capillary pressure corresponding to a certain wp saturation is decreased with increasing contact angle a similar influence of the contact angle on the primary drainage curves have been reported in literature for example o carroll et al 2005 have conducted drainage experiments on ottawa sand with different wetting conditions and the resulted primary drainage curves show a similar trend towards smaller capillary pressures as contact angle increases besides jettestuen et al 2013 observed the same trend of decreased nwp entry pressure with the increasing of contact angle fig 11 shows the snapshots of wp nwp distribution in the porous media under different wettability conditions a b c d and e as marked in fig 10 as shown in fig 11f the nwp invasion fronts at different contact angle of the disks are successfully captured by the proposed lvca pmm the wp saturations presented in fig 11 are all about 0 85 however the corresponding capillary pressure significantly decreases from 29 2 pa to 11 9 pa with the constant contact angle increases from 0 to 85 for almost identical saturation the nwp invasion pattern slightly changes when constant contact angle increase from 0 to 60 see fig 11a 11c while the nwp invasion patterns for a constant contact angle of 85 fig 11d is significantly different from other cases the major difference occurs near the left boundary with the increase of contact angle the distance between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the wall r 1 see eq 5 decreases faster than the distance between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the particle r 2 see eq 4 as explained above a big enough value of r 1 r 2 is required to maintain the non drainage state of the wp hence the value of r 1 r 2 in the throat between wall and particle are harder to maintain at higher contact angle resulting in the intrusion of nwp through the throat it is clear that the wetting conditions have a strong impact on the wp nwp distribution pattern although the capillary pressures and saturations in fig 11c θ 60 and fig 11e randomly assigned contact angle are almost identical with p c 18 8 pa s w 0 857 in fig 11c and p c 18 8 pa s w 0 854 in fig 11e the nwp invasion patterns in fig 11c and 11e are dramatically different it can be observed that the pendular bridge is difficult to form in porous systems with higher contact angle as shown in fig 11a multiple pendular capillary bridges formed inside the nwp invasion zone in the totally wetting system θ 0 with the increase of constant contact angle however the number of pendular bridges dramatically decreases and no pendular bridge is observed at θ 85 see fig 11d for the mixed wettability system see fig 11e all the pendular bridges formed are between the disks with contact angle of 0 30 and 60 since wp mainly occurs as pendular bridges at low saturation values the ease of forming pendular bridges at small contact angle may explain the large discrepancy between the p c s w curve for θ 60 and the curve for the random contact angle system 4 2 comparison with schulz s model fig 12 a shows the comparisons of the p c s w curves predicted by lvca pmm and schulz s model schulz et al 2014 for a porous medium with different contact angles the p c s w curves predicted by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 are on the left of the curves by lvca pmm for fractional wettability conditions θ 0 the discrepancy between curves by schulz s model and lvca pmm model becomes distinct with increasing contact angle at θ 85 the p c s w curve by schulz et al 2014 shows significantly different pattern compared with the other cases θ 0 30 60 when θ 85 the saturation predicted by schulz et al 2014 firstly increases with the increase of capillary pressure which is against to the experimental observations o carroll et al 2005 the unrealistic prediction by schulz s model may be sourced from the overprediction of the contact angle see fig 4 and the limitation on the radius of curvature of nwp wp interface see fig 5 additionally the ruptured wp phase see fig 2c was not considered in schulz s model which results in an overestimation of the wp saturation especially at low wp saturation conditions as shown in fig 12b s s w denotes the saturation predicted by schulz s model and s l w is that by the lvca pmm model the wp saturation predicted by schulz s model is 2 11 times higher than the wp saturation by lvca pmm model for totally wetting scenario θ 0 because of counting ruptured wp phase incorrectly fig 13 a 13b corresponding to the points a and b marked in fig 12a 13e 13f corresponding to the points c and d marked in fig 12a and 13i 13j corresponding to the points e and f marked in fig 12a compare the snapshots of wp nwp distribution predicted by lvca pmm model and schulz s model schulz et al 2014 when θ 30 60 and 85 respectively fig 13c 13d corresponding to the points a and b marked in fig 12a 13g 13h corresponding to the points c and d marked in fig 12a and 13k 13l corresponding to the points e and f marked in fig 12a compare the probability count of the resulted contact angle by lvca pmm model and schulz s model when θ 30 60 and 85 respectively the resulted contact angles are directly measured from the produced nwp wp distribution images by using the method proposed by scanziani et al 2017 the differences between the presupposed contact angle and the resulted contact angles for the snapshots of wp nwp distribution produced by lvca pmm model are generally less than 0 5 see fig 13c 13g and 13 k which may be caused by the discrepancy by representing disks with pixels in the digital space as pointed out by hilpert and miller 2001 however the distribution of resulted contact angles by schulz s model is wider and deviated from the presupposed contact angles see fig 13d 13h and 13 l it can be seen that when θ 30 fig 13a and 13b and 60 fig 13d and 13e the nwp invasion patterns predicted by lvca pmm and schulz s model are quite similar however the corresponding capillary pressures predicted by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 p c 23 4 pa for θ 30 in fig 13b p c 13 6 pa for θ 60 in fig 13h are smaller than the corresponding capillary pressures predicted by lvca pmm p c 25 4 pa for θ 30 in fig 13a p c 18 8 pa for θ 60 in fig 13g the underestimation of the capillary pressure by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 is due to the overestimation of the contact angle see fig 4 the resulted contact angle α by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 for θ 30 ranges from 34 38 with an average value of 36 2 as shown in fig 13d and α for θ 60 ranges from 72 to 85 with an average value of 79 4 as shown in fig 13h it should be noted that the nwp invasion patterns are significantly different between fig 13i and 13j despite their wp saturations are almost identical as illustrated in fig 13i a smooth wp nwp interface and the constant contact angle of 85 are successfully reproduced by the lvca pmm model however an unsmooth wp nwp interface see spinodes a b and c in fig 13j is predicted by schulz s model and the resulted contact angle α by schulz s model for θ 85 are widely distributed from 35 to 165 fig 13l the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface in fig 13j is 62 5 mm which is 6 25 12 5 times larger than the radius of disks in the media such a large radius of curvature leads to the wp nwp interfaces predicted schulz s model cannot form on the right disks as shown in fig 5 resulting in the misinterpretation of the nwp invasion front as well as the contact angle 5 conclusions the lvca pmm is proposed in this study to improve schulz s model schulz et al 2014 and enhance the pore morphology method pmm by taking into account locally variable contact angles in the lvca pmm the morphological erosion procedure in original pmm is replaced by subtracting the dilation of solid using digital disks with diameters determined by the particle sizes the capillary pressure and the contact angle while the morphological dilation procedure on nwp reservoir connected remaining pore space keeps unchanged an algorithm to replace the rupture wp phases is also included in the lvca pmm the lvca pmm model can be applied to partially wetting systems with different uniform and randomly assigned contact angles to produce the p c s w curves and the nwp wp distribution compared to the pmm model proposed by schulz et al 2014 the lvca pmm presents better macro and pore scale results particularly at high contact angle and high non uniformity in particle sizes it is worth noting that while the examples presented in this work were limited to porous media consist of disks in two dimensional cases or spheres in three dimensional cases by mimicking the shape of solid with disks or spheres in three dimensional cases the lvca pmm model can be applied to porous media composed of irregularly shaped solid credit authorship contribution statement xin liu conceptualization methodology data

3063,the pore morphology method pmm has been widely applied to simulate the quasi static drainage process of porous media which requires less computational time and computer memory compared to other two phase flow simulation methods however most of the existing pore morphology simulations were restricted to totally wetting systems i e contact angle is equal to zero here we propose a new pore morphology method lvca pmm enhanced by considering locally variable contact angles which now enables a reproduction of the primary drainage process for porous media under different wettability conditions featuring the full range of contact angle for wetting phase for various spatial distribution a series of simulations are performed by using the lvca pmm to a porous medium under different uniform and mixed wettability conditions the proposed lvca pmm presents a better result compared to the method by schulz et al 2014 for different wettability conditions the capillary pressure saturation relations as well as the pore scale fluid distributions can be well captured by the proposed lvca pmm keywords pore morphology method contact angle wettability capillary pressure saturation relation fluid distribution 1 introduction wettability the preference of a fluid to be in contact with a solid surface in the presence of another immiscible fluid is one of the most important factors that controls multiphase flow in porous media at both pore scale hoffman 1975 levaché and bartolo 2014 zhao et al 2018 and macroscopic scale stokes et al 1986 trojer et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 it therefore plays a fundamental role in a wide range of natural and industrial processes including geologic co2 sequestration szulczewski et al 2012 enhanced oil recovery orr and taber 1984 groundwater remediation cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 and transport in polymer electrolyte fuel cells yang et al 2004 for example wettability affects the capillary sealing efficiency with respect to co2 of the caprock and the transport properties of the water or brine and co2 phases in the reservoir rock chalbaud et al 2009 wettability is often characterized using the contact angle θ between the fluid fluid interface and the solid conventionally θ 90 corresponds to wetting phase wp and θ 90 corresponds to non wetting phase nwp a variety of different computational approaches are available to model the pore scale fluid fluid flow process including i models based on lattice or dissipative particle dynamics such as the lattice boltzmann method models chen et al 2018 liu et al 2012 and stochastic rotation dynamics models hiller et al 2016 jung et al 2016 ii continuum models such as volume of fluid methods pavuluri et al 2018 maes and geiger 2018 and phase field models cueto felgueroso and juanes 2012 cogswell and szulczewski 2017 iii topological methods such as pore network models knudsen et al 2002 holtzman and segre 2015 and iv morphological methods such as pore morphology method pmm models hilpert and miller 2001 liu et al 2020a b it has been noted that the first two approaches require extensively computational power vogel et al 2005 zhao et al 2019 and pore network models require a transformation of the three dimensional microstructure into an idealized network of pores connected by throats yuan and chareyre 2017 the pmm models on the other hand are less computationally demanding and can be applied directly to any given microstructure vogel et al 2005 liu et al 2020a b following the pioneering work from hilpert and miller 2001 the pmm has been widely extended to determine the capillary pressure saturation curves for different porous media including soils mu et al 2016 silin et al 2011 liu et al 2020a b and gas diffusion layer and micro porous layer of the polymer electrolyte fuel cell schulz et al 2007 wargo et al 2013 by using less computational efforts the pmm models can deliver results comparable to micro and macro experimental observations pore network models and lattice based models turner et al 2004 vogel et al 2005 liu et al 2020a b in early development of pmm models the wetting fluid wp is assumed to be completely wetting i e contact angle θ 0 however in practice media with non vanishing contact angles can be observed commonly siddiqui et al 2018 grundke et al 2015 which are widely employed for many applications such as drug dissolution cheema et al 2008 and lubrication painting and liquid coating prabhu et al 2009 in addition mixed wettability conditions are observed in experiments for many porous media such as fuel cell materials martínez et al 2009 and rocks alhammadi et al 2017 for example alhammadi et al 2017 measured the contact angle distributions in three carbonate reservoir rock samples the experimental results indicated a mixed wettability condition exists in all three rock samples as shown in fig 1 lattice particle based models chen et al 2018 liu et al 2012 continuum models pavuluri et al 2018 maes and geiger 2018 and pore network models knudsen et al 2002 holtzman and segre 2015 have been developed to accommodate the porous media with various wettability conditions to date partially wetting fluids in the pmm models have only been taken into account through rescaling the capillary pressure with a factor of c o s θ as in schulz et al 2007 and schulz et al 2014 however the method to consider partial wettability by rescaling the capillary pressure with a factor can only be valid if the solid surface is assumed as a plane substantial error occurs when applying this approach to more common scenarios with round and complex solid surfaces see section 3 1 for details therefore it is desirable to extend the pmm model to handle porous media with arbitrary pore geometry and fluids featuring different wettability in this paper the pmm is enhanced by considering locally variable contact angle lvca pmm to simulate the drainage process in partially wetting porous media with various wettability conditions in the proposed lvca pmm model we firstly implement an algorithm that quantitatively reproduces fluid fluid interface morphologies for circular or spherical in three dimensional cases solid surfaces by assembling disks or spheres three dimensional cases together to mimic irregularly shaped solid phase the lvca pmm model can be applied to more general cases to consider partially saturated porous media with arbitrary pore geometry and filled by fluids with different wettability this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the background of the pmm model hilpert and miller 2001 is reviewed briefly then to overcome the limitations from schulz s rescaling pmm model schulz et al 2014 we present the detailed algorithms of the proposed lvca pmm model to consider the spatial variation of contact angle in section 3 in section 4 results of lvca pmm simulations on uniform and mixed wettability porous media are presented and discussed and compared with the results modelled by schulz et al 2014 some key concluding remarks are presented in the last section 2 pore morphology method a brief review the pmm was established by hilpert and miller 2001 to simulate the quasistatic steps of a drainage process in totally wetting i e contact angle θ 0 porous media the physical model is a digital porous medium with one side connected to a non wetting phase nwp reservoir and the opposite side connected to a wetting phase wp reservoir the two dimensional pmm model uses a digital disk with a diameter φ as a probe to detect the pore space that is accessible by the nwp the diameter φ is calculated from young laplace equation 1 p c 2 γ φ where p c is the capillary pressure and γ is the interfacial tension two mathematical morphological operations namely erosion and dilation are employed in the pmm hilpert and miller 2001 by using the minkowski subtraction the morphological erosion e of a binary image a by a structure element b can be expressed as e b a a b similarly by using the minkowski addition the morphological dilation d of a by b is expressed as d b a a b the algorithm of the pmm can be decomposed into several calculation steps hilpert and miller 2001 as follows 1 at the beginning the porous medium is saturated with wp p c 0 2 then p c is increased incrementally the pore space p is eroded by the digital disk with diameter φ calculated from eq 1 see fig 2 a 3 from the erosion result separate eroded pore spaces are identified all subspaces that are not connected to the nwp reservoir are removed see fig 2b 4 remaining connected pores are dilated using the same digital disk used in step 2 see fig 2c saturation is then calculated and recorded 5 the entire process is repeated for the next pressure step using the morphological framework and considering the connectivity of nwp the saturation of nwp at capillary pressure p c becomes 2 s n φ v o l c p s φ s φ v o l p where p s φ is the erosion of the pore space by a disk of diameter φ c x represents the part of x that is connected to the nwp reservoir v o l x represents the volume of x the key advantage of the pmm model consists of the low memory requirements and the extremely low calculation times however the pmm model can be only applied to a vanishing contact angle θ 0 and thus a totally wetting system in addition the pmm may produce incorrect ruptured wp spaces see white circle in fig 2c which cannot exist in a real thermodynamic equilibrium system liu et al 2020a 3 extension of the pmm model to partially wetting porous media 3 1 the existing model schulz et al 2014 modified the pmm through rescaling the diameter of erosion by c o s θ to model the drainage process in porous media with various contact angles which is named as schulz s model in this article it has been then applied to a two dimensional porous medium consisted of disks with uniform and variable contact angles however scaling the diameter of erosion by c o s θ only works for solid phase with planer surface for cambered surface like disk or sphere significant error occurs fig 3 shows the illustration of schulz s model schulz et al 2014 for a two particle system point a is the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface since the diameter of erosion was scaled by c o s θ ac r c o s θ based on the cosine law the resulting contact angle α 1 is calculated as 3 α 1 π cos 1 r 1 2 r 2 r 1 r cos θ 2 2 r 1 r α 2 can be calculated similarly by replacing r 1 in eq 3 by r 2 it is clear that α 1 α 2 for particles with different radius and either α 1 or α 2 is not equal to θ fig 4 shows the resulted contact angle α with the change of presupposed contact angle θ at different ratio of the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface to the radius of particle d r r the difference between α and θ increased with the increases of θ and d it can be seen that α is larger than θ if θ 30 and d 1 therefore in the pmm simulation schulz s model can result in overestimation of the nwp saturation because of the difference between the resulted and presupposed contact angles there is another limitation of schulz s model in pmm simulation as shown fig 3 the wp nwp interface can only be formed in between the two specified particles when r r 1 r c o s θ r 1 and r r 2 r c o s θ r 2 therefore the ratio of the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface to the radius of particle d 2 1 c o s θ when r is significantly larger than r the predicted wp nwp interface cannot form in between the two specified particles but may forms on other particles instead resulting in unexpected contact angles see fig 5 3 2 lvca pmm model 3 2 1 the position of the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface the pmm enhanced by considering locally variable contact angle lvca pmm is proposed in this paper to simulate partially wetting porous media directly the lvca pmm is based on the geometrical relationship between the wp nwp interface and the surface of the solid phase fig 6 a shows the illustration of wp nwp interface existed between two different circular particles here the surface of solid phase is shown in orange and the interface between wp and nwp is shown in blue point a is the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface o 1 and o 2 are the center of the circular particles according to the cosine law the distance between a and the surface of the particle r 1 can be calculated as 4 r 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 r 1 r c o s θ r 1 the resulted contact angle α is precisely equal to the presupposed contact angle θ as shown in fig 4 besides r 1 r 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 r 1 r c o s θ which is larger than r r 1 at any given d and θ for wp therefore the resulted wp nwp interface would always form between the specified particles hence both limitations of schulz s model schulz et al 2014 i e the overestimation of contact angle and the limitation on the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface can be overcame by eq 4 as shown in fig 4 the resulted contact angle α predicted by lvca pmm is identical to the presupposed contact angle θ for any given θ and d it is worth noting that eq 4 can also apply to irregularly shaped particles by filling the volume of a real particle with overlapping disks or overlapping spheres in three dimensional cases ferellec and mcdowell 2010 wang et al 2007 lu and mcdowell 2007 price et al 2007 fig 6b shows the illustration of wp nwp interface exists at boundary walls the distance between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the wall r can be calculated as 5 r r c o s θ 3 2 2 algorithm to simulate the nwp distribution considering contact angle the lvca pmm algorithm is based on the geometry distance r between the center of curvature of the wp nwp interface and the solid surface for a totally wetting system r is constant and equal to r the radius of curvature of the wp nwp interface the locations of the centers of curvature of the wp nwp interface can be determined by eroding the pore space by a digital disk s φ with diameter φ 2 r i e the contour of e s p in fig 1a as in the step 2 of the original pmm for a partially wetting system however the porous medium often compose of polydisperse particles with different contact angles therefore r may change from particle to particle and from particle to boundary the way of erosion of pore space in the original pmm cannot apply to this scenario instead individual particles and boundary walls are dilated by the digital disk s φ with diameter φ 2 r i e d s g where g represents solid space at the contour of the remaining pore space p lies the centers of curvature of the wp nwp interface the remaining pore space is the complementary subspace of the dilation of solid space p can be expressed as 6 p d s g c p is corresponding to the erosion of the pore space by s φ in the original pmm for totally wetting system in the case of vanishing contact angle p is equal to e s p then the nwp filled portion of pore space can be determined by 7 p n c p s φ g w a straightforward dilation of c p with the disk of diameter φ would hit the solid space g since φ φ hence g should be subtracted from c p s in eq 7 w is the spaces occupied by the ruptured wp when applying the pmm to totally wetting system θ 0 liu et al 2020 proposed an algorithm to detect and remove the ruptured wp spaces see fig 2c as the ruptured wp always comes in pairs in the algorithm the ruptured wp spaces can be detected when following two conditions are satisfied liu et al 2020a 1 the separation distance between two wp spaces is less than 2 φ and 2 the separation distance between one wp space and the opposite solid surface is larger than φ for general cases of θ 0 w can be detected since a ruptured wp space w only connects to one particle or one boundary hence w can be expressed as 8 w w w g i g g j g i j d e w g i d e w g j where e is a digital disk with diameter of 2 pixels the corresponding nwp saturation is now calculated by 9 s n φ v o l c d s g c s φ g w v o l p the calculation steps for the lvca pmm model can be summarized as follows 1 at the beginning the porous medium is saturated with wp the capillary pressure p c is zero 2 then p c is increased incrementally for every individual particle and boundary wall the diameter φ of a digital disk in two dimensional cases is calculated by using eqs 4 and 5 respectively the particles and walls are dilated by the corresponding disks 3 from the solid dilation result separate remaining pore spaces are identified all subspaces that are not connected to the nwp reservoir are removed 4 remaining connected pores are dilated using a digital disk with diameter φ calculated by eq 1 the solid space is subtracting from the dilation result ruptured wp spaces are detected and then replaced by nwp 5 saturation is then calculated using eq 9 and recorded 6 the entire process is repeated for the next pressure step 3 2 3 lvca pmm simulation of locally different contact angles fig 7 compares the phase distribution results at the same capillary pressure for a medium consists of particles with different shapes with uniform contact angle 60 see fig 7a and 7b versus that with the contact angle varies locally on the solid surface 0 and 60 see fig 7c and 7d for the latter case fig 7c and 7d random pixels on the surface of the particles are assigned a contact angle of 60 marked in black the sizes of the black pixels are amplified in two times here for clarification all other surface pixels are assigned a contact angle of 0 now that there are multiple contact angles within the structure the diameter of the structuring element may change size when moving from pixel to pixel during the solid dilation procedure for such a case only the surface pixels of the solid i e pixels adjacent to the pore space should be considered during this procedure the surface pixels can be identified easily by eroding the solid features of the input image using a disk with diameter of 2 pixels and then subtracting the resulting image from the original the influence of the random surface pixels is captured by the lvca pmm model and yields different saturation results when comparing fig 7b versus fig 7d 3 2 4 experimental validation of lvca pmm the experimental results of primary drainage tests for pure silanized sand and a mixture of natural quartz sand and silanized sand in a volume ratio of 1 1 denoted by qs 1 1 were reported in ustohal et al 1998 the natural quartz sand and silanized sand have narrow and similar grain size distributions 0 25 0 50 mm but strongly different surface properties the silanized sand was resulted by treating the surface of the natural quartz sand with a silylating agent but did not affect its grain size distribution the contact angles of quartz sand and silanized sand were 0 and 50 respectively to reproduce the experimental capillary pressure saturation curves the sand packings are firstly simulated by using the three dimensional dem model liu et al 2020b following the grain size statistics with a porosity of 0 38 ustohal et al 1998 because the pure silanized sand packing and the qs 1 1 mixture packing shared the same grain size distribution and porosity the simulated packings of pure silanized sand and qs 1 1 mixture have the same solid skeleton the sand particles were simplified as spheres and a total of 9044 spheres were generated the packing systems were represented by 4663 voxels in digital space with a resolution of 0 015 mm voxel the lvca pmm is then applied to the discretization of 4663 voxels to reproduce the capillary pressure saturation curves and nwp wp distributions when applying lvca pmm model to these three dimensional systems the structuring element that is used in the dilation of the solid and the remaining pore space is a digital sphere of radius r or r r is calculated by using the modified young laplace equation p c 4 γ φ r is calculated by eqs 4 or 5 for the pure silanized sand system all the particles are assigned with a contact angle of 50 for the qs 1 1 mixture system randomly selected 4522 particles are assigned with a contact angle of 50 silanized sand and the rest of the particles are assigned with a contact angle of 0 quartz sand the surface tension of the air water system is 0 073 n m the top of the systems in y direction is assumed to connected to nwp air reservoir and the bottom of the systems is connected to wp water reservoir fig 8 shows the comparison between the capillary pressure saturation curves modelled by the lvca pmm and the laboratory test results ustohal et al 1998 the maximum saturations of the experimental materials were lower than 1 0 because of the immobile air content at the beginning of the drainage nevertheless as shown in fig 8 the lvca pmm model can appropriately reproduce the capillary pressure saturation curves observed in the experimental tests particularly the difference of the capillary pressure saturation curves due to the variation in contact angles the two insets in fig 8 show the slices of unsaturated pure silanized sand and qs 1 1 samples in x direction at capillary pressure of 24 8 cm h2o the quartz sand particles θ 0 and silanized sand θ 50 are marked in red and orange respectively it can be observed that the nwp invasion pattern of the qs system significantly differs from the pure silanized sand system due to the difference in contact angles 4 application and comparison 4 1 application of the lvca pmm model to porous media with locally variable wetting conditions as shown in fig 9 the lvca pmm is applied to a two dimensional porous medium that consists of polydisperse disks with various wettability conditions it is worth noting that lvca pmm can easily be applied to three dimensional cases while only two dimensional examples are presented herein for clearer demonstration and illustration the two dimensional porous medium has dimensions of 400 400 mm the disk sizes range from 10 mm to 20 mm a resolution of 0 125 mm pixel is chosen and the capillary pressure is determined for an air water system surface tension γ 0 073 n m fig 9a and b have the same solid structure but different wettability conditions in fig 9a all disks are assigned uniform contact angles θ 0 30 60 or 85 in fig 9b disks are randomly assigned contact angles of 0 30 60 and 85 five simulations are performed on the porous medium using the lvca pmm model where four simulations are conducted with the constant contact angle ranges from 0 to 85 and one simulation with randomly assigned contact angle as shown in fig 10 with the increase of constant contact angle the p c s w curve shifts left where s w 1 s n the p c s w curve of the randomly assigned contact angles case is at the slightly right of the curve for θ 60 the discrepancy between the two curves is increased with decreasing saturation the shift of the p c s w curves with contact angle can be explained as follows as shown in fig 6a if a wp nwp interface can be formed in the throat between two disks in this case nwp is unable to invade through the throat the sum of the distances between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the surfaces of the two disks r 1 and r 2 should at least be equal to if not larger than the separation distance between the two disks b i e r 1 r 2 b according to eq 4 with the increase of contact angle θ an increased radius of curvature of the wp nwp interface r corresponding to a smaller capillary pressure is required to maintain the value of r 1 r 2 and thus maintain the non drainage state of the wp therefore the capillary pressure corresponding to a certain wp saturation is decreased with increasing contact angle a similar influence of the contact angle on the primary drainage curves have been reported in literature for example o carroll et al 2005 have conducted drainage experiments on ottawa sand with different wetting conditions and the resulted primary drainage curves show a similar trend towards smaller capillary pressures as contact angle increases besides jettestuen et al 2013 observed the same trend of decreased nwp entry pressure with the increasing of contact angle fig 11 shows the snapshots of wp nwp distribution in the porous media under different wettability conditions a b c d and e as marked in fig 10 as shown in fig 11f the nwp invasion fronts at different contact angle of the disks are successfully captured by the proposed lvca pmm the wp saturations presented in fig 11 are all about 0 85 however the corresponding capillary pressure significantly decreases from 29 2 pa to 11 9 pa with the constant contact angle increases from 0 to 85 for almost identical saturation the nwp invasion pattern slightly changes when constant contact angle increase from 0 to 60 see fig 11a 11c while the nwp invasion patterns for a constant contact angle of 85 fig 11d is significantly different from other cases the major difference occurs near the left boundary with the increase of contact angle the distance between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the wall r 1 see eq 5 decreases faster than the distance between the center of the curvature of the wp nwp interface and the particle r 2 see eq 4 as explained above a big enough value of r 1 r 2 is required to maintain the non drainage state of the wp hence the value of r 1 r 2 in the throat between wall and particle are harder to maintain at higher contact angle resulting in the intrusion of nwp through the throat it is clear that the wetting conditions have a strong impact on the wp nwp distribution pattern although the capillary pressures and saturations in fig 11c θ 60 and fig 11e randomly assigned contact angle are almost identical with p c 18 8 pa s w 0 857 in fig 11c and p c 18 8 pa s w 0 854 in fig 11e the nwp invasion patterns in fig 11c and 11e are dramatically different it can be observed that the pendular bridge is difficult to form in porous systems with higher contact angle as shown in fig 11a multiple pendular capillary bridges formed inside the nwp invasion zone in the totally wetting system θ 0 with the increase of constant contact angle however the number of pendular bridges dramatically decreases and no pendular bridge is observed at θ 85 see fig 11d for the mixed wettability system see fig 11e all the pendular bridges formed are between the disks with contact angle of 0 30 and 60 since wp mainly occurs as pendular bridges at low saturation values the ease of forming pendular bridges at small contact angle may explain the large discrepancy between the p c s w curve for θ 60 and the curve for the random contact angle system 4 2 comparison with schulz s model fig 12 a shows the comparisons of the p c s w curves predicted by lvca pmm and schulz s model schulz et al 2014 for a porous medium with different contact angles the p c s w curves predicted by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 are on the left of the curves by lvca pmm for fractional wettability conditions θ 0 the discrepancy between curves by schulz s model and lvca pmm model becomes distinct with increasing contact angle at θ 85 the p c s w curve by schulz et al 2014 shows significantly different pattern compared with the other cases θ 0 30 60 when θ 85 the saturation predicted by schulz et al 2014 firstly increases with the increase of capillary pressure which is against to the experimental observations o carroll et al 2005 the unrealistic prediction by schulz s model may be sourced from the overprediction of the contact angle see fig 4 and the limitation on the radius of curvature of nwp wp interface see fig 5 additionally the ruptured wp phase see fig 2c was not considered in schulz s model which results in an overestimation of the wp saturation especially at low wp saturation conditions as shown in fig 12b s s w denotes the saturation predicted by schulz s model and s l w is that by the lvca pmm model the wp saturation predicted by schulz s model is 2 11 times higher than the wp saturation by lvca pmm model for totally wetting scenario θ 0 because of counting ruptured wp phase incorrectly fig 13 a 13b corresponding to the points a and b marked in fig 12a 13e 13f corresponding to the points c and d marked in fig 12a and 13i 13j corresponding to the points e and f marked in fig 12a compare the snapshots of wp nwp distribution predicted by lvca pmm model and schulz s model schulz et al 2014 when θ 30 60 and 85 respectively fig 13c 13d corresponding to the points a and b marked in fig 12a 13g 13h corresponding to the points c and d marked in fig 12a and 13k 13l corresponding to the points e and f marked in fig 12a compare the probability count of the resulted contact angle by lvca pmm model and schulz s model when θ 30 60 and 85 respectively the resulted contact angles are directly measured from the produced nwp wp distribution images by using the method proposed by scanziani et al 2017 the differences between the presupposed contact angle and the resulted contact angles for the snapshots of wp nwp distribution produced by lvca pmm model are generally less than 0 5 see fig 13c 13g and 13 k which may be caused by the discrepancy by representing disks with pixels in the digital space as pointed out by hilpert and miller 2001 however the distribution of resulted contact angles by schulz s model is wider and deviated from the presupposed contact angles see fig 13d 13h and 13 l it can be seen that when θ 30 fig 13a and 13b and 60 fig 13d and 13e the nwp invasion patterns predicted by lvca pmm and schulz s model are quite similar however the corresponding capillary pressures predicted by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 p c 23 4 pa for θ 30 in fig 13b p c 13 6 pa for θ 60 in fig 13h are smaller than the corresponding capillary pressures predicted by lvca pmm p c 25 4 pa for θ 30 in fig 13a p c 18 8 pa for θ 60 in fig 13g the underestimation of the capillary pressure by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 is due to the overestimation of the contact angle see fig 4 the resulted contact angle α by schulz s model schulz et al 2014 for θ 30 ranges from 34 38 with an average value of 36 2 as shown in fig 13d and α for θ 60 ranges from 72 to 85 with an average value of 79 4 as shown in fig 13h it should be noted that the nwp invasion patterns are significantly different between fig 13i and 13j despite their wp saturations are almost identical as illustrated in fig 13i a smooth wp nwp interface and the constant contact angle of 85 are successfully reproduced by the lvca pmm model however an unsmooth wp nwp interface see spinodes a b and c in fig 13j is predicted by schulz s model and the resulted contact angle α by schulz s model for θ 85 are widely distributed from 35 to 165 fig 13l the radius of curvature of wp nwp interface in fig 13j is 62 5 mm which is 6 25 12 5 times larger than the radius of disks in the media such a large radius of curvature leads to the wp nwp interfaces predicted schulz s model cannot form on the right disks as shown in fig 5 resulting in the misinterpretation of the nwp invasion front as well as the contact angle 5 conclusions the lvca pmm is proposed in this study to improve schulz s model schulz et al 2014 and enhance the pore morphology method pmm by taking into account locally variable contact angles in the lvca pmm the morphological erosion procedure in original pmm is replaced by subtracting the dilation of solid using digital disks with diameters determined by the particle sizes the capillary pressure and the contact angle while the morphological dilation procedure on nwp reservoir connected remaining pore space keeps unchanged an algorithm to replace the rupture wp phases is also included in the lvca pmm the lvca pmm model can be applied to partially wetting systems with different uniform and randomly assigned contact angles to produce the p c s w curves and the nwp wp distribution compared to the pmm model proposed by schulz et al 2014 the lvca pmm presents better macro and pore scale results particularly at high contact angle and high non uniformity in particle sizes it is worth noting that while the examples presented in this work were limited to porous media consist of disks in two dimensional cases or spheres in three dimensional cases by mimicking the shape of solid with disks or spheres in three dimensional cases the lvca pmm model can be applied to porous media composed of irregularly shaped solid credit authorship contribution statement xin liu conceptualization methodology data

3064,apportioning sources assessing flow pathways and quantifying the interaction between source and transport factors are critical for decreasing nutrient loss from agricultural catchments in this

1 nutrient management practices fertilizer rate placement timing directly influenced the magnitude of incidental nutrient loss and proportion of load that was derived from a fertilizer source it was estimated that 52 and 46 of cumulative no3 n and drp load respectively was incidental loss that occurred within 30 d of fertilizer application continuous re distribution of no3 n throughout the soil profile following fertilizer application resulted in a broad range of concentration across flow pathways and antecedent conditions in contrast dry conditions with tile water sourced from shallow soil water or precipitation resulted in greater but more variable drp concentration compared to wetter conditions when tile water was largely comprised of groundwater findings suggest that groundwater table dynamics exerted a strong control over drp concentration as similar surface tile hydrologic connectivity occurred during both dry and wet conditions but produced different water quality outcomes

monitoring of precipitation soil volumetric water content vwc soil water and groundwater fig 1 site location was based on topography and dominant soil type where kcl 1 and kcl 2 were located at higher blount soil series and lower pewamo soil series elevations respectively each site was equipped with a rain gauge which funneled precipitation rainfall and snow into a collection bottle for subsequent

the employed sampling strategy has minimal effects on nutrient concentrations king et al 2016 nutrient load was calculated by multiplying concentration by daily discharge williams et al 2015b daily tile drain water samples were also composited to match the sampling interval for rainfall soil water and groundwater and subsequently analyzed for ec and stable water isotopes 2 4 data analysis sources of tile drain water were evaluated using both two and three component hydrograph separation genereux 1998 hydrograph separation was completed for each sampling interval when the tile drain was flowing for two component hydrograph separation precipitation average of kcl 1 and kcl 2 and groundwater kcl 2 for each sampling interval were used as event water and pre event water end members respectively groundwater from kcl 1 routinely resulted in unrealistic mixing fractions i e 100 thus data from kcl 2 was utilized for the groundwater end member fractions of event water qe q and pre

error and spatial variability i e difference between kcl 1 and kcl 2 to determine how storm characteristics and antecedent wetness conditions influenced tile drain discharge and hydrograph mixing

intensity total discharge maximum discharge average discharge average soil moisture deficit smd and average groundwater table depth observed during the sampling interval soil moisture deficit was calculated for each soil horizon using measured soil vwc and summed together to estimate dynamic soil storage for the entire profile williams et al 2019 relationships between dissolved nutrient losses concentration and load and storm characteristics antecedent wetness conditions and two and three component mixing fractions were also evaluated using linear regression analyses was completed in r statistical software r core team 2014 to isolate the effects of recent nutrient management practices i e fertilizer application on edge of field nutrient loss linear relationships were developed between daily discharge and daily dissolved nutrient load for both the 30 d periods following fertilization fertilization periods and all remaining data non fertilization periods based on previous studies examining dissolved nutrient loss in drainage water following fertilizer application e g williams et al 2016b king et al 2018 it was assumed that direct loss of fertilizer i e incidental nutrient loss was likely to occur within a 30 d period following fertilizer application nutrient loss in tile drainage during both fertilization and non fertilization periods may also occur as the result of other sources e g soil n soil p or flow pathways with long residence times e g groundwater that may not reflect recent management practices meals et al 2010 thus linear relationships from the non fertilization period were applied to daily discharge from the fertilizer period this was used to estimate the immediate impact of fertilizer application on edge of field dissolved nutrient loss based on the calculated difference between the actual load and the load predicted via the non fertilization period relationship 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic conditions annual precipitation ranged

using the methods of genereux 1998 ranged from 1 to 35 average uncertainty 9 three component hydrograph separation was also completed for each sampling interval through addition of a third end member shallow soil water and second tracer ec shallow soil water was chosen as the third end member because it was consistently distinguishable from both precipitation and groundwater sources and also reflects the current conceptual model of nutrient transport to tile drains from surface soil layers using this approach qprecip q comprised on average 6 8 range 0 41 of tile discharge while qsoil q

non fertilization period was used to predict incidental nutrient loss during the 30 d periods following fertilization assuming that nutrient loss during fertilization periods was a combination of incidental loss and losses from other n sources and or flow pathways with long residence times i e losses not directly related to the fertilizer application for the first four n applications incidental losses accounted for 66 1 8 kg ha 1 72 8 6 kg ha 1 76 4 9 kg ha 1 and 45 0 7 kg ha 1 of the total no3 n load during the fertilization period respectively the fifth n application on july 12 2019 was not considered for this analysis since the study terminated prior to 30 d after application incidental no3 n loss summed across the four fertilization periods accounted for 52 16 0 kg ha 1 of the total no3 n load during the study 30 7 kg ha 1 fig 7 cumulative no3 n load was non linearly related to cumulative tile discharge largely due to fertilizer application in spring 2018 however when

tile drained fields utilizing two component hydrograph separation with precipitation and groundwater as event and pre event water end members respectively results indicated that event water comprised 24 26 of tile discharge with values ranging from 1 to 92 studies using a variety of tracers e g water isotopes ec water temperature bromide and two component separation have reported similar findings whereby event water typically comprises between 10 and 50 of tile discharge stone and wilson 2006 vidon and cuadra 2010 klaus et al 2013 williams et al 2016b zajicek et al 2016 pluer et al 2020 event water fractions are often equated with preferential flow and have been used to imply that a substantial portion of tile flow is comprised of precipitation that rapidly bypasses the soil matrix completed less frequently especially in agricultural landscapes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 three component hydrograph separation in the current study however suggests that direct precipitation contributions to tile flow were much smaller 6 8 than those estimated with two component hydrograph separation groundwater 65 31 and soil water 29 28 comprised the vast majority of tile discharge differences between two and three component hydrograph separation results can likely be attributed to the assumptions made as part of the two component separation two component separation assumes that soil water and groundwater signatures are similar klaus and mcdonnell 2013 but in reality vary with depth in the soil profile williams and mcafee 2021 additionally shallow soil water 10 and 20 cm depths had similar isotopic signatures to precipitation fig 3 which likely led to overestimates of the event water fractions with the two component approach the addition of a second tracer ec in the three component separation helped to better separate end members and provided a better estimate to water sources to tile drains laboratory and field scale experiments have shown that only small fractions of applied rainfall infiltrate beyond surface soils for instance only one third of the total water volume leached from the bottom of a 30 cm deep undisturbed soil monolith was irrigation water during a 33 mm rainfall simulation williams et al 2020 similarly soil water isotope data in conjunction with a compartmental mixing cell model showed that only 19 of soil water at 40 to 50 cm depths was from a 41 mm irrigation event klaus et al 2013 dye tracer studies provide further evidence of considerable mixing and or matrix flow within the topsoil e g ali et al 2018 thus infiltrating precipitation that mixes with and mobilizes pre event soil water and subsequently bypasses lower soil layers as preferential flow i e matrix derived preferential flow serves as one potential hypothesis to explain observed findings groundwater in tile drained fields may also serve as an isostat whereby larger volumes of water stored deeper in the soil profile that were mobilized during a precipitation event buffer the signature of small contributions of precipitation and shallow soil water this functioning would be akin to stream riparian areas where large stores of water control stream isotopic signatures by regulating small contributions from hillslopes tetzlaff et al 2014 alternatively sampling resolution used in the current study 8 3 d could underrepresent important short term processes with further quantification that includes high frequency measurements i e sub daily to daily needed in future work subsurface tile drain discharge exhibited a strong threshold behavior with smd and groundwater depth increasing soil saturation and rising groundwater table ultimately facilitated the majority of tile flow this finding compliments hydrograph separation results and highlights that soil water and groundwater are important components of tile flow results also agree with previous work showing that antecedent conditions are important for controlling subsurface hydrologic response lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 hanrahan et al 2021 for example in a drained field in ontario canada tile discharge was not initiated until soil moisture exceeded a saturation threshold lam et al 2016 threshold relationships between discharge and antecedent wetness are commonly observed across both natural and managed catchments tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 detty and mcguire 2010 ali et al 2015 lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 in drained fields results from the current study and others therefore indicate that metrics of antecedent wetness are a primary control on tile flow generation and once precipitation inputs exceed this threshold tile discharge will substantially increase with increases in precipitation amount conceptually data indicate two contrasting hydrologic states at the monitored field site dependent upon whether the groundwater table remains below or rises above tile drain depth when conditions are dry typically summer early fall elevated pet rates enhance desiccation cracking on the soil surface especially in fine textured soils at the study site the groundwater table remains well below tile drain depth and greater precipitation intensity is often observed under these conditions tile drain response to precipitation would be expected to be negligible or small and comprised largely of soil water and or precipitation that rapidly bypasses the soil matrix during the two year study only 9 of cumulative tile discharge 70 of 764 mm occurred when the groundwater table was less than tile depth in contrast when conditions are wet typically winter spring pet rates are low fields are fallow and the groundwater table frequently rises above tile drain depth tile drain response would be expected to be proportional to precipitation inputs i e greater rainfall amount would yield larger tile discharge with tile discharge largely comprised of groundwater and smaller fractions of soil water and precipitation 4 2 the role of nutrient source and agricultural management practices on dissolved nutrient loss measured no3 n and drp concentration and load were comparable to tile drainage nutrient losses across the region king et al 2015a williams et al 2015a pease et al 2018 and the u s midwest king et al 2015b christianson and harmel 2015 christianson et al 2016 for example median annual no3 n and drp load in tile drain water from forty fields within the eastern corn belt was 28 4 kg ha 1 hanrahan et al 2019 and 0 8 kg ha 1 pease et al 2018 respectively cumulative no3 n and drp load in the current study comprised 14 of cumulative n inputs and 2 of cumulative p inputs which is typical of nutrient budgets in agricultural landscapes hanrahan et al 2019 results suggest that fertilizer application affected edge of field drp load with nutrient management practices directly influencing the magnitude of incidental nutrient loss and the proportion of edge of field drp load that was derived from a fertilizer source for example the two p fertilizer applications fall 2017 spring 2019 had contrasting water quality responses dissolved reactive p concentration increased up to 5 62 mg l 1 and 0 35 mg l 1 following fertilizer application in fall 2017 and spring 2019 respectively fertilizer application rate was greater in fall 2017 35 6 vs 19 4 kg ha 1 however fertilizer placement is hypothesized to be the main factor influencing the magnitude of drp concentration in spring 2019 fertilizer was applied in the subsurface with the planter whereas in fall 2017 fertilizer was broadcast on the soil surface broadcast fertilizer applications pose a much larger risk for elevated drp concentrations in drainage water compared to fertilizer that is either incorporated or injected into the soil due to increased soil fertilizer contact when fertilizer is placed in the subsurface williams et al 2016b williams et al 2018a timing of fertilizer application relative to storm events also likely played a role in drp loss tile discharge during storm events during the 30 d period following fertilizer application was characterized by larger flow events largest flow event 23 6 mm vs 11 7 mm and greater cumulative flow 63 5 mm vs 27 5 mm in fall 2017 compared to spring 2019 if fertilizer had been incorporated following application in fall 2017 or if application was followed by smaller flow events drp load would be expected to be substantially less for instance using the relationship between daily discharge and daily drp load during the non fertilization period as a proxy for the potential impact of incorporating fertilizer in fall 2017 drp load would have been 70 g ha 1 during the 30 d period after fertilizer application rather than the measured 480 g ha 1 these findings show the important role nutrient management practices e g rate placement timing in determining the contribution of incidental drp losses to edge of field losses similar to drp concentration no3 n concentration increased following fertilizer application highlighting the importance of nutrient management practices on no3 n loss nitrate n losses were more affected by fertilizer application rate and application timing rather that fertilizer placement larger fertilizer application rates in spring 2018 67 2 and 84 0 kg ha 1 yielded larger losses of no3 n compared to smaller application rates in fall 2017 29 1 kg ha 1 and spring 2019 46 7 kg ha 1 similar effects of fertilizer application rate on no3 n loss in drainage water have been reported in other studies christianson and harmel 2015 king et al 2016 wet conditions with multiple large storm events during early spring 2018 which are typical for the study region williams and king 2020 also likely promoted elevated no3 n loss during the 30 d periods following fertilizer application while study results indicate that fertilizer application and incidental nutrient loss are imperative to edge of field nutrient loss it is also necessary to acknowledge that other nutrient sources and time periods outside the 30 d window following fertilizer application were equally important to cumulative dissolved nutrient loss increases in drp concentration in response to increases in tile discharge throughout the study period suggests that legacy soil p in surface soil horizons table 2 baker et al 2017 was a substantial source of drp to drainage water tile drain drp concentration is often related to soil p concentration duncan et al 2017 osterholz et al 2020 patterns of drp concentration increase with flow similar to the current study have also been observed at field and watershed scales and have been attributed to soil p contributions e g king et al 2017 unlike p which has a strong affinity for binding to soil and therefore accumulating in soil and becoming a legacy source soil n was likely only a small source of n delivered to tile drains as n does not often accumulate in soil indeed no3 n concentration peaked following fertilizer application in spring 2018 and subsequently declined to low levels by the end of the growing season which indicates that the majority of applied no3 n had been either taken up by crops or leached from the field it is hypothesized that the majority of no3 n loss during the non fertilization period was therefore no3 n from the most recent fertilizer application that was delayed in arriving in drainage water due to transport in slower flow pathways van metre et al 2016 or potentially released into the soil solution from growing legume crops owens et al 2000 the partitioning of cumulative dissolved nutrient load into different sources was specific to the study site and field management practices employed with changes in management hypothesized to alter the ratio of nutrient sources future work examining more comprehensive methods for apportioning nutrient sources is needed to improve estimates of soil and incidental fertilizer nutrient loads and reduce uncertainty in these estimates for instance a period of 30 d following fertilizer application was chosen in the current study to approximate the window of time in which direct loss from fertilizer would occur before equilibration with soil however changing this timing to 15 d or 180 d would yield varying results a clearer definition of legacy nutrients i e when does a fertilizer source become a legacy source through data analyses and tracer studies is also urgently needed to better apportion losses and develop strategies to mitigate dissolved nutrient losses in drained landscapes while such approximations are useful for making distinctions between the two sources equilibration of applied p and n to soil will vary as a function of application rate application method soil properties antecedent conditions and fertilizer form 4 3 the role of hydrologic processes on dissolved nutrient loss dissolved reactive p concentration in drainage water during both fertilization and non fertilization periods was related to metrics of antecedent wetness i e smd and groundwater table depth and water sources i e hydrograph components relationships between water sources and drp concentration were improved using three component hydrograph separation compared to two component hydrograph separation however the strongest observed relationships were between antecedent wetness metrics and drp concentration findings indicate that when soils were dry groundwater table was below tile depth and near surface soil water and or precipitation comprised the largest fractions of tile flow drp concentration was greater and more variable in contrast when soils were wet groundwater table was above tile depth and groundwater comprised the largest fraction of tile flow drp concentration was low and more stable while the magnitude of drp concentration varied this trend persisted during both fertilization and non fertilization periods most p either as fertilizer or soil p is located in surface 0 5 cm soil horizons baker et al 2017 duncan et al 2017 osterholz et al 2020 when tile water was sourced solely from the soil surface as either precipitation or soil water during dry antecedent conditions elevated drp concentration was therefore observed with variability in drp concentration hypothesized to be related to p desorption kinetics penn et al 2022 this finding supports the current conceptual model of drp transport to tile drains whereby preferential flow pathways provide a direct connection between soil surface horizons and tile drains and result in elevated concentrations in drainage water e g smith et al 2015 based on hydrograph separation results surface tile hydrologic connectivity in the current study occurred not only under dry antecedent conditions but also wet antecedent conditions despite precipitation and shallow soil water contributing to tile flow under wet antecedent conditions drp concentration was on average 50 lower 0 04 mg l 1 vs 0 08 mg l 1 compared to dry antecedent conditions it is often assumed that surface processes e g rainfall intensity soil characteristics e g abiotic or biotic preferential flow pathways and surface tile connectivity determine drp concentration magnitude in drainage water results from the current study however indicate that subsurface processes specifically the positioning of the groundwater table relative to tile depth may exert a stronger control on drp concentration it is postulated that groundwater functions as both a hydrologic and chemical buffer to regulate tile drain drp concentration when the groundwater table is above tile depth the larger volume of subsurface stored water would serve to dilute elevated drp concentrations transported with precipitation and or shallow soil water i e hydrologic buffer groundwater also has a long residence time 225 334 d williams and mcafee 2021 longer residence times allow drp to have a high degree of contact and contact time with low p subsoil and increasing the likelihood of p sorption on subsoils thereby lowering drp concentration i e chemical buffer hence a groundwater table above tile depth produced drp concentrations that were lower and more consistent future work on the role of groundwater dynamics on drp transport is needed including its effect on intra and inter event drp concentration patterns and differences between fields i e persistent vs flashy groundwater table nitrate n concentration was not related to any metrics of antecedent wetness storm characteristics or water sources while p can accumulate in surface soils no3 n is much more mobile owing its transport character to soil physical properties and water movement patterns rather than soil chemical properties given this increased mobility throughout the soil profile it is likely that the processes controlling no3 n transport changed over time and resulted in poor relationships among factors as no3 n went from concentrated in surface soils immediately after fertilizer application to diffuse and distributed through the soil profile during the weeks to months after application nitrate n concentration time series see fig 6 especially following fertilizer application in spring 2018 provide evidence of varying flow pathways and processes following fertilizer application no3 n increased relative to pre application but was highly variable during the days to weeks after application over time the variability in no3 n concentration decreased as concentration decreased suggesting a more diffuse and consistent delivery of no3 n time of stabilization for no3 n concentration to reach 1 0 mg l 1 from fertilizer application in spring to summer 2018 was 130 170 d which was similar to mean residence time of deeper soil water 60 80 cm 124 193 d williams and mcafee 2021 at the study site thus information on fertilizer application timing and rate and the mean residence time of soil water near tile depth may be a better predictor of no3 n delivery to tile drains rather than specific flow pathways both no3 n and drp load were strongly related to tile discharge during both fertilization and non fertilization periods although the slope of the relationship varied between periods while no3 n and drp load were strongly related to tile discharge examination of relationships between nutrient concentration antecedent wetness and hydrograph components indicated that processes producing the strong connection between load and discharge varied between no3 n and drp for no3 n continuous re distribution of n throughout the soil profile resulted in a broad range of concentration observed in tile drainage water across flow pathways antecedent conditions and storm events as a result no3 n concentration was on average similar across conditions i e chemostatic with loading then largely proportional to flow volume such re distribution of p sources within the soil profile does not occur as quickly as n instead requiring years to decades thus for drp groundwater was the main driver producing strong relationships between load and tile discharge since most tile discharge was generated when the groundwater table was above tile depth drp concentrations in drainage water during high flows were relatively consistent i e groundwater functioning as a hydrologic and chemical buffer irrespective of fertilization or non fertilization periods previous studies in drained landscapes have found similar findings where drp was chemostatic when daily tile flow was greater than the 50th percentile and chemodynamic when tile flow was less than the 50th percentile across a range of fields with varying soil test p concentration williams et al 2018b thus the difference between chemostatic and chemodynamic drp transport may largely depend on groundwater table dynamics rather than the magnitude of stored p or the source of p i e fertilizer vs soil p findings from the current study therefore provide an alternative hypothesis for chemostatic nutrient export patterns in drained landscapes compared to previous work which have often attributed these patterns to accumulated nutrient stores e g basu et al 2010 guan et al 2011 thompson et al 2011 williams et al 2016a 5 summary and conclusions combined measurements of water nutrient and tracer fluxes revealed novel insights into source and transport factors controlling nutrient delivery to tile drains tile discharge was primarily sourced from groundwater and soil water williams and mcafee 2021 with both tile flow and hydrograph components well correlated to metrics of precipitation and antecedent conditions nutrient management practices including fertilizer application rate fertilizer placement and fertilizer application timing had a substantial effect on dissolved nutrient loss in drainage water larger application rates fertilizer broadcast on the soil surface and fertilizer applied before large storm events resulted in a substantial portion of cumulative no3 n and drp load occurring as incidental loss during 30 d periods following fertilizer application given its mobility and continuous re distribution throughout the soil profile following fertilizer application no3 n concentration was on average similar regardless of the dominant water source or antecedent conditions as a result no3 n load was proportional to tile discharge the magnitude and timing of no3 n loss may therefore be best predicted using the fertilizer application rate and the mean transit time of deep soil water i e near tile drain depth in contrast drp concentration was related to both metrics of antecedent wetness and water sources during dry conditions when the water table was below tile drain depth tile hydrograph response to precipitation was small water was sourced from either shallow soil water or precipitation and drp concentration tended to be high but variable alternatively during wet conditions when the water table was near or above tile depth tile flow increased with increasing precipitation amount water was sourced from groundwater and drp concentration was low and relatively stable findings indicate that groundwater dynamics specifically the position of the water table relative to tile drain depth exerts an important control on drp delivery to tile drains groundwater may serve to dilute elevated drp concentration transported from the soil surface hydrologic buffering and long groundwater residence times allow for increased contact with subsoils and the potential for p sorption chemical buffering since the majority of tile discharge 91 occurred when groundwater was above tile depth drp load was therefore proportional to tile flow further exploration of the effect of groundwater dynamics on nutrient delivery to tile drains especially drp is needed including the role groundwater plays on intra and inter event drp concentration patterns and differences between fields results from the current study highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic interaction between hydrologic processes and nutrient pools fertilizer and soil as this relationship determined the amount source and timing of nutrient delivery to tile drains changes to either source or transport factors can alter no3 n and drp delivery to tile drains which has direct implications for both nutrient and water management practice implementation small changes in fertilizer application practices would have likely yielded substantial reductions in dissolved nutrient load in the current study additionally it is likely that hydrologic processes not only transport nutrients but also impact soil chemistry e g p desorption from soil penn et al 2022 which could be especially important for understanding dissolved nutrient loss from legacy soil sources results from the current study are crucial for improving subsurface water and nutrient transport in numerical models commonly used models often lack or misrepresent critical processes controlling subsurface nutrient transport e g radcliffe et al 2015 thus data on water nutrient and tracer fluxes like those collected in the current study will allow for testing efficiencies in models simulating water and

1 nutrient management practices fertilizer rate placement timing directly influenced the magnitude of incidental nutrient loss and proportion of load that was derived from a fertilizer source it was estimated that 52 and 46 of cumulative no3 n and drp load respectively was incidental loss that occurred within 30 d of fertilizer application continuous re distribution of no3 n throughout the soil profile following fertilizer application resulted in a broad range of concentration across flow pathways and antecedent conditions in contrast dry conditions with tile water sourced from shallow soil water or precipitation resulted in greater but more variable drp concentration compared to wetter conditions when tile water was largely comprised of groundwater findings suggest that groundwater table dynamics exerted a strong control over drp concentration as similar surface tile hydrologic connectivity occurred during both dry and wet conditions but produced different water quality outcomes

environmental objectives in drained agroecosystems kleinman et al 2018 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are often applied to agricultural fields one or more times during a crop rotation numerous studies have measured increased nutrient loss in drainage water following fertilizer application jaynes et al 2001 helmers et al 2012 king et al 2018 this incidental nutrient loss can be substantial when fertilizer application precedes a large storm event e g williams et al 2018a in some extreme cases liquid manure can be transported directly to tile drains following application geohring et al 1998 more commonly elevated nutrient concentrations are observed during storm events days to weeks after application e g williams et al 2016b time series analysis of discharge and water quality datasets also point to the influence of legacy nutrients i e nutrients accumulated and stored throughout a catchment kleinman et al 2011 on drainage water losses basu et al 2010 jarvie et al 2013 van meter et al 2018 williams et al 2016a stackpoole et al 2019 chang et al 2021 nitrogen in groundwater or p desorption from surface soil horizons can result in large cumulative nutrient losses over time independent of contemporary agricultural practices meals et al 2010 nutrient transport to tile drains is hypothesized to be controlled by the degree of hydrologic connectivity between surface soils and tile drains it is widely presumed that abiotic e g desiccation cracks or biotic e g earthworm burrows preferential flow pathways connecting surface soils and tile drains are responsible for elevated p losses in drainage water stamm et al 1998 simard et al 2000 vidon and cuadra 2011 king et al 2015b whereas slower less surface connected flow pathways i e groundwater transport the majority of n wagner et al 2008 kennedy et al 2012 conservative tracers suggest preferential flows that are often associated with new water or event water typically comprise between 10 and 50 of tile discharge although these contributions can vary widely vidon and cuadra 2010 klaus et al 2013 zajicek et al 2016 smith and capel 2018 williams and mcafee 2021 conceptually increasing p concentration and decreasing n concentration would be expected as event water comprises an increasing fraction of total tile discharge studies measuring tracer and solute fluxes p pesticides and others immediately following application have generally found elevated solute concentrations associated with greater event water fractions kung et al 2000 stone and wilson 2006 vidon and cuadra 2011 williams et al 2016b williams et al 2018a thus providing support for surface tile drain connectivity as the primary process controlling transport moving beyond the time period directly following fertilizer application the relationship between surface tile hydrologic connectivity and water quality is less clear for example macrae et al 2019 classified hydrologic conditions for multiple fields and years expecting variable p concentration based on the degree of surface tile drain connectivity however similar p concentrations were observed irrespective of connectivity poor relationships between tracer and nutrient fluxes suggest other processes may be important for nutrient delivery during periods without fertilization pluer et al 2020 source and transport are widely regarded as important for nutrient delivery from agricultural catchments e g pionke et al 2000 despite this recognition the relative contribution of recently applied fertilizers and legacy soil nutrient sources to overall nutrient loss is largely unknown guo et al 2021 hydrologic processes responsible for nutrient transport to tile drains are also understudied and often focus on specific conditions e g periods after fertilization

water radcliffe et al 2015 thus water and tracer flux data can be useful for improving the representation of subsurface processes to address these needs we measured water nutrient and tracer stable water isotopes electrical conductivity fluxes from a tile drained field across a range of hydroclimatic conditions and agricultural management activities the current study builds upon williams and mcafee 2021 which evaluated water storage mixing and fluxes in a tile drained field to better understand how flow pathways storm characteristics and antecedent conditions influence the nutrient delivery to tile drains specific study objectives were to 1 determine water flow pathways to tile drains and examine the influence of storm characteristics and antecedent conditions on flow partitioning 2 quantify n and p fluxes in drainage water and evaluate the relative contribution of recent nutrient management practices to overall losses and 3 assess linkages between water flow pathways and nutrient delivery to tile drains 2 methods 2 1 site description an agricultural field 22 7 ha with tile drainage depth 0 8 m spacing 9 1 m located in northeastern indiana usa 41 32 01 n 84 48 38 w was monitored fig 1 the field was cropped in a three year rotation of corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and wheat avena sativa l with a cover crop mixture planted during the non growing season a detailed accounting of field agricultural practices is shown in table 1 the surface topography of the field was flat slopes 0 2 fig 1 and soils were classified as either blount silt loam fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs somewhat poorly drained or pewamo silty clay fine mixed active mesic typic argiaquolls very poorly drained which were found at higher and lower elevations respectively select soil physiochemical properties are shown in table 2 long term average annual temperature at the study site is 10 c and annual rainfall varies across the western lake erie basin from 833 to 1 135 mm williams and king 2020 2 2 precipitation soil moisture soil water and groundwater monitoring two sampling sites kcl 1 and kcl 2 were established 35 m from the field edge for monitoring of precipitation soil volumetric water content vwc soil water and groundwater fig 1 site location was based on topography and dominant soil type where kcl 1 and kcl 2 were located at higher blount soil series and lower pewamo soil series elevations respectively each site was equipped with a rain gauge which funneled precipitation rainfall and snow into a collection bottle for subsequent analysis soil vwc at each site was measured with four moisture sensors ech2o ec 5 meter group inc pullman wa installed at depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm a groundwater well 2 m deep screened depth 1 2 m was also installed at each site and depth sensors hydros 21 meter group inc were used to record water level in the wells both soil vwc and water depth in the wells were recorded hourly ceramic soil solution samplers were installed at depths of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm at both kcl 1 and kcl 2 a continuous vacuum of 12 kpa was maintained in each sampler by means of a hanging water column e g riekerk and morris 1983 thus samples collected in the ceramic samplers represented the mobile faction of soil water water samples from the rain gauges groundwater wells and soil solution samplers were collected every 4 to 21 d mean 8 3 d from june 2017 through august 2019 for a total of 97 sampling intervals all water samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity ec and stable water isotopes δ18o and δ2h stable water isotope ratios were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 45 ep los gatos research san jose ca against reference values calibrated to vienna standard mean ocean water instrument precision for δ18o and δ2h was 0 11 and 0 5 respectively 2 3 weather and subsurface tile drainage a weather station lufft ws600 lufft usa inc carpinteria ca located near the field edge measured rainfall amount and intensity air temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation at a 10 min interval fig 1 subsurface tile discharge was also measured at the field edge as described by williams et al 2016c briefly the tile drain outlet was equipped with a compound weir insert thel mar brevard nc where the original outlet draining the field was cut and fitted with a 30 cm diameter pipe that facilitated the installation of the weir insert water level was recorded at a 10 min interval using an isco signature flow meter teledyne isco lincoln ne and an area velocity sensor isco 2150 was also used to measure water level and flow velocity when the tile outlet became submerged daily water samples were collected from the tile drain using an automated water sampler isco 6712 filtered 0 45 µm and analyzed for nitrate n no3 n and dissolved reactive p drp gallery discrete analyzer thermo scientific waltham ma daily water samples were composed of six subsamples collected every four hours that were composited into a single bottle with sample bottles retrieved weekly from the field samples were not preserved in the field however previous testing has shown that the employed sampling strategy has minimal effects on nutrient concentrations king et al 2016 nutrient load was calculated by multiplying concentration by daily discharge williams et al 2015b daily tile drain water samples were also composited to match the sampling interval for rainfall soil water and groundwater and subsequently analyzed for ec and stable water isotopes 2 4 data analysis sources of tile drain water were evaluated using both two and three component hydrograph separation genereux 1998 hydrograph separation was completed for each sampling interval when the tile drain was flowing for two component hydrograph separation precipitation average of kcl 1 and kcl 2 and groundwater kcl 2 for each sampling interval were used as event water and pre event water end members respectively groundwater from kcl 1 routinely resulted in unrealistic mixing fractions i e 100 thus data from kcl 2 was utilized for the groundwater end member fractions of event water qe q and pre event water qpe q in tile discharge were calculated using δ18o signatures as a tracer for three component hydrograph separation precipitation average of kcl 1 and kcl 2 shallow soil water 10 20 cm depths average of kcl 1 and kcl 2 and groundwater kcl 2 were used as end members the fractions of precipitation qprecip q shallow soil water qsoil q and groundwater qgw q were determined using δ18o signatures and ec as tracers uncertainty in both two and three component hydrograph separation was estimated using the gaussian standard error method of genereux 1998 accounting for both laboratory error and spatial variability i e difference between kcl 1 and kcl 2 to determine how storm characteristics and antecedent wetness conditions influenced tile drain discharge and hydrograph mixing fractions spearman rank correlation was completed tile drain discharge and mixing fractions from both two and three component hydrograph separation were compared to precipitation amount precipitation intensity total discharge maximum discharge average discharge average soil moisture deficit smd and average groundwater table depth observed during the sampling interval soil moisture deficit was calculated for each soil horizon using measured soil vwc and summed together to estimate dynamic soil storage for the entire profile williams et al 2019 relationships between dissolved nutrient losses concentration and load and storm characteristics antecedent wetness conditions and two and three component mixing fractions were also evaluated using linear regression analyses was completed in r statistical software r core team 2014 to isolate the effects of recent nutrient management practices i e fertilizer application on edge of field nutrient loss linear relationships were developed between daily discharge and daily dissolved nutrient load for both the 30 d periods following fertilization fertilization periods and all remaining data non fertilization periods based on previous studies examining dissolved nutrient loss in drainage water following fertilizer application e g williams et al 2016b king et al 2018 it was assumed that direct loss of fertilizer i e incidental nutrient loss was likely to occur within a 30 d period following fertilizer application nutrient loss in tile drainage during both fertilization and non fertilization periods may also occur as the result of other sources e g soil n soil p or flow pathways with long residence times e g groundwater that may not reflect recent management practices meals et al 2010 thus linear relationships from the non fertilization period were applied to daily discharge from the fertilizer period this was used to estimate the immediate impact of fertilizer application on edge of field dissolved nutrient loss based on the calculated difference between the actual load and the load predicted via the non fertilization period relationship 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic conditions annual precipitation ranged

precipitation did not exhibit spatial or temporal patterns and averaged 48 33 µs cm 1 fig 3 shallow soil water 10 and 20 cm depths δ18o generally followed patterns observed in precipitation albeit with slight dampening and smoothing of soil water values relative to precipitation fig 3 similar to precipitation shallow soil water δ18o did not vary between sites kcl 1 vs kcl 2 or between depths 10

landscape position i e kcl 1 oxygen 18 and ec for soil water at depths of 40 60 and 80 cm fell between values for shallow soil water and groundwater data not shown and as a result were difficult to distinguish from each other and from either shallow soil water or groundwater depending on the antecedent conditions williams and mcafee 2021 during dry antecedent conditions when the groundwater table was deep in the profile δ18o and ec at these intermediate depths were similar to shallow soil water however during wet antecedent conditions when the groundwater table was frequently observed between 40 and 80 cm δ18o and ec were similar to groundwater 3 2 2 two and three component hydrograph separation using precipitation average of kcl 1 and kcl 2 and groundwater kcl 2 as end members and δ18o as a tracer event water qe q and pre event qpe q fractions of tile discharge were determined for each sampling interval event water comprised 1 to 92 mean 24 26 of tile discharge fig 4 on average qe q was greater during the winter 31 20 and summer 29 27 compared to the spring 20 14 and fall 17 15 uncertainty in two component hydrograph separation for individual sampling intervals calculated using the methods of genereux 1998 ranged from 1 to 35 average uncertainty 9 three component hydrograph separation was also completed for each sampling interval through addition of a third end member shallow soil water and second tracer ec shallow soil water was chosen as the third end member because it was consistently distinguishable from both precipitation and groundwater sources and also reflects the current conceptual model of nutrient transport to tile drains from surface soil layers using this approach qprecip q comprised on average 6 8 range 0 41 of tile discharge while qsoil q and qgw q comprised 29 28 range 0 100 and 65 31 range 0 100 of tile discharge respectively fig 4 qprecip q was consistent across seasons 4 8 in contrast qsoil q and qgw q varied seasonally whereby qsoil q tended to be greater in summer 53 compared to other seasons 17 28 and qgw q tended to be lower in the summer 39 compared to other seasons 66 78 cumulatively qprecip q qsoil q and qgw q accounted for 81 150 and 533 mm of total tile discharge 764 mm respectively uncertainty in three component hydrograph separation across flow components and sampling intervals ranged from 2 to 27 average uncertainty 10 3 2 3 effect of storm characteristics and antecedent conditions on discharge and hydrograph components relationships among storm characteristics antecedent wetness conditions and two and three component hydrograph separation results are shown in fig 5 with spearman rank correlation coefficients and p values provided in supplemental table 1 tile discharge was positively correlated with precipitation amount ρ 0 53 p 0 001 and smd ρ 0 70 p 0 001 while negatively correlated with groundwater table depth ρ 0 70 p 0 001 thresholds where discharge dramatically increased with an increase in both smd and groundwater table depth were visible fig 5 further analysis using segmented regression segmented package r statistical software was completed to determine threshold or break point values tile discharge substantially increased when smd was greater than 17 3 mm and when groundwater table depth was 0 84 0 03 m event water fraction of discharge calculated via two component hydrograph separation was correlated to precipitation amount ρ 0 23 p 0 030 and total discharge ρ 0 21 p 0 040 fig 5 relationships between qpe q and storm characteristics tile discharge and antecedent conditions are the inverse of qe q from three component hydrograph separation qprecip q was positively correlated to both precipitation amount ρ 0 32 p 0 002 and precipitation intensity ρ 0

0 42 p 0 001 while greater smd resulted in decreased qsoil q ρ 0 48 p 0 001 and increased qgw q ρ 0 49 p 0 001 3 3 nutrient concentration and load 3 3 1 nitrate and dissolved reactive phosphorus daily no3 n concentration in tile water ranged from 0 01 to 23 38 mg l 1 fig 6 nitrate concentration averaged 3 85 1 91 mg l 1 from june 2017 through february 2018 after which concentration started to increase tile water no3 n concentration peaked in april and may 2018 10 61 2 83 mg l 1 nitrate concentration declined throughout spring and summer 2018 with no3 n concentration remaining low 1 31 1 56

non fertilization period was used to predict incidental nutrient loss during the 30 d periods following fertilization assuming that nutrient loss during fertilization periods was a combination of incidental loss and losses from other n sources and or flow pathways with long residence times i e losses not directly related to the fertilizer application for the first four n applications incidental losses accounted for 66 1 8 kg ha 1 72 8 6 kg ha 1 76 4 9 kg ha 1 and 45 0 7 kg ha 1 of the total no3 n load during the fertilization period respectively the fifth n application on july 12 2019 was not considered for this analysis since the study terminated prior to 30 d after application incidental no3 n loss summed across the four fertilization periods accounted for 52 16 0 kg ha 1 of the total no3 n load during the study 30 7 kg ha 1 fig 7 cumulative no3 n load was non linearly related to cumulative tile discharge largely due to fertilizer application in spring 2018 however when

q non fertilization period all data fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 water sources and fluxes to tile drains hydrograph separation over the two year study provided valuable insight into water velocities within tile drained fields utilizing two component hydrograph separation with precipitation and groundwater as event and pre event water end members respectively results indicated that event water comprised 24 26 of tile discharge with values ranging from 1 to 92 studies using a variety of tracers e g water isotopes ec water temperature bromide and two component separation have reported similar findings whereby event water typically comprises between 10 and 50 of tile discharge stone and wilson 2006 vidon and cuadra 2010 klaus et al 2013 williams et al 2016b zajicek et al 2016 pluer et al 2020 event water fractions are often equated with preferential flow and have been used to imply that a substantial portion of tile flow is comprised of precipitation that rapidly bypasses the soil matrix completed less frequently especially in agricultural landscapes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 three component hydrograph separation in the current study however suggests that direct precipitation contributions to tile flow were much smaller 6 8 than those estimated with two component hydrograph separation groundwater 65 31 and soil water 29 28 comprised the vast majority of tile discharge differences between two and three component hydrograph separation results can likely be attributed to the assumptions made as part of the two component separation two component separation assumes that soil water and groundwater signatures are similar klaus and mcdonnell 2013 but in reality vary with depth in the soil profile williams and mcafee 2021 additionally shallow soil water 10 and 20 cm depths had similar isotopic signatures to precipitation fig 3 which likely led to overestimates of the event water fractions with the two component approach the addition of a second tracer ec in the three component separation helped to better separate end members and provided a better estimate to water sources to tile drains laboratory and field scale experiments have shown that only small fractions of applied rainfall infiltrate beyond surface soils for instance only one third of the total water volume leached from the bottom of a 30 cm deep undisturbed soil monolith was irrigation water during a 33 mm rainfall simulation williams et al 2020 similarly soil water isotope data in conjunction with a compartmental mixing cell model showed that only 19 of soil water at 40 to 50 cm depths was from a 41 mm irrigation event klaus et al 2013 dye tracer studies provide further evidence of considerable mixing and or matrix flow within the topsoil e g ali et al 2018 thus infiltrating precipitation that mixes with and mobilizes pre event soil water and subsequently bypasses lower soil layers as preferential flow i e matrix derived preferential flow serves as one potential hypothesis to explain observed findings groundwater in tile drained fields may also serve as an isostat whereby larger volumes of water stored deeper in the soil profile that were mobilized during a precipitation event buffer the signature of small contributions of precipitation and shallow soil water this functioning would be akin to stream riparian areas where large stores of water control stream isotopic signatures by regulating small contributions from hillslopes tetzlaff et al 2014 alternatively sampling resolution used in the current study 8 3 d could underrepresent important short term processes with further quantification that includes high frequency measurements i e sub daily to daily needed in future work subsurface tile drain discharge exhibited a strong threshold behavior with smd and groundwater depth increasing soil saturation and rising groundwater table ultimately facilitated the majority of tile flow this finding compliments hydrograph separation results and highlights that soil water and groundwater are important components of tile flow results also agree with previous work showing that antecedent conditions are important for controlling subsurface hydrologic response lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 hanrahan et al 2021 for example in a drained field in ontario canada tile discharge was not initiated until soil moisture exceeded a saturation threshold lam et al 2016 threshold relationships between discharge and antecedent wetness are commonly observed across both natural and managed catchments tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 detty and mcguire 2010 ali et al 2015 lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 in drained fields results from the current study and others therefore indicate that metrics of antecedent wetness are a primary control on tile flow generation and once precipitation inputs exceed this threshold tile discharge will substantially increase with increases in precipitation amount conceptually data indicate two contrasting hydrologic states at the monitored field site dependent upon whether the groundwater table remains below or rises above tile drain depth when conditions are dry typically summer early fall elevated pet rates enhance desiccation cracking on the soil surface especially in fine textured soils at the study site the groundwater table remains well below tile drain depth and greater precipitation intensity is often observed under these conditions tile drain response to precipitation would be expected to be negligible or small and comprised largely of soil water and or precipitation that rapidly bypasses the soil matrix during the two year study only 9 of cumulative tile discharge 70 of 764 mm occurred when the groundwater table was less than tile depth in contrast when conditions are wet typically winter spring pet rates are low fields are fallow and the groundwater table frequently rises above tile drain depth tile drain response would be expected to be proportional to precipitation inputs i e greater rainfall amount would yield larger tile discharge with tile discharge largely comprised of groundwater and smaller fractions of soil water and precipitation 4 2 the role of nutrient source and agricultural management practices on dissolved nutrient loss measured no3 n and drp concentration and load were comparable to tile drainage nutrient losses across the region king et al 2015a williams et al 2015a pease et al 2018 and the u s midwest king et al 2015b christianson and harmel 2015 christianson et al 2016 for example median annual no3 n and drp load in tile drain water from forty fields within the eastern corn belt was 28 4 kg ha 1 hanrahan et al 2019 and 0 8 kg ha 1 pease et al 2018 respectively cumulative no3 n and drp load in the current study comprised 14 of cumulative n inputs and 2 of cumulative p inputs which is typical of nutrient budgets in agricultural landscapes hanrahan et al 2019 results suggest that fertilizer application affected edge of field drp load with nutrient management practices directly influencing the magnitude of incidental nutrient loss and the proportion of edge of field drp load that was derived from a fertilizer source for example the two p fertilizer applications fall 2017 spring 2019 had contrasting water quality responses dissolved reactive p concentration increased up to 5 62 mg l 1 and 0 35 mg l 1 following fertilizer application in fall 2017 and spring 2019 respectively fertilizer application rate was greater in fall 2017 35 6 vs 19 4 kg ha 1 however fertilizer placement is hypothesized to be the main factor influencing the magnitude of drp concentration in spring 2019 fertilizer was applied in the subsurface with the planter whereas in fall 2017 fertilizer was broadcast on the soil surface broadcast fertilizer applications pose a much larger risk for elevated drp concentrations in drainage water compared to fertilizer that is either incorporated or injected into the soil due to increased soil fertilizer contact when fertilizer is placed in the subsurface williams et al 2016b williams et al 2018a timing of fertilizer application relative to storm events also likely played a role in drp loss tile discharge during storm events during the 30 d period following fertilizer application was characterized by larger flow events largest flow event 23 6 mm vs 11 7 mm and greater cumulative flow 63 5 mm vs 27 5 mm in fall 2017 compared to spring 2019 if fertilizer had been incorporated following application in fall 2017 or if application was followed by smaller flow events drp load would be expected to be substantially less for instance using the relationship between daily discharge and daily drp load during the non fertilization period as a proxy for the potential impact of incorporating fertilizer in fall 2017 drp load would have been 70 g ha 1 during the 30 d period after fertilizer application rather than the measured 480 g ha 1 these findings show the important role nutrient management practices e g rate placement timing in determining the contribution of incidental drp losses to edge of field losses similar to drp concentration no3 n concentration increased following fertilizer application highlighting the importance of nutrient management practices on no3 n loss nitrate n losses were more affected by fertilizer application rate and application timing rather that fertilizer placement larger fertilizer application rates in spring 2018 67 2 and 84 0 kg ha 1 yielded larger losses of no3 n compared to smaller application rates in fall 2017 29 1 kg ha 1 and spring 2019 46 7 kg ha 1 similar effects of fertilizer application rate on no3 n loss in drainage water have been reported in other studies christianson and harmel 2015 king et al 2016 wet conditions with multiple large storm events during early spring 2018 which are typical for the study region williams and king 2020 also likely promoted elevated no3 n loss during the 30 d periods following fertilizer application while study results indicate that fertilizer application and incidental nutrient loss are imperative to edge of field nutrient loss it is also necessary to acknowledge that other nutrient sources and time periods outside the 30 d window following fertilizer application were equally important to cumulative dissolved nutrient loss increases in drp concentration in response to increases in tile discharge throughout the study period suggests that legacy soil p in surface soil horizons table 2 baker et al 2017 was a substantial source of drp to drainage water tile drain drp concentration is often related to soil p concentration duncan et al 2017 osterholz et al 2020 patterns of drp concentration increase with flow similar to the current study have also been observed at field and watershed scales and have been attributed to soil p contributions e g king et al 2017 unlike p which has a strong affinity for binding to soil and therefore accumulating in soil and becoming a legacy source soil n was likely only a small source of n delivered to tile drains as n does not often accumulate in soil indeed no3 n concentration peaked following fertilizer application in spring 2018 and subsequently declined to low levels by the end of the growing season which indicates that the majority of applied no3 n had been either taken up by crops or leached from the field it is hypothesized that the majority of no3 n loss during the non fertilization period was therefore no3 n from the most recent fertilizer application that was delayed in arriving in drainage water due to transport in slower flow pathways van metre et al 2016 or potentially released into the soil solution from growing legume crops owens et al 2000 the partitioning of cumulative dissolved nutrient load into different sources was specific to the study site and field management practices employed with changes in management hypothesized to alter the ratio of nutrient sources future work examining more comprehensive methods for apportioning nutrient sources is needed to improve estimates of soil and incidental fertilizer nutrient loads and reduce uncertainty in these estimates for instance a period of 30 d following fertilizer application was chosen in the current study to approximate the window of time in which direct loss from fertilizer would occur before equilibration with soil however changing this timing to 15 d or 180 d would yield varying results a clearer definition of legacy nutrients i e when does a fertilizer source become a legacy source through data analyses and tracer studies is also urgently needed to better apportion losses and develop strategies to mitigate dissolved nutrient losses in drained landscapes while such approximations are useful for making distinctions between the two sources equilibration of applied p and n to soil will vary as a function of application rate application method soil properties antecedent conditions and fertilizer form 4 3 the role of hydrologic processes on dissolved nutrient loss dissolved reactive p concentration in drainage water during both fertilization and non fertilization periods was related to metrics of antecedent wetness i e smd and groundwater table depth and water sources i e hydrograph components relationships between water sources and drp concentration were improved using three component hydrograph separation compared to two component hydrograph separation however the strongest observed relationships were between antecedent wetness metrics and drp concentration findings indicate that when soils were dry groundwater table was below tile depth and near surface soil water and or precipitation comprised the largest fractions of tile flow drp concentration was greater and more variable in contrast when soils were wet groundwater table was above tile depth and groundwater comprised the largest fraction of tile flow drp concentration was low and more stable while the magnitude of drp concentration varied this trend persisted during both fertilization and non fertilization periods most p either as fertilizer or soil p is located in surface 0 5 cm soil horizons baker et al 2017 duncan et al 2017 osterholz et al 2020 when tile water was sourced solely from the soil surface as either precipitation or soil water during dry antecedent conditions elevated drp concentration was therefore observed with variability in drp concentration hypothesized to be related to p desorption kinetics penn et al 2022 this finding supports the current conceptual model of drp transport to tile drains whereby preferential flow pathways provide a direct connection between soil surface horizons and tile drains and result in elevated concentrations in drainage water e g smith et al 2015 based on hydrograph separation results surface tile hydrologic connectivity in the current study occurred not only under dry antecedent conditions but also wet antecedent conditions despite precipitation and shallow soil water contributing to tile flow under wet antecedent conditions drp concentration was on average 50 lower 0 04 mg l 1 vs 0 08 mg l 1 compared to dry antecedent conditions it is often assumed that surface processes e g rainfall intensity soil characteristics e g abiotic or biotic preferential flow pathways and surface tile connectivity determine drp concentration magnitude in drainage water results from the current study however indicate that subsurface processes specifically the positioning of the groundwater table relative to tile depth may exert a stronger control on drp concentration it is postulated that groundwater functions as both a hydrologic and chemical buffer to regulate tile drain drp concentration when the groundwater table is above tile depth the larger volume of subsurface stored water would serve to dilute elevated drp concentrations transported with precipitation and or shallow soil water i e hydrologic buffer groundwater also has a long residence time 225 334 d williams and mcafee 2021 longer residence times allow drp to have a high degree of contact and contact time with low p subsoil and increasing the likelihood of p sorption on subsoils thereby lowering drp concentration i e chemical buffer hence a groundwater table above tile depth produced drp concentrations that were lower and more consistent future work on the role of groundwater dynamics on drp transport is needed including its effect on intra and inter event drp concentration patterns and differences between fields i e persistent vs flashy groundwater table nitrate n concentration was not related to any metrics of antecedent wetness storm characteristics or water sources while p can accumulate in surface soils no3 n is much more mobile owing its transport character to soil physical properties and water movement patterns rather than soil chemical properties given this increased mobility throughout the soil profile it is likely that the processes controlling no3 n transport changed over time and resulted in poor relationships among factors as no3 n went from concentrated in surface soils immediately after fertilizer application to diffuse and distributed through the soil profile during the weeks to months after application nitrate n concentration time series see fig 6 especially following fertilizer application in spring 2018 provide evidence of varying flow pathways and processes following fertilizer application no3 n increased relative to pre application but was highly variable during the days to weeks after application over time the variability in no3 n concentration decreased as concentration decreased suggesting a more diffuse and consistent delivery of no3 n time of stabilization for no3 n concentration to reach 1 0 mg l 1 from fertilizer application in spring to summer 2018 was 130 170 d which was similar to mean residence time of deeper soil water 60 80 cm 124 193 d williams and mcafee 2021 at the study site thus information on fertilizer application timing and rate and the mean residence time of soil water near tile depth may be a better predictor of no3 n delivery to tile drains rather than specific flow pathways both no3 n and drp load were strongly related to tile discharge during both fertilization and non fertilization periods although the slope of the relationship varied between periods while no3 n and drp load were strongly related to tile discharge examination of relationships between nutrient concentration antecedent wetness and hydrograph components indicated that processes producing the strong connection between load and discharge varied between no3 n and drp for no3 n continuous re distribution of n throughout the soil profile resulted in a broad range of concentration observed in tile drainage water across flow pathways antecedent conditions and storm events as a result no3 n concentration was on average similar across conditions i e chemostatic with loading then largely proportional to flow volume such re distribution of p sources within the soil profile does not occur as quickly as n instead requiring years to decades thus for drp groundwater was the main driver producing strong relationships between load and tile discharge since most tile discharge was generated when the groundwater table was above tile depth drp concentrations in drainage water during high flows were relatively consistent i e groundwater functioning as a hydrologic and chemical buffer irrespective of fertilization or non fertilization periods previous studies in drained landscapes have found similar findings where drp was chemostatic when daily tile flow was greater than the 50th percentile and chemodynamic when tile flow was less than the 50th percentile across a range of fields with varying soil test p concentration williams et al 2018b thus the difference between chemostatic and chemodynamic drp transport may largely depend on groundwater table dynamics rather than the magnitude of stored p or the source of p i e fertilizer vs soil p findings from the current study therefore provide an alternative hypothesis for chemostatic nutrient export patterns in drained landscapes compared to previous work which have often attributed these patterns to accumulated nutrient stores e g basu et al 2010 guan et al 2011 thompson et al 2011 williams et al 2016a 5 summary and conclusions combined measurements of water nutrient and tracer fluxes revealed novel insights into source and transport factors controlling nutrient delivery to tile drains tile discharge was primarily sourced from groundwater and soil water williams and mcafee 2021 with both tile flow and hydrograph components well correlated to metrics of precipitation and antecedent conditions nutrient management practices including fertilizer application rate fertilizer placement and fertilizer application timing had a substantial effect on dissolved nutrient loss in drainage water larger application rates fertilizer broadcast on the soil surface and fertilizer applied before large storm events resulted in a substantial portion of cumulative no3 n and drp load occurring as incidental loss during 30 d periods following fertilizer application given its mobility and continuous re distribution throughout the soil profile following fertilizer application no3 n concentration was on average similar regardless of the dominant water source or antecedent conditions as a result no3 n load was proportional to tile discharge the magnitude and timing of no3 n loss may therefore be best predicted using the fertilizer application rate and the mean transit time of deep soil water i e near tile drain depth in contrast drp concentration was related to both metrics of antecedent wetness and water sources during dry conditions when the water table was below tile drain depth tile hydrograph response to precipitation was small water was sourced from either shallow soil water or precipitation and drp concentration tended to be high but variable alternatively during wet conditions when the water table was near or above tile depth tile flow increased with increasing precipitation amount water was sourced from groundwater and drp concentration was low and relatively stable findings indicate that groundwater dynamics specifically the position of the water table relative to tile drain depth exerts an important control on drp delivery to tile drains groundwater may serve to dilute elevated drp concentration transported from the soil surface hydrologic buffering and long groundwater residence times allow for increased contact with subsoils and the potential for p sorption chemical buffering since the majority of tile discharge 91 occurred when groundwater was above tile depth drp load was therefore proportional to tile flow further exploration of the effect of groundwater dynamics on nutrient delivery to tile drains especially drp is needed including the role groundwater plays on intra and inter event drp concentration patterns and differences between fields results from the current study highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic interaction between hydrologic processes and nutrient pools fertilizer and soil as this relationship determined the amount source and timing of nutrient delivery to tile drains changes to either source or transport factors can alter no3 n and drp delivery to tile drains which has direct implications for both nutrient and water management practice implementation small changes in fertilizer application practices would have likely yielded substantial reductions in dissolved nutrient load in the current study additionally it is likely that hydrologic processes not only transport nutrients but also impact soil chemistry e g p desorption from soil penn et al 2022 which could be especially important for understanding dissolved nutrient loss from legacy soil sources results from the current study are crucial for improving subsurface water and nutrient transport in numerical models commonly used models often lack or misrepresent critical processes controlling subsurface nutrient transport e g radcliffe et al 2015 thus data on water nutrient and tracer fluxes like those collected in the current study will allow for testing efficiencies in models simulating water and nutrient transport and provide a benchmark for a more realistic representation of subsurface processes within drained agricultural fields credit authorship contribution statement mark r williams
