19415,modification of polyamide reverse osmosis ro membranes with silver nanoparticles agnp may effectively control biofouling while silver leaching tests are usually performed during membrane development the lack of common testing protocols limits cross comparison among different labs we compare four release tests to quantify the release of dissolved and nanoparticulate silver from polyamide ro membranes prepared through in situ surface functionalization 1 batch immersion 2 dead end filtration 3 cross flow filtration and 4 low pressure water jetting for the first time we demonstrated the possibility of agnp release to membrane treated water through direct agnp detachment when using nanopure water as an extraction solution water jetting resulted in the fastest silver mass release while dead end filtration caused the slowest release based on the initial release kinetic data dead end filtration exhibited silver mass release an order of magnitude lower than the other three tests although cross flow filtration may best represent the ro membrane operation quantifying silver release suffers from poor mass balance due to the adsorption of dissolved silver by various reactor components and large volumes of water usage a commonly applied batch immersion method was low cost and easily performed but may not induce hydraulic shear sufficient for agnp detachment from a ro membrane the information on silver release behavior may depend on the specific test which is important for assessing antimicrobial efficacy and service life of the nanoparticle functionalized membranes keywords nanotechnology antibacterial fouling dissolution biofilm release 1 introduction membrane fouling especially biofouling remains a barrier to efficient application of membrane technology for water and wastewater treatment flemming 2002 biofouling increases operating pressures and adds to the energy consumption and the complexity of the process design and operation it also reduces the lifetime of membranes and membrane modules baker and dudley 1998 giwa et al 2016 hydraulic washing and chemical treatments disinfectant surfactants acids etc are often used to slow biofouling rates and clean membranes incorporation of antibacterial nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticles hereafter agnp into the active layer of the membrane has received great attention to mitigate bacterial growth and membrane biofouling li et al 2008 pendergast and hoek 2011 membranes functionalized with agnp at loadings on the order of 1 5 μg cm2 exhibit extended antibacterial functionality compared to ionic silver on membrane surfaces wu et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 the recent development of nano enabled membrane technologies focuses on the flexibility of material synthesis and regeneration using in situ agnp formation approach soroush et al 2016 yang et al 2016 while agnp dissolution and release of antibacterial silver ions ag is expected and desirable for a high antimicrobial efficiency the persistent dissolution eventually causes the depletion of biologically active agnp and requires agnp regeneration on the membrane ben sasson et al 2014 yin et al 2013 the release and depletion of silver from the membrane during use can reduce the efficacy of surface agnp and add to the cost of membrane operation the release of silver into concentrated brines during the ro process presents additional challenges associated with brine discharge extending the service life of agnp enabled membrane and controlling silver release remains one of the greatest challenges for membrane development and has received limited attention compared to the development of agnp coated membranes wu et al 2015 although silver leaching tests are usually performed during membrane development no common test protocol exists for evaluating the stability and leaching potential of agnp enabled membranes the most common tests rely upon batch immersion mauter et al 2011 rahaman et al 2014 yin et al 2013 and dead end filtration diagne et al 2012 mollahosseini and rahimpour 2013 tang et al 2015 zodrow et al 2009 however specific experimental conditions including extraction time chemical composition of extraction solutions surface area to volume ratios and agitation status varied from study to study making it difficult to compare results between tests depending on the membrane fabrication and testing platform the reported amount of silver release varies by more than two orders of magnitudes from 1 to 70 supporting information si table s1 the large differences in silver release suggest the varying stability of agnp on membrane surface and potentially the different antimicrobial efficacy during water treatment operation most tests do not differentiate between nano scale particulate and dissolved silver forms consequently the performance of agnp coated membranes based on commonly used test results is highly variable and may not predict actual water treatment results rather than focusing on the ability of agnp coated membranes to limit microbial growth this study focuses on silver release and release rates from agnp coated polyamide ro membranes using four different release test platforms 1 batch immersion 2 dead end filtration 3 cross flow filtration and 4 low pressure water jetting the water jetting system was developed to study silver release resulting from the direct hydraulic abrasion single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms analysis was utilized to quantify both dissolved and nanoparticulate forms of released silver in bulk solutions finally we compared the four test platforms based on 1 silver mass release rate 2 influence of water chemistry on silver release 3 cost and operation complexity of the release test we conclude with advantages and precautions in the selection of nanoparticle based antimicrobial membrane tests for evaluating stability and release the results should help researchers improve nanoparticle design to maximize the efficacy and longevity of membranes 2 materials methods 2 1 in situ formation of agnp on commercial ro membrane a commercial polyamide drinking water ro membrane applied membrane inc ca usa was selected for agnp coating by in situ reduction method modified from ben sasson et al 2014 briefly 1 l 3 mm agno3 solution was applied to the spiral wound ro membrane using a customized recirculating system figure s1 followed by 1 l 3 mm sodium borohydride nabh4 solution nabh4 reacted with and reduced the surface bound ag to zero valent ag0 nanoparticles the membrane was then rinsed with nanopure water for 1 min to remove loosely attached agnp and excess nabh4 the operation details are summarized in the supporting information the formation of agnp was confirmed with the fei xl30 scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray analysis edx both secondary electron se and back scattered electron bse images were collected to analyze membrane surface features and the distribution of agnp total silver loading on the coated membrane was determined by icp ms after digesting 2 5 cm2 membrane coupons in 40 ml 2 hno3 solution for 24 h under sonication bransonic ultrasonic bath 2 2 silver release test platform design and operation 2 2 1 chemical composition of extraction solution nanopure water 18 3 mω cm was used as a standard extraction solution for testing silver release across all test platforms extraction solution 1 to test the influence of acidic ph and dissolved chloride additional extraction solutions were prepared at ph 5 in the presence and absence of magnesium chloride mgcl2 table 1 monosodium phosphate nah2po4 was used as the ph buffer at a concentration of 2 5 mm the chloride concentration was selected at 2 mm or 10 mm to simulate chloride in typical natural waters mullaney et al 2009 the chemical composition and concentration are consistent with national sanitation foundation nsf ansi 61 protocol for testing drinking water system components all extraction solutions were prepared with nanopure water barnstead water purification system the application of extraction solution for each release test platform was summarized in table 1 2 2 2 batch immersion bench scale batch tests were performed for silver release from the coated ro membranes following similar approaches used in several studies table s1 briefly circular membrane coupons 2 5 cm a 4 9 cm2 were placed in 40 ml extraction solution in separate 50 ml centrifuge tubes and continuously agitated using a benchtop orbital shaker model rpm the surface area to volume ratio of 120 cm2 l was selected based on nsf ansi 61 protocol for testing health effects of drinking water system components nsfinternational 2016 separate batches were used for evaluating silver release at different time points 5 15 30 45 60 180 360 720 1440 2880 and 4320 min the longest contact time 3 days was chosen as the minimum operation time following nsf ansi 61 protocol at each designated time point the silver release process ended by stopping agitation and retracting membrane coupons from the extraction solution the leachates were subject to analysis for both agnp and dissolved silver concentrations by sp icp ms the retracted membrane was then digested with 2 hno3 solution for quantifying residual ag the batch test for each time point was conducted in triplicates to obtain uncertainty for silver release and mass balance 2 2 3 dead end filtration a stainless steel dead end filtration cell sterlitech hp4750 stirred cell was used to examine silver release in a pressurized flow through system figure s2 a ro membrane coupon 4 3 cm a 14 6 cm2 was placed at the bottom of the reactor cell which was fed with 200 ml nanopure water at an applied pressure of 90 psi 6 2 bar a magnetic bar was placed inside the cell to allow a fast mixing to minimize mass transfer limited agnp dissolution time integrated permeate samples were collected continuously over 4 h operating time in six 50 ml centrifuge tubes 0 10 min 11 30 min 31 60 min 61 120 min 121 180 min and 181 240 min at the end of the experiment the remaining solution inside the cell was also collected for the analysis of agnp and dissolved silver concentrations the used membrane was placed in 2 hno3 for quantifying residual silver content the mass balance was calculated based on the summation of total released silver and residual silver on tested membranes triplicate experiments of dead end filtration were performed with each extraction solution to calculate uncertainty for silver release and mass balance 2 2 4 cross flow filtration agnp coated membranes were tested in a commercial cross flow filtration membrane cell system tomar water system inc to represent typical operating conditions for ro membranes all wetted parts of the system are made from stainless steel with the exception of the chemical resistant tubing leading to and from the filter and filter housing and feed tank which are made of polyethylene each of three test cells sterlitech cf042 installed on top of the cross flow system had an effective membrane surface area of 42 cm2 approximately 23 l deionized water ph 6 7 was used as the extraction solution for agnp coated membranes a feed pressure of 90 psi consistent with dead end filtration was applied to produce a water flux of approximately 20 30 l m2 h the retentate stream was recirculated back to the feed tank to allow a constant mixing of feed and retentate the feed temperature was maintained at 23 1 c by circulating chilled water from a refrigerated bath thermo neslab rte 5 digital through a stainless steel coil in the feed retentate tank during the first 11 h operation permeate was collected in a 1 l glass beaker while the retentate stream was continuously recycled after 11 h the permeate flow was directed back to the retentate tank until the completion of experiment the permeate samples from the three cells were collected at selected time points for monitoring water flux and silver release to the produced water the release of silver to the retentate stream was monitored by collecting samples directly from the feed retentate tank duplicate experiments were operated for 50 h after which the membrane coupons were digested and analysed for residual silver amount the permeate and retentate samples were analysed for the concentration of both nanoparticulate and dissolved silver by sp icp ms within two days of sampling 2 2 5 water jetting system a low pressure water jetting system figure s3 was developed to study silver leaching under the impact of hydraulic abrasion using water flow a detailed description of system design and operation conditions is provided in supporting information briefly a circular membrane coupon 1 8 cm was subject to water jet spray at a rate of 1100 ml min equivalent to a hydraulic pressure of 19 psi on membrane surface from a vertical direction one litre extraction solution i e nanopure water was constantly recirculated by a peristaltic pump for a total operation time of 60 min five 15 ml samples were collected from the reservoir at 5 15 30 45 and 60 min which were then analysed for agnp and dissolved silver concentrations after the completion of water jetting test the exposed membrane coupon 0 32 cm2 was digested and analysed for residual silver content the silver mass balance was calculated by summing the mass of released silver and residual silver on the exposed membrane which was compared with the initial silver loading at least duplicate experiments were performed for the water jetting tests under a specific condition 2 3 single particle icp ms for silver analysis analysis for the concentration of dissolved and nanoparticulate silver was performed by sp icp ms using a thermo xseries ii icp ms system briefly the instrument was operated at a time resolved single particle mode with an integration dwell time of 10 ms and a data collection time of 120 s samples from silver release tests were introduced directly into the instrument by the peristaltic pump within 24 h of collection when high dissolved silver concentration was observed 1 ppb samples were diluted in nanopure water prior to analysis instrument calibration utilized one blank and four dissolved silver standard solutions 200 2000 ng l transport efficiency was determined for each analysis using a national institutes of standards and technology nist 60 nm aunp and ionic au standard based on the method described in pace et al 2011 to monitor instrumental drift over time a single 200 ng l dissolved silver calibration standard was analysed between every ten samples in the single particle mode data analyses were carried out manually by plotting raw pulse intensity data against collection time background i e dissolved ag counts were subtracted from the pulse intensity and agnp was sized using a density of 10 49 g cm3 the minimum detectable agnp size was 30 nm by sp icp ms in this study contributing factors that limit the minimum size detection included matrix signal suppression salting of the cones high dissolved silver background and decreased instrumental sensitivity over time in addition to particle sizing mass concentrations of both nanoparticulate and ionic silver can be obtained from sp icp ms analysis the total silver concentration was then calculated by summing the two components for selected samples the total silver concentration determined by sp icp ms were compared with the results of normal mode icp ms after acidification for 92 of the selected samples the results agreed with each other within 15 uncertainty 3 results 3 1 formation of agnp coating on ro membrane surface the in situ formation of agnp on the spiral wound membrane was indicated by the change of surface color from white to yellow brown figure s4 secondary electron sem images showed that agnp coated membrane had the same ridge and valley structure of a pristine polyamide membrane fig 1 at a relatively high magnification of 25000 deposits of bright nanoparticles can be clearly observed on the membrane surfaces the bse sem analysis coupled with edx confirmed the formation of discrete silver nanoparticles instead of a continuous layer of ag0 deposits on the membrane surface fig 1c the nanoparticles however were unevenly distributed at the micro scale and varied in diameter most agnps have size less than 50 nm but they can form aggregates with diameters up to 200 nm on the membrane surface the average particle size is clearly greater than 15 nm as reported by ben sasson et al 2014 using the same coating method after acid digestion the surface silver loading was determined to be 2 52 0 34 μg cm2 the variance in silver loading agreed with the uneven agnp surface coverage observed by sem the results suggest that localized spots in the spiral wound membrane may experience silver accumulation during in situ silver reduction process to understand this variable in silver release test at least triplicate experiments were performed to determine the initial silver loading for each test method 3 2 silver release from polyamide membrane using batch and dead end filtration batch immersion and dead end filtration are conventional platforms for evaluating metal leaching from membranes fig 2 a shows the concentration of total released silver in a batch system over time up to three days rapid silver release occurred at the beginning of the experiment resulting in 53 ppb silver 15 2 initial silver loading in the 40 ml leachate at 60 min the mass release rate slowed down after 360 min and followed a sigmoidal shape at longer reaction time at the end of the experiment 51 of initial silver loading was released into the extraction solution of nanopure water at a concentration of 180 ppb leaving 1 54 0 16 μg ag cm2 on the membrane fig 3 a the released silver was nearly all dissolved silver as determined by sp icp ms agnp was found negligible lod in the leachate regardless of reaction time the calculated silver mass balance was consistently 106 6 table 2 indicating a good reproducibility of the testing platform in dead end filtration tests total silver concentration in the filtrate was initially high at 6 ppb and decreased over time at an operating flux rate of 20 2 2 l m2 h fig 2b fig 3b shows the cumulative silver release to the permeate plotted against time at the end of the 4 h experiment the total released silver was 0 64 0 2 μg 80 of which was in the 80 ml extraction solution left in the reactor the total released silver accounted for less than 2 of the initial silver mass on the membrane so the majority of silver remained on the membrane 2 2 μg ag cm2 in the permeate both nanoparticulate and dissolved silver concentrations decreased over time the relative quantity of agnp quickly dropped from 41 to 15 of the total silver present at the end of the experiment suggesting an increasing influence of silver dissolution over the duration of the test in the final retentate nanoparticulate silver accounted for 12 of total ag similar to that in the permeate the averaged mass balance achieved 90 2 recovery table 2 indicating a good reproducibility of the testing platform 3 3 silver release in cross flow filtration the evaluation of silver release from the bench scale cross flow filtration system was based on silver analysis in separate permeate and retentate streams fig 2c shows that silver concentration in the permeate was initially 18 ppb and decreased rapidly over time in comparison silver concentration in the retentate was lower 2 2 ppb but remained relatively stable over longer test time e g 20 h because of the low permeate flux 28 l m2 h the mass of released silver into the permeate 7 1 μg was smaller than present in the retentate 45 7 μg at 1 h experiment from a total membrane area of 126 cm2 over the following 10 h the amount of released silver increased to 42 μg in the permeate but slightly decrease to 35 μg in the retentate fig 3c shows the released silver mass normalized to the membrane area over the first 11 h experiment while released silver in the permeate increased almost linearly the amount of total released silver in permeate and retentate became constant after 5 h at 11 h reaction the cross flow filtration resulted in a total silver release of 0 65 μg cm2 accounting for 24 of initial silver loading 2 70 μg ag cm2 of the tested membranes the silver concentration in permeate and retentate continued to decrease after 11 h but the value was consistently greater in the permeate fig 2c because the permeate flow was directed back to the retentate tank from 11 to 50 h the released silver in the permeate was not calculated assuming all released silver was retained in the retentate tank the amount of total released silver was calculated to be only 6 4 μg at 50 h significantly lower than the amount estimated at 11 h at the completion of the tests used membranes were digested for measuring remaining silver content on the membrane surfaces surprisingly only 13 6 4 3 of initial silver loading remained on the surface a substantial amount of silver was clearly released 2 3 μg ag cm2 during cross flow filtration but was not detected in the retentate tank the incomplete silver mass balance table 2 suggested an underestimation of long term silver release in the complex cross flow filtration system mainly due to silver adsorption by large contact surfaces of various reactor components e g tank tubing pump etc the results indicate a clear challenge to the quantification of released silver when using this test platform the analyses of silver speciation with sp icp ms showed that nanoparticles were consistently detected in the retentate but not in the permeate the concentration of dissolved silver in the retentate stream was significantly greater than nanoparticulate ag accounting for more than 90 of total released ag however the agnp mass concentration and relative abundance both increased over time fig 3c suggesting continuous detachment of agnp during cross flow filtration the typical average agnp size determined by sp icp ms was 55 nm fig s5 larger than primary agnp size observed by sem on membrane surface fig 1 3 4 silver release in water jetting tests fig 2d shows the trends of the two silver components as a function of time during the test when nanopure water was used as an extraction solution immediately after the initiation of water jet 5 min nanoparticulate and dissolved silver were detected in the leachate at concentrations of 9 2 ng l and 70 ng l respectively over the 1 h experiment agnp concentrations slightly decreased to 7 7 ng l while dissolved silver concentration increased almost linearly to 290 ng l at 60 min the dissolved silver concentration at any time point was significantly higher than that of agnp the fraction of agnp in total released silver decreased accordingly from 12 at 5 min to 3 at 60 min the majority of released agnp have sizes between 35 and 45 nm fig s5 which are similar to the agnp found in other test systems however because sp icp ms has a detection limit of 25 35 nm smaller agnp 35 nm may not be detected and accounted for in the leachate it is possible agnp concentration was underestimated in all test systems at the conclusion of the tests the remaining silver on the water exposed membrane area was 0 86 0 14 μg cm2 or 42 6 9 of initial silver loading fig 3d the silver mass balance was calculated to be 88 11 by combining the released silver in solution and residual silver on membrane table 2 the slight silver loss can be partly explained the adsorption of released silver to the components of the water jetting system e g tubing reservoir wall etc nevertheless the water jetting test was demonstrated to be reproducible platform and provide a direct evidence that agnp can be removed from polyamide membrane by hydraulic abrasion 3 5 effect of acidic ph and chloride on silver release agnp coated ro membranes were also tested in ph 5 solutions with and without the additional of chloride cl to evaluate silver release at different chemical conditions table 1 the released silver concentration followed similar trends at the lower ph as in nanopure water for a given test platform for example in a batch system the total silver release also exhibited a sigmoidal shape after a rapid initial release at ph 5 data not shown the residual silver content on the membrane however was different from the results in nanopure water and was influenced by acidic ph or the presence of chloride anion the amounts of released silver on the membrane at the completion of each experiment are summarized in table 3 at ph 5 in the absence of chloride the released silver was 1 75 μg cm2 in the batch system leaving 0 98 μg cm2 35 of initial ag on the membrane after the three day experiment in the presence of 2 mm cl silver release significantly decreased and the residual silver content increased to 2 20 μg ag cm2 78 of initial ag on the membrane similar results were observed for silver release in the water jetting experiments where the residual silver contents were 1 46 and 2 02 μg ag cm2 in the absence and presence of chloride respectively dead end and cross flow filtration yielded comparable results for the silver release and retention with different water chemistry in the respective group table 3 it is difficult to clearly determine the effect of ph and chloride on silver release by using these two test platforms however the cross flow filtration tests resulted in substantially more silver release from the membrane over the 50 h operation compared to dead end filtration the residual silver contents were only 0 63 and 0 69 μg ag cm2 in the absence and presence of 2 mm cl respectively while both values are higher than in nanopure water they do not exhibit a significant impact of dissolved cl on silver release in cross flow filtration when cl concentration further increased to 10 mm in the feed solution silver released also increased leaving only 0 30 μg ag cm2 11 of initial ag at the completion of the experiment 4 discussion 4 1 release rate of silver at different testing conditions to facilitate comparison of the four different testing platforms the cumulative release of silver in nanopure water is plotted against time for each platform after normalization to surface area fig 4 the initial rate of silver release was calculated based on the linear range of plots where the r squared value was greater than 0 95 fig 4 demonstrates that water jetting resulted in the fastest silver release while dead end filtration caused the slowest release the rate is 11 6 1 0 ng ag cm2 min by water jet which is more than two orders of magnitude greater than by dead end filtration 0 047 0 007 ng ag cm2 min batch immersion and cross flow filtration resulted in intermediate silver release at 4 30 0 5 and 0 73 0 05 ng ag cm2 min respectively although batch immersion and dead end filtration have been commonly used for testing membrane stability the results from this study clearly showed that they can yield different information on silver release from what may be expected in the actual practice i e cross flow membrane operation batch immersion tends to overestimate the silver release potential while dead end filtration platform may greatly underestimate the release from the coated membrane in the dead end filtration cell although the solution is stirred the membrane is kept static and does not undergo vigorous agitation i e hydraulic shear as in the batch reactor in contrast the hydraulic turbulence occurring in the batch reactor likely facilitates the dissolution of agnp on the polyamide membrane the highest silver release rate is in the water jetting system indicating that hydraulic abrasion can promote silver release and cause the direct detachment of agnp form the coated membrane the relatively faster initial release of silver was also observed in previous studies using the batch immersion method yin et al 2013 reported a silver release of 0 37 μg cm2 over the first day in a similar batch system 1 cm2 membrane in 20 ml di water the amount of released silver over the 14 day experiment accounted for 12 of initial silver loading on the membrane the same membrane tested by dead end filtration showed a slower silver release at a pressure of 300 psi the cumulative amount of released silver in the 4 85 l permeate accounted for merely 3 5 of initial silver loading compared to the poorly adhered agnp membrane in this study the membrane in yin et al experienced much slower silver release in either test platform the difference in agnp stability is likely explained by the mechanism of agnp attachment on the polyamide membranes in their study the covalently bonded agnp using cysteamine as a bridging agent likely protected agnp from direct detachment and dissolution more strongly yin et al 2013 it was expected that the slow release can maintain the antimicrobial properties of the agnp coated membrane for months in another batch immersion test on agnp modified polyamide membrane the release rate of silver was even lower at 0 1 μg cm2 per day yang et al 2016 the study used polydopamine pda instead of sodium borohydride to reduce ag and form dispersed agnp on the membrane these results suggest that agnp coated membranes prepared with different approaches can be compared using the batch immersion system for agnp stability 4 2 evaluating agnp detachment with different testing platforms most previous membrane studies only analysed total released silver after acidification assuming agnp detachment is negligible during the release test rahaman et al 2014 zodrow et al 2009 by employing sp icp ms this study for the first time demonstrates the possibility of agnp release to membrane treated water through direct agnp detachment among the four test platforms dead end and cross flow filtration allowed the evaluation of agnp mass and particle concentration in the finished water permeate compared to agnp in the finished water the release of agnp into the retentate stream potentially poses a greater challenge to wastewater management as discussed with fig 2 agnp concentration in the retentate stream increased over time during the cross flow filtration suggesting agnp may be continuously stripped from the membrane surface the consequent accumulation of agnp in the membrane retentate i e brine might require its concentration to be monitored before being discharged this study shows that different testing platforms may yield different silver release result in the batch immersion test no agnp was detected in the leachate regardless of reaction time the release mechanism was dominated by the oxidative dissolution of agnp on membrane surfaces this result however was not observed in other testing platforms which all identified the presence of agnp at the beginning of dead end filtration and water jetting tests the agnp concentration although extremely low 20 ng l constituted a good portion of total released silver fig 2 the initial agnp release was likely caused by the detachment of loosely bound agnp on membrane after in situ synthesis over time the relative concentration of agnp to total silver concentration continued to decrease in the leachate so that dissolution quickly became the dominant silver release mechanism in particular water jet substantially accelerated the oxidative dissolution of agnp probably because the extraction solution is sufficiently aerated before contacting the membrane surface 4 3 the effect of chemical composition of extraction solutions on silver release while agnp dissolution and stability is known to be influenced by solution ph and chemical composition many previous release tests used ultrapure water as the only extraction solution for membranes table s1 as shown in fig 5 nanopure water typically resulted in the most significant silver release across all testing platforms within a given duration of the test lowering the solution ph to the acidic range ph 5 appears to only have limited impact on silver release and may even reduce silver release this result seems to contradict to the previous analysis that agnp dissolution rate increases with decreasing ph liu and hurt 2010 theoretically after ag0 is oxidized by adsorbed oxygen the protonation of surface groups ag oh at acidic ph can destabilize ag o bonds and facilitate the release of ag from ag0 surfaces peretyazhko et al 2014 because the extraction solution used monosodium phosphate nah2po4 as the ph buffer phosphate groups may form surface complexes with ag o and reduce the available surface sites for oxygen adsorption the formation of silver phosphate species might further reduce silver solubility ksp 8 89 10 17 in the extraction solution thompson 1973 it is likely that the overall release of silver was controlled by a slower oxidation process of agnp by oxygen wu et al 2015 since the detachment of ag from agnp surfaces was relatively fast therefore the increased proton concentration did not have a significant impact on the silver release rate we also showed that dissolved chloride may affect silver release from agnp coated membrane chloride is the most prevalent monovalent anion in natural water and municipal wastewater wu et al 2015 it can strongly affect the silver release due to the strong affinity to oxidized ag and the formation of various ag cl species aqueous or insoluble depending on its concentration dissolved cl can either promote or suppress the dissolution of agnp in a suspension ksp agcl 1 77 10 10 chambers et al 2014 levard et al 2013 this effect is now observed when agnp are immobilized on the membrane surfaces as thin film coating fig 5 shows that the amount of released silver may decrease in 2 mm cl solution in all test platforms possibly due to the formation of sparingly soluble agcl precipitates when the cl concentration increased to 10 mm the release of silver in both permeate and retentate streams increased during the cross flow filtration fig 5 because the lower cl concentration 1 mm mgcl2 was selected by nsf international for testing drinking water system components our results suggest the recipe may underestimate silver release from agnp coated membrane when treating drinking water a previous study similarly used nacl solutions to simulate natural water and wastewater and tested silver release from ag zeolite membranes by batch immersion in a 24 h increment wu et al 2015 the rate of silver release was observed to rise when cl concentration increased from 10 mm to 154 mm which was explained by the formation of predominantly soluble agclx x 1 species at high cl silver molar ratios about 70 of initially loaded agnp remained on the membrane after the 7 day release experiment in 10 mm nacl solutions which is higher than the residual agnp tested in the current study of cross flow filtration therefore the impact of dissolved chloride on silver release not only depends on its concentration but also the characteristics of agnp coated membrane when performing silver release tests extraction solution should represent a larger range of solution chemistry while ultrapure water is an excellent candidate that can be used to provide a baseline of silver release extraction solution may also include common anions that can form soluble complexes or precipitates with ag after ag0 dissolution such as dissolved chloride additional research needs to further consider the impact of the anions on the antimicrobial properties of the membrane because the newly formed silver species may have different toxicity than free silver ions levard et al 2013 4 4 the selection of test platform for nanoparticle release from membrane systems for the development of nano enabled water treatment systems the use of release test platform should address the following questions 1 whether and how much silver can enter the produced water and brine 2 what is the operation time of agnp coated membrane before agnp are required to be regenerated or replaced and 3 what is the antimicrobial efficacy of membranes based on the released silver in the bulk solution the first question is important for human and environmental exposure and risk assessment while the last two are relevant from an engineering perspective for product design and development for the agnp coated ro membrane evaluated in this study all test platforms clearly demonstrated that silver will be released from membrane surfaces in contact with water the silver concentration measured in the bulk solution is typically below 0 1 mg l or the secondary maximum contaminant level smcl for drinking water established by u s environmental protection agency usepa 2008 the only exception is batch immersion test which showed the cumulative dissolved silver concentration exceeding 0 1 mg l shortly after 8 h reaction as discussed earlier batch immersion tests yielded higher silver release rate from membrane than most other tests and is likely not representative of field conditions but because the method was a commonly used platform for metal release the results acquired from this method can provide a basis for comparing membranes fabricated by different approaches to provide a more realistic evaluation of silver release to produced water and brine cross flow filtration is recommended by monitoring silver in both permeate and retentate streams by quantifying the residual agnp on the membrane after the test the overall silver release can be calculated and used to estimate the service life assuming the antimicrobial activity of agnp coated membranes relies on the release of dissolved silver xiu et al 2012 the dissolved silver concentration in the bulk solution may be used to predict the antimicrobial efficacy of the membrane in all test platforms however silver concentration was much lower than the reported minimum inhibitory concentration mic90 6 10 mg l to different strains of p aeruginosa sandstrom 2011 clearly the strong antimicrobial activity of agnp coated membrane is directly related to the much higher silver concentration localized at or near the membrane surface among the four test platforms only batch immersion and dead end filtration allowed the silver release process in a completely mixed system assuming the bulk silver concentration is near equilibrium with the surface ag it is possible to determine the biologically active silver concentration on membrane surface when using the two platforms however because the antimicrobial properties of the membranes were not assessed in this study the correlation between bulk silver concentration and antimicrobial efficacy of membranes cannot be concluded when conducting silver release tests on ro membranes the cost and operating conditions of test platform may also be considered to determine the selection table s2 the cross flow filtration requires a specialized experimental system which has the highest capital cost among all four platforms the operation maintenance and data analysis for cross flow filtration are the most demanding which may explain its unpopularity for membrane evaluation the complexity of the system may also cause silver loss due to ag adsorption to the reactor components thus posing a challenge to quantifying silver release in the brine however because cross flow cell typically uses much larger membrane areas 42 cm2 in this study than other platforms the test result may better represent the average silver release behavior on membrane with large spatial heterogeneity in comparison batch immersion and water jetting tests are cost effective alternatives that use small size membrane the water jetting test takes the shortest operation time to yield the most significant silver release which can be used for a conservative estimate of antimicrobial service life the batch immersion test according to the nsf ansi 61 protocol would take much longer operation time for at least 3 days the dead end filtration on the other hand does not have clear advantages either in the cost or operation because dead end filtration may significantly underestimate silver release potential the information obtained from this platform can be used for determining the most conservative release rate 5 conclusions the development of agnp modified polyamide membrane is usually accompanied by the evaluation of silver release to assess the stability antimicrobial efficacy and subsequently service life of the membranes in this study four different test platforms i e batch immersion dead end filtration cross flow filtration and low pressure water jetting were used to determine the release of both dissolved and nanoparticulate silver from the membrane for the first time we demonstrate that nanoparticulate silver can be released to the bulk solution in addition to dissolved ag although the oxidative dissolution of ag0 consistently dominates the release mechanism the detachment of loosely attached agnp may account for an important source of released silver at the early testing stage this event is clearly demonstrated during dead end filtration where about 50 of total released silver was agnp within the first 10 min test however the dead end filtration resulted in the slowest silver release compared to other test platforms thus may significantly underestimate silver release during actual water treatment the popular batch immersion test is recommended to be performed for most nano enabled membrane because the results can be compared by extracting information from a larger literature base this test platform may be particularly useful for evaluating the detachment of less water soluble nanomaterials such as gold or zero valent iron zvi nanoparticles to enhance the predictive capability of release tests on the release behavior of nano enabled membrane more than one method is recommended to be employed by considering the capital cost and operating complexity summarized in this study the variation in extraction solution chemistry may further improve the applicability of the test platforms for a broader range of

19415,modification of polyamide reverse osmosis ro membranes with silver nanoparticles agnp may effectively control biofouling while silver leaching tests are usually performed during membrane development the lack of common testing protocols limits cross comparison among different labs we compare four release tests to quantify the release of dissolved and nanoparticulate silver from polyamide ro membranes prepared through in situ surface functionalization 1 batch immersion 2 dead end filtration 3 cross flow filtration and 4 low pressure water jetting for the first time we demonstrated the possibility of agnp release to membrane treated water through direct agnp detachment when using nanopure water as an extraction solution water jetting resulted in the fastest silver mass release while dead end filtration caused the slowest release based on the initial release kinetic data dead end filtration exhibited silver mass release an order of magnitude lower than the other three tests although cross flow filtration may best represent the ro membrane operation quantifying silver release suffers from poor mass balance due to the adsorption of dissolved silver by various reactor components and large volumes of water usage a commonly applied batch immersion method was low cost and easily performed but may not induce hydraulic shear sufficient for agnp detachment from a ro membrane the information on silver release behavior may depend on the specific test which is important for assessing antimicrobial efficacy and service life of the nanoparticle functionalized membranes keywords nanotechnology antibacterial fouling dissolution biofilm release 1 introduction membrane fouling especially biofouling remains a barrier to efficient application of membrane technology for water and wastewater treatment flemming 2002 biofouling increases operating pressures and adds to the energy consumption and the complexity of the process design and operation it also reduces the lifetime of membranes and membrane modules baker and dudley 1998 giwa et al 2016 hydraulic washing and chemical treatments disinfectant surfactants acids etc are often used to slow biofouling rates and clean membranes incorporation of antibacterial nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticles hereafter agnp into the active layer of the membrane has received great attention to mitigate bacterial growth and membrane biofouling li et al 2008 pendergast and hoek 2011 membranes functionalized with agnp at loadings on the order of 1 5 μg cm2 exhibit extended antibacterial functionality compared to ionic silver on membrane surfaces wu et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 the recent development of nano enabled membrane technologies focuses on the flexibility of material synthesis and regeneration using in situ agnp formation approach soroush et al 2016 yang et al 2016 while agnp dissolution and release of antibacterial silver ions ag is expected and desirable for a high antimicrobial efficiency the persistent dissolution eventually causes the depletion of biologically active agnp and requires agnp regeneration on the membrane ben sasson et al 2014 yin et al 2013 the release and depletion of silver from the membrane during use can reduce the efficacy of surface agnp and add to the cost of membrane operation the release of silver into concentrated brines during the ro process presents additional challenges associated with brine discharge extending the service life of agnp enabled membrane and controlling silver release remains one of the greatest challenges for membrane development and has received limited attention compared to the development of agnp coated membranes wu et al 2015 although silver leaching tests are usually performed during membrane development no common test protocol exists for evaluating the stability and leaching potential of agnp enabled membranes the most common tests rely upon batch immersion mauter et al 2011 rahaman et al 2014 yin et al 2013 and dead end filtration diagne et al 2012 mollahosseini and rahimpour 2013 tang et al 2015 zodrow et al 2009 however specific experimental conditions including extraction time chemical composition of extraction solutions surface area to volume ratios and agitation status varied from study to study making it difficult to compare results between tests depending on the membrane fabrication and testing platform the reported amount of silver release varies by more than two orders of magnitudes from 1 to 70 supporting information si table s1 the large differences in silver release suggest the varying stability of agnp on membrane surface and potentially the different antimicrobial efficacy during water treatment operation most tests do not differentiate between nano scale particulate and dissolved silver forms consequently the performance of agnp coated membranes based on commonly used test results is highly variable and may not predict actual water treatment results rather than focusing on the ability of agnp coated membranes to limit microbial growth this study focuses on silver release and release rates from agnp coated polyamide ro membranes using four different release test platforms 1 batch immersion 2 dead end filtration 3 cross flow filtration and 4 low pressure water jetting the water jetting system was developed to study silver release resulting from the direct hydraulic abrasion single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms analysis was utilized to quantify both dissolved and nanoparticulate forms of released silver in bulk solutions finally we compared the four test platforms based on 1 silver mass release rate 2 influence of water chemistry on silver release 3 cost and operation complexity of the release test we conclude with advantages and precautions in the selection of nanoparticle based antimicrobial membrane tests for evaluating stability and release the results should help researchers improve nanoparticle design to maximize the efficacy and longevity of membranes 2 materials methods 2 1 in situ formation of agnp on commercial ro membrane a commercial polyamide drinking water ro membrane applied membrane inc ca usa was selected for agnp coating by in situ reduction method modified from ben sasson et al 2014 briefly 1 l 3 mm agno3 solution was applied to the spiral wound ro membrane using a customized recirculating system figure s1 followed by 1 l 3 mm sodium borohydride nabh4 solution nabh4 reacted with and reduced the surface bound ag to zero valent ag0 nanoparticles the membrane was then rinsed with nanopure water for 1 min to remove loosely attached agnp and excess nabh4 the operation details are summarized in the supporting information the formation of agnp was confirmed with the fei xl30 scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray analysis edx both secondary electron se and back scattered electron bse images were collected to analyze membrane surface features and the distribution of agnp total silver loading on the coated membrane was determined by icp ms after digesting 2 5 cm2 membrane coupons in 40 ml 2 hno3 solution for 24 h under sonication bransonic ultrasonic bath 2 2 silver release test platform design and operation 2 2 1 chemical composition of extraction solution nanopure water 18 3 mω cm was used as a standard extraction solution for testing silver release across all test platforms extraction solution 1 to test the influence of acidic ph and dissolved chloride additional extraction solutions were prepared at ph 5 in the presence and absence of magnesium chloride mgcl2 table 1 monosodium phosphate nah2po4 was used as the ph buffer at a concentration of 2 5 mm the chloride concentration was selected at 2 mm or 10 mm to simulate chloride in typical natural waters mullaney et al 2009 the chemical composition and concentration are consistent with national sanitation foundation nsf ansi 61 protocol for testing drinking water system components all extraction solutions were prepared with nanopure water barnstead water purification system the application of extraction solution for each release test platform was summarized in table 1 2 2 2 batch immersion bench scale batch tests were performed for silver release from the coated ro membranes following similar approaches used in several studies table s1 briefly circular membrane coupons 2 5 cm a 4 9 cm2 were placed in 40 ml extraction solution in separate 50 ml centrifuge tubes and continuously agitated using a benchtop orbital shaker model rpm the surface area to volume ratio of 120 cm2 l was selected based on nsf ansi 61 protocol for testing health effects of drinking water system components nsfinternational 2016 separate batches were used for evaluating silver release at different time points 5 15 30 45 60 180 360 720 1440 2880 and 4320 min the longest contact time 3 days was chosen as the minimum operation time following nsf ansi 61 protocol at each designated time point the silver release process ended by stopping agitation and retracting membrane coupons from the extraction solution the leachates were subject to analysis for both agnp and dissolved silver concentrations by sp icp ms the retracted membrane was then digested with 2 hno3 solution for quantifying residual ag the batch test for each time point was conducted in triplicates to obtain uncertainty for silver release and mass balance 2 2 3 dead end filtration a stainless steel dead end filtration cell sterlitech hp4750 stirred cell was used to examine silver release in a pressurized flow through system figure s2 a ro membrane coupon 4 3 cm a 14 6 cm2 was placed at the bottom of the reactor cell which was fed with 200 ml nanopure water at an applied pressure of 90 psi 6 2 bar a magnetic bar was placed inside the cell to allow a fast mixing to minimize mass transfer limited agnp dissolution time integrated permeate samples were collected continuously over 4 h operating time in six 50 ml centrifuge tubes 0 10 min 11 30 min 31 60 min 61 120 min 121 180 min and 181 240 min at the end of the experiment the remaining solution inside the cell was also collected for the analysis of agnp and dissolved silver concentrations the used membrane was placed in 2 hno3 for quantifying residual silver content the mass balance was calculated based on the summation of total released silver and residual silver on tested membranes triplicate experiments of dead end filtration were performed with each extraction solution to calculate uncertainty for silver release and mass balance 2 2 4 cross flow filtration agnp coated membranes were tested in a commercial cross flow filtration membrane cell system tomar water system inc to represent typical operating conditions for ro membranes all wetted parts of the system are made from stainless steel with the exception of the chemical resistant tubing leading to and from the filter and filter housing and feed tank which are made of polyethylene each of three test cells sterlitech cf042 installed on top of the cross flow system had an effective membrane surface area of 42 cm2 approximately 23 l deionized water ph 6 7 was used as the extraction solution for agnp coated membranes a feed pressure of 90 psi consistent with dead end filtration was applied to produce a water flux of approximately 20 30 l m2 h the retentate stream was recirculated back to the feed tank to allow a constant mixing of feed and retentate the feed temperature was maintained at 23 1 c by circulating chilled water from a refrigerated bath thermo neslab rte 5 digital through a stainless steel coil in the feed retentate tank during the first 11 h operation permeate was collected in a 1 l glass beaker while the retentate stream was continuously recycled after 11 h the permeate flow was directed back to the retentate tank until the completion of experiment the permeate samples from the three cells were collected at selected time points for monitoring water flux and silver release to the produced water the release of silver to the retentate stream was monitored by collecting samples directly from the feed retentate tank duplicate experiments were operated for 50 h after which the membrane coupons were digested and analysed for residual silver amount the permeate and retentate samples were analysed for the concentration of both nanoparticulate and dissolved silver by sp icp ms within two days of sampling 2 2 5 water jetting system a low pressure water jetting system figure s3 was developed to study silver leaching under the impact of hydraulic abrasion using water flow a detailed description of system design and operation conditions is provided in supporting information briefly a circular membrane coupon 1 8 cm was subject to water jet spray at a rate of 1100 ml min equivalent to a hydraulic pressure of 19 psi on membrane surface from a vertical direction one litre extraction solution i e nanopure water was constantly recirculated by a peristaltic pump for a total operation time of 60 min five 15 ml samples were collected from the reservoir at 5 15 30 45 and 60 min which were then analysed for agnp and dissolved silver concentrations after the completion of water jetting test the exposed membrane coupon 0 32 cm2 was digested and analysed for residual silver content the silver mass balance was calculated by summing the mass of released silver and residual silver on the exposed membrane which was compared with the initial silver loading at least duplicate experiments were performed for the water jetting tests under a specific condition 2 3 single particle icp ms for silver analysis analysis for the concentration of dissolved and nanoparticulate silver was performed by sp icp ms using a thermo xseries ii icp ms system briefly the instrument was operated at a time resolved single particle mode with an integration dwell time of 10 ms and a data collection time of 120 s samples from silver release tests were introduced directly into the instrument by the peristaltic pump within 24 h of collection when high dissolved silver concentration was observed 1 ppb samples were diluted in nanopure water prior to analysis instrument calibration utilized one blank and four dissolved silver standard solutions 200 2000 ng l transport efficiency was determined for each analysis using a national institutes of standards and technology nist 60 nm aunp and ionic au standard based on the method described in pace et al 2011 to monitor instrumental drift over time a single 200 ng l dissolved silver calibration standard was analysed between every ten samples in the single particle mode data analyses were carried out manually by plotting raw pulse intensity data against collection time background i e dissolved ag counts were subtracted from the pulse intensity and agnp was sized using a density of 10 49 g cm3 the minimum detectable agnp size was 30 nm by sp icp ms in this study contributing factors that limit the minimum size detection included matrix signal suppression salting of the cones high dissolved silver background and decreased instrumental sensitivity over time in addition to particle sizing mass concentrations of both nanoparticulate and ionic silver can be obtained from sp icp ms analysis the total silver concentration was then calculated by summing the two components for selected samples the total silver concentration determined by sp icp ms were compared with the results of normal mode icp ms after acidification for 92 of the selected samples the results agreed with each other within 15 uncertainty 3 results 3 1 formation of agnp coating on ro membrane surface the in situ formation of agnp on the spiral wound membrane was indicated by the change of surface color from white to yellow brown figure s4 secondary electron sem images showed that agnp coated membrane had the same ridge and valley structure of a pristine polyamide membrane fig 1 at a relatively high magnification of 25000 deposits of bright nanoparticles can be clearly observed on the membrane surfaces the bse sem analysis coupled with edx confirmed the formation of discrete silver nanoparticles instead of a continuous layer of ag0 deposits on the membrane surface fig 1c the nanoparticles however were unevenly distributed at the micro scale and varied in diameter most agnps have size less than 50 nm but they can form aggregates with diameters up to 200 nm on the membrane surface the average particle size is clearly greater than 15 nm as reported by ben sasson et al 2014 using the same coating method after acid digestion the surface silver loading was determined to be 2 52 0 34 μg cm2 the variance in silver loading agreed with the uneven agnp surface coverage observed by sem the results suggest that localized spots in the spiral wound membrane may experience silver accumulation during in situ silver reduction process to understand this variable in silver release test at least triplicate experiments were performed to determine the initial silver loading for each test method 3 2 silver release from polyamide membrane using batch and dead end filtration batch immersion and dead end filtration are conventional platforms for evaluating metal leaching from membranes fig 2 a shows the concentration of total released silver in a batch system over time up to three days rapid silver release occurred at the beginning of the experiment resulting in 53 ppb silver 15 2 initial silver loading in the 40 ml leachate at 60 min the mass release rate slowed down after 360 min and followed a sigmoidal shape at longer reaction time at the end of the experiment 51 of initial silver loading was released into the extraction solution of nanopure water at a concentration of 180 ppb leaving 1 54 0 16 μg ag cm2 on the membrane fig 3 a the released silver was nearly all dissolved silver as determined by sp icp ms agnp was found negligible lod in the leachate regardless of reaction time the calculated silver mass balance was consistently 106 6 table 2 indicating a good reproducibility of the testing platform in dead end filtration tests total silver concentration in the filtrate was initially high at 6 ppb and decreased over time at an operating flux rate of 20 2 2 l m2 h fig 2b fig 3b shows the cumulative silver release to the permeate plotted against time at the end of the 4 h experiment the total released silver was 0 64 0 2 μg 80 of which was in the 80 ml extraction solution left in the reactor the total released silver accounted for less than 2 of the initial silver mass on the membrane so the majority of silver remained on the membrane 2 2 μg ag cm2 in the permeate both nanoparticulate and dissolved silver concentrations decreased over time the relative quantity of agnp quickly dropped from 41 to 15 of the total silver present at the end of the experiment suggesting an increasing influence of silver dissolution over the duration of the test in the final retentate nanoparticulate silver accounted for 12 of total ag similar to that in the permeate the averaged mass balance achieved 90 2 recovery table 2 indicating a good reproducibility of the testing platform 3 3 silver release in cross flow filtration the evaluation of silver release from the bench scale cross flow filtration system was based on silver analysis in separate permeate and retentate streams fig 2c shows that silver concentration in the permeate was initially 18 ppb and decreased rapidly over time in comparison silver concentration in the retentate was lower 2 2 ppb but remained relatively stable over longer test time e g 20 h because of the low permeate flux 28 l m2 h the mass of released silver into the permeate 7 1 μg was smaller than present in the retentate 45 7 μg at 1 h experiment from a total membrane area of 126 cm2 over the following 10 h the amount of released silver increased to 42 μg in the permeate but slightly decrease to 35 μg in the retentate fig 3c shows the released silver mass normalized to the membrane area over the first 11 h experiment while released silver in the permeate increased almost linearly the amount of total released silver in permeate and retentate became constant after 5 h at 11 h reaction the cross flow filtration resulted in a total silver release of 0 65 μg cm2 accounting for 24 of initial silver loading 2 70 μg ag cm2 of the tested membranes the silver concentration in permeate and retentate continued to decrease after 11 h but the value was consistently greater in the permeate fig 2c because the permeate flow was directed back to the retentate tank from 11 to 50 h the released silver in the permeate was not calculated assuming all released silver was retained in the retentate tank the amount of total released silver was calculated to be only 6 4 μg at 50 h significantly lower than the amount estimated at 11 h at the completion of the tests used membranes were digested for measuring remaining silver content on the membrane surfaces surprisingly only 13 6 4 3 of initial silver loading remained on the surface a substantial amount of silver was clearly released 2 3 μg ag cm2 during cross flow filtration but was not detected in the retentate tank the incomplete silver mass balance table 2 suggested an underestimation of long term silver release in the complex cross flow filtration system mainly due to silver adsorption by large contact surfaces of various reactor components e g tank tubing pump etc the results indicate a clear challenge to the quantification of released silver when using this test platform the analyses of silver speciation with sp icp ms showed that nanoparticles were consistently detected in the retentate but not in the permeate the concentration of dissolved silver in the retentate stream was significantly greater than nanoparticulate ag accounting for more than 90 of total released ag however the agnp mass concentration and relative abundance both increased over time fig 3c suggesting continuous detachment of agnp during cross flow filtration the typical average agnp size determined by sp icp ms was 55 nm fig s5 larger than primary agnp size observed by sem on membrane surface fig 1 3 4 silver release in water jetting tests fig 2d shows the trends of the two silver components as a function of time during the test when nanopure water was used as an extraction solution immediately after the initiation of water jet 5 min nanoparticulate and dissolved silver were detected in the leachate at concentrations of 9 2 ng l and 70 ng l respectively over the 1 h experiment agnp concentrations slightly decreased to 7 7 ng l while dissolved silver concentration increased almost linearly to 290 ng l at 60 min the dissolved silver concentration at any time point was significantly higher than that of agnp the fraction of agnp in total released silver decreased accordingly from 12 at 5 min to 3 at 60 min the majority of released agnp have sizes between 35 and 45 nm fig s5 which are similar to the agnp found in other test systems however because sp icp ms has a detection limit of 25 35 nm smaller agnp 35 nm may not be detected and accounted for in the leachate it is possible agnp concentration was underestimated in all test systems at the conclusion of the tests the remaining silver on the water exposed membrane area was 0 86 0 14 μg cm2 or 42 6 9 of initial silver loading fig 3d the silver mass balance was calculated to be 88 11 by combining the released silver in solution and residual silver on membrane table 2 the slight silver loss can be partly explained the adsorption of released silver to the components of the water jetting system e g tubing reservoir wall etc nevertheless the water jetting test was demonstrated to be reproducible platform and provide a direct evidence that agnp can be removed from polyamide membrane by hydraulic abrasion 3 5 effect of acidic ph and chloride on silver release agnp coated ro membranes were also tested in ph 5 solutions with and without the additional of chloride cl to evaluate silver release at different chemical conditions table 1 the released silver concentration followed similar trends at the lower ph as in nanopure water for a given test platform for example in a batch system the total silver release also exhibited a sigmoidal shape after a rapid initial release at ph 5 data not shown the residual silver content on the membrane however was different from the results in nanopure water and was influenced by acidic ph or the presence of chloride anion the amounts of released silver on the membrane at the completion of each experiment are summarized in table 3 at ph 5 in the absence of chloride the released silver was 1 75 μg cm2 in the batch system leaving 0 98 μg cm2 35 of initial ag on the membrane after the three day experiment in the presence of 2 mm cl silver release significantly decreased and the residual silver content increased to 2 20 μg ag cm2 78 of initial ag on the membrane similar results were observed for silver release in the water jetting experiments where the residual silver contents were 1 46 and 2 02 μg ag cm2 in the absence and presence of chloride respectively dead end and cross flow filtration yielded comparable results for the silver release and retention with different water chemistry in the respective group table 3 it is difficult to clearly determine the effect of ph and chloride on silver release by using these two test platforms however the cross flow filtration tests resulted in substantially more silver release from the membrane over the 50 h operation compared to dead end filtration the residual silver contents were only 0 63 and 0 69 μg ag cm2 in the absence and presence of 2 mm cl respectively while both values are higher than in nanopure water they do not exhibit a significant impact of dissolved cl on silver release in cross flow filtration when cl concentration further increased to 10 mm in the feed solution silver released also increased leaving only 0 30 μg ag cm2 11 of initial ag at the completion of the experiment 4 discussion 4 1 release rate of silver at different testing conditions to facilitate comparison of the four different testing platforms the cumulative release of silver in nanopure water is plotted against time for each platform after normalization to surface area fig 4 the initial rate of silver release was calculated based on the linear range of plots where the r squared value was greater than 0 95 fig 4 demonstrates that water jetting resulted in the fastest silver release while dead end filtration caused the slowest release the rate is 11 6 1 0 ng ag cm2 min by water jet which is more than two orders of magnitude greater than by dead end filtration 0 047 0 007 ng ag cm2 min batch immersion and cross flow filtration resulted in intermediate silver release at 4 30 0 5 and 0 73 0 05 ng ag cm2 min respectively although batch immersion and dead end filtration have been commonly used for testing membrane stability the results from this study clearly showed that they can yield different information on silver release from what may be expected in the actual practice i e cross flow membrane operation batch immersion tends to overestimate the silver release potential while dead end filtration platform may greatly underestimate the release from the coated membrane in the dead end filtration cell although the solution is stirred the membrane is kept static and does not undergo vigorous agitation i e hydraulic shear as in the batch reactor in contrast the hydraulic turbulence occurring in the batch reactor likely facilitates the dissolution of agnp on the polyamide membrane the highest silver release rate is in the water jetting system indicating that hydraulic abrasion can promote silver release and cause the direct detachment of agnp form the coated membrane the relatively faster initial release of silver was also observed in previous studies using the batch immersion method yin et al 2013 reported a silver release of 0 37 μg cm2 over the first day in a similar batch system 1 cm2 membrane in 20 ml di water the amount of released silver over the 14 day experiment accounted for 12 of initial silver loading on the membrane the same membrane tested by dead end filtration showed a slower silver release at a pressure of 300 psi the cumulative amount of released silver in the 4 85 l permeate accounted for merely 3 5 of initial silver loading compared to the poorly adhered agnp membrane in this study the membrane in yin et al experienced much slower silver release in either test platform the difference in agnp stability is likely explained by the mechanism of agnp attachment on the polyamide membranes in their study the covalently bonded agnp using cysteamine as a bridging agent likely protected agnp from direct detachment and dissolution more strongly yin et al 2013 it was expected that the slow release can maintain the antimicrobial properties of the agnp coated membrane for months in another batch immersion test on agnp modified polyamide membrane the release rate of silver was even lower at 0 1 μg cm2 per day yang et al 2016 the study used polydopamine pda instead of sodium borohydride to reduce ag and form dispersed agnp on the membrane these results suggest that agnp coated membranes prepared with different approaches can be compared using the batch immersion system for agnp stability 4 2 evaluating agnp detachment with different testing platforms most previous membrane studies only analysed total released silver after acidification assuming agnp detachment is negligible during the release test rahaman et al 2014 zodrow et al 2009 by employing sp icp ms this study for the first time demonstrates the possibility of agnp release to membrane treated water through direct agnp detachment among the four test platforms dead end and cross flow filtration allowed the evaluation of agnp mass and particle concentration in the finished water permeate compared to agnp in the finished water the release of agnp into the retentate stream potentially poses a greater challenge to wastewater management as discussed with fig 2 agnp concentration in the retentate stream increased over time during the cross flow filtration suggesting agnp may be continuously stripped from the membrane surface the consequent accumulation of agnp in the membrane retentate i e brine might require its concentration to be monitored before being discharged this study shows that different testing platforms may yield different silver release result in the batch immersion test no agnp was detected in the leachate regardless of reaction time the release mechanism was dominated by the oxidative dissolution of agnp on membrane surfaces this result however was not observed in other testing platforms which all identified the presence of agnp at the beginning of dead end filtration and water jetting tests the agnp concentration although extremely low 20 ng l constituted a good portion of total released silver fig 2 the initial agnp release was likely caused by the detachment of loosely bound agnp on membrane after in situ synthesis over time the relative concentration of agnp to total silver concentration continued to decrease in the leachate so that dissolution quickly became the dominant silver release mechanism in particular water jet substantially accelerated the oxidative dissolution of agnp probably because the extraction solution is sufficiently aerated before contacting the membrane surface 4 3 the effect of chemical composition of extraction solutions on silver release while agnp dissolution and stability is known to be influenced by solution ph and chemical composition many previous release tests used ultrapure water as the only extraction solution for membranes table s1 as shown in fig 5 nanopure water typically resulted in the most significant silver release across all testing platforms within a given duration of the test lowering the solution ph to the acidic range ph 5 appears to only have limited impact on silver release and may even reduce silver release this result seems to contradict to the previous analysis that agnp dissolution rate increases with decreasing ph liu and hurt 2010 theoretically after ag0 is oxidized by adsorbed oxygen the protonation of surface groups ag oh at acidic ph can destabilize ag o bonds and facilitate the release of ag from ag0 surfaces peretyazhko et al 2014 because the extraction solution used monosodium phosphate nah2po4 as the ph buffer phosphate groups may form surface complexes with ag o and reduce the available surface sites for oxygen adsorption the formation of silver phosphate species might further reduce silver solubility ksp 8 89 10 17 in the extraction solution thompson 1973 it is likely that the overall release of silver was controlled by a slower oxidation process of agnp by oxygen wu et al 2015 since the detachment of ag from agnp surfaces was relatively fast therefore the increased proton concentration did not have a significant impact on the silver release rate we also showed that dissolved chloride may affect silver release from agnp coated membrane chloride is the most prevalent monovalent anion in natural water and municipal wastewater wu et al 2015 it can strongly affect the silver release due to the strong affinity to oxidized ag and the formation of various ag cl species aqueous or insoluble depending on its concentration dissolved cl can either promote or suppress the dissolution of agnp in a suspension ksp agcl 1 77 10 10 chambers et al 2014 levard et al 2013 this effect is now observed when agnp are immobilized on the membrane surfaces as thin film coating fig 5 shows that the amount of released silver may decrease in 2 mm cl solution in all test platforms possibly due to the formation of sparingly soluble agcl precipitates when the cl concentration increased to 10 mm the release of silver in both permeate and retentate streams increased during the cross flow filtration fig 5 because the lower cl concentration 1 mm mgcl2 was selected by nsf international for testing drinking water system components our results suggest the recipe may underestimate silver release from agnp coated membrane when treating drinking water a previous study similarly used nacl solutions to simulate natural water and wastewater and tested silver release from ag zeolite membranes by batch immersion in a 24 h increment wu et al 2015 the rate of silver release was observed to rise when cl concentration increased from 10 mm to 154 mm which was explained by the formation of predominantly soluble agclx x 1 species at high cl silver molar ratios about 70 of initially loaded agnp remained on the membrane after the 7 day release experiment in 10 mm nacl solutions which is higher than the residual agnp tested in the current study of cross flow filtration therefore the impact of dissolved chloride on silver release not only depends on its concentration but also the characteristics of agnp coated membrane when performing silver release tests extraction solution should represent a larger range of solution chemistry while ultrapure water is an excellent candidate that can be used to provide a baseline of silver release extraction solution may also include common anions that can form soluble complexes or precipitates with ag after ag0 dissolution such as dissolved chloride additional research needs to further consider the impact of the anions on the antimicrobial properties of the membrane because the newly formed silver species may have different toxicity than free silver ions levard et al 2013 4 4 the selection of test platform for nanoparticle release from membrane systems for the development of nano enabled water treatment systems the use of release test platform should address the following questions 1 whether and how much silver can enter the produced water and brine 2 what is the operation time of agnp coated membrane before agnp are required to be regenerated or replaced and 3 what is the antimicrobial efficacy of membranes based on the released silver in the bulk solution the first question is important for human and environmental exposure and risk assessment while the last two are relevant from an engineering perspective for product design and development for the agnp coated ro membrane evaluated in this study all test platforms clearly demonstrated that silver will be released from membrane surfaces in contact with water the silver concentration measured in the bulk solution is typically below 0 1 mg l or the secondary maximum contaminant level smcl for drinking water established by u s environmental protection agency usepa 2008 the only exception is batch immersion test which showed the cumulative dissolved silver concentration exceeding 0 1 mg l shortly after 8 h reaction as discussed earlier batch immersion tests yielded higher silver release rate from membrane than most other tests and is likely not representative of field conditions but because the method was a commonly used platform for metal release the results acquired from this method can provide a basis for comparing membranes fabricated by different approaches to provide a more realistic evaluation of silver release to produced water and brine cross flow filtration is recommended by monitoring silver in both permeate and retentate streams by quantifying the residual agnp on the membrane after the test the overall silver release can be calculated and used to estimate the service life assuming the antimicrobial activity of agnp coated membranes relies on the release of dissolved silver xiu et al 2012 the dissolved silver concentration in the bulk solution may be used to predict the antimicrobial efficacy of the membrane in all test platforms however silver concentration was much lower than the reported minimum inhibitory concentration mic90 6 10 mg l to different strains of p aeruginosa sandstrom 2011 clearly the strong antimicrobial activity of agnp coated membrane is directly related to the much higher silver concentration localized at or near the membrane surface among the four test platforms only batch immersion and dead end filtration allowed the silver release process in a completely mixed system assuming the bulk silver concentration is near equilibrium with the surface ag it is possible to determine the biologically active silver concentration on membrane surface when using the two platforms however because the antimicrobial properties of the membranes were not assessed in this study the correlation between bulk silver concentration and antimicrobial efficacy of membranes cannot be concluded when conducting silver release tests on ro membranes the cost and operating conditions of test platform may also be considered to determine the selection table s2 the cross flow filtration requires a specialized experimental system which has the highest capital cost among all four platforms the operation maintenance and data analysis for cross flow filtration are the most demanding which may explain its unpopularity for membrane evaluation the complexity of the system may also cause silver loss due to ag adsorption to the reactor components thus posing a challenge to quantifying silver release in the brine however because cross flow cell typically uses much larger membrane areas 42 cm2 in this study than other platforms the test result may better represent the average silver release behavior on membrane with large spatial heterogeneity in comparison batch immersion and water jetting tests are cost effective alternatives that use small size membrane the water jetting test takes the shortest operation time to yield the most significant silver release which can be used for a conservative estimate of antimicrobial service life the batch immersion test according to the nsf ansi 61 protocol would take much longer operation time for at least 3 days the dead end filtration on the other hand does not have clear advantages either in the cost or operation because dead end filtration may significantly underestimate silver release potential the information obtained from this platform can be used for determining the most conservative release rate 5 conclusions the development of agnp modified polyamide membrane is usually accompanied by the evaluation of silver release to assess the stability antimicrobial efficacy and subsequently service life of the membranes in this study four different test platforms i e batch immersion dead end filtration cross flow filtration and low pressure water jetting were used to determine the release of both dissolved and nanoparticulate silver from the membrane for the first time we demonstrate that nanoparticulate silver can be released to the bulk solution in addition to dissolved ag although the oxidative dissolution of ag0 consistently dominates the release mechanism the detachment of loosely attached agnp may account for an important source of released silver at the early testing stage this event is clearly demonstrated during dead end filtration where about 50 of total released silver was agnp within the first 10 min test however the dead end filtration resulted in the slowest silver release compared to other test platforms thus may significantly underestimate silver release during actual water treatment the popular batch immersion test is recommended to be performed for most nano enabled membrane because the results can be compared by extracting information from a larger literature base this test platform may be particularly useful for evaluating the detachment of less water soluble nanomaterials such as gold or zero valent iron zvi nanoparticles to enhance the predictive capability of release tests on the release behavior of nano enabled membrane more than one method is recommended to be employed by considering the capital cost and operating complexity summarized in this study the variation in extraction solution chemistry may further improve the applicability of the test platforms for a broader range of

19416,enhanced removal of trace toxic metals ppm level from high salinity wastewater is crucial to ensure water safety but still a challenging task in this study we fabricated a new hybrid ultrafiltration membrane paa zif 8 pvdf by immobilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 particles onto the surface of trimesoyl chloride tmc modified polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane under protection of polyacrylic acid paa layer the resultant paa zif 8 pvdf membrane exhibited relatively high water flux of 460 l m 2 h 1 and outstanding nickel ion ni ii capacity 219 09 mg g from a synthetic high salinity na 15000 mg l wastewater x ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies revealed that preferable ni ii uptake was mainly attributed to the specific interaction between ni ii and hydroxyl groups on zif 8 frameworks and carboxyl groups in paa layer as well compared to paa zif 8 could selectively bind ni ii with negligible effect exerted by concentrated sodium ion the filtration study showed that the 12 56 cm2 membrane could effectively treat 5 76 l high salinity wastewater ni ii 0 2 mg l na 0 15000 mg l to conspicuously reduce ni ii below the maximum contaminant level of china 0 1 mg l moreover the hybrid membrane could be regenerated by hcl nacl solution ph 5 5 for repeated use under direct current electric field generally speaking the newly developed zif 8 hybrid ultrafiltration membrane showed a very promising potential in enhanced removal of toxic metals from high salinity wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords ni ii high salinity wastewater paa zif 8 pvdf membrane ultrafiltration electrostatic adsorption hydrogen bonding adsorption 1 introduction nickel ni has been extensively applied in electroplating electrolysis mining metallurgy and surface finishing industries because of its chemical inertness from water air and alkali corrosion raval et al 2016 a large amount of ni contained wastewater hence has been discharged which may pose a serious threat to human health and the ecosystem habiba et al 2017 bolisetty and mezzenga 2016 therefore ni is already labeled as one prior heavy metal pollutant to be monitored and controlled by the u s environmental protection agency u s epa 2014 generally ni in industrial wastewater exists mainly in the form of positive ions ni ii fu and wang 2011 several methods have been developed to remove ni ii from industrial wastewaters such as chemical precipitation biodegradation adsorption johnson and worrall 2007 liu et al 2012 lofrano et al 2016 however with the strictness of industrial wastewater discharged standard the emission concentration of ni ii was lower than 0 1 mg l china epa 2008 which seriously restricted the aforementioned applications membrane separation is an alternative technology to remove heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes can separate all low molecular weight contaminant species including metal ions park et al 2017 werber et al 2017 while both of them were limited by some shortages such as high intrinsic costs huge energy consumption and water losses ultrafiltration uf membrane has characteristics of simple operation low cost and easy maintenance but uf cannot separate metal ions from water because of its larger pore size zhao et al 2016 thus it is a reliable protocol to combine uf membrane with adsorbents to remove trace ni ii in industrial wastewater up to now a variety of adsorbents have been introduced to modify uf membrane for ni ii removal such as metal metal oxide nanoparticles polymer and biomass materials yin and deng 2015 barakat and schmidt 2010 habiba et al 2017 khajeh et al 2013 actually the ni ii contained industrial wastewater after being consecutively pre treated with ph adjustment coagulation sedimentation and so on usually contains 2 5 mg l ni ii along with high concentration 104 ppm of alkali metal cations e g na k pan et al 2010 high salinity easily gives rise to inactivation of common adsorbents which makes their less attractive in industrially relevant scales therefore it is crucial to found a adsorption material which compatible with uf membrane to eliminate trace ni ii in high salinity wastewater selectively metal organic frameworks mofs one kind of metallic coordination polymer constructed by metal atom with organic linkers have received tremendous attention because of their customizable chemical functionalities and versatile architectures recently substantial advancements have been made in mofs based wastewater treatment furukawa et al 2013 canivet et al 2014 particularly in the removal of trace heavy metal ions e g hg2 pb2 and cd2 from water luo et al 2015 ricco et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks 8 zif 8 a subclass of mofs is featured with high chemical and water stability large accessible surface area and abundant active surface sites brown et al 2012 some previous studies have proved that zif 8 particles not only possess the ability of trapping trace heavy metal ions but also are strong stable in the presence of various interfering anions cl no3 and so4 2 wu et al 2014 li et al 2014 however just like any other adsorbents zif 8 particles are often prepared in the form of dispersive powders which cause problems in adsorption regeneration processes and potential safety concerns ascribe to leak into water supplies pan et al 2017 moreover head loss and compaction of powders over treatment process that prevent the system to work at its full potential which also make difficult for the regeneration of materials casadellà et al 2016 for the needs of practical application the powder materials should to be supported or specifically shaped thus the hybrid uf membrane can be a good choice for achieving particles immobilized and wastewater treatment simultaneously which successfully combine the advantages of zif 8 particles and uf membrane together and overcome their respective drawbacks in water hu and his co worker has successfully demonstrated the excellent stability of zif 8 hybrid uf membrane through experimental and molecular dynamic simulation studies hu et al 2011 other research results also indicated that zif 8 is more likely to be compatible with polymer materials which can be easily tuned to meet the requirements for the membrane fabrication and water separation zhang et al 2014a b wang et al 2016 in this study a novel zif 8 hybrid uf membrane paa zif 8 pvdf membrane was developed by physically immobilizing zif 8 particles on the surface of pvdf membrane though a two step process zif 8 particles were adhered to the surface of pvdf membrane in the first step and then polyacrylic acid paa coating was used to protect the zif 8 particles remained on membrane surface the benefit of this design strategy is that the pvdf membrane can be endowed with ni ii adsorption capacity and its inherent properties are also well maintained morphologies wettability pure water flux and potential of zero charge were evaluated to obtain the basic characteristics of the membrane a series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted on ph adsorption isotherm and salinity effect to obtain the key parameters for the adsorption process the mechanism was investigated through the adsorption experiments and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyzer and x ray diffraction study finally the study of long time membrane filtration and regeneration were conducted to test its actual application it is the first time that zif 8 hybrid pvdf membranes has been successfully used for removing trace ni ii especially in high salinity industrial wastewater we anticipate that our work could stimulate more studies toward the rational design of a highly efficient and multifunctional mofs hybrid membrane additionally considering the costs of mofs hybrid membranes in application the further study on the optimal structure activity relationship between paa zif 8 pvdf membrane and target heavy metal pollutants is also extremely necessary 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were reagent

hexane solution for 2 min which provided membrane surface a better wetting property to attract zif 8 subsequently the membrane was rapidly transferred to vacuum filter and the zif 8 tmc n hexane mixed solution was poured into vacuum filter then a pump was applied at the bottom of filter to pump out the solution which help to leave a zif 8 functional layer the next steps were in accordance with paa functionalized pvdf membranes the zif 8 particles were physically covered by paa on the membrane surface finally the dense sandwich like paa zif 8 pvdf membranes were formed membranes with different

50 2θ at a rate of 5 per minute under cu k alpha radiation λ 1 5418 å the variations of surface functional groups on membranes were characterized by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyzer ftir nicolet is5 thermo usa in the spectra range of 400 4000 cm 1 with an attenuated total reflection atr accessory the surface chemical composition of membranes before and after ni ii loaded were

adsorption experiment the stock ni ii solution with a concentration of 2 g l was prepared by dissolving ni no3 2 into ultrapure water and the stock solutions were diluted by ultrapure water for the subsequent adsorption experiments the effects of different ph value on ni ii adsorption was investigated by adding dispersive zif 8 particles 0 05 g paa pvdf membrane 12 56 cm2 and paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane 12 56 cm2 into 50 ml ni ii solutions 50 mg l with varying initial ph values from 2 to 5 5 respectively 0 1 m naoh or hno3 was used to adjust the ph of solution adsorption isotherm was tested by batch experiments in which 0 05 g of zif 8 particles 12 56 cm2 paa pvdf membrane and 12 56 cm2 of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane were added to 50 ml ni ii solutions with different initial concentrations 2 220 mg l respectively the ph values of solutions were adjusted to 5 5 0 2 in order to find out salinity effect on ni ii adsorption four groups of adsorption isotherm experiments in various salt concentration na 0 5000 10000 and 15000 mg l were conducted in the aforementioned studies the adsorption capacity was calculated by measuring the difference between initial and final or

adsorbents dosage g all adsorption experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average data was used to evaluate performance 2 8 membrane filtration and regeneration the filtration study of the membrane was carried out in the same dead end filtration membrane module as that was used for testing the pwf of membranes a piece of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane with an effective area of 12 56 cm2 was immobilized in the membrane module the filtration experiment was conducted under the flow rate of 30 ml h at room temperature and the lange pump baoding china was used to ensure a stable flow rate simulated ni ii contained wastewater ph 5 5 that containing 2 mg l ni ii along with high concentration na 15000 mg l was prepared as the feed solution the effluents were collected periodically for ni

analysis the regeneration experiment was operated in site electric field 2 2 v within three cycles of adsorption desorption process by using hcl nacl solution na 1000 mg l ph 5 5 as regeneration

the equilibrium concentration of feeding solution in two cycles respectively mg l v and vr are the volume of the ni ii effluent in two cycles respectively l 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 cross sectional microstructure fig 2 a illustrated the cross sectional image of pristine pvdf membrane where the typical asymmetric structure could be observed with a thin dense top layer supported by many fingers like sub layer pores subsequently the as prepared pvdf membrane was used as substrate to fabricate paa zif 8 pvdf membrane as demonstrated in fig 2b 2d the paa zif 8 active layer was tightly integrated with pvdf membrane via vacuum suction and paa in situ polymerization where the thicknesses of active layer was controlled by the loading amount of zif 8 the thickness of 6 1 7 7 and 14 6 μm correspond to the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 03 0 05 and 0 08 membrane respectively during fabrication the microstructure in pvdf membrane demonstrated no critical change by incorporation of zif 8 and introduction of paa coating fig 2e and the inset image exhibited a cross sectional sector magnified from paa zif 8 active layer which can be seen that zif 8 particles were well dispersed in paa active layer without aggregation in addition to medium function of tmc the paa coating significantly assists the homogeneous distribution and stabilization of zif 8 particles on membrane surface the eds mapping scanning spectra were used to determine the cross sectional chemical composition of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane referring to fig 2f carbon c oxygen o nitrogen n fluorine f and zinc zn elements are observed and zn and f elements were mainly distributed in the paa zif 8 active layer and support membrane respectively which was in according with the analyses in fesem images 3 1 2 surface roughness the surface roughness of various membranes was investigated by 3 d afm and the relevant images and data were presented in fig s5 the roughness average ra slightly increased from 32 1 nm for pristine pvdf membrane to 43 5 nm for paa pvdf membrane the increased ra could be attributed to the agglomeration of paa on the pvdf membrane further the surface roughness increased dramatically along with the addition of zif 8 particles the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 08 membrane acquired the highest ra value of 113 6 nm the presence of zif 8 particles in the paa zif 8 active layer was induced many bumpy and nodular points on surface of substrate which resulted in an obvious enhancement of roughness qin et al 2015 3 1 3 xps analysis the xps wide spectra of various membranes and zif 8 particles were performed to detect the surface chemical composition and the results were shown in fig 3 the atom ratio of o f increased from 0 09 for pristine pvdf membrane to 4 93 for paa pvdf membrane which means a large quantity of coo groups has been introduced onto the pvdf membrane surface through in situ acrylic acid polymerization reaction compared to the peaks of c 1s n 1s o 1s and f 1s detected in paa pvdf membrane a new peak of zn 2p centered at 1098 ev was appeared in paa zif 8 pvdf membrane which was in consistency with the zn 2p peak in zif 8 wang et al 2016 additionally the intensity of n 1s markedly increased which further verified the fact that zif 8 was successfully immobilized onto the surface of pvdf membrane through paa coating in the novel designed paa zif 8 pvdf membrane in our work 3 2 water flux and surface wettability the ca is usually employed to evaluate the surface wettability of the membranes in general the smaller ca indicated the better hydrophilicity of membrane when ca is less than 90 as shown in fig 4 compared to 83 2 of the pristine pvdf membrane the ca of paa pvdf membrane dramatically decreased to 42 2 since amounts of coo groups are presented on the membrane surface zhang et al 2014a b however the ca of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane increased from 43 7 to 51 4 with addition of hydrophobic zif 8 particles that is the zif 8 particles embedded on the membrane surface would leads to improvement of the surface hydrophobicity liu et al 2013 for separation membrane pwf is the key parameter in appraising the properties of practical application qin et al 2016 thus the pwf of as fabricated membranes were tested and compared and the results were also shown in fig 4 the pwf of pristine pvdf membrane was 410 l m 2h 1 and that of paa pvdf membrane reached up to 485 l m 2h 1 compared to paa pvdf membrane the pwf of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane decreased gradually from 478 to 392 l m 2h 1 as the zif 8 amount increased the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 08 membrane corresponding to its high density of paa zif 8 functional layer possessed the lowest pwf in achieving a balance between ca and pwf paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane was selected as optimum candidate for subsequent ni ii adsorption testing 3 3 ni ii adsorption testing 3 3 1 effect of ph value in fig 5 a the pzc of zif 8 particles paa pvdf membrane and paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane were carefully measured to be 3 2 4 4 and 4 0 respectively which means that the optimum ph value for ni ii adsorption on paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane was higher than 4 0 the paa zif 8 active layer consists of two parts paa layer and loaded zif 8 in order to evaluate the effect of the ph on the ni ii adsorption onto both parts the batch experiments at various ph value 2 5 5 were conducted at 50 mg l initial concentration of ni ii solution as depicted in fig 5b in the range of ph 2 4 4 the zif 8 played a more important role in ni ii adsorption since ph value higher than 4 4 electrostatic interactions with coo groups occurred the ni ii adsorption capacity on pvdf zif 8 paa 0 05 increased dramatically along with the increase of ph this result was consistent with previous study in pzc when the ph value increased to 5 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity was up to 49 2 mg g representing 99 ni ii removal although it is expected that it continues to rise for higher ph since the proportion of carboxylate form increases which is beneficial for adsorbing ni ii when the ph is higher than 5 5 the ni ii may be precipitated with additional hydroxide ions zhao et al 2016 moreover from an application perspective the ph value of ni ii contained wastewater is usually below 6 pan et al 2009 hence ph 5 5 was selected as optimum ph value in further experiments 3 3 2 effect of various salinities alkali metal cations are commonly found together with heavy metal ions in industrial wastewater pan et al 2009 and na was selected as a representative ionic factors in this study due to its ubiquity and abundance thus it is necessary to determine the effect of such innocuous cation on paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane for ni ii adsorption two kinds of isotherm models langmuir 6 and freundlich 7 were used to analyze the adsorption isotherm data both of models have been successfully applied to many heavy metal ions adsorption processes from aqueous phase li et al 2015 6 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 7 q e k f c e 1 n where qe mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qm mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration kl is langmuir constant l mg kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 and n stand for freundlich constants that related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively the adsorption isotherms of disperse zif 8 particles paa pvdf membrane and paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane under different salinity na 0 5000 10000 15000 mg l were fitted well with langmuir model and the correlation coefficients r2 were above 0 98 table 1 higher than those of freundlich model as shown in fig 6 in non salted and low salinity condition ni ii adsorption is governed by a combination of electrostatic interactions on coo groups of paa and specific hydrogen bonding interaction on hydroxyl of zif 8 as the salinity of ni ii contained wastewater increased the electrostatic interactions on coo groups were gradually weakened and eventually eliminated in high na levels 0 43 0 65 mol l because the high ionic strength screened the electrostatic interactions the adsorption capacity of paa pvdf membrane toward ni ii was apparently decreased from 85 53 to 16 54 mg g as na concentration increased from 0 to 15000 mg l while the maximum amounts of ni ii adsorption on zif 8 was maintained around 210 mg g no matter how na concentration increased means that specific adsorption of ni ii onto zif 8 was independent from variation of salinity obviously because of zif 8 the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane has exhibited prominent capability of ni ii adsorption even in high salinity condition the simulated maximum adsorption capacity of both three materials were also shown in fig s6 to further distinguish different sorption between the coo groups and zif 8 particles xps study was performed by choosing ni element as a representative criterion as shown in fig 7 the peaks of ni no3 2 consist of ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 ni 2p3 2 comprised two deconvoluted peaks at 856 75 and 862 38 ev respectively and ni 2p1 2 comprised two deconvoluted peaks at 874 27 and 880 32 ev respectively xu and liu 2008 remarkably a new peak at 857 7 ev was generated in fig 7a which was ascribe to specific hydrogen bonding interaction between zif 8 and ni ii o ni meanwhile the generation of another new peak in fig 7b at 853 6 ev was resulted from the electrostatic adsorption interaction by coo groups sheng et al 2011 coincidently both of peaks were also appeared in ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane fig 7c the area and intensity of peak coo ni was decreased significantly with the na concentration increased from 0 to 15000 mg l contrarily no noticeable variation was observed in peak o ni indicated that ni ii trapping by zif 8 was less vulnerable to high salinity than coo groups 3 3 3 ni ii adsorption mechanisms adsorption site of ni ii by paa zif 8 pvdf membrane was further probed with xps ftir and xrd as shown in fig 8 a the binding energy of o1s was analyzed as a discrete entity which has shifted from 531 1 to 531 9 ev after ni ii adsorption fig 8b was illustrated the deconvoluted spectra of the o1s region in virgin ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane a peak at 531 12 ev represented coo group of paa two peaks at 530 01 and 531 79 ev were belong to zif 8 which corresponded to zn o and n o respectively li et al 2014 after ni ii adsorption a remarkable shift to higher binding energy was observed for coo group which based on the following suggested mechanism however coo groups were vulnerable to great levels of na pan et al 2010 2r cooh aq ni2 aq 2r cooni aq 2h aq in addition a new peak in ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane occurred with a binding energy of 534 07 ev represented water oh indicated the involvement of hydration reaction on zif 8 frameworks tian et al 2014 pan et al 2011 li et al 2014 a large amount of hydration hydroxyl active sites zn oh and c n oh were produced through the dissociative adsorption of water both of these two distinct sites on zif 8 were bind with ni ii and subsequently formed monodentate and bidentate complexes zn oni and c n oni via specific hydrogen bonding interaction both of peaks 530 01 and 531 79 ev were shifted towards higher binding energy the process was demonstrated by the following reactions equation and zif 8 was free from interference of high salinity environment image 2 moreover fig s7 was illustrated the ftir spectra of pristine and ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane the spectra of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane have changed considerably after adsorption a broad new peak was generated at 3387 cm 1 that represented the stretching vibration of carboxylate cooni chizallet et al 2010 peaks at 623 cm 1 and 920 cm 1 which represented vibration of v zn o in zif 8 and v o h in coo groups respectively li et al 2014 han et al 2014 were weaken after adsorption a strong and intense peak around 850 910 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of o ni indicated the successful adsorption of ni ii onto paa zif 8 pvdf membrane four peaks 1428 1587 and 1650 1725 cm 1 were represented v c o of carboxyl group and v c n of imidazole ring which were difficult to distinguish and separate completely han et al 2014 tian et al 2014 after adsorption these peaks were replaced by two broad peak at 1600 and 1640 cm 1 which exactly coincided with the character peaks of carboxylate co oni and metal hydroxyl complexes oni respectively to verify the adsorption mechanism from the structure of zif 8 and explore the stability of zif 8 xrd spectrogram of zif 8 was obtained after 72 h of continuous immersion experiment under high salinity system as shown in fig s8 zif 8 has exhibited excellent structure stability in high salinity water only one weak new peak was generated near peak 002 which ascribed to the formation of hydration hydroxyl bond such as zn oh and c n oh on zif 8 frameworks cychosz and matzger 2010 after adsorption reaction two new peaks that split from original 112 and 222 in ni ii loaded zif 8 it was demonstrated that new lattice structure zn oni and c n oni was formed li et al 2014 3 4 continuous membrane filtration and regeneration the simulated wastewater ph 5 5 containing 2 mg l ni ii along with 15000 mg l na was used for testing the applicability of the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane the flow rate was set as 30 ml h for leaving enough retention time to active sites on membrane material as illustrated in fig 9 a ni ii concentration was below the detection limit at the beginning of the every cycle of continuous filtration and slightly increases as time goes the ni ii in simulated wastewater was adsorbed on paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane and the effective treatment volume were 1870 3 1307 4 957 6 and 452 7 l m2 for four cycles respectively equivalent to 5 76 l effective treatment volume within 12 56 cm2 of membrane area when breakthrough point was set as 0 1 mg l which is the standard for discharge of ni ii recommended by china electroplating industry china epa 2008 at the end of each continuous filtration experiment ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane was performed in site electro regeneration on anode direct voltage 2 2 v at room temperature by using hcl nacl solution ph 5 5 na 1000 mg l as a regeneration agent and the flow rate was still set as 30 ml h the regeneration solution were collected periodically for ni ii concentration measured in fig 9b the three regeneration cycles of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane showed that the adsorbed ni ii could be effectively eluted with a limited volume of acidic nacl solution through charge rejection the regeneration effectiveness were 95 2 84 7 and 71 6 for three cycles respectively incomplete desorption might lead to the reduction of adsorbent sites which was the main reason of regeneration effectiveness degradation the optimum regeneration condition of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane remained to be groped further and perfected in the process of research and experiment in days to come in addition considering the fact that several main factors flow rate filtration method and breakthrough time would influence filtration process of paa zif 8 pvdf uf membranes in practical heavy metal industrial wastewater treatment our further efforts will be focus on the systematic study of specific adsorption kinetics model in membrane technique field finally at the end of each regeneration cycle the effluent was also collected for zn concentration testing the zn concentration was below the detection limit of icp oes indicating no zn leaching occurred during regeneration process and conforming the zif 8 was stable by paa coating 4 conclusion in the current study we grafted zif 8 particles onto a pvdf membrane and modified the zif 8 hybrid membrane with in situ polymerization of acrylic acid a novel paa zif 8 pvdf uf membrane was prepared successfully for highly efficient removal of ni ii from wastewater in high salinity condition the maximum adsorption capacity was 219 09 mg ni ii g in high salinity na 15000 mg l wastewater at the optimal ph 5 5 langmuir equation fitted the isotherm data better than the freundlich equation the membrane treated the ni ii cotained wastewater under the continuous dead end filtration with better performance one sheet of membrane with an area of 12 56 cm2 was able to treat 5 76 l wastewater ni ii 2 mg l na 15000 mg l to meet the china epa regulation of 0 1 mg l ni ii the membrane also showed potential reusability for filtration the adsorption mechanism was described in fig 10 about the electrostatic adsorption by carboxyl groups in paa as well as specific hydrogen bonding interaction between ni ii and hydroxyl on zif 8 frameworks especially the latter one play a most important role on ni ii adsorption in high salinity system all the results indicated that paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane is a very attractive mofs

19416,enhanced removal of trace toxic metals ppm level from high salinity wastewater is crucial to ensure water safety but still a challenging task in this study we fabricated a new hybrid ultrafiltration membrane paa zif 8 pvdf by immobilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 particles onto the surface of trimesoyl chloride tmc modified polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane under protection of polyacrylic acid paa layer the resultant paa zif 8 pvdf membrane exhibited relatively high water flux of 460 l m 2 h 1 and outstanding nickel ion ni ii capacity 219 09 mg g from a synthetic high salinity na 15000 mg l wastewater x ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies revealed that preferable ni ii uptake was mainly attributed to the specific interaction between ni ii and hydroxyl groups on zif 8 frameworks and carboxyl groups in paa layer as well compared to paa zif 8 could selectively bind ni ii with negligible effect exerted by concentrated sodium ion the filtration study showed that the 12 56 cm2 membrane could effectively treat 5 76 l high salinity wastewater ni ii 0 2 mg l na 0 15000 mg l to conspicuously reduce ni ii below the maximum contaminant level of china 0 1 mg l moreover the hybrid membrane could be regenerated by hcl nacl solution ph 5 5 for repeated use under direct current electric field generally speaking the newly developed zif 8 hybrid ultrafiltration membrane showed a very promising potential in enhanced removal of toxic metals from high salinity wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords ni ii high salinity wastewater paa zif 8 pvdf membrane ultrafiltration electrostatic adsorption hydrogen bonding adsorption 1 introduction nickel ni has been extensively applied in electroplating electrolysis mining metallurgy and surface finishing industries because of its chemical inertness from water air and alkali corrosion raval et al 2016 a large amount of ni contained wastewater hence has been discharged which may pose a serious threat to human health and the ecosystem habiba et al 2017 bolisetty and mezzenga 2016 therefore ni is already labeled as one prior heavy metal pollutant to be monitored and controlled by the u s environmental protection agency u s epa 2014 generally ni in industrial wastewater exists mainly in the form of positive ions ni ii fu and wang 2011 several methods have been developed to remove ni ii from industrial wastewaters such as chemical precipitation biodegradation adsorption johnson and worrall 2007 liu et al 2012 lofrano et al 2016 however with the strictness of industrial wastewater discharged standard the emission concentration of ni ii was lower than 0 1 mg l china epa 2008 which seriously restricted the aforementioned applications membrane separation is an alternative technology to remove heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes can separate all low molecular weight contaminant species including metal ions park et al 2017 werber et al 2017 while both of them were limited by some shortages such as high intrinsic costs huge energy consumption and water losses ultrafiltration uf membrane has characteristics of simple operation low cost and easy maintenance but uf cannot separate metal ions from water because of its larger pore size zhao et al 2016 thus it is a reliable protocol to combine uf membrane with adsorbents to remove trace ni ii in industrial wastewater up to now a variety of adsorbents have been introduced to modify uf membrane for ni ii removal such as metal metal oxide nanoparticles polymer and biomass materials yin and deng 2015 barakat and schmidt 2010 habiba et al 2017 khajeh et al 2013 actually the ni ii contained industrial wastewater after being consecutively pre treated with ph adjustment coagulation sedimentation and so on usually contains 2 5 mg l ni ii along with high concentration 104 ppm of alkali metal cations e g na k pan et al 2010 high salinity easily gives rise to inactivation of common adsorbents which makes their less attractive in industrially relevant scales therefore it is crucial to found a adsorption material which compatible with uf membrane to eliminate trace ni ii in high salinity wastewater selectively metal organic frameworks mofs one kind of metallic coordination polymer constructed by metal atom with organic linkers have received tremendous attention because of their customizable chemical functionalities and versatile architectures recently substantial advancements have been made in mofs based wastewater treatment furukawa et al 2013 canivet et al 2014 particularly in the removal of trace heavy metal ions e g hg2 pb2 and cd2 from water luo et al 2015 ricco et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks 8 zif 8 a subclass of mofs is featured with high chemical and water stability large accessible surface area and abundant active surface sites brown et al 2012 some previous studies have proved that zif 8 particles not only possess the ability of trapping trace heavy metal ions but also are strong stable in the presence of various interfering anions cl no3 and so4 2 wu et al 2014 li et al 2014 however just like any other adsorbents zif 8 particles are often prepared in the form of dispersive powders which cause problems in adsorption regeneration processes and potential safety concerns ascribe to leak into water supplies pan et al 2017 moreover head loss and compaction of powders over treatment process that prevent the system to work at its full potential which also make difficult for the regeneration of materials casadellà et al 2016 for the needs of practical application the powder materials should to be supported or specifically shaped thus the hybrid uf membrane can be a good choice for achieving particles immobilized and wastewater treatment simultaneously which successfully combine the advantages of zif 8 particles and uf membrane together and overcome their respective drawbacks in water hu and his co worker has successfully demonstrated the excellent stability of zif 8 hybrid uf membrane through experimental and molecular dynamic simulation studies hu et al 2011 other research results also indicated that zif 8 is more likely to be compatible with polymer materials which can be easily tuned to meet the requirements for the membrane fabrication and water separation zhang et al 2014a b wang et al 2016 in this study a novel zif 8 hybrid uf membrane paa zif 8 pvdf membrane was developed by physically immobilizing zif 8 particles on the surface of pvdf membrane though a two step process zif 8 particles were adhered to the surface of pvdf membrane in the first step and then polyacrylic acid paa coating was used to protect the zif 8 particles remained on membrane surface the benefit of this design strategy is that the pvdf membrane can be endowed with ni ii adsorption capacity and its inherent properties are also well maintained morphologies wettability pure water flux and potential of zero charge were evaluated to obtain the basic characteristics of the membrane a series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted on ph adsorption isotherm and salinity effect to obtain the key parameters for the adsorption process the mechanism was investigated through the adsorption experiments and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyzer and x ray diffraction study finally the study of long time membrane filtration and regeneration were conducted to test its actual application it is the first time that zif 8 hybrid pvdf membranes has been successfully used for removing trace ni ii especially in high salinity industrial wastewater we anticipate that our work could stimulate more studies toward the rational design of a highly efficient and multifunctional mofs hybrid membrane additionally considering the costs of mofs hybrid membranes in application the further study on the optimal structure activity relationship between paa zif 8 pvdf membrane and target heavy metal pollutants is also extremely necessary 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were reagent

adsorption experiment the stock ni ii solution with a concentration of 2 g l was prepared by dissolving ni no3 2 into ultrapure water and the stock solutions were diluted by ultrapure water for the subsequent adsorption experiments the effects of different ph value on ni ii adsorption was investigated by adding dispersive zif 8 particles 0 05 g paa pvdf membrane 12 56 cm2 and paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane 12 56 cm2 into 50 ml ni ii solutions 50 mg l with varying initial ph values from 2 to 5 5 respectively 0 1 m naoh or hno3 was used to adjust the ph of solution adsorption isotherm was tested by batch experiments in which 0 05 g of zif 8 particles 12 56 cm2 paa pvdf membrane and 12 56 cm2 of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane were added to 50 ml ni ii solutions with different initial concentrations 2 220 mg l respectively the ph values of solutions were adjusted to 5 5 0 2 in order to find out salinity effect on ni ii adsorption four groups of adsorption isotherm experiments in various salt concentration na 0 5000 10000 and 15000 mg l were conducted in the aforementioned studies the adsorption capacity was calculated by measuring the difference between initial and final or

adsorbents dosage g all adsorption experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average data was used to evaluate performance 2 8 membrane filtration and regeneration the filtration study of the membrane was carried out in the same dead end filtration membrane module as that was used for testing the pwf of membranes a piece of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane with an effective area of 12 56 cm2 was immobilized in the membrane module the filtration experiment was conducted under the flow rate of 30 ml h at room temperature and the lange pump baoding china was used to ensure a stable flow rate simulated ni ii contained wastewater ph 5 5 that containing 2 mg l ni ii along with high concentration na 15000 mg l was prepared as the feed solution the effluents were collected periodically for ni

characterization 3 1 1 cross sectional microstructure fig 2 a illustrated the cross sectional image of pristine pvdf membrane where the typical asymmetric structure could be observed with a thin dense top layer supported by many fingers like sub layer pores subsequently the as prepared pvdf membrane was used as substrate to fabricate paa zif 8 pvdf membrane as demonstrated in fig 2b 2d the paa zif 8 active layer was tightly integrated with pvdf membrane via vacuum suction and paa in situ polymerization where the thicknesses of active layer was controlled by the loading amount of zif 8 the thickness of 6 1 7 7 and 14 6 μm correspond to the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 03 0 05 and 0 08 membrane respectively during fabrication the microstructure in pvdf membrane demonstrated no critical change by incorporation of zif 8 and introduction of paa coating fig 2e and the inset image exhibited a cross sectional sector magnified from paa zif 8 active layer which can be seen that zif 8 particles were well dispersed in paa active layer without aggregation in addition to medium function of tmc the paa coating significantly assists the homogeneous distribution and stabilization of zif 8 particles on membrane surface the eds mapping scanning spectra were used to determine the cross sectional chemical composition of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane referring to fig 2f carbon c oxygen o nitrogen n fluorine f and zinc zn elements are observed and zn and f elements were mainly distributed in the paa zif 8 active layer and support membrane respectively which was in according with the analyses in fesem images 3 1 2 surface roughness the surface roughness of various membranes was investigated by 3 d afm and the relevant images and data were presented in fig s5 the roughness average ra slightly increased from 32 1 nm for pristine pvdf membrane to 43 5 nm for paa pvdf membrane the increased ra could be attributed to the agglomeration of paa on the pvdf membrane further the surface roughness increased dramatically along with the addition of zif 8 particles the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 08 membrane acquired the highest ra value of 113 6 nm the presence of zif 8 particles in the paa zif 8 active layer was induced many bumpy and nodular points on surface of substrate which resulted in an obvious enhancement of roughness qin et al 2015 3 1 3 xps analysis the xps wide spectra of various membranes and zif 8 particles were performed to detect the surface chemical composition and the results were shown in fig 3 the atom ratio of o f increased from 0 09 for pristine pvdf membrane to 4 93 for paa pvdf membrane which means a large quantity of coo groups has been introduced onto the pvdf membrane surface through in situ acrylic acid polymerization reaction compared to the peaks of c 1s n 1s o 1s and f 1s detected in paa pvdf membrane a new peak of zn 2p centered at 1098 ev was appeared in paa zif 8 pvdf membrane which was in consistency with the zn 2p peak in zif 8 wang et al 2016 additionally the intensity of n 1s markedly increased which further verified the fact that zif 8 was successfully immobilized onto the surface of pvdf membrane through paa coating in the novel designed paa zif 8 pvdf membrane in our work 3 2 water flux and surface wettability the ca is usually employed to evaluate the surface wettability of the membranes in general the smaller ca indicated the better hydrophilicity of membrane when ca is less than 90 as shown in fig 4 compared to 83 2 of the pristine pvdf membrane the ca of paa pvdf membrane dramatically decreased to 42 2 since amounts of coo groups are presented on the membrane surface zhang et al 2014a b however the ca of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane increased from 43 7 to 51 4 with addition of hydrophobic zif 8 particles that is the zif 8 particles embedded on the membrane surface would leads to improvement of the surface hydrophobicity liu et al 2013 for separation membrane pwf is the key parameter in appraising the properties of practical application qin et al 2016 thus the pwf of as fabricated membranes were tested and compared and the results were also shown in fig 4 the pwf of pristine pvdf membrane was 410 l m 2h 1 and that of paa pvdf membrane reached up to 485 l m 2h 1 compared to paa pvdf membrane the pwf of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane decreased gradually from 478 to 392 l m 2h 1 as the zif 8 amount increased the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 08 membrane corresponding to its high density of paa zif 8 functional layer possessed the lowest pwf in achieving a balance between ca and pwf paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane was selected as optimum candidate for subsequent ni ii adsorption testing 3 3 ni ii adsorption testing 3 3 1 effect of ph value in fig 5 a the pzc of zif 8 particles paa pvdf membrane and paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane were carefully measured to be 3 2 4 4 and 4 0 respectively which means that the optimum ph value for ni ii adsorption on paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane was higher than 4 0 the paa zif 8 active layer consists of two parts paa layer and loaded zif 8 in order to evaluate the effect of the ph on the ni ii adsorption onto both parts the batch experiments at various ph value 2 5 5 were conducted at 50 mg l initial concentration of ni ii solution as depicted in fig 5b in the range of ph 2 4 4 the zif 8 played a more important role in ni ii adsorption since ph value higher than 4 4 electrostatic interactions with coo groups occurred the ni ii adsorption capacity on pvdf zif 8 paa 0 05 increased dramatically along with the increase of ph this result was consistent with previous study in pzc when the ph value increased to 5 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity was up to 49 2 mg g representing 99 ni ii removal although it is expected that it continues to rise for higher ph since the proportion of carboxylate form increases which is beneficial for adsorbing ni ii when the ph is higher than 5 5 the ni ii may be precipitated with additional hydroxide ions zhao et al 2016 moreover from an application perspective the ph value of ni ii contained wastewater is usually below 6 pan et al 2009 hence ph 5 5 was selected as optimum ph value in further experiments 3 3 2 effect of various salinities alkali metal cations are commonly found together with heavy metal ions in industrial wastewater pan et al 2009 and na was selected as a representative ionic factors in this study due to its ubiquity and abundance thus it is necessary to determine the effect of such innocuous cation on paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane for ni ii adsorption two kinds of isotherm models langmuir 6 and freundlich 7 were used to analyze the adsorption isotherm data both of models have been successfully applied to many heavy metal ions adsorption processes from aqueous phase li et al 2015 6 q e q m k

langmuir constant l mg kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 and n stand for freundlich constants that related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively the adsorption isotherms of disperse zif 8 particles paa pvdf membrane and paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane under different salinity na 0 5000 10000 15000 mg l were fitted well with langmuir model and the correlation coefficients r2 were above 0 98 table 1 higher than those of freundlich model as shown in fig 6 in non salted and low salinity condition ni ii adsorption is governed by a combination of electrostatic interactions on coo groups of paa and specific hydrogen bonding interaction on hydroxyl of zif 8 as the salinity of ni ii contained wastewater increased the electrostatic interactions on coo groups were gradually weakened and eventually eliminated in high na levels 0 43 0 65 mol l because the high ionic strength screened the electrostatic interactions the adsorption capacity of paa pvdf membrane toward ni ii was apparently decreased from 85 53 to 16 54 mg g as na concentration increased from 0 to 15000 mg l while the maximum amounts of ni ii adsorption on zif 8 was maintained around 210 mg g no matter how na concentration increased means that specific adsorption of ni ii onto zif 8 was independent from variation of salinity obviously because of zif 8 the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane has exhibited prominent capability of ni ii adsorption even in high salinity condition the simulated maximum adsorption capacity of both three materials were also shown in fig s6 to further distinguish different sorption between the coo groups and zif 8 particles xps study was performed by choosing ni element as a representative criterion as shown in fig 7 the peaks of ni no3 2 consist of ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 ni 2p3 2 comprised two deconvoluted peaks at 856 75 and 862 38 ev respectively and ni 2p1 2 comprised two deconvoluted peaks at 874 27 and 880 32 ev respectively xu and liu 2008 remarkably a new peak at 857 7 ev was generated in fig 7a which was ascribe to specific hydrogen bonding interaction between zif 8 and ni ii o ni meanwhile the generation of another new peak in fig 7b at 853 6 ev was resulted from the electrostatic adsorption interaction by coo groups sheng et al 2011 coincidently both of peaks were also appeared in ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane fig 7c the area and intensity of peak coo ni was decreased significantly with the na concentration increased from 0 to 15000 mg l contrarily no noticeable variation was observed in peak o ni indicated that ni ii trapping by zif 8 was less vulnerable to high salinity than coo groups 3 3 3 ni ii adsorption mechanisms adsorption site of ni ii by paa zif 8 pvdf membrane was further probed with xps ftir and xrd as shown in fig 8 a the binding energy of o1s was analyzed as a discrete entity which has shifted from 531 1 to 531 9 ev after ni ii adsorption fig 8b was illustrated the deconvoluted spectra of the o1s region in virgin ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane a peak at 531 12 ev represented coo group of paa two peaks at 530 01 and 531 79 ev were belong to zif 8 which corresponded to zn o and n o respectively li et al 2014 after ni ii adsorption a remarkable shift to higher binding energy was observed for coo group which based on the following suggested mechanism however coo groups were vulnerable to great levels of na pan et al 2010 2r cooh aq ni2 aq 2r cooni aq 2h aq in addition a new peak in ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane occurred with a binding energy of 534 07 ev represented water oh indicated the involvement of hydration reaction on zif 8 frameworks tian et al 2014 pan et al 2011 li et al 2014 a large amount of hydration hydroxyl active sites zn oh and c n oh were produced through the dissociative adsorption of water both of these two distinct sites on zif 8 were bind with ni ii and subsequently formed monodentate and bidentate complexes zn oni and c n oni via specific hydrogen bonding interaction both of peaks 530 01 and 531 79 ev were shifted towards higher binding energy the process was demonstrated by the following reactions equation and zif 8 was free from interference of high salinity environment image 2 moreover fig s7 was illustrated the ftir spectra of pristine and ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf membrane the spectra of paa zif 8 pvdf membrane have changed considerably after adsorption a broad new peak was generated at 3387 cm 1 that represented the stretching vibration of carboxylate cooni chizallet et al 2010 peaks at 623 cm 1 and 920 cm 1 which represented vibration of v zn o in zif 8 and v o h in coo groups respectively li et al 2014 han et al 2014 were weaken after adsorption a strong and intense peak around 850 910 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of o ni indicated the successful adsorption of ni ii onto paa zif 8 pvdf membrane four peaks 1428 1587 and 1650 1725 cm 1 were represented v c o of carboxyl group and v c n of imidazole ring which were difficult to distinguish and separate completely han et al 2014 tian et al 2014 after adsorption these peaks were replaced by two broad peak at 1600 and 1640 cm 1 which exactly coincided with the character peaks of carboxylate co oni and metal hydroxyl complexes oni respectively to verify the adsorption mechanism from the structure of zif 8 and explore the stability of zif 8 xrd spectrogram of zif 8 was obtained after 72 h of continuous immersion experiment under high salinity system as shown in fig s8 zif 8 has exhibited excellent structure stability in high salinity water only one weak new peak was generated near peak 002 which ascribed to the formation of hydration hydroxyl bond such as zn oh and c n oh on zif 8 frameworks cychosz and matzger 2010 after adsorption reaction two new peaks that split from original 112 and 222 in ni ii loaded zif 8 it was demonstrated that new lattice structure zn oni and c n oni was formed li et al 2014 3 4 continuous membrane filtration and regeneration the simulated wastewater ph 5 5 containing 2 mg l ni ii along with 15000 mg l na was used for testing the applicability of the paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane the flow rate was set as 30 ml h for leaving enough retention time to active sites on membrane material as illustrated in fig 9 a ni ii concentration was below the detection limit at the beginning of the every cycle of continuous filtration and slightly increases as time goes the ni ii in simulated wastewater was adsorbed on paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane and the effective treatment volume were 1870 3 1307 4 957 6 and 452 7 l m2 for four cycles respectively equivalent to 5 76 l effective treatment volume within 12 56 cm2 of membrane area when breakthrough point was set as 0 1 mg l which is the standard for discharge of ni ii recommended by china electroplating industry china epa 2008 at the end of each continuous filtration experiment ni ii loaded paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane was performed in site electro regeneration on anode direct voltage 2 2 v at room temperature by using hcl nacl solution ph 5 5 na 1000 mg l as a regeneration agent and the flow rate was still set as 30 ml h the regeneration solution were collected periodically for ni ii concentration measured in fig 9b the three regeneration cycles of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane showed that the adsorbed ni ii could be effectively eluted with a limited volume of acidic nacl solution through charge rejection the regeneration effectiveness were 95 2 84 7 and 71 6 for three cycles respectively incomplete desorption might lead to the reduction of adsorbent sites which was the main reason of regeneration effectiveness degradation the optimum regeneration condition of paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane remained to be groped further and perfected in the process of research and experiment in days to come in addition considering the fact that several main factors flow rate filtration method and breakthrough time would influence filtration process of paa zif 8 pvdf uf membranes in practical heavy metal industrial wastewater treatment our further efforts will be focus on the systematic study of specific adsorption kinetics model in membrane technique field finally at the end of each regeneration cycle the effluent was also collected for zn concentration testing the zn concentration was below the detection limit of icp oes indicating no zn leaching occurred during regeneration process and conforming the zif 8 was stable by paa coating 4 conclusion in the current study we grafted zif 8 particles onto a pvdf membrane and modified the zif 8 hybrid membrane with in situ polymerization of acrylic acid a novel paa zif 8 pvdf uf membrane was prepared successfully for highly efficient removal of ni ii from wastewater in high salinity condition the maximum adsorption capacity was 219 09 mg ni ii g in high salinity na 15000 mg l wastewater at the optimal ph 5 5 langmuir equation fitted the isotherm data better than the freundlich equation the membrane treated the ni ii cotained wastewater under the continuous dead end filtration with better performance one sheet of membrane with an area of 12 56 cm2 was able to treat 5 76 l wastewater ni ii 2 mg l na 15000 mg l to meet the china epa regulation of 0 1 mg l ni ii the membrane also showed potential reusability for filtration the adsorption mechanism was described in fig 10 about the electrostatic adsorption by carboxyl groups in paa as well as specific hydrogen bonding interaction between ni ii and hydroxyl on zif 8 frameworks especially the latter one play a most important role on ni ii adsorption in high salinity system all the results indicated that paa zif 8 pvdf 0 05 membrane is a very attractive mofs hybrid membrane for efficient ni ii removal in high salinity wastewater this finding provides a promising alternative approach for designing a novel effective uf membrane to remove heavy metal ions

19417,quinone group is an important fraction of humic acid the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of levofloxacin lf degradation by permanganate mno4 significantly increased from 0 010 without benzoquinone bq to 0 042 0 443 min 1 at bq o mno4 o molar ratio 0 03 0 25 at ph 7 5 and an acidic ph facilitated lf degradation in the presence of bq mno4 was first reduced to mn ii then mn ii reacted with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical which was promoted under acidic conditions with dissolved oxygen available mn iii further oxidized semiquinone radical to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 as well as regenerate bq in addition mno4 could also react with mn ii to produce mn iii whose complexation with semiquinone radical in turn promoted this reaction due to the predominant scavenging of o2 by bq 1o2 and mn iii mainly contributed to the accelerated lf degradation with a notable formation of hydroxyl ketone and endoperoxide groups in the degradation byproducts this study helps better understand the role of natural organic matter in the degradation of organic micropollutants by mno4 in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords quinone group permanganate levofloxacin mn iii singlet oxygen water treatment 1 introduction permanganate mno4 is regarded as a green oxidant for its relatively low cost easy availability non formation of halogenated byproducts and compatibility over a wide ph range sun et al 2016 as a typical natural organic matter nom in drinking water sources humic acid ha was found to enhance the degradation of levofloxacin lf by mno4 through inducing the production of mn iii superoxide radical o2 and hydroxyl radical oh xu et al 2017 previous studies on the mechanism for ha accelerating mno4 oxidation mostly focused on the formation of reactive manganese species including mn iii and mno2 s jiang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 increasing the aromatic and double bond content or conjugation degree rather than the carboxyl and aliphatic groups or polysaccharide like substance in ha could promote the degradation of organic micropollutants omps by mno4 he et al 2010 however it still remains obscure on which fraction of ha mainly produces secondary oxidants with mno4 quinone groups fig s1 are abundant in humic substance and other dissolved organic matter from diverse aquatic environments which possess an electron transfer capacity cory and mcknight 2005 hernández montoya et al 2012 the content of quinone groups is generally 1 4 mmol g 1 c o in ha zhou et al 2015 as a typical quinone benzoquinone bq could enhance the degradation of sulfamethoxazole by peroxymonosulfate pms through the formation of singlet oxygen 1o2 from the decomposition of a dioxirane intermediate and ha showed the same effect zhou et al 2015 in the proposed mechanism for ha enhanced omp degradation by fe iii and h2o2 georgi et al 2007 fe iii first reacted with h2o2 to produce ho2 and fe ii eq 1 which was a rate limiting step further fe ii reacted with h2o2 to generate oh for omp degradation eq 2 and meanwhile ho2 rapidly reduced the quinone group in ha to semiquinone radical fig s2 which then reduced fe iii to fe ii at a much faster rate to enhance oh formation 1 fe iii h 2 o 2 fe ii ho 2 h 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii o h oh the degradation of phenol in a photo fenton process h2o2 fe iii 300 480 nm irradiation wavelengths manifested autocatalysis because quinone as a reaction intermediate could produce semiquinone radical and oh through photolysis hence two equivalents of oh were ultimately generated because the resulting semiquinone radical could convert fe iii to fe ii and generate the other oh via eq 2 and quinone was regenerated in the meanwhile chen and pignatello 1997 bq could also promote the formation of sulfate radical so4 through reducing persulfate s2o8 2 with semiquinone radical thus enhancing the degradation of 2 4 4 trichlorobiphenyl by s2o8 2 fang et al 2013 in addition phenol groups are also abundant in humic substance fig s1 the degradation of phenol by fe iii and h2o2 displayed initially a lag phase due to the rate limiting reduction of fe iii by h2o2 and then 1 4 and 1 2 hydroquinones produced from phenol degradation reduced fe iii to fe ii much faster through two one electron transfer steps with semiquinone radical as an intermediate and quinone as a byproduct which increased the concentration of fe ii and thus accelerated phenol degradation chen and pignatello 1997 this study by using bq as a model compound was to investigate the impact of quinone group on lf degradation by mno4 specifically the kinetics of lf degradation by mno4 was comparatively determined in the absence or presence of bq and the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on secondary oxidant scavenging tests electron paramagnetic resonance epr and uv vis analyses and degradation byproducts identification this study helps better understand the role of nom in the degradation of omps by mno4 in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ultrapure water produced from a milli q system advantage a10 millipore usa was used in all experiments and

solution absorbance was measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa 2 3 experimental procedures the kinetics of lf 0 4 μm degradation by mno4 40 μm was comparatively investigated in the absence or presence of bq under pseudo first order conditions mno4 o lf o 100 1 experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate in 50 ml conical flasks with magnetic stirring at ambient temperature 23 2 c sodium pyrophosphate pp na4p2o7 was used to stabilize mn iii sodium azide nan3 or furfuryl alcohol ffa was used to scavenge 1o2 and tert butanol tba was used to scavenge oh a certain amount of mno4 stock solution was added to an aqueous mixture of lf and other reactants whose ph was buffered with 1 mm phosphate and adjusted with naoh or h2so4 solution to initiate the reactions it was found that the ph changed insignificantly over the reaction course and the phosphate buffer had little impact on lf degradation by mno4 samples were withdrawn at preselected times and immediately quenched with an excessive nh2oh to accurately identify the degradation byproducts of lf proportionally raised concentrations of mno4 2800 μm lf 28 μm and bq were purposely adopted and samples were quenched with an excessive na2s2o3 followed by 0 2 μm membrane filtration due to the limited ability of nh2oh for quenching a considerable amount of mno2 s produced from the reduction of mno4 2800 μm the change of nh2oh to na2s2o3 had little influence on the kinetic results for instance the second order rate constant for the reaction of mno4 with lf at ph 7 5 was determined to be 4 2 or 3 9 m 1 s 1 when using nh2oh or na2s2o3 as a quencher respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 lf degradation by mno4 in the presence of bq at ph 7 5 the presence of bq significantly increased the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of lf degradation by mno4 from 0 010 without bq to 0 042 0 443 min 1 at bq o mno4 o 0 03 0 25 fig 1 a indicating the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq the k obs and the bq o mno4 o ratio were linearly correlated fig s3 implying that more secondary oxidants were produced as the latter increased however at bq o mno4 o 0 4 the k obs decreased to 0 337 min 1 fig 1a and the lf degradation was negligibly affected at bq o mno4 o 0 6 implying that bq itself consumed a majority of secondary oxidants mn iii was decisive for the ha accelerated lf degradation by mno4 xu et al 2017 and mn iii was also produced in the reaction of mno4 with bisulfite hso3 to rapidly degrade omps sun et al 2015 pp is a specific ligand for mn iii at bq o mno4 o 0 25 the addition of pp 1 mm almost completely inhibited the acceleration on lf degradation fig 1b indicating that mn iii was also the initially decisive intermediate for the bq accelerated lf degradation by mno4 ffa and nan3 are often used to probe the formation of 1o2 whose reaction rate constants with 1o2 were reported to be 1 2 108 and 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively halladja et al 2007 zhou et al 2015 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 and within the reaction time of 0 15 min the presence of 20 and 200 μm ffa decreased the k obs from 0 443 to 0 287 and 0 170 min 1 fig 1b respectively and the lf degradation became much slower after 15 min nan3 1 mm also significantly decreased the k obs to 0 143 min 1 fig 1b indicating that 1o2 significantly contributed to the accelerated lf degradation as a fluoroquinolone lf could be readily degraded by 1o2 liu et al 2018 dissolved oxygen do was often indispensable to generate 1o2 zhang et al 2009 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 the stripping of do from reacting solution also inhibited lf degradation fig s4 suggesting the involvement of do in the production of 1o2 it is noteworthy that bq is a specific scavenger for o2 with a reaction rate constant of 1 109 m 1 s 1 cavalcante et al 2016 as the bq o mno4 o ratio increased from 0 25 to 0 60 the lf degradation was significantly inhibited fig 1a suggesting the contribution of o2 to the accelerated lf degradation in general o2 undergoes rapid disproportionation in water to produce oh rather than directly reacts with omps furman et al 2009 khanchandani et al 2014 the second order reaction rate constant of oh with lf could reach above 109 m 1 s 1 el najjar et al 2013 ling et al 2018 tba is a specific scavenger for oh at bq o mno4 o 0 25 the addition of tba 2 7 mm only decreased the k obs to 0 345 min 1 fig 1b indicating an unimportant contribution of oh to the accelerated lf degradation which may be attributed to the predominant scavenging of o2 by bq oh also contributed insignificantly to the bq accelerated sulfamethoxazole degradation by pms zhou et al 2015 in brief these results indicate that mn iii should have induced the formation of 1o2 and oh in the reaction of mno4 with bq 3 2 secondary oxidants generated in the reaction of mno4 with bq when quinone was reduced to semiquinone radical fig s2 the latter could further transfer an electron to do to produce o2 and regenerate bq thor et al 1982 the redox cycle of quinones and corresponding semiquinone radicals occurs spontaneously in surface water soil airborne particulate matter and other environmental compartments fang et al 2013 o2 was an autoxidation product of semiquinone radical guillén et al 2000 as a strongly oxidative intermediate mn iii may accelerate this autoxidation process to produce o2 bmpo traps o2 and oh to form bmpo ooh and bmpo oh respectively methanol ch3oh can prevent the disproportionation of o2 epr spectra show that as the bq o mno4 o ratio increased from 0 to 0 5 the peak intensity of bmpo ooh kept increasing until exceeding that of bmpo oh fig 2 indicating an increasing production of o2 in the reaction of mno4 with bq by contrast as the bq o mno4 o ratio further increased from 0 5 to 4 the peak intensities of both bmpo ooh and bmpo oh kept decreasing while that of semiquinone radical remarkably increased without mno4 no semiquinone radical was detected in the presence of bmpo and ch3oh fig s5 in the absence of bmpo and ch3oh the reaction of mno4 with bq in water also produced a higher amount of semiquinone radical than the aqueous bq solution fig s6a as the reaction proceeded from 5 to 9 min the amount of semiquinone radical produced by mno4 and bq kept increasing fig s6b it is seen that as a carbon centered radical semiquinone radical could be directly detected without a spin trapping agent and its production was enhanced in the reaction of mno4 with bq fig 2 shows that semiquinone radical could accumulate to a high concentration under an excessive bq while it decayed to o2 at a relatively lower bq concentration i e bq o mno4 o 0 50 temp is a specific probe for 1o2 yang et al 1999 because it traps 1o2 to produce 1 oxyl temp tempo fig s1 after mixing bq with temp for 3 min semiquinone radical was identified and the intensity of tempo simultaneously increased fig s7 indicating the production of 1o2 from the decay of semiquinone radical in the reaction of mno4 with bq the intermediate mn iii may promote the decay of semiquinone radical to produce 1o2 at bq o mno4 o 0 5 the peak intensity of tempo increased as compared to that in the absence of bq fig s8 indicating the production of 1o2 in the reaction of mno4 with bq as the bq o mno4 o ratio increased to 1 4 the peak intensity of tempo decreased while that of semiquinone radical kept increasing this result indicates that semiquinone radical could also decay to produce 1o2 when formed at a relatively low concentration 3 3 reaction of mn ii with bq quinone was involved in the bacterial oxidation of mn ii with mn iii as an intermediate johnson and tebo 2008 our results also indicate that bq was reduced by a manganese species to form semiquinone radical in its reaction with mno4 and the reaction solution turned colorless finally among all the species originating from mn vii only mn ii is nearly colorless in water moreover as the reaction of mno4 with bq proceeded the uv vis absorbance of mn ii complex was increasing while that of mn iii complex first increased and then decreased fig s9 indicating the production of mn ii mn ii covered a much broader magnetic field with six successive peaks on its epr spectrum fig s10a otherwise only a diagonal line was observed in the magnetic field range in fig 2 even at bq o mno4 o 4 mn ii was not detected on the epr spectrum at a reaction time of 3 min fig 2 it suggests that once mn ii was formed it could further react with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical which eventually produced mn iii semiquinone radical complex and other secondary oxidants when coexisting with bq for 3 min the peak intensity of mn ii significantly decreased fig s10b indicating the reaction of mn ii with bq in the presence of temp the reaction of mn ii with bq could proceed for at least 2 h fig 3 a the peak intensity of tempo notably increased while that of mn ii gradually decreased this result indicates that bq reacted with mn ii to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical and mn iii further oxidized semiquinone radical to produce 1o2 scheme 1 a in the presence of bmpo bmpo oh was detected and its peak intensity increased up to a reaction time of 3 h fig 3b which indicates again the reaction of mn ii with bq in the presence of both bmpo and ch3oh the bmpo adduct of o2 bmpo ooh rather than oh bmpo oh was detected fig 3c these results indicate that o2 and oh were also produced in the reaction of mn ii with bq scheme 1a it was noteworthy that the peak intensity of mn ii hardly decreased when that of bmpo ooh or bmpo oh increased fig 3b and c once produced o2 would transfer an electron to mn iii to produce mn ii at ph 6 5 the k obs of lf degradation by mno4 increased significantly from 0 014 without bq to 0 979 min 1 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 table 1 while at ph 8 5 the k obs increased only from 0 008 to 0 025 min 1 it is seen that an acidic ph favored the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq hydrogen ion h could promote the formation of mn iii and semiquinone radical in the reaction of mn ii with bq scheme 1a and h was also found to promote the ha accelerated degradation of lf by mno4 xu et al 2017 even without mno4 the coexistence of mn ii and bq could significantly degrade lf fig 4 a the addition of pp remarkably inhibited lf degradation indicating the formation of mn iii in the reaction of mn ii with bq scheme 1a and the degradation of lf by mn iii in comparison nan3 exerted a weaker inhibition than pp but a stronger inhibition than tba on lf degradation indicating that the reaction of mn iii with semiquinone radical produced 1o2 and oh which also contributed to lf degradation as mentioned above the relatively lower contribution of oh to lf degradation could be ascribed to the scavenging of o2 by bq moreover the addition of mn ii greatly enhanced the degradation of lf by mno4 in the presence of bq fig 4b confirming that mn ii was involved in the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq 3 4 reaction of mn vii with mn ii besides directly reacting with mn iii semiquinone radical could also form a complex with mn iii through its oh group fig s2 mno4 has an absorbance peak at 525 nm a525 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 when stabilized by pp mn iii has an absorbance peak at 258 nm a258 sun et al 2015 in the mno4 bq pp reaction system the a258 kept increasing while the a525 kept decreasing as the reaction proceeded fig 5 a indicating the continuous conversion of mn vii to mn iii in the reaction of mno4 with bq in the mno4 mn ii bq pp reaction system the increase in a258 and the decrease in a525 were both accelerated fig 5b indicating that the addition of mn ii promoted the formation of mn iii in the reaction of mno4 with bq in the mn ii bq pp reaction system the a258 was obscured by an adjacent much larger peak of bq but another characteristic peak a212 clearly indicated the continuous formation of mn iii pp fig 5c however it is noted that a less amount of mn iii pp was formed even at higher initial concentrations of mn ii and bq fig 5c these results indicate that not only mno4 but also mn ii could react with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical and the products could further form a complex to summarize mno4 first reacted with bq to produce mn ii and then mn ii reacted with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical whose further reaction in the presence of do yielded 1o2 and o2 and regenerated mn ii and bq scheme 1a in addition mno4 reacted with mn ii to produce mn iii which then formed a complex with semiquinone radical scheme 1b hence semiquinone radical actually promoted the formation of mn iii 1o2 and mn iii significantly degraded lf the aqueous bq solution contained a certain amount of semiquinone radical fig s6 indicating the internal electron transfer among bq molecules in the reaction of mno4 with bq the electron from mn ii which reduced bq to semiquinone radical also originated from another bq molecule scheme 1a and mno4 accelerated the production of semiquinone radical from bq 3 5 lf degradation by mno4 in the presence of phenol the oxidation of phenol by mno4 produced quinone guan et al 2010 considering that the ha structure also contains abundant phenol groups fig s1 the effect of phenol on lf degradation by mno4 was also examined at phenol o mno4 o 0 13 and 0 25 the degradation of lf was notably accelerated in the presence of phenol fig 6 a the acceleration by phenol was initially much weaker than that by bq but became comparable as the reaction proceeded at phenol o mno4 o 0 25 the addition of pp completely inhibited the acceleration by phenol fig 6b indicating a decisive role of mn iii tba inhibited the acceleration by phenol more significantly than ffa in the initial phase indicating an important role of oh while the inhibition of ffa surpassed that of tba after a reaction time of about 23 min indicating an important role of 1o2 in the later phase in other words oh was predominantly generated in the reaction of mno4 with phenol and once phenol was oxidized to quinone 1o2 was predominantly generated this result well explains why oh mainly contributed to the ha accelerated degradation of lf by mno4 in our previous study xu et al 2017 whereas 1o2 mainly contributed to the bq accelerated degradation of lf in this study it is noted that other reducing groups in ha may also induce the generation of secondary oxidants for example the dimethylamine group in ha could generate oh during ozonation buffle and von gunten 2006 in addition ha has a very complex chemical structure which also varies significantly with different origins therefore the contributions of different secondary oxidants e g oh o2 1o2 to the accelerated degradation of omps in chemical oxidation processes actually rely on the relative contents of phenol quinone and other reducing groups in ha 3 6 degradation pathways of lf by mno4 in the presence of bq based on the ms ms2 spectra fig s11 abundance evolution fig s12 and mass measurements table s1 of byproducts the degradation pathways of lf by mno4 in the presence of bq are proposed in fig 7 lf was degraded mainly through carboxylation e g lf391 and lf313 hydroxylation e g lf228 and lf343 dehydrogenation e g lf359 and lf375 and dealkylation e g lf347 and lf395 reactions loss of one ch3 group from the n4 atom to produce lf347 was a typical n dealkylation reaction it was reported that mn iii could facilitate the n dealkylation of atrazine hu et al 2017 the hydroxyl and ketone groups in lf313 could originate from the degradation of an endoperoxide intermediate it was reported that 1o2 first attacked the ch group in guanine to produce a roo or roo group and then one of the oxygen atoms was connected with an adjacent carbon atom to form an endoperoxide group whose further degradation yielded hydroxyl and ketone groups dumont et al 2016 in addition 1o2 could also attack an olefin group through cycloaddition reaction min and boff 2002 which explains the endoperoxide structure in lf228 the two hydroxyl groups on either side of the c c bond in lf343 could originate from 1 2 cycloaddition upon 1o2 attack and the subsequent cleavage of the o o bond the olefin structure in lf359 c4 c5 could facilitate the attack of 1o2 to produce lf335 lf413 2 and lf375 lf278 was produced by cleaving the n1 c4 and n1 c8 bonds of lf the dealkylation defluorination and hydroxylation of lf363 could produce lf413 1 and lf379 hu et al 2017 reported that mn iii could not only cleave the n c bond of atrazine to eliminate an alkylamine group but also promote the dechlorination and subsequent hydroxylation of 4 chlorophenol the ketone groups in lf278 lf306 and lf413 2 could probably be reduced by semiquinone radical to corresponding hydroxyl groups in lf254 lf269 and lf385 the notable formation of oxygen rich e g hydroxyl ketone and endoperoxide groups in the degradation byproducts also confirmed the essential roles of 1o2 and mn iii in accelerating lf degradation by mno4 as a result a stronger destruction of lf was achieved in the presence of bq 4 conclusions this study investigated the impact of bq on lf degradation by mno4 from both kinetic and mechanistic aspects based on the experimental results obtained the following conclusions can be drawn bq significantly enhanced the degradation of lf by mno4 at ph 7 5 the k obs of lf degradation increased from 0 010 without bq to 0 443 min 1 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 an acidic ph favored the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq thus facilitating lf degradation mno4 was reduced by bq to mn ii which then reacted with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical in the presence of do mn iii further reacted with semiquinone radical to yield 1o2 and o2 in addition mno4 could also react with mn ii to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical promoted this reaction through forming a complex with mn iii among the secondary oxidants produced in the reaction of mno4 with bq 1o2 and mn iii mainly accounted for the accelerated degradation of lf because o2 was predominantly scavenged by bq the presence of bq induced a stronger destruction of lf as evidenced by the notable formation of hydroxyl ketone and endoperoxide groups in the degradation byproducts

19417,quinone group is an important fraction of humic acid the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of levofloxacin lf degradation by permanganate mno4 significantly increased from 0 010 without benzoquinone bq to 0 042 0 443 min 1 at bq o mno4 o molar ratio 0 03 0 25 at ph 7 5 and an acidic ph facilitated lf degradation in the presence of bq mno4 was first reduced to mn ii then mn ii reacted with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical which was promoted under acidic conditions with dissolved oxygen available mn iii further oxidized semiquinone radical to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 as well as regenerate bq in addition mno4 could also react with mn ii to produce mn iii whose complexation with semiquinone radical in turn promoted this reaction due to the predominant scavenging of o2 by bq 1o2 and mn iii mainly contributed to the accelerated lf degradation with a notable formation of hydroxyl ketone and endoperoxide groups in the degradation byproducts this study helps better understand the role of natural organic matter in the degradation of organic micropollutants by mno4 in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords quinone group permanganate levofloxacin mn iii singlet oxygen water treatment 1 introduction permanganate mno4 is regarded as a green oxidant for its relatively low cost easy availability non formation of halogenated byproducts and compatibility over a wide ph range sun et al 2016 as a typical natural organic matter nom in drinking water sources humic acid ha was found to enhance the degradation of levofloxacin lf by mno4 through inducing the production of mn iii superoxide radical o2 and hydroxyl radical oh xu et al 2017 previous studies on the mechanism for ha accelerating mno4 oxidation mostly focused on the formation of reactive manganese species including mn iii and mno2 s jiang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 increasing the aromatic and double bond content or conjugation degree rather than the carboxyl and aliphatic groups or polysaccharide like substance in ha could promote the degradation of organic micropollutants omps by mno4 he et al 2010 however it still remains obscure on which fraction of ha mainly produces secondary oxidants with mno4 quinone groups fig s1 are abundant in humic substance and other dissolved organic matter from diverse aquatic environments which possess an electron transfer capacity cory and mcknight 2005 hernández montoya et al 2012 the content of quinone groups is generally 1 4 mmol g 1 c o in ha zhou et al 2015 as a typical quinone benzoquinone bq could enhance the degradation of sulfamethoxazole by peroxymonosulfate pms through the formation of singlet oxygen 1o2 from the decomposition of a dioxirane intermediate and ha showed the same effect zhou et al 2015 in the proposed mechanism for ha enhanced omp degradation by fe iii and h2o2 georgi et al 2007 fe iii first reacted with h2o2 to produce ho2 and fe ii eq 1 which was a rate limiting step further fe ii reacted with h2o2 to generate oh for omp degradation eq 2 and meanwhile ho2 rapidly reduced the quinone group in ha to semiquinone radical fig s2 which then reduced fe iii to fe ii at a much faster rate to enhance oh formation 1 fe iii h 2 o 2 fe ii ho 2 h 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii o h oh the degradation of phenol in a photo fenton process h2o2 fe iii 300 480 nm irradiation wavelengths manifested autocatalysis because quinone as a reaction intermediate could produce semiquinone radical and oh through photolysis hence two equivalents of oh were ultimately generated because the resulting semiquinone radical could convert fe iii to fe ii and generate the other oh via eq 2 and quinone was regenerated in the meanwhile chen and pignatello 1997 bq could also promote the formation of sulfate radical so4 through reducing persulfate s2o8 2 with semiquinone radical thus enhancing the degradation of 2 4 4 trichlorobiphenyl by s2o8 2 fang et al 2013 in addition phenol groups are also abundant in humic substance fig s1 the degradation of phenol by fe iii and h2o2 displayed initially a lag phase due to the rate limiting reduction of fe iii by h2o2 and then 1 4 and 1 2 hydroquinones produced from phenol degradation reduced fe iii to fe ii much faster through two one electron transfer steps with semiquinone radical as an intermediate and quinone as a byproduct which increased the concentration of fe ii and thus accelerated phenol degradation chen and pignatello 1997 this study by using bq as a model compound was to investigate the impact of quinone group on lf degradation by mno4 specifically the kinetics of lf degradation by mno4 was comparatively determined in the absence or presence of bq and the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on secondary oxidant scavenging tests electron paramagnetic resonance epr and uv vis analyses and degradation byproducts identification this study helps better understand the role of nom in the

solution absorbance was measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa 2 3 experimental procedures the kinetics of lf 0 4 μm degradation by mno4 40 μm was comparatively investigated in the absence or presence of bq under pseudo first order conditions mno4 o lf o 100 1 experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate in 50 ml conical flasks with magnetic stirring at ambient temperature 23 2 c sodium pyrophosphate pp na4p2o7 was used to stabilize mn iii sodium azide nan3 or furfuryl alcohol ffa was used to scavenge 1o2 and tert butanol tba was used to scavenge oh a certain amount of mno4 stock solution was added to an aqueous mixture of lf and other reactants whose ph was buffered with 1 mm phosphate and adjusted with naoh or h2so4 solution to initiate the reactions it was found that the ph changed insignificantly over the reaction course and the phosphate buffer had little impact on lf degradation by mno4 samples were withdrawn at preselected times and immediately quenched with an excessive nh2oh to accurately identify the degradation byproducts of lf proportionally raised concentrations of mno4 2800 μm lf 28 μm and bq were purposely adopted and samples were quenched with an excessive na2s2o3 followed by 0 2 μm membrane filtration due to the limited ability of nh2oh for quenching a considerable amount of mno2 s produced from the reduction of mno4 2800 μm the change of nh2oh to na2s2o3 had little influence on the kinetic results for instance the second order rate constant for the reaction of mno4 with lf at ph 7 5 was determined to be 4 2 or 3 9 m 1 s 1 when using nh2oh or na2s2o3 as a quencher respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 lf degradation by mno4 in the presence of bq at ph 7 5 the presence of bq significantly increased the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of lf degradation by mno4 from 0 010 without bq to 0 042 0 443 min 1 at bq o mno4 o 0 03 0 25 fig 1 a indicating the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq the k obs and the bq o mno4 o ratio were linearly correlated fig s3 implying that more secondary oxidants were produced as the latter increased however at bq o mno4 o 0 4 the k obs decreased to 0 337 min 1 fig 1a and the lf degradation was negligibly affected at bq o mno4 o 0 6 implying that bq itself consumed a majority of secondary oxidants mn iii was decisive for the ha accelerated lf degradation by mno4 xu et al 2017 and mn iii was also produced in the reaction of mno4 with bisulfite hso3 to rapidly degrade omps sun et al 2015 pp is a specific ligand for mn iii at bq o mno4 o 0 25 the addition of pp 1 mm almost completely inhibited the acceleration on lf degradation fig 1b indicating that mn iii was also the initially decisive intermediate for the bq accelerated lf degradation by mno4 ffa and nan3 are often used to probe the formation of 1o2 whose reaction rate constants with 1o2 were reported to be 1 2 108 and 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively halladja et al 2007 zhou et al 2015 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 and within the reaction time of 0 15 min the presence of 20 and 200 μm ffa decreased the k obs from 0 443 to 0 287 and 0 170 min 1 fig 1b respectively and the lf degradation became much slower after 15 min nan3 1 mm also significantly decreased the k obs to 0 143 min 1 fig 1b indicating that 1o2 significantly contributed to the accelerated lf degradation as a fluoroquinolone lf could be readily degraded by 1o2 liu et al 2018 dissolved oxygen do was often indispensable to generate 1o2 zhang et al 2009 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 the stripping of do from reacting solution also inhibited lf degradation fig s4 suggesting the involvement of do in the production of 1o2 it is noteworthy that bq is a specific scavenger for o2 with a reaction rate constant of 1 109 m 1 s 1 cavalcante et al 2016 as the bq o mno4 o ratio increased from 0 25 to 0 60 the lf degradation was significantly inhibited fig 1a suggesting the contribution of o2 to the accelerated lf degradation in general o2 undergoes rapid disproportionation in water to produce oh rather than directly reacts with omps furman et al 2009 khanchandani et al 2014 the second order reaction rate constant of oh with lf could reach above 109 m 1 s 1 el najjar et al 2013 ling et al 2018 tba is a specific scavenger for oh at bq o mno4 o 0 25 the addition of tba 2 7 mm only decreased the k obs to 0 345 min 1 fig 1b indicating an unimportant contribution of oh to the accelerated lf degradation which may be attributed to the predominant scavenging of o2 by bq oh also contributed insignificantly to the bq accelerated sulfamethoxazole degradation by pms zhou et al 2015 in brief these results indicate that mn iii should have induced the formation of 1o2 and oh in the reaction of mno4 with bq 3 2 secondary oxidants generated in the reaction of mno4 with bq when quinone was reduced to semiquinone radical fig s2 the latter could further transfer an electron to do to produce o2 and regenerate bq thor et al 1982 the redox cycle of quinones and corresponding semiquinone radicals occurs spontaneously in surface water soil airborne particulate matter and other environmental compartments fang et al 2013 o2 was an autoxidation product of semiquinone radical guillén et al 2000 as a strongly oxidative intermediate mn iii may accelerate this autoxidation process to produce o2 bmpo traps o2 and oh to form bmpo ooh and bmpo oh respectively methanol ch3oh can prevent the disproportionation of o2 epr spectra show that as the bq o mno4 o ratio increased from 0 to 0 5 the peak intensity of bmpo ooh kept increasing until exceeding that of bmpo oh fig 2 indicating an increasing production of o2 in the reaction of mno4 with bq by contrast as the bq o mno4 o ratio further increased from 0 5 to 4 the peak intensities of both bmpo ooh and bmpo oh kept decreasing while that of semiquinone radical remarkably increased without mno4 no semiquinone radical was detected in the presence of bmpo and ch3oh fig s5 in the absence of bmpo and ch3oh the reaction of mno4 with bq in water also produced a higher amount of semiquinone radical than the aqueous bq solution fig s6a as the reaction proceeded from 5 to 9 min the amount of semiquinone radical produced by mno4 and bq kept increasing fig s6b it is seen that as a carbon centered radical semiquinone radical could be directly detected without a spin trapping agent and its production was enhanced in the reaction of mno4 with bq fig 2 shows that semiquinone radical could accumulate to a high concentration under an excessive bq while it decayed to o2 at a relatively lower bq concentration i e bq o mno4 o 0 50 temp is a specific probe for 1o2 yang et al 1999 because it traps 1o2 to produce 1 oxyl temp tempo fig s1 after mixing bq with temp for 3 min semiquinone radical was identified and the intensity of tempo simultaneously increased fig s7 indicating the production of 1o2 from the decay of semiquinone radical in the reaction of mno4 with bq the intermediate mn iii may promote the decay of semiquinone radical to produce 1o2 at bq o mno4 o 0 5 the peak intensity of tempo increased as compared to that in the absence of bq fig s8 indicating the production of 1o2 in the reaction of mno4 with bq as the bq o mno4 o ratio increased to 1 4 the peak intensity of tempo decreased while that of semiquinone radical kept increasing this result indicates that semiquinone radical could also decay to produce 1o2 when formed at a relatively low concentration 3 3 reaction of mn ii with bq quinone was involved in the bacterial oxidation of mn ii with mn iii as an intermediate johnson and tebo 2008 our results also indicate that bq was reduced by a manganese species to form semiquinone radical in its reaction with mno4 and the reaction solution turned colorless finally among all the species originating from mn vii only mn ii is nearly colorless in water moreover as the reaction of mno4 with bq proceeded the uv vis absorbance of mn ii complex was increasing while that of mn iii complex first increased and then decreased fig s9 indicating the production of mn ii mn ii covered a much broader magnetic field with six successive peaks on its epr spectrum fig s10a otherwise only a diagonal line was observed in the magnetic field range in fig 2 even at bq o mno4 o 4 mn ii was not detected on the epr spectrum at a reaction time of 3 min fig 2 it suggests that once mn ii was formed it could further react with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical which eventually produced mn iii semiquinone radical complex and other secondary oxidants when coexisting with bq for 3 min the peak intensity of mn ii significantly decreased fig s10b indicating the reaction of mn ii with bq in the presence of temp the reaction of mn ii with bq could proceed for at least 2 h fig 3 a the peak intensity of tempo notably increased while that of mn ii gradually decreased this result indicates that bq reacted with mn ii to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical and mn iii further oxidized semiquinone radical to produce 1o2 scheme 1 a in the presence of bmpo bmpo oh was detected and its peak intensity increased up to a reaction time of 3 h fig 3b which indicates again the reaction of mn ii with bq in the presence of both bmpo and ch3oh the bmpo adduct of o2 bmpo ooh rather than oh bmpo oh was detected fig 3c these results indicate that o2 and oh were also produced in the reaction of mn ii with bq scheme 1a it was noteworthy that the peak intensity of mn ii hardly decreased when that of bmpo ooh or bmpo oh increased fig 3b and c once produced o2 would transfer an electron to mn iii to produce mn ii at ph 6 5 the k obs of lf degradation by mno4 increased significantly from 0 014 without bq to 0 979 min 1 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 table 1 while at ph 8 5 the k obs increased only from 0 008 to 0 025 min 1 it is seen that an acidic ph favored the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq hydrogen ion h could promote the formation of mn iii and semiquinone radical in the reaction of mn ii with bq scheme 1a and h was also found to promote the ha accelerated degradation of lf by mno4 xu et al 2017 even without mno4 the coexistence of mn ii and bq could significantly degrade lf fig 4 a the addition of pp remarkably inhibited lf degradation indicating the formation of mn iii in the reaction of mn ii with bq scheme 1a and the degradation of lf by mn iii in comparison nan3 exerted a weaker inhibition than pp but a stronger inhibition than tba on lf degradation indicating that the reaction of mn iii with semiquinone radical produced 1o2 and oh which also contributed to lf degradation as mentioned above the relatively lower contribution of oh to lf degradation could be ascribed to the scavenging of o2 by bq moreover the addition of mn ii greatly enhanced the degradation of lf by mno4 in the presence of bq fig 4b confirming that mn ii was involved in the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq 3 4 reaction of mn vii with mn ii besides directly reacting with mn iii semiquinone radical could also form a complex with mn iii through its oh group fig s2 mno4 has an absorbance peak at 525 nm a525 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 when stabilized by pp mn iii has an absorbance peak at 258 nm a258 sun et al 2015 in the mno4 bq pp reaction system the a258 kept increasing while the a525 kept decreasing as the reaction proceeded fig 5 a indicating the continuous conversion of mn vii to mn iii in the reaction of mno4 with bq in the mno4 mn ii bq pp reaction system the increase in a258 and the decrease in a525 were both accelerated fig 5b indicating that the addition of mn ii promoted the formation of mn iii in the reaction of mno4 with bq in the mn ii bq pp reaction system the a258 was obscured by an adjacent much larger peak of bq but another characteristic peak a212 clearly indicated the continuous formation of mn iii pp fig 5c however it is noted that a less amount of mn iii pp was formed even at higher initial concentrations of mn ii and bq fig 5c these results indicate that not only mno4 but also mn ii could react with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical and the products could further form a complex to summarize mno4 first reacted with bq to produce mn ii and then mn ii reacted with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical whose further reaction in the presence of do yielded 1o2 and o2 and regenerated mn ii and bq scheme 1a in addition mno4 reacted with mn ii to produce mn iii which then formed a complex with semiquinone radical scheme 1b hence semiquinone radical actually promoted the formation of mn iii 1o2 and mn iii significantly degraded lf the aqueous bq solution contained a certain amount of semiquinone radical fig s6 indicating the internal electron transfer among bq molecules in the reaction of mno4 with bq the electron from mn ii which reduced bq to semiquinone radical also originated from another bq molecule scheme 1a and mno4 accelerated the production of semiquinone radical from bq 3 5 lf degradation by mno4 in the presence of phenol the oxidation of phenol by mno4 produced quinone guan et al 2010 considering that the ha structure also contains abundant phenol groups fig s1 the effect of phenol on lf degradation by mno4 was also examined at phenol o mno4 o 0 13 and 0 25 the degradation of lf was notably accelerated in the presence of phenol fig 6 a the acceleration by phenol was initially much weaker than that by bq but became comparable as the reaction proceeded at phenol o mno4 o 0 25 the addition of pp completely inhibited the acceleration by phenol fig 6b indicating a decisive role of mn iii tba inhibited the acceleration by phenol more significantly than ffa in the initial phase indicating an important role of oh while the inhibition of ffa surpassed that of tba after a reaction time of about 23 min indicating an important role of 1o2 in the later phase in other words oh was predominantly generated in the reaction of mno4 with phenol and once phenol was oxidized to quinone 1o2 was predominantly generated this result well explains why oh mainly contributed to the ha accelerated degradation of lf by mno4 in our previous study xu et al 2017 whereas 1o2 mainly contributed to the bq accelerated degradation of lf in this study it is noted that other reducing groups in ha may also induce the generation of secondary oxidants for example the dimethylamine group in ha could generate oh during ozonation buffle and von gunten 2006 in addition ha has a very complex chemical structure which also varies significantly with different origins therefore the contributions of different secondary oxidants e g oh o2 1o2 to the accelerated degradation of omps in chemical oxidation processes actually rely on the relative contents of phenol quinone and other reducing groups in ha 3 6 degradation pathways of lf by mno4 in the presence of bq based on the ms ms2 spectra fig s11 abundance evolution fig s12 and mass measurements table s1 of byproducts the degradation pathways of lf by mno4 in the presence of bq are proposed in fig 7 lf was degraded mainly through carboxylation e g lf391 and lf313 hydroxylation e g lf228 and lf343 dehydrogenation e g lf359 and lf375 and dealkylation e g lf347 and lf395 reactions loss of one ch3 group from the n4 atom to produce lf347 was a typical n dealkylation reaction it was reported that mn iii could facilitate the n dealkylation of atrazine hu et al 2017 the hydroxyl and ketone groups in lf313 could originate from the degradation of an endoperoxide intermediate it was reported that 1o2 first attacked the ch group in guanine to produce a roo or roo group and then one of the oxygen atoms was connected with an adjacent carbon atom to form an endoperoxide group whose further degradation yielded hydroxyl and ketone groups dumont et al 2016 in addition 1o2 could also attack an olefin group through cycloaddition reaction min and boff 2002 which explains the endoperoxide structure in lf228 the two hydroxyl groups on either side of the c c bond in lf343 could originate from 1 2 cycloaddition upon 1o2 attack and the subsequent cleavage of the o o bond the olefin structure in lf359 c4 c5 could facilitate the attack of 1o2 to produce lf335 lf413 2 and lf375 lf278 was produced by cleaving the n1 c4 and n1 c8 bonds of lf the dealkylation defluorination and hydroxylation of lf363 could produce lf413 1 and lf379 hu et al 2017 reported that mn iii could not only cleave the n c bond of atrazine to eliminate an alkylamine group but also promote the dechlorination and subsequent hydroxylation of 4 chlorophenol the ketone groups in lf278 lf306 and lf413 2 could probably be reduced by semiquinone radical to corresponding hydroxyl groups in lf254 lf269 and lf385 the notable formation of oxygen rich e g hydroxyl ketone and endoperoxide groups in the degradation byproducts also confirmed the essential roles of 1o2 and mn iii in accelerating lf degradation by mno4 as a result a stronger destruction of lf was achieved in the presence of bq 4 conclusions this study investigated the impact of bq on lf degradation by mno4 from both kinetic and mechanistic aspects based on the experimental results obtained the following conclusions can be drawn bq significantly enhanced the degradation of lf by mno4 at ph 7 5 the k obs of lf degradation increased from 0 010 without bq to 0 443 min 1 at bq o mno4 o 0 25 an acidic ph favored the production of secondary oxidants in the reaction of mno4 with bq thus facilitating lf degradation mno4 was reduced by bq to mn ii which then reacted with bq to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical in the presence of do mn iii further reacted with semiquinone radical to yield 1o2 and o2 in addition mno4 could also react with mn ii to produce mn iii and semiquinone radical promoted this reaction through forming a complex with mn iii among the secondary oxidants produced in the reaction of mno4 with bq 1o2 and mn iii mainly accounted for the accelerated degradation of lf because o2 was predominantly scavenged by bq the presence of bq induced a stronger destruction of lf as evidenced by the notable formation of hydroxyl ketone and endoperoxide groups in the degradation byproducts

19418,inhibition by ammoniacal nitrogen consisting of free ammonia nh3 and ammonium ion nh4 has been widely investigated for anaerobic digestion however despite the large amount of research on the subject ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition still threatens many anaerobic digesters this paper presents i a method to reliably characterise ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition and ii a robust inhibition modelling approach results showed that nh3 and nh4 inhibition need to be jointly determined which can only be done by performing inhibition tests at various total ammoniacal nitrogen tan concentrations and ph values these test conditions were reliably achieved using the salts nh4hco3 and nh4cl without ph adjustment rather than by using nh4cl with ph adjustment the use of only salts showed a lower ph change during the inhibition test 1 5 days thereby decreasing the uncertainty in tan speciation and strengthening the test and model outputs a threshold inhibition function satisfactorily described r2 0 99 the joint inhibition of nh3 and nh4 on three distinct inocula and provided a better description of the inhibition testing results than a non competitive inhibition function r2 0 70 the key advantage of the proposed threshold inhibition function is its capacity to identify the inhibition lower limit concentration where inhibition starts kimin and upper limit concentration where inhibition is complete kimax the threshold inhibition function also identifies the 50 inhibition concentration ki50 at the midpoint of kimin and kimax finally experimental and model results show that at ph 7 3 7 7 and tan concentrations above 2000 mgn l 1 both nh3 and nh4 contribute significantly to overall inhibition keywords anaerobic digestion inhibition toxicity

small variations in ph lead to a substantial change in tan speciation both nh3 and nh4 have been reported as concurrent inhibitors of methanogenic activity hadj et al 2009 lay et al 1998 however the emphasis has usually been on nh3 because it is considered the most inhibitory form kayhanian 1999 rajagopal et al 2013 most studies have assessed the impact of ammoniacal nitrogen on ad process performance in terms of tan and or nh3 concentrations rajagopal et al 2013 yenigün and demirel 2013 nonetheless as demonstrated by the few publications studying ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition at various tan concentrations and ph values taking only nh3 concentration as inhibitor factor cannot accurately describe observed inhibition akindele and sartaj 2018 hadj et al 2009 lay et al 1998 nakakubo et al 2008 tian et al 2018 this is especially important at high tan concentrations where both nh3 and nh4 can be significant inhibitors on the other hand using tan concentration as a sole factor of inhibition does not allow differentiation between nh3 and nh4 inhibition especially since nh3 can be more harmful than nh4 and minor changes in ph can affect the observed inhibition rajagopal et al 2013 inhibition testing also known as anaerobic toxicity assay ata has been widely used to quantify the inhibitory capacity of a compound in ad owen et al 1979 rozzi and remigi 2004 soto et al 1993a acetoclastic methanogens in particular methanosaeta are considered to be most sensitive microorganisms to inhibition in ad systems de vrieze et al 2015 fotidis et al 2014 therefore inhibition testing has focused on the response of specific methanogenic activity sma to a range of inhibitor concentrations lu et al 2018 rozzi and remigi 2004 the inhibition potential of biostatic inhibitors e g nh3 and nh4 is typically described by an inhibition coefficient ki50 representing the concentration at which the sma is half the maximum batstone et al 2002 reported ki50 values for nh3 and tan show an enormous variability with values ranging from 0 05 to 1 4 gnh3 n l 1 and from 1 7 to 14 gtan l 1 respectively chen et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 yenigün and demirel 2013 chen et al 2008 attributed the substantial differences in ki50 values to several factors such as substrate type anaerobic community composition environmental conditions and acclimatisation periods but also to differences in experimental techniques the relevance of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition in ad research and applications requires a reliable methodology to differentiate between nh3 and nh4 inhibition as well as to reliably determine inhibition parameters thereby preventing incorrect interpretations of inhibition test results inhibition testing also provides data for inhibition modelling to elucidate the response of a microbial community to different inhibitor concentrations rozzi and remigi 2004 nh3 inhibition was initially modelled by hill and barth 1977 using an uncompetitive inhibition model on the kinetic growth of methanogens a model where the inhibitor affects both the overall uptake rate and the substrate affinity pavlostathis and giraldo gomez 1991 later work angelidaki et al 1993 siegrist et al 1993 utilised a non competitive switching function which linearly affects the uptake rate or growth rate through a standard continuous inhibition function as used in many other models e g asm1 henze et al 1987 the non competitive function was the standard for nh3 in early ad modelling publications keshtkar et al 2001 kiely et al 1997 mussati et al 1998 and was later recommended in the iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 for nh3 inhibition and other biostatic inhibitors batstone et al 2002 however the sigmoidal inhibition pattern observed in practice for nh3 astals et al 2015 hadj et al 2009 nakakubo et al 2008 does not resemble the inhibition pattern described by the non competitive inhibition function concave up decreasing recent work has identified that a threshold style inhibition function analogous to the empirical equation used in the adm1 for ph inhibition is more suitable to represent changes in methanogenic activity with varying inhibitor concentrations arnell et al 2016 batstone et al 2015 this is primarily due to the identification of a lower limit concentration below which there is no inhibition and an upper limit of inhibition concentration above which there is complete inhibition which are aspects of practical importance and yet cannot be represented by the non competitive model the main goal of this study is to develop and validate a robust inhibition method for ammoniacal nitrogen which identifies the separate impact of nh3 and nh4 this research also examines the modelling of nh3 and nh4 inhibition to provide a better understanding of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition in anaerobic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagent and inoculum source all test reagents were analytical reagent grade anhydrous sodium acetate chem supply australia was used as carbon source as per astals et al 2015 ammonium chloride merck germany and ammonium bicarbonate sigma aldrich us were used as tan source the inocula used in this study were i digested pig manure dpm from well mixed 4 l lab scale digesters operating at 37 c a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days and an organic loading rate olr of 0 5 gvs l 1 day 1 ii digested sewage sludge dss from a mixed mesophilic 5500 m3 digester treating primary and secondary sludge 1 1 ratio on a volume basis at a hrt of 23 days located in south east queensland australia iii digested slaughterhouse wastewater dshw from the settled sludge layer 3 m depth of an anaerobic lagoon treating combined wastewater from a cattle only meat processing facility in new south wales australia the lagoon operates in the mesophilic temperature range and has not been desludged in 10 years 2 2 inhibition test method inhibition testing was performed following the method described by astals et al 2015 specifically serum bottles 115 ml contained i 80 ml of inoculum ii the amount of sodium acetate solution 200 gacetate l 1 needed for an inoculum to acetate ratio of 5 volatile solids basis and iii the amount of ammonium salt i e ammonium chloride or ammonium bicarbonate needed to reach a specific tan concentration control tests inoculum and sodium acetate only were run for each inoculum and each experimental condition dss inoculum was diluted with deionised water prior testing to a volatile solid vs concentration of 10 gvs l 1 following astals et al 2015 dpm and dshw were not diluted because their vs concentrations were already below 10 gvs l 1 5 2 and 3 0 gvs l 1 respectively the ph of each serum bottle was measured once all reagents had been added just before the headspace of the bottles was flushed for 30 s 4 l min 1 with 99 99 n2 during headspace flushing the gas line was not submerged into the test medium the bottle was then sealed with a butyl rubber septum and aluminium crimp seal and placed in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c the specific methanogenic activity sma of each serum bottle was determined through three sampling events approximately at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 days whereat the headspace pressure increase and methane concentration were quantified using a bench top manometer and a gas chromatograph respectively methane production is expressed in grams of chemical oxygen demand gcod ch4 acetate degradation was not completed during the inhibition tests to assure zero order kinetics when determining the sma astals et al 2015 soto et al 1993a the ph of each test bottle was also measured just after the final sampling event 1 5 days all conditions were tested in triplicate including control conditions table 1 summarises the test conditions of the three sets of experiments carried out to develop and validate the inhibition methodology the experimental details of each of the experiments are as follows 2 3 experiment 1 evaluate the impact of the tan source and ph to determine the impact of the tan source and ph on inhibition threshold and pattern a series of tests were performed using ammonium chloride nh4cl or ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 at four different added tan concentrations added as 2 3 4 and 5 gtan l 1 and without ph adjustment an extra set of tests was also carried out with nh4cl and with ph adjustment since this strategy has been previously used in the literature to differentiate the inhibitory impact of nh3 and nh4 hadj et al 2009 lay et al 1998 in this last set of tests ph was dropwise adjusted at the beginning of the assay with 4m naoh to 7 40 to match the ph of the control assay digested pig manure dpm was used as inoculum 2 4 experiment 2 assess the impact of inoculum dilution based on the outcome of experiment 1 a second series of tests was carried out to assess the impact of inoculum dilution i e the initial volatile solids concentration on test performance specifically digested sewage sludge dss was diluted with deionised water to 10 gvs l 1 1 1 dilution and 5 gvs l 1 1 3 dilution in this test nh4cl or nh4hco3 was used to provide five different tan concentrations without ph adjustment the added tan concentrations using nh4cl were 0 5 1 3 5 and 8 gtan l 1 while the added tan concentrations using nh4hco3 were 0 5 1 2 3 and 5 gtan l 1 2 5 experiment 3 validate the proposed methodology a further validation test was performed using another distinct inoculum in terms of substrate type and digester configuration namely digested slaughterhouse wastewater dshw as in experiment 2 either nh4cl or nh4hco3 without ph adjustment was used to provide different tan concentrations and ph values the five added tan concentrations using nh4cl were 0 5 1 3 5 and 8 gtan l 1 while the five added tan concentrations using nh4hco3 were 0 5 1 2 3 and 5 gtan l 1 2 6 analytical methods analyses of the total fraction were performed directly on raw samples for analyses of the soluble fraction samples were centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min and the supernatant filtered through a 0 45 μm pes millipore filter total solids ts and vs were measured for each inoculum according to standard method 2540g eaton et al 2005 ph was measured with a tps wp 80d multi parameter meter equipped with a tps 121210 micro ph sensor the ph sensor was calibrated prior to its use with two certipur ph standards merck kgaa germany at ph 7 00 and 9 00 at room temperature 23 c ph readings were not temperature compensated but were measured at 25 30 c tan was determined using a lachat quick chem 8500 flow injection analyser following the manufacturer s protocol nh3 concentration was calculated by means of equation 1 where the activity coefficient γ1 corrects for non ideal conditions note i in the supplementary material explains activity correction calculations nh4 concentration was the difference between tan and nh3 concentration in equation 1 tan concentration includes both the concentration supplied by the inhibitor and by the inoculum background and ph is the average value between the initial before flushing the headspace of the test

inhibition modelling mathematical analysis of the inhibition test data was based on the change in sma from its maximum value smamax obtained from the non inhibited control tests with increasing nh3 and nh4 concentrations as can be seen in equation 3 the inhibition modelling included distinct inhibition terms for nh3 inh3 and nh4 inh4 3 sma sma max i nh 3 i nh 4 two inhibition functions were tested namely i a non competitive inhibition function equation 4 and ii a threshold inhibition function analogous to the empirical equation used in the adm1 for ph inhibition equation 5 4 i nhx 1 1 s

which the inhibition is almost complete sma 0 06 smamax the ki50 of the threshold inhibition function is the arithmetic average midpoint of kimin and kimax in equation 5 the exponent 2 provides a progressive increase in inhibition above the threshold concentration an exponent 2 gives a decreasing effect at increasing inhibitor concentrations while an exponent 2 provides an excessive acceleration in inhibition the constant number 2 77259 ensures that the arithmetic average of kimin and kimax equals ki50 i e ki50 kimin kimax 2 the parameter covariance matrix calculated to quantify the correlation between model parameters was obtained by equation 6 montgomery 2012 where ssr is the sum of squared residuals n p is the number of degrees of freedom and x is the jacobian matrix 6 cov β ˆ x x 1 ssr n p 3 results 3 1 impact of tan source and ph on inhibition response fig 1 plots the change in sma against nh3 fig 1a and nh4 fig 1b concentrations for experiment 1 when using nh4hco3 nh4cl without ph adjustment or nh4cl with ph adjustment on dpm inoculum results showed that test conditions strongly influenced inhibition test outputs inhibition threshold and pattern which was directly related to tan speciation i e concentration of nh3 and nh4 as affected by ph of the digestion media nh4cl is an acidic salt and decreases the ph of the test medium while nh4hco3 is an alkaline salt and increases the ph of the test medium table si in the supplementary material presents the initial final and average ph values of the inhibition tests fig 1 shows that tests with higher ph nh4hco3 nh4cl with ph adjustment nh4cl without ph adjustment were more inhibited at low nh4 values but less inhibited at high nh3 values these observations clearly show an interdependence between nh3 and nh4 inhibition caused by ph the experiment 1 results also showed that despite a short testing time 1 5 days there was a ph drift during the inhibition tests see table si the ph drift decrease was particularly notable when using nh4cl with ph adjustment tests possibly caused by a number of physico chemical processes converging to an end point ph in the complex sludge matrix a ph drift is of key concern for robust inhibition measurements because a small change in ph translates into a substantial change in nh3 concentration to illustrate this fig si in the supplementary material shows fig 1 inhibition profiles when the nh3 concentration is calculated using the initial final or average ph these results suggested that to reliably differentiate the impact of nh3 and nh4 on ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition it is preferable to use only salts nh4hco3 nh4cl rather than nh4cl with ph adjustment 3 2 inhibition modelling the threshold inhibition function equation 5 satisfactorily fitted the experimental data r2 0 99 of the first series of tests see fig 1 whereas the non competitive inhibition function equation 4 did not r2 0 68 see fig sii in the supplementary material the combination of non competitive inhibition for nh3 as in adm1 and threshold style inhibition for nh4 also did not provide a satisfactory fit of the data r2 0 88 the comparison of the different models using an f test confirmed that the threshold inhibition function was statistically better than the non competitive inhibition function or a combination of the two approaches p 0 0001 the model outputs from the threshold inhibition function for dpm table 2 indicated that nh3 was inhibitory at concentrations as low as 15 mgnh3 n l 1 and that acetoclastic methanogenesis was completely inhibited at and above 130 mgnh3 n l 1 for nh4 concentrations needed to reach 2700 mgnh4 n l 1 to start inhibiting the onset concentration and inhibition was complete at nh4 concentrations above 4800 mgnh4 n l 1 the model correlation matrix showed that the inhibition parameters had a weak to moderate correlation indicating that the nh3 and nh4 inhibition parameters were independent of each other and that the model was not over parameterised see table sii in the supplementary material fig 2 shows the overall degree of inhibition on sma caused by the combined impact of nh3 and nh4 where 1 means total inhibition and 0 means no inhibition fig 2 was generated using the inhibition parameters for dpm in table 2 the figure clearly identified five different zones of inhibition i zone of no significant inhibition white colour ii zone where inhibition is dominated by nh4 red colour iii zone where inhibition is dominated by nh3 blue colour iv zone where nh3 and nh4 have an equal contribution to inhibition purple colour and v a zone of complete inhibition black colour from an inhibition point of view the most remarkable observation from fig 2 was that at ph 7 3 7 7 a common ph in many anaerobic systems and tan 2000 mg l 1 relevant for many ad systems both species made a similar contribution to overall inhibition this observation supported that both nh3 and nh4 need to be jointly considered when performing inhibition studies on ammoniacal nitrogen 3 3 impact of inoculum dilution as shown in fig 3 inoculum dilution did not have a major impact on the inhibition results this observation is further supported by the model outputs of the threshold inhibition function since inhibition parameters for 10 and 5 gvs l 1 were not significantly different table 2 3 4 validation of inhibition analysis method the methodology used above to differentiate nh3 and nh4 inhibition was further validated with dshw fig 4 shows the experimental and model results demonstrating that the test and analysis methodology were applicable to this very different inoculum the threshold inhibition function satisfactorily fitted the test results r2 0 99 table 2 4 discussion ammoniacal nitrogen is the most investigated reported inhibitory compound in ad systems chen et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 yenigün and demirel 2013 hence a robust methodology is needed to improve the interpretations of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition as well as to prevent incorrect interpretation of inhibition results by ad academics and practitioners towards this end the method developed in this study expands the inhibition protocol by astals et al 2015 specifically for ammoniacal nitrogen 4 1 progress towards a robust assay for ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition testing the results showed that nh3 and nh4 inhibition need to be jointly determined which could only be done by performing inhibition tests where both tan and ph were varied ammonium chloride nh4cl has been the most common source of tan for ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition testing in batch assays lu et al 2018 tian et al 2018 however since nh4cl is a mildly acidic salt the ph of the test medium usually decreases when nh4cl is added for instance in the digested sewage sludge test at 10 gvs l 1 the ph of the digestion medium decreased from 7 57 control to 7 27 when 3 gtan l 1 was added by nh4cl see table si therefore although tan concentration was increased by 500 in this specific example from 0 6 to 3 6 gtan l 1 the resulting nh3 concentration only increased by 170 from 22 to 59 mgnh3 n l 1 see fig siii in the supplementary material using nh4cl as unique tan source is therefore not adequate because i different tan concentrations are only trialled at a single ph condition which does not allow differentiating between nh3 and nh4 inhibition and ii the impact of nh4cl on ph limits the range of nh3 concentrations that can be achieved to differentiate between nh3 and nh4 inhibition some authors adjusted the medium ph by adding hcl or naoh solution hadj et al 2009 lay et al 1998 sung and liu 2003 however in the present study salts nh4hco3 and nh4cl provided a more stable ph during the inhibition test 1 5 days than nh4cl with naoh ph adjustment see table si ph changes during the inhibition test cause uncertainty in estimates of nh3 concentration and make it more difficult to establish cause effect relationships between nh3 and sma see fig si therefore using nh4hco3 and nh4cl salts is preferred to minimise ph drift as compared to nh4cl with initial ph adjustment furthermore using salts to create ph differences at a single tan concentration is simpler quicker and more reliable than adjusting ph by the dropwise addition of an acid or alkali other ammonium salts could have been used to induce different tan and ph values such as nh4br nh4 2hpo4 and nh4 2co3 however bromide seems to be more inhibitory than chloride chen et al 2008 phosphate can precipitate with nh4 as struvite thereby reducing tan concentrations and ph and carbonate is more alkaline than bicarbonate potentially increasing the ph above 8 that could lead to secondary inhibition mechanisms the combination of nh4hco3 and nh4cl in different proportions could also be considered as an option but makes the setting up of inhibition tests more time consuming the results presented in this study showed that using nh4hco3 and nh4cl provided a large enough range of ph values large enough difference in nh3 and nh4 concentrations to statistically identify inhibitors parameters of both inhibitors see table 2 a more alkaline salt e g nh4 2co3 could be used instead of nh4hco3 if the ph variation is considered insufficient however the ph should be kept within the optimum of acetoclastic methanogens i e 6 5 8 0 batstone et al 2002 once nh4hco3 and nh4cl were selected as preferred tan source the impact of inoculum dilution on test response was evaluated by diluting digested sewage sludge to 10 gvs l 1 1 1 dilution and 5 gvs l 1 1 3 dilution inoculum pre dilution to 10 gvs l 1 was previously suggested by astals et al 2015 to avoid the interferences caused by highly concentrated inoculum however inoculum dilution also helps to reduce background concentrations of inhibitory compounds therefore when the inhibitor concentration in the inoculum is relatively high it may be necessary to dilute the inoculum below 10 gvs l 1 experimental fig 3 and model table 2 results showed that inoculum dilution did not have a significant impact on the inhibition test response or interpretation however inoculum dilution will affect the endogenous methane production methane from the inoculum and the sample matrix therefore it is recommended that any series of inhibition tests on the same inoculum to be done at the same dilution level finally excessive inoculum dilution is also not recommended since it may affect buffering capacity and availability of essential nutrients 4 2 modelling ammonia and ammonium inhibition most studies have used the non competitive inhibition functions to describe inhibition by nh3 and other biostatic inhibitors batstone et al 2002 fitamo et al 2016 hierholtzer and akunna 2012 owhondah et al 2016 however the experimental results of the present study suggested that the non competitive inhibition function is not suitable to describe the inhibition extent and pattern for nh3 and nh4 on acetoclastic methanogenesis see section 3 2 and fig sii other empirical inhibition functions have been previously used to model nh3 inhibition such as the n component non competitive function siegrist et al 2002 hill function ramirez et al 2009 and others hadj et al 2009 lokshina et al 2003 sung and liu 2003 wilson et al 2012 broadly the key differences between these functions and the non competitive inhibition function is their capacity to i adjust to describe different inhibition patterns and or ii provide an inhibitor concentration lag i e inhibitor concentration range where no inhibition occurs the proposed threshold inhibition function equation 5 has an advantage over other empirical inhibition functions since it clearly identifies three key points of inhibition the inhibitor concentration where inhibition starts kimin the inhibitor concentration where inhibition is almost complete kimax and the ki50 i e the average between kimin and kimax importantly the results showed that threshold inhibition function was able to properly describe r2 0 99 the separate inhibition of nh3 and nh4 for three distinctive inocula under study see figs 1 and 3 and fig sii fig 5 highlights inhibition model differences from an application perspective predicted inhibition profiles are presented for the threshold and non competitive models best fit describing inhibition by nh3 and nh4 on the dpm test see section 3 1 and 3 2 the non competitive inhibition function displays a concave up decreasing curve that starts inhibiting as soon as the inhibitor is present while the threshold inhibition shows a sigmoidal curve once the inhibitor concentration exceeds the onset concentration kimin the non competitive inhibition pattern of inhibition predicted that concentrations as large as 500 mgnh3 n l 1 and 10000 mgnh4 n l 1 did not cause complete inhibition unlike what is observed in reality overall the fact that i inhibition started as soon as the inhibitor was present and that ii large inhibitor concentration did not cause complete inhibition contrary to experimental observation suggested that the non competitive inhibition function was inadequate to represent nh3 and nh4 inhibition in anaerobic systems the need for a more suitable inhibition function than the non competitive model for biostatic inhibitors is also evident when observing the inhibition profiles for sodium astals et al 2015 soto et al 1993b and potassium chen and cheng 2007 as stated by batstone et al 2015 the threshold inhibition function is an ideal candidate for use as a new standardised empirical equation for biostatic inhibition modelling including as illustrated above for nh3 and nh4 finally it is worth mentioning that the confidence intervals of model parameters kimin and kimax are related to the i number of observations ii positioning of the observations iii conformity to the model and iv inclusion of activity corrections to estimate nh3 and nh4 concentration since there was a good conformity between the experimental data and the model outputs the confidence intervals in table 2 could have been reduced by i conducting initial tests to identify the optimal positioning of the experimental conditions and or ii by increasing the number of concentrations tested 4 3 application and limitations of the free ammonia ammonium inhibition test method the developed methodology provides a better understanding of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition by i differentiating between nh3 and nh4 inhibition and ii improving nh3 and nh4 inhibition modelling such information could be used to i evaluate the risk associated with ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition ii select and design mitigation strategies and iii determine inhibition tolerance prior to a process change that markedly increases tan in the digester e g loading rate co digestion pre treatment and recirculation however the developed method does not provide information about the mechanisms of inhibition nor does it foresee microbial acclimation capacity for example regarding the degradation pathway the method does not allow one to determine if acetate conversion into methane has been through acetoclastic methanogenesis or syntrophic acetate oxidation sao followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis nor if there is a degradation pathway shift as the nh3 and nh4 concentration changes despite these limitations the methodology can be applied to determine how a change in tan concentration is to be managed as well as to monitor changes in microbial inhibition resilience over time 5 conclusions a methodology has been developed and validated for assessing ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition experimental results showed that nh3 and nh4 inhibition needs to be jointly determined and that this can only be achieved by inhibition tests at various tan and ph values a smaller ph drift between the beginning and end of an inhibition test 1 5 days indicated that the use of separate salts nh4hco3 and nh4cl was preferred over nh4cl with ph adjustment results also showed that inoculum dilution below 10 gvs l 1 did not affect inhibition test outputs although excessive dilution is not recommended regarding inhibition modelling a threshold inhibition function proved to be more suitable than a non competitive inhibition function r2 0 99 and 0 70 respectively to quantify the distinct contributions of nh3 and nh4 to inhibition extent and inhibition pattern the key advantage of the proposed threshold inhibition function is its capacity to identify the inhibition lower limit concentration where inhibition starts kimin and upper limit concentration where inhibition is complete kimax an aspect that the non competitive model cannot represent acknowledgements this research was funded by the crc

19418,inhibition by ammoniacal nitrogen consisting of free ammonia nh3 and ammonium ion nh4 has been widely investigated for anaerobic digestion however despite the large amount of research on the subject ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition still threatens many anaerobic digesters this paper presents i a method to reliably characterise ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition and ii a robust inhibition modelling approach results showed that nh3 and nh4 inhibition need to be jointly determined which can only be done by performing inhibition tests at various total ammoniacal nitrogen tan concentrations and ph values these test conditions were reliably achieved using the salts nh4hco3 and nh4cl without ph adjustment rather than by using nh4cl with ph adjustment the use of only salts showed a lower ph change during the inhibition test 1 5 days thereby decreasing the uncertainty in tan speciation and strengthening the test and model outputs a threshold inhibition function satisfactorily described r2 0 99 the joint inhibition of nh3 and nh4 on three distinct inocula and provided a better description of the inhibition testing results than a non competitive inhibition function r2 0 70 the key advantage of the proposed threshold inhibition function is its capacity to identify the inhibition lower limit concentration where inhibition starts kimin and upper limit concentration where inhibition is complete kimax the threshold inhibition function also identifies the 50 inhibition concentration ki50 at the midpoint of kimin and kimax finally experimental and model results show that at ph 7 3 7 7 and tan concentrations above 2000 mgn l 1 both nh3 and nh4 contribute significantly to overall inhibition keywords anaerobic digestion inhibition toxicity

inhibition testing has focused on the response of specific methanogenic activity sma to a range of inhibitor concentrations lu et al 2018 rozzi and remigi 2004 the inhibition potential of biostatic inhibitors e g nh3 and nh4 is typically described by an inhibition coefficient ki50 representing the concentration at which the sma is half the maximum batstone et al 2002 reported ki50 values for nh3 and tan show an enormous variability with values ranging from 0 05 to 1 4 gnh3 n l 1 and from 1 7 to 14 gtan l 1 respectively chen et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 yenigün and demirel 2013 chen et al 2008 attributed the substantial differences in ki50 values to several factors such as substrate type anaerobic community composition environmental conditions and acclimatisation periods but also to differences in experimental techniques the relevance of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition in ad research and applications requires a reliable methodology to differentiate between nh3 and nh4 inhibition as well as to reliably determine inhibition parameters thereby preventing incorrect interpretations of inhibition test results inhibition testing also provides data for inhibition modelling to elucidate the response of a microbial community to different inhibitor concentrations rozzi and remigi 2004 nh3 inhibition was initially modelled by hill and barth 1977 using an uncompetitive inhibition model on the kinetic growth of methanogens a model where the inhibitor affects both the overall uptake rate and the substrate affinity pavlostathis and giraldo gomez 1991 later work angelidaki et al 1993 siegrist et al 1993 utilised a non competitive switching function which linearly affects the uptake rate or growth rate through a standard continuous inhibition function as used in many other models e g asm1 henze et al 1987 the non competitive function was the standard for nh3 in early ad modelling publications keshtkar et al 2001 kiely et al 1997 mussati et al 1998 and was later recommended in the iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 for nh3 inhibition and other biostatic inhibitors batstone et al 2002 however the sigmoidal inhibition pattern observed in practice for nh3 astals et al 2015 hadj et al 2009 nakakubo et al 2008 does not resemble the inhibition pattern described by the non competitive inhibition function concave up decreasing recent work has identified that a threshold style inhibition function analogous to the empirical equation used in the adm1 for ph inhibition is more suitable to represent changes in methanogenic activity with varying inhibitor concentrations arnell et al 2016 batstone et al 2015 this is primarily due to the identification of a lower limit concentration below which there is no inhibition and an upper limit of inhibition concentration above which there is complete inhibition which are aspects of practical importance and yet cannot be represented by the non competitive model the main goal of this study is to develop and validate a robust inhibition method for ammoniacal nitrogen which identifies the separate impact of nh3 and nh4 this research also examines the modelling of nh3 and nh4 inhibition to provide a better understanding of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition in anaerobic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagent and inoculum source all test reagents were analytical reagent grade anhydrous sodium acetate chem supply australia was used as carbon source as per astals et al 2015 ammonium chloride merck germany and ammonium bicarbonate sigma aldrich us were used as tan source the inocula used in this study were i digested pig manure dpm from well mixed 4 l lab scale digesters operating at 37 c a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days and an organic loading rate olr of 0 5 gvs l 1 day 1 ii digested sewage sludge dss from a mixed mesophilic 5500 m3 digester treating primary and secondary sludge 1 1 ratio on a volume basis at a hrt of 23 days located in south east queensland australia iii digested slaughterhouse wastewater dshw from the settled sludge layer 3 m depth of an anaerobic lagoon treating combined wastewater from a cattle only meat processing facility in new south wales australia the lagoon operates in the mesophilic temperature range and has not been desludged in 10 years 2 2 inhibition test method inhibition testing was performed following the method described by astals et al 2015 specifically serum bottles 115 ml contained i 80 ml of inoculum ii the amount of sodium acetate solution 200 gacetate l 1 needed for an inoculum to acetate ratio of 5 volatile solids basis and iii the amount of ammonium salt i e ammonium chloride or ammonium bicarbonate needed to reach a specific tan concentration control tests inoculum and sodium acetate only were run for each inoculum and each experimental condition dss inoculum was diluted with deionised water prior testing to a volatile solid vs concentration of 10 gvs l 1 following astals et al 2015 dpm and dshw were not diluted because their vs concentrations were already below 10 gvs l 1 5 2 and 3 0 gvs l 1 respectively the ph of each serum bottle was measured once all reagents had been added just before the headspace of the bottles was flushed for 30 s 4 l min 1 with 99 99 n2 during headspace flushing the gas line was not submerged into the test medium the bottle was then sealed with a butyl rubber septum and aluminium crimp seal and placed in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c the specific methanogenic activity sma of each serum bottle was determined through three sampling events approximately at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 days whereat the headspace pressure increase and methane concentration were quantified using a bench top manometer and a gas chromatograph respectively methane production is expressed in grams of chemical oxygen demand gcod ch4 acetate degradation was not completed during the inhibition tests to assure zero order kinetics when determining the sma astals et al 2015 soto et al 1993a the ph of each test bottle was also measured just after the final sampling event 1 5 days all conditions were tested in triplicate including control conditions table 1 summarises the test conditions of the three sets of experiments carried out to develop and validate the inhibition methodology the experimental details of each of the experiments are as follows 2 3 experiment 1 evaluate the impact of the tan source and ph to determine the impact of the tan source and ph on inhibition threshold and pattern a series of tests were performed using ammonium chloride nh4cl or ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 at four different added tan concentrations added as 2 3 4 and 5 gtan l 1 and without ph adjustment an extra set of tests was also carried out with nh4cl and with ph adjustment since this strategy has been previously used in the literature to differentiate the inhibitory impact of nh3 and nh4 hadj et al 2009 lay et al 1998 in this last set of tests ph was dropwise adjusted at the beginning of the assay with 4m naoh to 7 40 to match the ph of the control assay digested pig manure dpm was used as inoculum 2 4 experiment 2 assess the impact of inoculum dilution based on the outcome of experiment 1 a second series of tests was carried out to assess the impact of inoculum dilution i e the initial volatile solids concentration on test performance specifically digested sewage sludge dss was diluted with deionised water to 10 gvs l 1 1 1 dilution and 5 gvs l 1 1 3 dilution in this test nh4cl or nh4hco3 was used to provide five different tan concentrations without ph adjustment the added tan concentrations using nh4cl were 0 5 1 3 5 and 8 gtan l 1 while the added tan concentrations using nh4hco3 were 0 5 1 2 3 and 5 gtan l 1 2 5 experiment 3 validate the proposed methodology a further validation test was performed using another distinct inoculum in terms of substrate type and digester configuration namely digested slaughterhouse wastewater dshw as in experiment 2 either nh4cl or nh4hco3 without ph adjustment was used to provide different tan concentrations and ph values the five added tan concentrations using nh4cl were 0 5 1 3 5 and 8 gtan l 1 while the five added tan concentrations using nh4hco3 were 0 5 1 2 3 and 5 gtan l 1 2 6 analytical methods analyses of the total fraction were performed directly on raw samples for analyses of the soluble fraction samples were centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min and the supernatant filtered through a 0 45 μm pes millipore filter total solids ts and vs were measured for each inoculum according to standard method 2540g eaton et al 2005 ph was measured with a tps wp 80d multi parameter meter equipped with a tps 121210 micro ph sensor the ph sensor was calibrated prior to its use with two certipur ph standards merck kgaa germany at ph 7 00 and 9 00 at room temperature 23 c ph readings were not temperature compensated but were measured at 25 30 c tan was determined using a lachat quick chem 8500 flow injection analyser following the manufacturer s protocol nh3 concentration was calculated by means of equation 1 where the activity coefficient γ1 corrects for non ideal conditions note i in the supplementary material explains activity correction calculations nh4 concentration was the difference between tan and nh3 concentration in equation 1 tan concentration includes both the concentration supplied by the inhibitor and by the inoculum background and ph is the average value between the initial before flushing the headspace of the test bottle with n2 and the final ph just after opening the bottles following the last sampling event the acid base equilibrium constant for ammonium nitrogen ka at the assay temperature 37 c is 1 27 10 9

thermal conductivity detector 2 7 data analysis all analyses were performed in triplicate and errors were estimated as the 95 confidence interval in the mean value for the three samples using a two tailed student t distribution with two degrees of freedom values of the sma were determined as the slope of a linear regression fit analysis toolpak in microsoft excel 2016 applied to the specific methane production gcod ch4 g 1vsinoculum y axis and time x axis for subsets of data over which the rate of methane production was approximately constant over time the inhibition model coefficient of

inhibition modelling mathematical analysis of the inhibition test data was based on the change in sma from its maximum value smamax obtained from the non inhibited control tests with increasing nh3 and nh4 concentrations as can be seen in equation 3 the inhibition modelling included distinct inhibition terms for nh3 inh3 and nh4 inh4 3 sma sma max i nh 3 i nh 4 two inhibition functions were tested namely i a non competitive inhibition function equation 4 and ii a threshold inhibition function analogous to the empirical equation used in the adm1 for ph inhibition equation 5 4 i nhx 1 1 s

s i ki min ki max ki min 2 i f s i ki min where besides the above described kimin is the inhibitor concentration where inhibition starts onset concentration and kimax is the inhibitor concentration at which the inhibition is almost complete sma 0 06 smamax the ki50 of the threshold inhibition function is the arithmetic average midpoint of kimin and kimax in equation 5 the exponent 2 provides a progressive increase in inhibition above the threshold concentration an exponent 2 gives a decreasing effect at increasing inhibitor concentrations while an exponent 2 provides an excessive acceleration in inhibition the constant number 2 77259 ensures that the arithmetic average of kimin and kimax equals ki50 i e ki50 kimin kimax 2 the parameter covariance matrix calculated to quantify the correlation between model parameters was obtained by equation 6 montgomery 2012 where ssr is the sum of squared residuals n p is the number of degrees of freedom and x is the jacobian matrix 6 cov β ˆ x x 1 ssr n p 3 results 3 1 impact of tan source and ph on inhibition response fig 1 plots the change in sma against nh3 fig 1a and nh4 fig 1b concentrations for experiment 1 when using nh4hco3 nh4cl without ph adjustment or nh4cl with ph adjustment on dpm inoculum results showed that test conditions strongly influenced inhibition test outputs inhibition threshold and pattern which was directly related to tan speciation i e concentration of nh3 and nh4 as affected by ph of the digestion media nh4cl is an acidic salt and decreases the ph of the test medium while nh4hco3 is an alkaline salt and increases the ph of the test medium table si in the supplementary material presents the initial final and average ph values of the inhibition tests fig 1 shows that tests with higher ph nh4hco3 nh4cl with ph adjustment nh4cl without ph adjustment were more inhibited at low nh4 values but less inhibited at high nh3 values these observations clearly show an interdependence between nh3 and nh4 inhibition caused by ph the experiment 1 results also showed that despite a short testing time 1 5 days there was a ph drift during the inhibition tests see table si the ph drift decrease was particularly notable when using nh4cl with ph adjustment tests possibly caused by a number of physico chemical processes converging to an end point ph in the complex sludge matrix a ph drift is of key concern for robust inhibition measurements because a small change in ph translates into a substantial change in nh3 concentration to illustrate this fig si in the supplementary material shows fig 1 inhibition profiles when the nh3 concentration is calculated using the initial final or average ph these results suggested that to reliably differentiate the impact of nh3 and nh4 on ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition it is preferable to use only salts nh4hco3 nh4cl rather than nh4cl with ph adjustment 3 2 inhibition modelling the threshold inhibition function equation 5 satisfactorily fitted the experimental data r2 0 99 of the first series of tests see fig 1 whereas the non competitive inhibition function equation 4 did not r2 0 68 see fig sii in the supplementary material the combination of non competitive inhibition for nh3 as in adm1 and threshold style inhibition for nh4 also did not provide a satisfactory fit of the data r2 0 88 the comparison of the different models using an f test confirmed that the threshold inhibition function was statistically better than the non competitive inhibition function or a combination of the two approaches p 0 0001 the model outputs from the threshold inhibition function for dpm table 2 indicated that nh3 was inhibitory at concentrations as low as 15 mgnh3 n l 1 and that acetoclastic methanogenesis was completely inhibited at and above 130 mgnh3 n l 1 for nh4 concentrations needed to reach 2700 mgnh4 n l 1 to start inhibiting the onset concentration and inhibition was complete at nh4 concentrations above 4800 mgnh4 n l 1 the model correlation matrix showed that the inhibition parameters had a weak to moderate correlation indicating that the nh3 and nh4 inhibition parameters were independent of each other and that the model was not over parameterised see table sii in the supplementary material fig 2 shows the overall degree of inhibition on sma caused by the combined impact of nh3 and nh4 where 1 means total inhibition and 0 means no inhibition fig 2 was generated using the inhibition parameters for dpm in table 2 the figure clearly identified five different zones of inhibition i zone of no significant inhibition white colour ii zone where inhibition is dominated by nh4 red colour iii zone where inhibition is dominated by nh3 blue colour iv zone where nh3 and nh4 have an equal contribution to inhibition purple colour and v a zone of complete inhibition black colour from an inhibition point of view the most remarkable observation from fig 2 was that at ph 7 3 7 7 a common ph in many anaerobic systems and tan 2000 mg l 1 relevant for many ad systems both species made a similar contribution to overall inhibition this observation supported that both nh3 and nh4 need to be jointly considered when performing inhibition studies on ammoniacal nitrogen 3 3 impact of inoculum dilution as shown in fig 3 inoculum dilution did not have a major impact on the inhibition results this observation is further supported by the model outputs of the threshold inhibition function since inhibition parameters for 10 and 5 gvs l 1 were not significantly different table 2 3 4 validation of inhibition analysis method the methodology used above to differentiate nh3 and nh4 inhibition was further validated with dshw fig 4 shows the experimental and model results demonstrating that the test and analysis methodology were applicable to this very different inoculum the threshold inhibition function satisfactorily fitted the test results r2 0 99 table 2 4 discussion ammoniacal nitrogen is the most investigated reported inhibitory compound in ad systems chen et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 yenigün and demirel 2013 hence a robust methodology is needed to improve the interpretations of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition as well as to prevent incorrect interpretation of inhibition results by ad academics and practitioners towards this end the method developed in this study expands the inhibition protocol by astals et al 2015 specifically for ammoniacal nitrogen 4 1 progress towards a robust assay for ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition testing the results showed that nh3 and nh4 inhibition need to be jointly determined which could only be done by performing inhibition tests where both tan and ph were varied ammonium chloride nh4cl has been the most common source of tan for ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition testing in batch assays lu et al 2018 tian et al 2018 however since nh4cl is a mildly acidic salt the ph of the test medium usually decreases when nh4cl is added for instance in the digested sewage sludge test at 10 gvs l 1 the ph of the digestion medium decreased from 7 57 control to 7 27 when 3 gtan l 1 was added by nh4cl see table si therefore although tan concentration was increased by 500 in this specific example from 0 6 to 3 6 gtan l 1 the resulting nh3 concentration only increased by 170 from 22 to 59 mgnh3 n l 1 see fig siii in the supplementary material using nh4cl as unique tan source is therefore not adequate because i different tan concentrations are only trialled at a single ph condition which does not allow differentiating between nh3 and nh4 inhibition and ii the impact of nh4cl on ph limits the range of nh3 concentrations that can be achieved to differentiate between nh3 and nh4 inhibition some authors adjusted the medium ph by adding hcl or naoh solution hadj et al 2009 lay et al 1998 sung and liu 2003 however in the present study salts nh4hco3 and nh4cl provided a more stable ph during the inhibition test 1 5 days than nh4cl with naoh ph adjustment see table si ph changes during the inhibition test cause uncertainty in estimates of nh3 concentration and make it more difficult to establish cause effect relationships between nh3 and sma see fig si therefore using nh4hco3 and nh4cl salts is preferred to minimise ph drift as compared to nh4cl with initial ph adjustment furthermore using salts to create ph differences at a single tan concentration is simpler quicker and more reliable than adjusting ph by the dropwise addition of an acid or alkali other ammonium salts could have been used to induce different tan and ph values such as nh4br nh4 2hpo4 and nh4 2co3 however bromide seems to be more inhibitory than chloride chen et al 2008 phosphate can precipitate with nh4 as struvite thereby reducing tan concentrations and ph and carbonate is more alkaline than bicarbonate potentially increasing the ph above 8 that could lead to secondary inhibition mechanisms the combination of nh4hco3 and nh4cl in different proportions could also be considered as an option but makes the setting up of inhibition tests more time consuming the results presented in this study showed that using nh4hco3 and nh4cl provided a large enough range of ph values large enough difference in nh3 and nh4 concentrations to statistically identify inhibitors parameters of both inhibitors see table 2 a more alkaline salt e g nh4 2co3 could be used instead of nh4hco3 if the ph variation is considered insufficient however the ph should be kept within the optimum of acetoclastic methanogens i e 6 5 8 0 batstone et al 2002 once nh4hco3 and nh4cl were selected as preferred tan source the impact of inoculum dilution on test response was evaluated by diluting digested sewage sludge to 10 gvs l 1 1 1 dilution and 5 gvs l 1 1 3 dilution inoculum pre dilution to 10 gvs l 1 was previously suggested by astals et al 2015 to avoid the interferences caused by highly concentrated inoculum however inoculum dilution also helps to reduce background concentrations of inhibitory compounds therefore when the inhibitor concentration in the inoculum is relatively high it may be necessary to dilute the inoculum below 10 gvs l 1 experimental fig 3 and model table 2 results showed that inoculum dilution did not have a significant impact on the inhibition test response or interpretation however inoculum dilution will affect the endogenous methane production methane from the inoculum and the sample matrix therefore it is recommended that any series of inhibition tests on the same inoculum to be done at the same dilution level finally excessive inoculum dilution is also not recommended since it may affect buffering capacity and availability of essential nutrients 4 2 modelling ammonia and ammonium inhibition most studies have used the non competitive inhibition functions to describe inhibition by nh3 and other biostatic inhibitors batstone et al 2002 fitamo et al 2016 hierholtzer and akunna 2012 owhondah et al 2016 however the experimental results of the present study suggested that the non competitive inhibition function is not suitable to describe the inhibition extent and pattern for nh3 and nh4 on acetoclastic methanogenesis see section 3 2 and fig sii other empirical inhibition functions have been previously used to model nh3 inhibition such as the n component non competitive function siegrist et al 2002 hill function ramirez et al 2009 and others hadj et al 2009 lokshina et al 2003 sung and liu 2003 wilson et al 2012 broadly the key differences between these functions and the non competitive inhibition function is their capacity to i adjust to describe different inhibition patterns and or ii provide an inhibitor concentration lag i e inhibitor concentration range where no inhibition occurs the proposed threshold inhibition function equation 5 has an advantage over other empirical inhibition functions since it clearly identifies three key points of inhibition the inhibitor concentration where inhibition starts kimin the inhibitor concentration where inhibition is almost complete kimax and the ki50 i e the average between kimin and kimax importantly the results showed that threshold inhibition function was able to properly describe r2 0 99 the separate inhibition of nh3 and nh4 for three distinctive inocula under study see figs 1 and 3 and fig sii fig 5 highlights inhibition model differences from an application perspective predicted inhibition profiles are presented for the threshold and non competitive models best fit describing inhibition by nh3 and nh4 on the dpm test see section 3 1 and 3 2 the non competitive inhibition function displays a concave up decreasing curve that starts inhibiting as soon as the inhibitor is present while the threshold inhibition shows a sigmoidal curve once the inhibitor concentration exceeds the onset concentration kimin the non competitive inhibition pattern of inhibition predicted that concentrations as large as 500 mgnh3 n l 1 and 10000 mgnh4 n l 1 did not cause complete inhibition unlike what is observed in reality overall the fact that i inhibition started as soon as the inhibitor was present and that ii large inhibitor concentration did not cause complete inhibition contrary to experimental observation suggested that the non competitive inhibition function was inadequate to represent nh3 and nh4 inhibition in anaerobic systems the need for a more suitable inhibition function than the non competitive model for biostatic inhibitors is also evident when observing the inhibition profiles for sodium astals et al 2015 soto et al 1993b and potassium chen and cheng 2007 as stated by batstone et al 2015 the threshold inhibition function is an ideal candidate for use as a new standardised empirical equation for biostatic inhibition modelling including as illustrated above for nh3 and nh4 finally it is worth mentioning that the confidence intervals of model parameters kimin and kimax are related to the i number of observations ii positioning of the observations iii conformity to the model and iv inclusion of activity corrections to estimate nh3 and nh4 concentration since there was a good conformity between the experimental data and the model outputs the confidence intervals in table 2 could have been reduced by i conducting initial tests to identify the optimal positioning of the experimental conditions and or ii by increasing the number of concentrations tested 4 3 application and limitations of the free ammonia ammonium inhibition test method the developed methodology provides a better understanding of ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition by i differentiating between nh3 and nh4 inhibition and ii improving nh3 and nh4 inhibition modelling such information could be used to i evaluate the risk associated with ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition ii select and design mitigation strategies and iii determine inhibition tolerance prior to a process change that markedly increases tan in the digester e g loading rate co digestion pre treatment and recirculation however the developed method does not provide information about the mechanisms of inhibition nor does it foresee microbial acclimation capacity for example regarding the degradation pathway the method does not allow one to determine if acetate conversion into methane has been through acetoclastic methanogenesis or syntrophic acetate oxidation sao followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis nor if there is a degradation pathway shift as the nh3 and nh4 concentration changes despite these limitations the methodology can be applied to determine how a change in tan concentration is to be managed as well as to monitor changes in microbial inhibition resilience over time 5 conclusions a methodology has been developed and validated for assessing ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition experimental results showed that nh3 and nh4 inhibition needs to be jointly determined and that this can only be achieved by inhibition tests at various tan and ph values a smaller ph drift between the beginning and end of an inhibition test 1 5 days indicated that the use of separate salts nh4hco3 and nh4cl was preferred over nh4cl with ph adjustment results also showed that inoculum dilution below 10 gvs l 1 did not affect inhibition test outputs although excessive dilution is not recommended regarding inhibition modelling a threshold inhibition function proved to be more suitable than a non competitive inhibition function r2 0 99 and 0 70 respectively to quantify the distinct contributions of nh3 and nh4 to inhibition extent and inhibition pattern the key advantage of the proposed threshold inhibition function is its capacity to identify the inhibition lower limit concentration where inhibition starts kimin and upper limit concentration where inhibition is complete kimax an aspect that the non competitive model cannot represent acknowledgements this research was funded by the crc

19419,the recharge of reclaimed water is an effective strategy for addressing the issues of water quality deterioration and groundwater level decline simultaneously residual al coagulants are normally remained in the recovered water at low concentrations and may induce clogging problems during the recharging process however this issue has been ignored in the past in this study we investigated the mechanisms of al iii induced aquifer bio clogging the role of al iii in quartz sand media sio2 dissolution and re precipitation in the series of aquifer columns we determined that al iii resulted in serious clogging in 140 h at low concentrations that satisfied the national drinking water standard of china the corresponding hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than 90 in the bacteria containing aquifer which was 30 greater than that for the bacteria free trials the enhanced al iii related clogging was caused by modifying quartz sand to form si o al oh n and improving microbes attachment microbes retention kinetic coefficients k of the al recharged simulated aquifer could increase by 3 0 8 3 times the al iii also enhanced biomass production and clogging by binding to microbial extracellular polymeric substances in turn the greater amount of biomass accelerated the si dissolution and re precipitation this may potentially damage the stability of aquifer structure the results showed that reclaimed water treated with al coagulation should be employed with caution for recharging graphical abstract image 1 keywords recharge al coagulant biomass clogging quartz sand dissolving 1 introduction the deterioration of water quality and the decline in groundwater levels represent significant issues in water research it has been suggested that combining wastewater reclamation and subsurface aquifer storage may handle these issues simultaneously bouwer 1996 jódar abellán et al 2017 which is so called reclaimed water recharging aquifer clogging is the most serious operational issue of reclaimed water recharging which can result in a decline of the recharge flowrate and finally caused the site abandonment barry et al 2017 page et al 2014 pavelic et al 2007 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 the clogging is normally induced by the residual contamination in the recharged water such as suspended solids bouyer et al 2001 mccurdy et al 2004 wang et al 2009 chemical sedimentation cui et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 and the aggregation of bacteria cells page et al 2014 pavelic et al 2011 in this context the mechanisms are classified into physico chemical and biological clogging as a result of the irrecoverable accumulation of particulate matters and the production of bacterial biomass pavelic et al 2007 2011 siriwardene et al 2007 respectively in order to prolong the storage capacity chemically advanced treatment processes have to be applied for water recovery izbicki et al 2010 page et al 2014 coagulation is a very common and efficient method for water recovery in which the removal of suspended solids and the chemical oxygen demand cod can reach as much as 90 and 70 respectively cui et al 2016 siriwardene et al 2007 yan et al 2009 currently approximate 80 of water coagulation processes are based on aluminum coagulants sharp et al 2006 srinivasan et al 1999 particularly the al salts e g alcl3 aguilar et al 2002 zhao et al 2008 2009 these treated water inevitably contained some residual al coagulants even at low concentrations of 0 04 2 70 mg al l miller et al 1984 yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 during recharging al coagulants could potentially accelerated aquifer clogging due to its hydroxylation characteristics aqueous al iii could dissociate to trivalent ion i e al3 and then hydrolyzed into several highly positively charged species the mononuclear al a normally 1000 da the medium polynuclear al b 1000 3000 da and the precipitated colloidal species al c 3000 da duan and gregory 2003 matilainen et al 2010 yan et al 2009 while bacteria cells in an aquifer have an isoelectric point ranging from 2 to 4 which means they have a negative surface charge at the ph of most natural water 6 8 in ph as a result al iii might enhance the bacterial aggregation by neutralizing the negative charges on the cells surfaces wilen et al 2008 thereby causing a compression of the double electrical layers moreover the bacterial cell walls possess ionizable functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups scholl and harvey 1992 al iii may induce ion bridging with the extracellular polymeric substances and then reduce the interaction energy barrier between cells li et al 2012 it seems that the role of residual al coagulants in the promotion of biological clogging is of great interest theoretically bioclogging may lead to the issue of soluble silica releasing from the aquifer diatoms heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria in biofilms which attached to the quartz sand main composition of the aquifer may cause si dissolution by increasing the local ph values higher than 9 brehm et al 2005 in contrast the aluminum hydroxides themselves contribute to an increase in the precipitation of the soluble si because they break the precipitation dissolution equilibrium of si bennett and siegel 1987 duan and gregory 1998 finally the dissolute silica re precipitated with al iii might cause further clogging the al coagulants are the normal reactants for water recovery which are not yet been considered as contaminants for recharging the role of the residual al in the reclaimed water with regard to aquifer clogging is worth of notified in this work we tested the hypothesis that residual al coagulants in the reclaimed water could promote bio clogging and aquifer media quartz sand dissolution to simulate recharge of reclaimed water we employed a synthetic wastewater with al iii concentrations satisfying the national drinking water standard of us and china respectively to investigate the hydraulic conductivity the related clogging mechanisms and kinetics and si dissolution and precipitation during the recharging this study aims in providing insights and guidelines of the effects of residual al coagulant on reclaimed water recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand soil and microbes ultra pure quartz grains 99 9 sio2 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china have particles sizes in the

ika german for 4 h the quartz grains were packed into the column to simulate an aquifer with bacteria to identify the changes of hydraulic conductivity quartz grains irradiated with uv light overnight were used as the control bacteria free the synthetic reclaimed water was fed to the columns at the flow rate of 120 ml h a darcian velocity of 15 4 m d with a peristaltic pump bt100 1f langepump china resulting in a hydraulic residence time of 0 25 h this darcian velocity was similar to the reported practical aquifer sites rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 the columns were kept at 20 c in the absence of light the experiments were stopped at about 140 h when the columns were significantly clogged the contents of the most seriously clogging section in the column which was 30 mm above the inlet was collected homogenized for further analysis 2 4 experimental trials in this study we focused specifically on the effects of the al iii concentrations of 0 05 and 0 2 mg al l on clogging which are the highest limits in the national drinking water quality standards of china and the united states respectively the effects of 0 6 mg al l on clogging was also studied which was a typical al iii concentration in reclaimed water cui et al 2016 miller et al 1984 zhang et al 2016 the trials were developed for the bacteria containing and bacteria free aquifers to determine the role of al iii in

actcctacgggaggcagcag and r806 ggactachvgggtwtctaat primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna v3 v4 fragments 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated clogging caused by al iii al iii itself caused clogging as shown by al 0 05 al 0 2 and al 0 6 trials in fig 2 a it appeared that al iii concentration was positively related to the degree of clogging fig 2b revealed that the clogging substances were inorganic for the bacteria free trials and were probably the retained alumini containing compounds they were considered as the al iii hydrolysis products because the solubility of these products at the oxide water interface was much lower than those in the bulk water james and healy 1972 moreover the turbulence and velocity gradients in the pores and pore necks of the aquifer accelerated generation of the hydrolysis products solomentseva et al 2007 clogging became much more serious when the simulated aquifer contained microbes the hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than 90 in the bacteria containing aquifer which was almost 30 greater than those of bacteria free trials fig 2b showed that biomass contributed to clogging because of the presence of a considerable amount of biomass in the clogging substances the biomass was mainly composed by epss and cells guellil et al 2011 compared to b trial the biomass in the clogging substances increased by 21 23 and 80 when the al iii concentrations were 0 05 0 2 and 0 6 mg l respectively consistently the retained al iii increased by 29 1 45 2 and 91 8 in these trials respectively compared to the corresponding bacteria free trials this mutual promotion between microbes and al iii resulted from the neutralization and ion bridging among al iii and epss causing a reduction of energy barriers in aggregations li et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2006 wilen et al 2008 3 2 clogging mechanisms 3 2 1 modified quartz sand surface the xps and ftir spectra confirmed that the quartz sand surface was modified by al iii during recharging fig 3 showed that xps spectra of si 2p for the pure quartz sand exhibited only one peak at the binding energy be of 102 9 ev which was attributed to band si o buzaneva et al 2000 this was as expected because sio2 is the main component of pure quartz sand 99 9 it was noteworthy that a new peak appeared at the be of 103 7 ev for quartz sand after al iii recharging which was verified as al o bonds fig 3b buzaneva et al 2000 the o 1s and al 2p spectra further confirmed the formation of al o bonds after al iii recharging fig 3c f in comparison with pure quartz sand a new peak at 530 8 ev appeared in the o 1s spectrum and was attributed to the band of si o al biino and gröning 1998 except for the peaks located at 532 6 and 531 7 ev that were assigned to adventitious materials and si o si respectively fig 3 c d biino and gröning 1998 the band at 75 9 ev was associated with al o si in the al 2p spectra except for the band at 75 1 ev which was assigned to al o h fig 3 e f buzaneva et al 2000 chan 2015 the ftir spectra also exhibited obvious changes after al iii recharging figure s1 a new band at 790 cm 1 was observed in all the al iii recharged samples and it was indeed related to the stretching vibrations of the al o bonds clayden et al 1999 based on these results we confirmed that al iii modified the quartz sand surface by forming si o al bonds the zeta potential of quartz sand increased from 24 9 to 24 2 20 7 and 18 2 mv after al 0 05 0 2 0 6 mg l modification respectively this weakened the ability of quartz sand to electrically repel bacteria cells rusch et al 2010 and thus enhanced biofilm formation and bioclogging in the simulated aquifer a large number of bacterial cells adhered strongly to the quartz sand surface as shown in fig 4 such an effect of al modification on quartz sand is also feasible for other aquifer components such as soil from practical site and mixture of soil quartz sand 50 50 in w w their initial zeta potentials were 13 5 mv and 14 9 mv respectively and increased to 10 4 mv and 13 6 mv respectively after modification with 0 2 mg al l the modifications contributed to the above mentioned bioclogging the quartz sand surface originally consisted of a lot of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and was dominated by the negatively charged sio duval et al 2002 thus quartz sand electrically repelled bacterial cells and bacteria alone did not result in serious bio clogging fig 4a si o al in the modified quartz sand further formed si o al oh n due to al iii hydrolyzation wu et al 2007 and the increased positive charges on surface of the quartz sand favored microbes attachment on the sand surface see fig 4b 3 2 2 enhanced biomass production to understand the roles of al iii in the production of biomass the clogging substances were characterized in the ftir spectra fig 5 the peak at 1730 1735 cm 1 was attributed to carbonyl group of polysaccharides boulet et al 2007 the bands at 1637 and 1528 1531 cm 1 were assigned to proteins amide i and ii respectively it appeared that al iii stimulated the production of the extracellular substances and modified their characteristics above bands became stronger for the trials with al iii especially polysaccharides became much more dominant with al iii stimulation because the peak of 1730 1735 cm 1 was only appeared when al iii was stimulated fig 6 a further revealed that the extracellular polysaccharides production was stimulated by al iii higher al iii concentrations in the synthetic recharged water induced a high polysaccharide production polysaccharides were absolutely dominant in epss while extracellular protein amounts were incomparable with those of polysaccharides data not shown accordingly the bacterial species which were functionalized to produce more polysaccharides under the harmful condition became more abundant figure s3 such as rhizobiaceae bosea rhizobium holosporaceae breedveld and miller 1994 sadhu et al 2012 the excreted polysaccharides play an important role in neutralizing al iii toxicity albert and brown 2015 and stabilizing mature biofilm flemming and wingender 2010 our previous work showed that the al iii at a concentration of no more than 2 0 mg al l could stimulated bacterial cells growth which is a typical hormesis effect of toxic metal cui et al 2018 dead cells were distributed at the bottom of the al iii stimulated biofilm while activated cells embedded in the polysaccharides could be found at the top this supports our above results about the essential roles of polysaccharides in bio clogging which could glued the nearby planktonic cells and thus ensuring continuous biofilm growth the xps spectra of c 1s figure s4 confirmed the biochemical binding between the biomass and al iii the spectra of c 1s of the clogging flocs without al iii participation was fitted well with 4 peaks at binding energy be of 283 9 284 6 285 1 and 285 9 ev which were assigned to c h c c c c and c o respectively when the recharged water contained al iii the be of c o increased from 285 9 to 287 5 indicating the formation of c o al oh n pop georgievski et al 2015 thus the al polymers were bound to epss to enhance the biomass production and clogging 3 2 3 kinetics the kinetic experimental results are shown in figure s1 and fig 7 no al was detected in the effluent while br control regularly broke through the simulated aquifer column indicating a strong affinity of al with quartz sand this was consistent with the above mentioned results on quartz sand surface modification with al iii modification microbes became more easily attached to the quartz sands the microbes retention kinetic coefficients k increased noticeably with al iii dosages in comparison to the protocol without al iii modification k values increased 3 0 5 6 and 8 3 times for 0 05 0 2 and 0 6 mg al l trials respectively the trends of microbe retention kinetic coefficients were consistent with the changes observed for the hydraulic conductivity k the results showed revealed that enhanced al iii related clogging was caused by modifying quartz sand and the improved microbe attachment capability 3 3 si dissolution and re precipitation we tested the si dissolution from the simulated aquifer after al iii recharging by considering the occurrence of bio corrosion caused by biofilm formation si in the clogging substances was as high as 60 4 mg g and 119 5 mg g after 140 h of recharge for al 0 2 b and al 0 6 b respectively fig 8 a the amounts increased by 40 and 97 respectively in comparison with trial b fig 8a si dissolution was driven by biochemical reactions induced by biofilms because the si retention in bacteria free trials was negligible fig 8a tem eds analysis showed that the precipitated si mainly formed the floc like substances rather than in the bacterial cells indicating that al iii probably reacted with the soluble si fig 8b c and d the microbial activities and the generated microbial products increased the solubility of quartz sand and dissolute it to silicic acid biofilms could create a local shift in the ph to be high enough for quartz dissolution and so that resulted in the breakdown of silica in the quartz bennett and siegel 1987 brehm et al 2005 the xps and ftir analysis clarified the si precipitation mechanisms in the packing columns fig 9 a new peak with a be of 103 6 ev appeared in the xps spectrum of si 2p for the bacteria containing quartz b as compared to the control fig 2 this peak was attributed to the binding of the dissolved si with the epss produced by biofilm the be of the peak increased to 104 8 ev when the recharged water contained 0 2 mg al l al 0 2 b fig 8 b because al combined with the dissolved si buzaneva et al 2000 similarly the xps spectra of al 2p fig 9c showed an intensive peak at 76 9 ev assigned to a si al bond occurred for the trial al 0 2 b buzaneva et al 2000 in contrast only one peak attributed to al oh occurred at the be of 75 3 ev in the al 2p spectra of the sterilized al iii recharge trial al 0 2 consistently the ftir spectra demonstrated that the soluble si was precipitated by al iii fig 9d the pure quartz sand exhibited a peak at 1080 cm 1 that was attributed to si o si montarges pelletier et al 2005 and the clogging substances from trials al 0 2 and al 0 6 only exhibited al oh at 800 cm 1 clayden et al 1999 it was noteworthy that the clogging substances sampled from the trials al 0 2 b and al 0 6 b showed a strong peak of si o al at 1050 cm 1 montarges pelletier et al 2005 sekiguchi and ando 1983 when the system contained bacteria 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the impacts of al iii on aquifer clogging using al concentrations that satisfied the national drinking water standards al iii and its hydrolysis products could modify the quartz sand surface to form si o al oh n and increased the zeta potential of the sand from 24 9 mv to up to 18 2 mv this weakened the repulsive force between simulated aquifer and microbe so that the microbial retention coefficient increased by 3 0 8 3 times compared to the unmodified trial the retained al could also stimulate biomass production and thus further intensified the bio clogging the hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than 90 when recharging the synthetically reclaimed water included al in turn the clogged biomass dissolved si from the aquifer which was then precipitated in the blockage by forming si epss al compounds this implied that the destruction of the aquifer due to al iii recharging in summary

19419,the recharge of reclaimed water is an effective strategy for addressing the issues of water quality deterioration and groundwater level decline simultaneously residual al coagulants are normally remained in the recovered water at low concentrations and may induce clogging problems during the recharging process however this issue has been ignored in the past in this study we investigated the mechanisms of al iii induced aquifer bio clogging the role of al iii in quartz sand media sio2 dissolution and re precipitation in the series of aquifer columns we determined that al iii resulted in serious clogging in 140 h at low concentrations that satisfied the national drinking water standard of china the corresponding hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than 90 in the bacteria containing aquifer which was 30 greater than that for the bacteria free trials the enhanced al iii related clogging was caused by modifying quartz sand to form si o al oh n and improving microbes attachment microbes retention kinetic coefficients k of the al recharged simulated aquifer could increase by 3 0 8 3 times the al iii also enhanced biomass production and clogging by binding to microbial extracellular polymeric substances in turn the greater amount of biomass accelerated the si dissolution and re precipitation this may potentially damage the stability of aquifer structure the results showed that reclaimed water treated with al coagulation should be employed with caution for recharging graphical abstract image 1 keywords recharge al coagulant biomass clogging quartz sand dissolving 1 introduction the deterioration of water quality and the decline in groundwater levels represent significant issues in water research it has been suggested that combining wastewater reclamation and subsurface aquifer storage may handle these issues simultaneously bouwer 1996 jódar abellán et al 2017 which is so called reclaimed water recharging aquifer clogging is the most serious operational issue of reclaimed water recharging which can result in a decline of the recharge flowrate and finally caused the site abandonment barry et al 2017 page et al 2014 pavelic et al 2007 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 the clogging is normally induced by the residual contamination in the recharged water such as suspended solids bouyer et al 2001 mccurdy et al 2004 wang et al 2009 chemical sedimentation cui et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 and the aggregation of bacteria cells page et al 2014 pavelic et al 2011 in this context the mechanisms are classified into physico chemical and biological clogging as a result of the irrecoverable accumulation of particulate matters and the production of bacterial biomass pavelic et al 2007 2011 siriwardene et al 2007 respectively in order to prolong the storage capacity chemically advanced treatment processes have to be applied for water recovery izbicki et al 2010 page et al 2014 coagulation is a very common and efficient method for water recovery in which the removal of suspended solids and the chemical oxygen demand cod can reach as much as 90 and 70 respectively cui et al 2016 siriwardene et al 2007 yan et al 2009 currently approximate 80 of water coagulation processes are based on aluminum coagulants sharp et al 2006 srinivasan et al 1999 particularly the al salts e g alcl3 aguilar et al 2002 zhao et al 2008 2009 these treated water inevitably contained some residual al coagulants even at low concentrations of 0 04 2 70 mg al l miller et al 1984 yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 during recharging al coagulants could potentially accelerated aquifer clogging due to its hydroxylation characteristics aqueous al iii could dissociate to trivalent ion i e al3 and then hydrolyzed into several highly positively charged species the mononuclear al a normally 1000 da the medium polynuclear al b 1000 3000 da and the precipitated colloidal species al c 3000 da duan and gregory 2003 matilainen et al 2010 yan et al 2009 while bacteria cells in an aquifer have an isoelectric point ranging from 2 to 4 which means they have a negative surface charge at the ph of most natural water 6 8 in ph as a result al iii might enhance the bacterial aggregation by neutralizing the negative charges on the cells surfaces wilen et al 2008 thereby causing a compression of the double electrical layers moreover the bacterial cell walls possess ionizable functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups scholl and harvey 1992 al iii may induce ion bridging with the extracellular polymeric substances and then reduce the interaction energy barrier between cells li et al 2012 it seems that the role of residual al coagulants in the promotion of biological clogging is of great interest theoretically bioclogging may lead to the issue of soluble silica releasing from the aquifer diatoms heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria in biofilms which attached to the quartz sand main composition of the aquifer may cause si dissolution by increasing the local ph values higher than 9 brehm et al 2005 in contrast the aluminum hydroxides themselves contribute to an increase in the precipitation of the soluble si because they break the precipitation dissolution equilibrium of si bennett and siegel 1987 duan and gregory 1998 finally the dissolute silica re precipitated with al iii might cause further clogging the al coagulants are the normal reactants for water recovery which are not yet been considered as contaminants for recharging the role of the residual al in the reclaimed water with regard to aquifer clogging is worth of notified in this work we tested the hypothesis that residual al coagulants in the reclaimed water could promote bio clogging and aquifer media quartz sand dissolution to simulate recharge of reclaimed water we employed a synthetic wastewater with al iii concentrations satisfying the national drinking water standard of us and china respectively to investigate the hydraulic conductivity the related clogging mechanisms and kinetics and si dissolution and precipitation during the recharging this study aims in providing insights and guidelines of the effects of residual al coagulant on reclaimed water recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand soil and microbes ultra pure quartz grains 99 9 sio2 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china have particles sizes in the range of 355 500 μm prior to use the grains were pretreated according to the procedures described by johnson et al 1996 sonicated 40 khz in de ionized water for 30 min and then immersed in 0 1 m sodium dithionite na2s2o4 for 2 h to remove surface metallic compounds the grains were then soaked in 5 h2o2 for 3 h to remove organic impurities and were washed with de ionized water more than 3 times with a subsequent overnight soaking in 12 m hcl finally the cleaned grains were rinsed in deionized water and sonicated for a further 30 min soil was derived from a practical recharging reclaimed water site in changchun china the grain gradation was 0 05 2 mm 82 35 0 002 0 05 mm 16 44 and 0 002 mm 1 21 the microbes used in this study were obtained by rinsing the soil then they were enriched in a synthesized culture prior to inoculation the culture was composed of in mm 78 ch3coona 3h2o 57 nh4cl 1 6 k2po4 3h2o 0 2 mgso4 7h2o 0 06 cacl2 2h2o the enriched microbes were centrifuged and diluted with 0 02 m phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 2 to obtain a bacteria storing suspension with 108 cell ml od600 0 1 2 2 experimental setup the plexiglass aquifer simulated columns were 160 mm in height and 30 mm in internal diameter stainless screens 80 mesh were fixed at the bottom as a distributor and to support the quartz sands the porosity of the packing was evaluated by the ratio of the dry and wet weight difference and the bulk volume of the column the porosity of all columns was about 26 5 the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a manometer was connected to the column at its influent and effluent and at 30 mm 80 mm 130 mm and 160 mm from the bottom of the column to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity 2 3 synthetic reclaimed water and recharging procedures 2 3 1 synthetic reclaimed water the synthetic reclaimed water contained in mm 0 78 ch3coona 3h2o 0 57 nh4cl 0 016 k2hpo4 3h2o 0 2 mgso4 7h2o 0 06 cacl2 2h2o corresponding to a chemical oxygen demand cod of 25 mg l and contents of nh4 n and p of 4 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively the deionized water was used for making the synthetic water to avoid influence of other cations in water 200 mg l 0 02 nan3 was added to the synthetic water to inhibit the growth of microbes in the column for the bacteria free trial the synthetic water was free of bacteria 2 3 2 packing preparations and recharging procedures the bacteria storing suspension was mixed with the quartz grains according to a volume mass ratio of 10 ml g and homogenized using a tube roller roller 6 digital ika german for 4 h the quartz grains were packed into the column to simulate an aquifer with bacteria to identify the changes of hydraulic conductivity quartz grains irradiated with uv light overnight were used as the control bacteria free the synthetic reclaimed water was fed to the columns at the flow rate of 120 ml h a darcian velocity of 15 4 m d with a peristaltic pump bt100 1f langepump china resulting in a hydraulic residence time of 0 25 h this darcian velocity was similar to the reported practical aquifer sites rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 the columns were kept at 20 c in the absence of light the experiments were stopped at about 140 h when the columns were significantly clogged the contents of the most seriously clogging section in the column which was 30 mm above the inlet was collected homogenized for further analysis 2 4 experimental trials in this study we focused specifically on the effects of the al iii concentrations of 0 05 and 0 2 mg al l on clogging which are the highest limits in the national drinking water quality standards of china and the united states respectively the effects of 0 6 mg al l on clogging was also studied which was a typical al iii concentration in reclaimed water cui et al 2016 miller et al 1984 zhang et al 2016 the trials were developed for the bacteria containing and bacteria free aquifers to determine the role of al iii in bio clogging desired concentrations of alcl3 6h2o were supplemented as al iii tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china as required different concentrations of al iii were prepared in the synthetic reclaimed water which were recharged respectively to bacteria containing b al 0 05 b al 0 2 b al 0 6 b and the bacteria free pure water al 0 05 al 0 2 al 0 6 quartz grains columns as shown

caused clogging as shown by al 0 05 al 0 2 and al 0 6 trials in fig 2 a it appeared that al iii concentration was positively related to the degree of clogging fig 2b revealed that the clogging substances were inorganic for the bacteria free trials and were probably the retained alumini containing compounds they were considered as the al iii hydrolysis products because the solubility of these products at the oxide water interface was much lower than those in the bulk water james and healy 1972 moreover the turbulence and velocity gradients in the pores and pore necks of the aquifer accelerated generation of the hydrolysis products solomentseva et al 2007 clogging became much more serious when the simulated aquifer contained microbes the hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than 90 in the bacteria containing aquifer which was almost 30 greater than those of bacteria free trials fig 2b showed that biomass contributed to clogging because of the presence of a considerable amount of biomass in the clogging substances the biomass was mainly composed by epss and cells guellil et al 2011 compared to b trial the biomass in the clogging substances increased by 21 23 and 80 when the al iii concentrations were 0 05 0 2 and 0 6 mg l respectively consistently the retained al iii increased by 29 1 45 2 and 91 8 in these trials respectively compared to the corresponding bacteria free trials this mutual promotion between microbes and al iii resulted from the neutralization and ion bridging among al iii and epss causing a reduction of energy barriers in aggregations li et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2006 wilen et al 2008 3 2 clogging mechanisms 3 2 1 modified quartz sand surface the xps and ftir spectra confirmed that the quartz sand surface was modified by al iii during recharging fig 3 showed that xps spectra of si 2p for the pure quartz sand exhibited only one peak at the binding energy be of 102 9 ev which was attributed to band si o buzaneva et al 2000 this was as expected because sio2 is the main component of pure quartz sand 99 9 it was noteworthy that a new peak appeared at the be of 103 7 ev for quartz sand after al iii recharging which was verified as al o bonds fig 3b buzaneva et al 2000 the o 1s and al 2p spectra further confirmed the formation of al o bonds after al iii recharging fig 3c f in comparison with pure quartz sand a new peak at 530 8 ev appeared in the o 1s spectrum and was attributed to the band of si o al biino and gröning 1998 except for the peaks located at 532 6 and 531 7 ev that were assigned to adventitious materials and si o si respectively fig 3 c d biino and gröning 1998 the band at 75 9 ev was associated with al o si in the al 2p spectra except for the band at 75 1 ev which was assigned to al o h fig 3 e f buzaneva et al 2000 chan 2015 the ftir spectra also exhibited obvious changes after al iii recharging figure s1 a new band at 790 cm 1 was observed in all the al iii recharged samples and it was indeed related to the stretching vibrations of the al o bonds clayden et al 1999 based on these results we confirmed that al iii modified the quartz sand surface by forming si o al bonds the zeta potential of quartz sand increased from 24 9 to 24 2 20 7 and 18 2 mv after al 0 05 0 2 0 6 mg l modification respectively this weakened the ability of quartz sand to electrically repel bacteria cells rusch et al 2010 and thus enhanced biofilm formation and bioclogging in the simulated aquifer a large number of bacterial cells adhered strongly to the quartz sand surface as shown in fig 4 such an effect of al modification on quartz sand is also feasible for other aquifer components such as soil from practical site and mixture of soil quartz sand 50 50 in w w their initial zeta potentials were 13 5 mv and 14 9 mv respectively and increased to 10 4 mv and 13 6 mv respectively after modification with 0 2 mg al l the modifications contributed to the above mentioned bioclogging the quartz sand surface originally consisted of a lot of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and was dominated by the negatively charged sio duval et al 2002 thus quartz sand electrically repelled bacterial cells and bacteria alone did not result in serious bio clogging fig 4a si o al in the modified quartz sand further formed si o al oh n due to al iii hydrolyzation wu et al 2007 and the increased positive charges on surface of the quartz sand favored microbes attachment on the sand surface see fig 4b 3 2 2 enhanced biomass production to understand the roles of al iii in the production of biomass the clogging substances were characterized in the ftir spectra fig 5 the peak at 1730 1735 cm 1 was attributed to carbonyl group of polysaccharides boulet et al 2007 the bands at 1637 and 1528 1531 cm 1 were assigned to proteins amide i and ii respectively it appeared that al iii stimulated the production of the extracellular substances and modified their characteristics above bands became stronger for the trials with al iii especially polysaccharides became much more dominant with al iii stimulation because the peak of 1730 1735 cm 1 was only appeared when al iii was stimulated fig 6 a further revealed that the extracellular polysaccharides production was stimulated by al iii higher al iii concentrations in the synthetic recharged water induced a high polysaccharide production polysaccharides were absolutely dominant in epss while extracellular protein amounts were incomparable with those of polysaccharides data not shown accordingly the bacterial species which were functionalized to produce more polysaccharides under the harmful condition became more abundant figure s3 such as rhizobiaceae bosea rhizobium holosporaceae breedveld and miller 1994 sadhu et al 2012 the excreted polysaccharides play an important role in neutralizing al iii toxicity albert and brown 2015 and stabilizing mature biofilm flemming and wingender 2010 our previous work showed that the al iii at a concentration of no more than 2 0 mg al l could stimulated bacterial cells growth which is a typical hormesis effect of toxic metal cui et al 2018 dead cells were distributed at the bottom of the al iii stimulated biofilm while activated cells embedded in the polysaccharides could be found at the top this supports our above results about the essential roles of polysaccharides in bio clogging which could glued the nearby planktonic cells and thus ensuring continuous biofilm growth the xps spectra of c 1s figure s4 confirmed the biochemical binding between the biomass and al iii the spectra of c 1s of the clogging flocs without al iii participation was fitted well with 4 peaks at binding energy be of 283 9 284 6 285 1 and 285 9 ev which were assigned to c h c c c c and c o respectively when the recharged water contained al iii the be of c o increased from 285 9 to 287 5 indicating the formation of c o al oh n pop georgievski et al 2015 thus the al polymers were bound to epss to enhance the biomass production and clogging 3 2 3 kinetics the kinetic experimental results are shown in figure s1 and fig 7 no al was detected in the effluent while br control regularly broke through the simulated aquifer column indicating a strong affinity of al with quartz sand this was consistent with the above mentioned results on quartz sand surface modification with al iii modification microbes became more easily attached to the quartz sands the microbes retention kinetic coefficients k increased noticeably with al iii dosages in comparison to the protocol without al iii modification k values increased 3 0 5 6 and 8 3 times for 0 05 0 2 and 0 6 mg al l trials respectively the trends of microbe retention kinetic coefficients were consistent with the changes observed for the hydraulic conductivity k the results showed revealed that enhanced al iii related clogging was caused by modifying quartz sand and the improved microbe attachment capability 3 3 si dissolution and re precipitation we tested the si dissolution from the simulated aquifer after al iii recharging by considering the occurrence of bio corrosion caused by biofilm formation si in the clogging substances was as high as 60 4 mg g and 119 5 mg g after 140 h of recharge for al 0 2 b and al 0 6 b respectively fig 8 a the amounts increased by 40 and 97 respectively in comparison with trial b fig 8a si dissolution was driven by biochemical reactions induced by biofilms because the si retention in bacteria free trials was negligible fig 8a tem eds analysis showed that the precipitated si mainly formed the floc like substances rather than in the bacterial cells indicating that al iii probably reacted with the soluble si fig 8b c and d the microbial activities and the generated microbial products increased the solubility of quartz sand and dissolute it to silicic acid biofilms could create a local shift in the ph to be high enough for quartz dissolution and so that resulted in the breakdown of silica in the quartz bennett and siegel 1987 brehm et al 2005 the xps and ftir analysis clarified the si precipitation mechanisms in the packing columns fig 9 a new peak with a be of 103 6 ev appeared in the xps spectrum of si 2p for the bacteria containing quartz b as compared to the control fig 2 this peak was attributed to the binding of the dissolved si with the epss produced by biofilm the be of the peak increased to 104 8 ev when the recharged water contained 0 2 mg al l al 0 2 b fig 8 b because al combined with the dissolved si buzaneva et al 2000 similarly the xps spectra of al 2p fig 9c showed an intensive peak at 76 9 ev assigned to a si al bond occurred for the trial al 0 2 b buzaneva et al 2000 in contrast only one peak attributed to al oh occurred at the be of 75 3 ev in the al 2p spectra of the sterilized al iii recharge trial al 0 2 consistently the ftir spectra demonstrated that the soluble si was precipitated by al iii fig 9d the pure quartz sand exhibited a peak at 1080 cm 1 that was attributed to si o si montarges pelletier et al 2005 and the clogging substances from trials al 0 2 and al 0 6 only exhibited al oh at 800 cm 1 clayden et al 1999 it was noteworthy that the clogging substances sampled from the trials al 0 2 b and al 0 6 b showed a strong peak of si o al at 1050 cm 1 montarges pelletier et al 2005 sekiguchi and ando 1983 when the system contained bacteria 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the impacts of al iii on aquifer clogging using al concentrations that satisfied the national drinking water standards al iii and its hydrolysis products could modify the quartz sand surface to form si o al oh n and increased the zeta potential of the sand from 24 9 mv to up to 18 2 mv this weakened the repulsive force between simulated aquifer and microbe so that the microbial retention coefficient increased by 3 0 8 3 times compared to the unmodified trial the retained al could also stimulate biomass production and thus further intensified the bio clogging the hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than 90 when recharging the synthetically reclaimed water included al in turn the clogged biomass dissolved si from the aquifer which was then precipitated in the blockage by forming si epss al compounds this implied that the destruction of the aquifer due to al iii recharging in summary we suggest that reclaimed water treated with al coagulation should be employed with caution for recharging acknowledgement the authors wish to thank the national natural science foundation of china
