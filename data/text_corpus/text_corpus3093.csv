15465,the water quality long term prediction is essential to water environment management decisions in recent years although water quality prediction methods based on deep learning have achieved excellent performance in short term prediction these methods are unsuitable for long term prediction because the accumulation use of short term prediction will easily introduce noise furthermore the long term prediction task requires a large amount of data to train the model to obtain accurate prediction results for some monitoring stations with limited historical data it is challenging to fully exploit the performance of deep learning models to this end we introduce a transfer learning framework into water quality prediction to improve the prediction performance in data constrained scenarios we propose a deep transfer learning based on transformer tlt model to enable time dependency perception and facilitate long term water quality prediction in tlt we innovatively introduce a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method which can transfer the knowledge learned from source monitoring stations to the target station while preventing the deep learning model from overfitting the source data during the pre training phase so tlt can fully exert the performance of deep learning models with limited samples we conduct experiments on data from 120 monitoring stations in major rivers and lakes in china to verify the effectiveness of tlt the results show that tlt can effectively improve the long term prediction accuracy of four water quality indicators ph do nh 3 n and cod m n from monitoring stations with limited samples keywords water quality prediction transformer transfer learning deep leaning stations with limited samples 1 introduction surface water is a valuable resource for human survival which is as fragile and non renewable however with the development of human industrialization and urbanization the ecological environment is increasingly destroyed the continuously polluted and deteriorating surface water environment poses a serious threat to human health vörösmarty et al 2010 in addition the deterioration of the surface water environment also aggravates the seriousness of the above problems sun et al 2016 therefore it is essential to monitor and predict surface water quality accurately and timely which contributes to early pollution warnings the water quality prediction task shows that we need to use some historical environmental indicators to provide an early warning of future environmental pollution ghahramani 2015 however due to the nonlinearity and non stationarity of water quality data it is difficult to predict future water quality indicator values accurately artificial intelligence ai technology provides a potential direction for solving water quality prediction problems more and more fields have been beginning to apply ai technology to benefit our life baek et al 2021 grigorescu et al 2020 gu et al 2021 it has also been successfully applied in the field of hydrological monitoring chen et al 2020 in particular research on water quality prediction based on deep learning is gradually emerging solanki et al 2015 thai nghe et al 2020 tung et al 2020 because deep neural networks dnn with excellent nonlinear approximation ability can fit arbitrary continuous functions although the multilayer perceptron mlp neural network can be used for water quality prediction due to its generality to different tasks banejad and olyaie 2011 chang et al 2010 its network structure is not especially good at capturing high dimensional time dependent features of water quality time series data because recurrent neural network rnn is good at capturing high dimensional time dependent patterns of water quality time series data researchers turned to rnn for water quality prediction li et al 2019a jiang et al 2021 successfully predicted fat oil and grease fog content in sewers based on gated recurrent unit gru network the long short term memory lstm network has also been used successfully for water quality prediction hu et al 2019 because lstm can mitigate the vanishing gradient problem of the rnn pulver and lyu 2017 bidirectional lstm bilstm can further improve the water quality prediction accuracy by learning forward and reverse temporal dependencies zou et al 2020 although the lstm model is good at dealing with time series prediction when the sequence length of water quality is long enough the lstm is prone to forgetting long term dependent information and the long term prediction accuracy is reduced yu et al 2019 yang et al 2021 proposed a hybrid cnn lstm model with attention mechanism cla which combines the advantages of three neural network structures to improve the prediction accuracy in which convolutional neural network cnn can capture local features of time series when its convolution layer is modified to 1 d convolution zhao et al 2017 however this hybrid model still suffers from the inherent flaws of the lstm network structure the attention mechanism of the transformer model can directly connect two arbitrary positions in the time series and strengthen or weaken the connection unlike lstm based models transformer models are more flexible in capturing time dependency patterns this has been verified in runoff forecasting yin et al 2022 another problem with these water quality prediction models is that they only make predictions for the next time step and cannot reflect long term trends in water quality obviously the long term multiple time steps prediction of multiple water quality variables is more conducive to water environment management decisions and early warning of pollution in addition although the excellent performance of the above deep learning models in the field of water quality prediction these models require a lot of water quality data for training to achieve optimal model parameters on the practical side the deployment of deep neural network water quality prediction models suffers from the limited sample of water quality data at some monitoring stations the tabula rasa deep neural networks should be trained on a large water quality dataset before providing useful water quality variable prediction output individual water quality monitoring stations usually require a lengthy data collection process because only after enough water quality data is collected can it be used to train the deep neural network so as to get the accurate prediction value of water quality variables of the corresponding station this clearly increases the time cost of deploying deep neural networks at water quality monitoring stations transfer learning can solve the problem of limited data of target stations because it can pre train the deep learning model using a rich source domain dataset and fine tune the pre trained model on the target domain dataset minami et al 2021 weiss et al 2016 transfer learning has been extensively studied in other fields lv et al 2019 transferred the model learned from urban areas to predict air quality in rural areas ma et al 2020 transferred the bi lstm model trained based on the existing stations to the air quality prediction task at the new station it is also used to address the data scarcity problem of traffic flow prediction and national exchange rate prediction ye and dai 2022 inspired by these research for target stations with limited data samples we can utilize water quality data collected at other stations in recent years the china national environmental monitoring center has deployed a large number of automatic water quality monitoring stations in lakes and rivers across the country collecting a large amount of water quality data available for analysis chen et al 2020 which can form a rich source domain dataset we can effectively use these valuable data to pre train deep learning models extract general hidden knowledge variation patterns of surface water quality indicators and apply it to the target stations water quality prediction this transfer learning method can effectively reduce the data collection time cost of deploying deep learning models in monitoring stations and solve the problem of limited data in monitoring stations in the field of water quality prediction although the combination of deep learning models and transfer learning has been successfully applied in other fields its application to water quality prediction still faces two major challenges in the complex scenario of the long term prediction task of multiple water quality indicators the lstm based models easily lose the long term dependence pattern of water quality data in the process of transfer learning due to its gated structure so it is difficult to obtain high multi time step prediction accuracy which is not conducive to the early warning of water pollution in the pre training stage of traditional transfer learning methods the deep learning model is prone to overfitting the source domain data which leads to more noise in the general hidden knowledge transfer process at the same time the increase of noise during the fine tuning stage interferes with adapting the deep learning model to the target domain data reducing the effect of transfer learning to tackle the above two challenges we adopt the self attention mechanism and encoder decoder structure of the transformer neural network model to learn the long term dependence patterns and innovatively propose a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework to mitigate model overfitting finally they form a transfer learning based on transformer tlt model our work has the following four contributions to the best of our knowledge we are the first to explore the state of the art performance of transformer neural network models in the field of water quality prediction we propose a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method to solve the problem of limited data from monitoring stations when we deploy deep learning models this method can prevent the deep learning model from overfitting the source domain data in the pre training stage which helps the model adapt to the water quality data of the target station the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method is a model independent water quality prediction framework that can be combined with other deep learning models this paper verifies the state of the art performance of the tlt model in complex scenarios of long term prediction of multiple water quality indicators through experiments 2 materials and data preprocessing 2 1 study area and water quality data in this study the raw data were collected weekly data from 120 automatic water quality monitoring stations in national major rivers and lakes from china national environmental monitoring centre from 2013 to 2016 http www mee gov cn hjzl shj dbszdczb after preprocessing we retained water quality data for 110 consecutive weeks from january 2013 to february 2015 among these monitoring stations the pearl river basin has 8 monitoring stations the yangtze river basin has 22 monitoring stations the songhua river basin has 11 monitoring stations the liaohe river basin has 7 monitoring stations the yellow river basin has 12 monitoring stations the huaihe river basin has 26 monitoring stations haihe river basin has 6 monitoring stations taihu lake basin has 6 monitoring stations poyang lake basin has four monitoring stations the rest of the large lakes and rivers include a total of 18 water quality indicators are usually divided into biological indicators chemical indicators and physical indicators tchobanoglous and schroeder 1985 the biological indicators contain fecal coliforms algae and so on the chemical indicators include dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh 3 n and the physical indicators cover hydrogen ion concentration ph temperature turbidity etc wu et al 2014 water environmental conditions are often the result of the synergistic effect of multiple key water quality indicators and several other environmental factors wilhm and dorris 1968 in the study of water quality prediction scholars choose important indicators that can reflect the quality of the water environment the most common indicators are ph do nh 3 n and cod m n zou et al 2020 the lower ph value reflects that the water body may suffer from acid pollution and nh 3 n is an indicator of water eutrophication ahmed et al 2019 therefore a single water quality indicator is insufficient to fully reflect the status quo of the water environment chen et al 2020 also shows that ph do cod m n and nh 3 n are key indicators for water quality prediction so we select these four key water quality indicators to construct a water quality prediction model 2 2 data preprocessing a small number of missing data problems exist in the original dataset due to sensor abnormalities or other factors the water quality time series does not change drastically if no sudden events such as rainfall or pollution occur within a short time interval besides yang et al 2021 show that linear interpolation can be used to fill in specific missing values without affecting the deep learning model to learn water quality change patterns therefore we complemented the missing values in the dataset using a linear interpolation algorithm the linear interpolation function can be constructed as follows 1 y t y l y r y l t l r l where y t is the missing value of the water quality variable y l denotes the nearest known observations of water quality variables before y t and y r denotes the nearest known data after y t t l and r are the temporal indexes of the observed values after completing the missing values by linear interpolation the dataset has 52 800 observations furthermore throughout the entire completion dataset ph do cod m n and nh 3 n ranged from 5 79 to 9 70 0 02 to 25 70 0 10 to 57 50 and 0 01 to 22 30 respectively subgraph a of fig 1 in order to address the comparability of different indicators in water quality monitoring data and make the feature space of the data more regular we used z score standardization for the water quality indicators at each monitoring station barboza et al 2017 subgraph b of fig 1 for each monitoring station z score standardization is performed on different water quality indicators using the corresponding training data set to keep the four indicators with the same degree of influence on the model prediction results the dataset of the source domain monitoring station is standardized using the mean and standard deviation of the entire dataset and the dataset of the target domain monitoring station is standardized using only the mean and standard deviation of the training data 3 methodology our proposed tlt framework consists of three main parts shown in fig 2 time series samples generation water quality time dependency aware prediction and recurrent fine tuning transfer learning it starts by generating time series samples of normalized water quality data using a sliding window approach then water quality time dependency aware prediction method is proposed based on the transformer network finally the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method is proposed to transfer knowledge a k a prediction model from source monitoring stations to the target station 3 1 time series samples generation the collected and standardized water quality data still cannot be directly fed to the model for training because the data need to be transformed into samples and labels that the model could identify we use a sliding window approach to transform the data to facilitate model training and prediction sliding window aims at constructing new observation samples using time series data of consecutive observations brockwell and davis 2002 to predict the time series value at time t the sliding window feeds the value at time t 1 t 2 t δ t to the model δ t is defined as the sliding window size more specifically we use the sliding window method to generate new observation samples and labels for water quality data as follows 1 for the time series data collected after n observations at a monitoring station set the sliding window size as t under this sliding window size setting we have the input x t x 1 t x t t x i t r d x at time t where d x 4 denotes x i t contains four water quality indicator values ph do cod m n and nh 3 n 2 set a forecast horizon h the forecast horizon depends on the application and periodicity of the data the output is the corresponding future sequence y t y 1 t y h t y i t r d y where 1 d y 4 3 setting the number of increments between consecutive sliding windows to 1 time step the time series data of a single monitoring station can be divided into m n t h 1 time series samples samples within the sliding window size t are the model input and samples involved in the forecast horizon h are the labels or targets 3 2 water quality time dependency aware prediction the transformer mainly has three parts position encoding self attention mechanism and encoder decoder structure the temporal feature encoding is more suitable when the transformer is applied to time series forecasting li et al 2019b zhou et al 2021 so we replace the original positional encoding with fine grained timestamp feature encoding to achieve water quality time dependency aware prediction the fine grained timestamp features include four features the year month quarter and week it s encoding thus has periodic information in multiple temporal dimensions in water quality prediction scenarios the self attention mechanism can capture long term and short term dependency patterns from historical water quality data furthermore in transformer s encoder decoder structure the encoder extracts high dimensional spatial representations of long term and short term dependency patterns of water quality data and the decoder uses these representations to predict future water quality 3 2 1 self attention mechanism for learning time dependent patterns of water quality data accurate long term water quality prediction requires the model to learn long term and short term dependence patterns of water quality data the self attention mechanism captures long term and short term dependencies by computing attention scores at different time steps meanwhile different attention heads focus on time dependent patterns at different periods canonical self attention in vaswani et al 2017 is described as mapping a query and a set of key value pairs to an output the output is computed as a weighted sum of values where the weight assigned to each value is computed by the query s compatibility function with the corresponding key in the multi head self attention layer original input x t r t d x is transformed into embedding x e m b r t d by linear projection and then simultaneously transformed to h distinct query matrices q i x e m b w i q key matrices k i x e m b w i k and value matrices v i x e m b w i v respectively where h denotes the number of heads d denotes the dimension of the input in the embedding space i 1 h w i q r d d q w i k r d d k and w i v r d d v are learnable parameters after these linear projections the multi head dot product attention computes a sequence of vector outputs in parallel this concated output includes the long term and short term dependence features of the time series the specific formulas are as follows 2 a t t e n t i o n q i k i v i s o f t m a x q i k i t d k m v i 3 h e a d i a t t e n t i o n q i k i v i 4 m u l t i h e a d c o n c a t e h e a d i h e a d h w o where the parameter matric w o r h d v d represents h e a d 1 h e a d h are concatenated and linearly projected again note that a mask matrix m is applied to filter out rightward attention by setting all upper triangular elements to to avoid future information leakage 3 2 2 water quality time dependency feature encoder the encoder is designed to learn high dimensional representations of water quality time series inputs which facilitates the self attention layer in the encoder to extract long term and short term dependency patterns we use a standard encoder structure in fig 3 the encoder input x e n x t is linearly transformed to obtain an embedded representation and then timestamp encoding is added the formula is as follows 5 x e m b x e n w e t i m e s t a m p w e t where weight matrix w e w e t r d x d d 512 x e n r t d x t i m e s t a m p y e a r q u a r t e r m o n t h w e e k the four fine grained features of t i m e s t a m p are normalized separately in advance and then converted into high dimensional space representation through linear projection thus the t i m e s t a m p allows the model to identify the temporal position of each unit in the sequence helping the model to learn the long term and short term dependent patterns of water quality data after the input representation the sequence input x e n r t d x is linearly projected as a matrix x e m b r t d the encoder is composed of n 3 identical layers each layer has two sublayers the first is a multi head self attention mechanism and the second is a simple position wise fully connected feed forward network we employ a residual connection around each of the two sublayers followed by layer normalization therefore the formulas for the encoder layer are as follows 6 x a t t l a y e r n o r m x e m b m u l i t i h e a d x e m b 7 o e n l a y e r n o r m x a t t f f n x a t t where x a t t o e n r t d ffn denotes fully connected feed forward network which consists of two linear transformations with a relu activation in between 8 f f n x m a x 0 x w 1 b 1 w 2 b 2 where w 1 w 2 are weight matrices b 1 b 2 are the bias items finally the encoder outputs an embedding representation o e n of water quality data in a high dimensional space which contains time dependent features and can be used as an intermediate input to the decoder to help it make predictions 3 2 3 decoder for regression prediction of water quality data with timestamp the encoder only outputs high dimensional space representations of water quality time series data and cannot directly output prediction results therefore we need to parse these high dimensional space representations with a decoder to obtain the implicit long term and short term dependency patterns and use it for regression prediction of future water quality as shown in fig 3 the input of transformer decoder x d e contains both the x t o k e n r t 2 d y and x 0 r h d y 9 x d e c o n c a t e x t o k e n x 0 where x d e r t 2 h d y x t o k e n is the second half of the sequence of x e n and x 0 is the part of the sequence to be predicted filled with 0 moreover we also add timestamp encoding to the embedding representation of the decoder input x d e to facilitate the decoder extracting the temporal location information of the water quality data 10 y e m b x d e w d t i m e s t a m p w d t where x d e and t i m e s t a m p are both linearly transformed and then summed to obtain the embedding space representation y e m b r t 2 h d linear transformation matrixs are w d w d t r d y d respectively the decoder is also composed of m 3 identical layers similar to the encoder still it has a third sublayer that performs multi head attention to the output of the encoder stack inserted between two sublayers with the latent hidden variable o e n from the encoder the equations of l th decoder layer can be summarized as o d e l d e c o d e r o d e l 1 o e n where o d e 0 y e m b the decoder can be formalized as follows 11 y a t t l 1 l a y e r n o r m o d e l 1 m u l i t i h e a d o d e l 1 12 y a t t l 2 l a y e r n o r m y a t t l 1 m u l i t i h e a d y a t t l 1 o e n 13 o d e l l a y e r n o r m y a t t l 2 f f n y a t t l 2 where o d e l l 1 m denotes the output of l th decoder layer y e m b l i i 1 2 represents the embedding space representation after the i th muli head attention module computation in the l th layer respectively after the linear transformation of the fully connected layer the output o d e m of the stacked encoder is finally projected to the sequence with the same dimension as the x d e and the predicted part in this sequence is the output of the entire transformer model 3 3 recurrent fine tuning transfer learning traditional transfer learning methods based on advanced deep learning techniques aim to reuse the model developed for the source task as the initial model for the target task which has solved the problem of limited data in the target domain ma et al 2019 however it is not fully applicable in the field of water quality prediction because in the pre training stage the deep learning model is prone to overfitting to the source domain data which leads to the introduction of noise during knowledge transfer the noise interferes with the adaptation of the model to the target domain in the fine tuning stage thus reducing the prediction accuracy to address this overfitting problem we propose a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method fig 2 shows the workflow of the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method in tlt its basic idea includes two stages pre training stage and fine tuning stage two tasks source task and target task and two datasets source domain dataset and target domain dataset since there is a certain connection between the source task and the target task the model can run alternately in the source task and the target task we pretrain the transformer model on the source dataset for one epoch and keep the model parameters and then fine tune the model on the target dataset for one epoch back to the source task this cycle runs for multiple epochs until convergence so that model parameters are shared between the source and target tasks for more efficient knowledge transfer firstly the model training process for each epoch is divided into a pre training phase and a fine tuning phase in the pre training phase the rich source domain data of existing stations are packaged into batches according to batch size and each batch trains the model once when all batches have trained the model the pre training phase of the current epoch is completed and fine tuning begins in the fine tuning stage the model parameters are fine tuned to accommodate the target task using target domain data from the target station in addition after the fine tuning of the current epoch is completed an early stop mechanism is introduced to determine whether the model returns to the source task for the next epoch training the early stop mechanism is that when the loss function value mse of the fine tuned model in the current epoch is better than the optimal loss function value the optimal model parameters are saved the optimal loss function value is updated and then the pre training and fine tuning of the next epoch is performed if the loss function value of the fine tuned model for three consecutive epochs is worse than the optimal value the recurrent transfer learning is stopped and the optimal model is returned this process recurrents continuously making the transformer model parameters iteratively update until convergence in such recurrent fine tuning transfer learning not only the general knowledge and features learned from other existing stations are preserved but the model can be tuned to the target station to prevent overfitting to the source task after obtaining the target model after multiple rounds of knowledge transfer the model is then tested using the data from the target station to output water quality prediction results 3 4 overall algorithm of tlt algorithm 1 describes the process of the water quality prediction algorithm based on tlt in pseudocode we divide the data of the target monitoring stations into the target dataset d t and the test dataset d t and use other monitoring stations as the source dataset d s therefore d s has a different data distribution than d t but d t has the same distribution as d t f θ represents the transformer model function and θ denotes the updatable parameters of the model θ represents the parameters of the target model converged after recurrent fine tuning transfer learning earlystop is an early stopping mechanism which can stop training early to prevent the model from deviating from the data distribution of the target domain 4 experiment 4 1 datasets as shown in table 1 the dataset used in this experiment contains 120 monitoring stations and each station records water quality indicators ph do cod m n and nh 3 n and time once a week so the dataset features are four water quality indicators and timestamp moreover 52 800 water quality indicators are observed in the dataset and the sequence length of water quality indicators for each monitoring station is 110 table 2 shows the distribution of monitoring stations in different basins in china and the corresponding number of water quality observations 4 2 metrics in this study we use two commonly used evaluation indicators to evaluate the predictive performance of transformer and other benchmark models they are mean square error mse and mean absolute error mae calculations of these two metrics are shown in eqs 14 15 14 m s e 1 n h i 1 n j 1 h y i j y i j 2 15 m a e 1 n h i 1 n j 1 h y i j y i j where n represents the number of water quality data samples h indicates the predicted time range and y i j represents the observations of the jth predicted time step of the ith sample y i j represents the corresponding predicted values lower values of these two indicators mean higher prediction accuracy and better performance of the model 4 3 experiment settings the detailed software and hardware environment of this experiment is introduced as follows the experiments use pycharm as the python integrated development environment all codes are written in python 3 6 and called various packages and all deep learning models are built through the pytorch 1 9 0 framework in addition the hardware environment includes cpu i7 8750h and gpu gtx 1080 after applying the sliding window method to construct the historical data of 120 water quality stations as samples we take the samples of 90 stations as the source domain dataset and the samples of the other 30 stations as the target domain dataset as shown in table 3 we divided the six rivers and two lakes with the highest number of monitoring stations into the source domain and the rest as the target domain the others class contains 14 monitoring stations across rivers and 4 monitoring stations in different lakes which are suitable as target domains we take all the samples in the source domain dataset as pre training data some samples in the target domain dataset as the training set and the rest as the test set the training test division ratio in the target domain dataset belongs to 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 we first set a breakpoint on the time series according to the ratio and then use a sliding window to generate samples in chronological order the samples generated before the breakpoint are the training set and the samples generated after the breakpoint are the test set the smaller the ratio the more serious the problem of limited data samples in monitoring stations to verify the performance of the transformer model we compared it with five other baseline deep learning algorithms including multilayer perceptron mlp heddam 2016 convolutional neural network cnn barzegar et al 2020 lstm liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 bidirectional lstm bi lstm zou et al 2020 and hybrid cnn lstm model with attention cla yang et al 2021 in this study the hyperparameters and network structure of these baseline models are optimized based on water quality multi task learning and prediction therefore all models predict four water quality indicators simultaneously all the models compared are as follows mlp model there are two fully connected layers each containing a linear layer a relu activation function and a dropout layer applied with a dropout rate of 0 05 the two layers hidden neurons are 256 and 128 respectively the last layer is the linear output layer cnn model there is a convolutional layer a fully connected layer and finally a linear output layer the convolutional layer has 64 filters and a kernel size of 3 the fully connected layer has 64 hidden neurons and the activation function is the relu function lstm model this model consists of an lstm layer a fully connected layer and a linear output layer the lstm layer has 128 hidden neurons with a dropout rate of 0 05 the fully connected layer also has 128 neurons and the activation function is the relu activation function bi lstm model this model consists of two inverted lstm layers stacked together then goes through two fully connected layers and a linear output layer the hyperparameter settings of each lstm layer are consistent with the above lstm model the two fully connected layers have 256 and 128 hidden neurons in sequence each layer has a relu activation function cla model this model is mainly composed of a convolutional layer an lstm layer an attention layer a fully connected layer and finally a linear output layer the hyperparameter settings of the convolutional and lstm layers are consistent with the cnn and lstm model the attention layer has a hidden dimension of 128 and 8 attention heads the fully connected layer also has 128 hidden neurons the activation function of each layer is the relu function transformer model there are three encoder layers and three decoder layers the hidden layer dimension of the encoder and decoder is 512 the attention head is 8 and the dropout rate is 0 05 traditional transfer learning this method initializes the source model parameters and uses the source domain data to pre train the source model for n 30 epochs the loss function of the source model has converged early and the model parameters of the last epoch are saved based on the saved pre training model the training set data of the target domain is also used to optimize the model parameters for n 30 epochs and finally get the target model this process is the pre training and fine tuning process of traditional transfer learning in this experiment our task is the long term prediction of water quality so the forecast horizon h is set to 4 time steps that is to predict the water quality indicators in the next month due to the long term trend pattern of the water quality data we consider using the historical 12 month water quality to predict the water quality of the next month so the historical sliding window size is set to 52 adam is used as the optimizer during all the model training the adam optimization algorithm comprehensively considers the first moment of the gradient i e the mean of the gradient and the second moment of the gradient i e the variance of the gradient to update the step length which can automatically adjust the learning rate and adjust the fluctuation range is not too large kingma and ba 2014 due to the principle of the adam optimizer the initial learning rate should be small and we refer to the hyperparameter settings of other time series forecasting research to initialize the learning rate to 0 0001 wu et al 2021 we set the maximum epoch to 30 because the transformer model triggers the early stop mechanism before the 30 epoch and most of the baseline models also trigger this mechanism and the loss function of the remaining models will converge before the 30 epoch in addition the batch size should not be set too large so we perform a grid search on 10 20 25 30 for all models we sequentially select the batch size to train models at the train set and then evaluate the model performance on the test set the search results are shown in fig 4 for all models the batch size is too large or too small can significantly degrade performance among them mlp cnn lstm and bi lstm perform best when batch size is 20 while cla and transformer perform best when batch size is 25 since the performance of the latter two models varies small between batch sizes of 20 and 25 we set the batch size to 20 for all models finally the common hyperparameter settings for all models are shown in the table 4 5 results and discussion 5 1 overall performance comparison to verify the performance of the transformer model this study compared it with five other baseline deep learning algorithms the comparison results are presented in table 5 the metrics in table 5 are derived from the average of the mse and mae metrics of the 30 monitoring stations in the target domain among the six deep learning models the transformer model has the highest prediction accuracy for all water quality indicators showing that the model outperforms the other five baseline models this demonstrates that compared with the lstm based models the transformer model is a better choice for us in the complex scenario of long term prediction of multiple water quality indicators in addition none of the six deep learning algorithms introduced a transfer learning framework namely training and verifying models with only target domain datasets tlt represents the transformer model introducing the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework which improves the prediction accuracy of all water quality indicators compared to the transformer therefore the tlt model has the best prediction performance and greatly improves prediction accuracy compared with the suboptimal values the mse and mae of the water quality indicator do have the largest improvement which is increased by 24 84 and 18 42 respectively among the four water quality indicators the mse improvement of n h 3 n and the mae improvement of c o d m n are the smallest but their mse and mae are still improved by 12 28 and 10 49 respectively river and lake are very different systems in terms of biological processes therefore we explore the performance of the baseline models on two different domains river and lake and the effect of the tlt model on intra domain and cross domain transfer as shown in table 6 haihe river represents the target domain composed of the data of three monitoring stations in the haihe river and others lake represents the target domain composed of the data of the three lake monitoring stations of others tlt lake represents the tlt model pre trained from the source data of 10 monitoring stations in taihu lake and poyang lake and tlt huaihe river represents the tlt model pre trained from the source data of 10 monitoring stations in huaihe river the train test set split ratio of the target domain is 1 1 and the historical window size and prediction horizon are 12 and 4 respectively compared with the other five benchmark deep learning models the transformer can most accurately predict do c o d m n and n h 3 n in the haihe river and its prediction accuracy for ph is second only to cla however the transformer performed poorly in predicting the c o d m n and n h 3 n of others lake this suggests that transformer may be more advantageous in predictive modeling of river water quality indicators furthermore on both target domains the mae metrics of tlt lake and tlt huaihe river outperform other untransferred models this suggests that even though rivers and lakes have very different biological processes water quality data from the two domains can still be transferred to each other to gain positive knowledge similar to the findings of otović et al 2022 two unrelated time series domains can also achieve positive knowledge transfer effects meanwhile when the target domain is the haihe river the mae values of tlt huaihe river in ph do and c o d m n are significantly better than those of tlt lake while the difference in n h 3 n is small therefore compared with the lake the water quality data of the river may be more suitable as the source domain to transfer helpful knowledge thereby improving the prediction accuracy of water quality indicators for the target river 5 2 effect of recurrent fine tuning transfer learning the transformer model and the tlt model were deployed separately on a single monitoring station and the comparison of the predicted and observed values for the four water quality indicators is also shown in fig 5 the horizontal axis of the figure represents the rolling prediction time range from 1 to 50 weeks and the vertical axis represents the normalized value of water quality indicators the data at this station is divided into a train test set in a 1 1 ratio the train set is used to train the transformer model or fine tune the tlt model and the test set is used for both models to implement predictions therefore the time series predictions in fig 5 are all in the test set one monitoring station data is limited and the transformer model fails to learn sufficient knowledge for prediction resulting in high errors compared with training directly with limited data samples from the target monitoring station the fitting degree of the tlt model to the ground truth is significantly improved this study also explores the applicability of the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework and the traditional transfer learning framework to different deep learning algorithms the results are shown in fig 6 all deep learning algorithms improve their prediction accuracy after applying the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework while the effect of traditional transfer learning is not stable after applying the traditional transfer learning framework the prediction accuracy of mlp cla and transformer has deteriorated although the prediction effect of cnn lstm and bi lstm are improved after applying the traditional transfer learning framework the improvement is not as good as the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning in most cases this shows that traditional transfer learning methods are prone to introduce too much noise during knowledge transfer reduce the transfer effect and even produce a negative transfer phenomenon among six deep learning models transformer has the largest improvement in average mae of water quality indicators after applying transfer learning this may be because the network structure of the transformer is the most complex and the sample limited problem is more likely to limit the optimization of model parameters the results show that recurrent fine tuning transfer learning can effectively solve the problem of insufficient training of deep learning models deployed on monitoring stations with limited data and avoid the noise interference caused by overfitting in the source domain 5 3 influence of target domain dataset partitioning ratio the above experiments validate the effectiveness of the transfer learning method which can be used to solve the data shortage problem of new stations where the data is insufficient for training however an important question for the tlt is how to define a new station what effect does the extent of data shortage at these new stations affect the effect of transfer learning to explore this question we examined the performance of the models on different proportions of training sets in this experiment the target domain dataset partition ratio was used to simulate the limited monitoring station data when the ratio is smaller fewer historical samples are available at the monitoring station for modeling as shown in fig 7 we tested the performance of each model at different proportions as the proportion decreased the performance of cnn and bi lstm models is best at 1 3 this phenomenon may be because there are 420 sequence samples in the 1 3 training set which can make these models reach the local optimum while the data volume of 840 sequence samples in the 1 1 training set cannot achieve a better global optimum instead local overfitting occurs the performance of the other four baseline models without transfer learning degrades by varying degrees as the trainable data becomes more limited among them the decrease in transformer is the largest because the network structure of the transformer model is more complex and the limited training data negatively impacts its performance moreover as the proportion of the training data decreases the average mse of the water quality indicators of tlt gradually decreases first reaching a trough at 1 3 and then the curve is relatively gentle meanwhile the average mse difference between the tlt and transformer models is also increasing this result shows that when the problem of limited data samples of the target monitoring station is more prominent the performance improvement of introducing the transfer learning framework on the transformer model is more obvious 5 4 influence from the history window size in addition to the partition proportion of the target domain datasets the history window size is also an essential factor affecting the number of samples at the monitoring stations by setting different history window sizes the single sample sequence length of the new station will vary thus generating different numbers of training samples with the same amount of data for example if the prediction range is set to 4 weeks and the historical window size is set to 52 26 12 and 4 weeks the number of available samples for new stations will be 55 81 95 and 103 respectively thus the number of available samples at the monitoring stations is inversely proportional as the size of the historical window grows however when we make longer term water quality predictions larger historical window sizes may be required to capture long term time dependent patterns can tlt s transfer learning framework address the reduction of available samples due to the larger history window sizes needed for long term prediction table 7 presents the results of the models using or not using transfer learning with different history window sizes for all four water quality indicators the model performance improvement from tlt over transformer increases with the history window size when the history window size of new stations is very large such as a year 52 weeks the improvement of transfer learning to the model performance is quite significant this result suggests that the useful knowledge transferred by the model from the source domain data becomes increasingly important as the number of available samples at new stations becomes smaller when the historical window size is only one month both the transformer model and the tlt model perform the best in predicting ph which may be because the ph indicator has a strong neighbor dependence the study by yang et al 2021 shows that when the historical window size is 8 the 4 week historical data close to the prediction window is assigned about 80 of the attention weights therefore this phenomenon may be because when the size of the historical window is too large the attention weight of the neighboring data will be reduced which is not conducive to the accurate prediction of the ph indicator in addition the longer history window size compared to one month 4 weeks allowed tlt to obtain more accurate prediction results on three water quality indicators do cod m n and nh 3 n therefore we can extend the history window size to obtain long term dependency patterns when dealing with long term prediction tasks although this leads to a reduction in available samples tlt can alleviate this problem 6 conclusions and future work this paper proposes a deep transfer learning model based on transformer tlt to improve the long term prediction accuracy of multiple water quality indicators especially for water quality monitoring stations with limited historical observations through this study the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared to the other five baseline deep learning models the transformer model is better at capturing long term dependency patterns for more accurate multi time step water quality prediction 2 a tlt model based on recurrent fine tuning transfer learning can learn useful knowledge of water quality at other stations avoid noise interference and achieve state of the art performance at target stations with limited samples 3 the water quality data of rivers and lakes can be transferred to each other to obtain positive knowledge but the river domain is more suitable for intra domain transfer learning in recent years countries around the world have established many new monitoring stations to monitor and help predict water quality indicators however not all existing stations are suitable as source domains to transfer their knowledge the negative transfer effects of transfer sources are still not considered and improper selection of transfer sources may introduce noise and reduce the effectiveness of transfer learning in the future the selection of a more suitable existing monitoring station as a transfer source for a particular target domain monitoring station is a potential direction to improve the proposed approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15465,the water quality long term prediction is essential to water environment management decisions in recent years although water quality prediction methods based on deep learning have achieved excellent performance in short term prediction these methods are unsuitable for long term prediction because the accumulation use of short term prediction will easily introduce noise furthermore the long term prediction task requires a large amount of data to train the model to obtain accurate prediction results for some monitoring stations with limited historical data it is challenging to fully exploit the performance of deep learning models to this end we introduce a transfer learning framework into water quality prediction to improve the prediction performance in data constrained scenarios we propose a deep transfer learning based on transformer tlt model to enable time dependency perception and facilitate long term water quality prediction in tlt we innovatively introduce a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method which can transfer the knowledge learned from source monitoring stations to the target station while preventing the deep learning model from overfitting the source data during the pre training phase so tlt can fully exert the performance of deep learning models with limited samples we conduct experiments on data from 120 monitoring stations in major rivers and lakes in china to verify the effectiveness of tlt the results show that tlt can effectively improve the long term prediction accuracy of four water quality indicators ph do nh 3 n and cod m n from monitoring stations with limited samples keywords water quality prediction transformer transfer learning deep leaning stations with limited samples 1 introduction surface water is a valuable resource for human survival which is as fragile and non renewable however with the development of human industrialization and urbanization the ecological environment is increasingly destroyed the continuously polluted and deteriorating surface water environment poses a serious threat to human health vörösmarty et al 2010 in addition the deterioration of the surface water environment also aggravates the seriousness of the above problems sun et al 2016 therefore it is essential to monitor and predict surface water quality accurately and timely which contributes to early pollution warnings the water quality prediction task shows that we need to use some historical environmental indicators to provide an early warning of future environmental pollution ghahramani 2015 however due to the nonlinearity and non stationarity of water quality data it is difficult to predict future water quality indicator values accurately artificial intelligence ai technology provides a potential direction for solving water quality prediction problems more and more fields have been beginning to apply ai technology to benefit our life baek et al 2021 grigorescu et al 2020 gu et al 2021 it has also been successfully applied in the field of hydrological monitoring chen et al 2020 in particular research on water quality prediction based on deep learning is gradually emerging solanki et al 2015 thai nghe et al 2020 tung et al 2020 because deep neural networks dnn with excellent nonlinear approximation ability can fit arbitrary continuous functions although the multilayer perceptron mlp neural network can be used for water quality prediction due to its generality to different tasks banejad and olyaie 2011 chang et al 2010 its network structure is not especially good at capturing high dimensional time dependent features of water quality time series data because recurrent neural network rnn is good at capturing high dimensional time dependent patterns of water quality time series data researchers turned to rnn for water quality prediction li et al 2019a jiang et al 2021 successfully predicted fat oil and grease fog content in sewers based on gated recurrent unit gru network the long short term memory lstm network has also been used successfully for water quality prediction hu et al 2019 because lstm can mitigate the vanishing gradient problem of the rnn pulver and lyu 2017 bidirectional lstm bilstm can further improve the water quality prediction accuracy by learning forward and reverse temporal dependencies zou et al 2020 although the lstm model is good at dealing with time series prediction when the sequence length of water quality is long enough the lstm is prone to forgetting long term dependent information and the long term prediction accuracy is reduced yu et al 2019 yang et al 2021 proposed a hybrid cnn lstm model with attention mechanism cla which combines the advantages of three neural network structures to improve the prediction accuracy in which convolutional neural network cnn can capture local features of time series when its convolution layer is modified to 1 d convolution zhao et al 2017 however this hybrid model still suffers from the inherent flaws of the lstm network structure the attention mechanism of the transformer model can directly connect two arbitrary positions in the time series and strengthen or weaken the connection unlike lstm based models transformer models are more flexible in capturing time dependency patterns this has been verified in runoff forecasting yin et al 2022 another problem with these water quality prediction models is that they only make predictions for the next time step and cannot reflect long term trends in water quality obviously the long term multiple time steps prediction of multiple water quality variables is more conducive to water environment management decisions and early warning of pollution in addition although the excellent performance of the above deep learning models in the field of water quality prediction these models require a lot of water quality data for training to achieve optimal model parameters on the practical side the deployment of deep neural network water quality prediction models suffers from the limited sample of water quality data at some monitoring stations the tabula rasa deep neural networks should be trained on a large water quality dataset before providing useful water quality variable prediction output individual water quality monitoring stations usually require a lengthy data collection process because only after enough water quality data is collected can it be used to train the deep neural network so as to get the accurate prediction value of water quality variables of the corresponding station this clearly increases the time cost of deploying deep neural networks at water quality monitoring stations transfer learning can solve the problem of limited data of target stations because it can pre train the deep learning model using a rich source domain dataset and fine tune the pre trained model on the target domain dataset minami et al 2021 weiss et al 2016 transfer learning has been extensively studied in other fields lv et al 2019 transferred the model learned from urban areas to predict air quality in rural areas ma et al 2020 transferred the bi lstm model trained based on the existing stations to the air quality prediction task at the new station it is also used to address the data scarcity problem of traffic flow prediction and national exchange rate prediction ye and dai 2022 inspired by these research for target stations with limited data samples we can utilize water quality data collected at other stations in recent years the china national environmental monitoring center has deployed a large number of automatic water quality monitoring stations in lakes and rivers across the country collecting a large amount of water quality data available for analysis chen et al 2020 which can form a rich source domain dataset we can effectively use these valuable data to pre train deep learning models extract general hidden knowledge variation patterns of surface water quality indicators and apply it to the target stations water quality prediction this transfer learning method can effectively reduce the data collection time cost of deploying deep learning models in monitoring stations and solve the problem of limited data in monitoring stations in the field of water quality prediction although the combination of deep learning models and transfer learning has been successfully applied in other fields its application to water quality prediction still faces two major challenges in the complex scenario of the long term prediction task of multiple water quality indicators the lstm based models easily lose the long term dependence pattern of water quality data in the process of transfer learning due to its gated structure so it is difficult to obtain high multi time step prediction accuracy which is not conducive to the early warning of water pollution in the pre training stage of traditional transfer learning methods the deep learning model is prone to overfitting the source domain data which leads to more noise in the general hidden knowledge transfer process at the same time the increase of noise during the fine tuning stage interferes with adapting the deep learning model to the target domain data reducing the effect of transfer learning to tackle the above two challenges we adopt the self attention mechanism and encoder decoder structure of the transformer neural network model to learn the long term dependence patterns and innovatively propose a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework to mitigate model overfitting finally they form a transfer learning based on transformer tlt model our work has the following four contributions to the best of our knowledge we are the first to explore the state of the art performance of transformer neural network models in the field of water quality prediction we propose a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method to solve the problem of limited data from monitoring stations when we deploy deep learning models this method can prevent the deep learning model from overfitting the source domain data in the pre training stage which helps the model adapt to the water quality data of the target station the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method is a model independent water quality prediction framework that can be combined with other deep learning models this paper verifies the state of the art performance of the tlt model in complex scenarios of long term prediction of multiple water quality indicators through experiments 2 materials and data preprocessing 2 1 study area and water quality data in this study the raw data were collected weekly data from 120 automatic water quality monitoring stations in national major rivers and lakes from china national environmental monitoring centre from 2013 to 2016 http www mee gov cn hjzl shj dbszdczb after preprocessing we retained water quality data for 110 consecutive weeks from january 2013 to february 2015 among these monitoring stations the pearl river basin has 8 monitoring stations the yangtze river basin has 22 monitoring stations the songhua river basin has 11 monitoring stations the liaohe river basin has 7 monitoring stations the yellow river basin has 12 monitoring stations the huaihe river basin has 26 monitoring stations haihe river basin has 6 monitoring stations taihu lake basin has 6 monitoring stations poyang lake basin has four monitoring stations the rest of the large lakes and rivers include a total of 18 water quality indicators are usually divided into biological indicators chemical indicators and physical indicators tchobanoglous and schroeder 1985 the biological indicators contain fecal coliforms algae and so on the chemical indicators include dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh 3 n and the physical indicators cover hydrogen ion concentration ph temperature turbidity etc wu et al 2014 water environmental conditions are often the result of the synergistic effect of multiple key water quality indicators and several other environmental factors wilhm and dorris 1968 in the study of water quality prediction scholars choose important indicators that can reflect the quality of the water environment the most common indicators are ph do nh 3 n and cod m n zou et al 2020 the lower ph value reflects that the water body may suffer from acid pollution and nh 3 n is an indicator of water eutrophication ahmed et al 2019 therefore a single water quality indicator is insufficient to fully reflect the status quo of the water environment chen et al 2020 also shows that ph do cod m n and nh 3 n are key indicators for water quality prediction so we select these four key water quality indicators to construct a water quality prediction model 2 2 data preprocessing a small number of missing data problems exist in the original dataset due to sensor abnormalities or other factors the water quality time series does not change drastically if no sudden events such as rainfall or pollution occur within a short time interval besides yang et al 2021 show that linear interpolation can be used to fill in specific missing values without affecting the deep learning model to learn water quality change patterns therefore we complemented the missing values in the dataset using a linear interpolation algorithm the linear interpolation function can be constructed as follows 1 y t y l y r y l t l r l where y t is the missing value of the water quality variable y l denotes the nearest known observations of water quality variables before y t and y r denotes the nearest known data after y t t l and r are the temporal indexes of the observed values after completing the missing values by linear interpolation the dataset has 52 800 observations furthermore throughout the entire completion dataset ph do cod m n and nh 3 n ranged from 5 79 to 9 70 0 02 to 25 70 0 10 to 57 50 and 0 01 to 22 30 respectively subgraph a of fig 1 in order to address the comparability of different indicators in water quality monitoring data and make the feature space of the data more regular we used z score standardization for the water quality indicators at each monitoring station barboza et al 2017 subgraph b of fig 1 for each monitoring station z score standardization is performed on different water quality indicators using the corresponding training data set to keep the four indicators with the same degree of influence on the model prediction results the dataset of the source domain monitoring station is standardized using the mean and standard deviation of the entire dataset and the dataset of the target domain monitoring station is standardized using only the mean and standard deviation of the training data 3 methodology our proposed tlt framework consists of three main parts shown in fig 2 time series samples generation water quality time dependency aware prediction and recurrent fine tuning transfer learning it starts by generating time series samples of normalized water quality data using a sliding window approach then water quality time dependency aware prediction method is proposed based on the transformer network finally the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method is proposed to transfer knowledge a k a prediction model from source monitoring stations to the target station 3 1 time series samples generation the collected and standardized water quality data still cannot be directly fed to the model for training because the data need to be transformed into samples and labels that the model could identify we use a sliding window approach to transform the data to facilitate model training and prediction sliding window aims at constructing new observation samples using time series data of consecutive observations brockwell and davis 2002 to predict the time series value at time t the sliding window feeds the value at time t 1 t 2 t δ t to the model δ t is defined as the sliding window size more specifically we use the sliding window method to generate new observation samples and labels for water quality data as follows 1 for the time series data collected after n observations at a monitoring station set the sliding window size as t under this sliding window size setting we have the input x t x 1 t x t t x i t r d x at time t where d x 4 denotes x i t contains four water quality indicator values ph do cod m n and nh 3 n 2 set a forecast horizon h the forecast horizon depends on the application and periodicity of the data the output is the corresponding future sequence y t y 1 t y h t y i t r d y where 1 d y 4 3 setting the number of increments between consecutive sliding windows to 1 time step the time series data of a single monitoring station can be divided into m n t h 1 time series samples samples within the sliding window size t are the model input and samples involved in the forecast horizon h are the labels or targets 3 2 water quality time dependency aware prediction the transformer mainly has three parts position encoding self attention mechanism and encoder decoder structure the temporal feature encoding is more suitable when the transformer is applied to time series forecasting li et al 2019b zhou et al 2021 so we replace the original positional encoding with fine grained timestamp feature encoding to achieve water quality time dependency aware prediction the fine grained timestamp features include four features the year month quarter and week it s encoding thus has periodic information in multiple temporal dimensions in water quality prediction scenarios the self attention mechanism can capture long term and short term dependency patterns from historical water quality data furthermore in transformer s encoder decoder structure the encoder extracts high dimensional spatial representations of long term and short term dependency patterns of water quality data and the decoder uses these representations to predict future water quality 3 2 1 self attention mechanism for learning time dependent patterns of water quality data accurate long term water quality prediction requires the model to learn long term and short term dependence patterns of water quality data the self attention mechanism captures long term and short term dependencies by computing attention scores at different time steps meanwhile different attention heads focus on time dependent patterns at different periods canonical self attention in vaswani et al 2017 is described as mapping a query and a set of key value pairs to an output the output is computed as a weighted sum of values where the weight assigned to each value is computed by the query s compatibility function with the corresponding key in the multi head self attention layer original input x t r t d x is transformed into embedding x e m b r t d by linear projection and then simultaneously transformed to h distinct query matrices q i x e m b w i q key matrices k i x e m b w i k and value matrices v i x e m b w i v respectively where h denotes the number of heads d denotes the dimension of the input in the embedding space i 1 h w i q r d d q w i k r d d k and w i v r d d v are learnable parameters after these linear projections the multi head dot product attention computes a sequence of vector outputs in parallel this concated output includes the long term and short term dependence features of the time series the specific formulas are as follows 2 a t t e n t i o n q i k i v i s o f t m a x q i k i t d k m v i 3 h e a d i a t t e n t i o n q i k i v i 4 m u l t i h e a d c o n c a t e h e a d i h e a d h w o where the parameter matric w o r h d v d represents h e a d 1 h e a d h are concatenated and linearly projected again note that a mask matrix m is applied to filter out rightward attention by setting all upper triangular elements to to avoid future information leakage 3 2 2 water quality time dependency feature encoder the encoder is designed to learn high dimensional representations of water quality time series inputs which facilitates the self attention layer in the encoder to extract long term and short term dependency patterns we use a standard encoder structure in fig 3 the encoder input x e n x t is linearly transformed to obtain an embedded representation and then timestamp encoding is added the formula is as follows 5 x e m b x e n w e t i m e s t a m p w e t where weight matrix w e w e t r d x d d 512 x e n r t d x t i m e s t a m p y e a r q u a r t e r m o n t h w e e k the four fine grained features of t i m e s t a m p are normalized separately in advance and then converted into high dimensional space representation through linear projection thus the t i m e s t a m p allows the model to identify the temporal position of each unit in the sequence helping the model to learn the long term and short term dependent patterns of water quality data after the input representation the sequence input x e n r t d x is linearly projected as a matrix x e m b r t d the encoder is composed of n 3 identical layers each layer has two sublayers the first is a multi head self attention mechanism and the second is a simple position wise fully connected feed forward network we employ a residual connection around each of the two sublayers followed by layer normalization therefore the formulas for the encoder layer are as follows 6 x a t t l a y e r n o r m x e m b m u l i t i h e a d x e m b 7 o e n l a y e r n o r m x a t t f f n x a t t where x a t t o e n r t d ffn denotes fully connected feed forward network which consists of two linear transformations with a relu activation in between 8 f f n x m a x 0 x w 1 b 1 w 2 b 2 where w 1 w 2 are weight matrices b 1 b 2 are the bias items finally the encoder outputs an embedding representation o e n of water quality data in a high dimensional space which contains time dependent features and can be used as an intermediate input to the decoder to help it make predictions 3 2 3 decoder for regression prediction of water quality data with timestamp the encoder only outputs high dimensional space representations of water quality time series data and cannot directly output prediction results therefore we need to parse these high dimensional space representations with a decoder to obtain the implicit long term and short term dependency patterns and use it for regression prediction of future water quality as shown in fig 3 the input of transformer decoder x d e contains both the x t o k e n r t 2 d y and x 0 r h d y 9 x d e c o n c a t e x t o k e n x 0 where x d e r t 2 h d y x t o k e n is the second half of the sequence of x e n and x 0 is the part of the sequence to be predicted filled with 0 moreover we also add timestamp encoding to the embedding representation of the decoder input x d e to facilitate the decoder extracting the temporal location information of the water quality data 10 y e m b x d e w d t i m e s t a m p w d t where x d e and t i m e s t a m p are both linearly transformed and then summed to obtain the embedding space representation y e m b r t 2 h d linear transformation matrixs are w d w d t r d y d respectively the decoder is also composed of m 3 identical layers similar to the encoder still it has a third sublayer that performs multi head attention to the output of the encoder stack inserted between two sublayers with the latent hidden variable o e n from the encoder the equations of l th decoder layer can be summarized as o d e l d e c o d e r o d e l 1 o e n where o d e 0 y e m b the decoder can be formalized as follows 11 y a t t l 1 l a y e r n o r m o d e l 1 m u l i t i h e a d o d e l 1 12 y a t t l 2 l a y e r n o r m y a t t l 1 m u l i t i h e a d y a t t l 1 o e n 13 o d e l l a y e r n o r m y a t t l 2 f f n y a t t l 2 where o d e l l 1 m denotes the output of l th decoder layer y e m b l i i 1 2 represents the embedding space representation after the i th muli head attention module computation in the l th layer respectively after the linear transformation of the fully connected layer the output o d e m of the stacked encoder is finally projected to the sequence with the same dimension as the x d e and the predicted part in this sequence is the output of the entire transformer model 3 3 recurrent fine tuning transfer learning traditional transfer learning methods based on advanced deep learning techniques aim to reuse the model developed for the source task as the initial model for the target task which has solved the problem of limited data in the target domain ma et al 2019 however it is not fully applicable in the field of water quality prediction because in the pre training stage the deep learning model is prone to overfitting to the source domain data which leads to the introduction of noise during knowledge transfer the noise interferes with the adaptation of the model to the target domain in the fine tuning stage thus reducing the prediction accuracy to address this overfitting problem we propose a recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method fig 2 shows the workflow of the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning method in tlt its basic idea includes two stages pre training stage and fine tuning stage two tasks source task and target task and two datasets source domain dataset and target domain dataset since there is a certain connection between the source task and the target task the model can run alternately in the source task and the target task we pretrain the transformer model on the source dataset for one epoch and keep the model parameters and then fine tune the model on the target dataset for one epoch back to the source task this cycle runs for multiple epochs until convergence so that model parameters are shared between the source and target tasks for more efficient knowledge transfer firstly the model training process for each epoch is divided into a pre training phase and a fine tuning phase in the pre training phase the rich source domain data of existing stations are packaged into batches according to batch size and each batch trains the model once when all batches have trained the model the pre training phase of the current epoch is completed and fine tuning begins in the fine tuning stage the model parameters are fine tuned to accommodate the target task using target domain data from the target station in addition after the fine tuning of the current epoch is completed an early stop mechanism is introduced to determine whether the model returns to the source task for the next epoch training the early stop mechanism is that when the loss function value mse of the fine tuned model in the current epoch is better than the optimal loss function value the optimal model parameters are saved the optimal loss function value is updated and then the pre training and fine tuning of the next epoch is performed if the loss function value of the fine tuned model for three consecutive epochs is worse than the optimal value the recurrent transfer learning is stopped and the optimal model is returned this process recurrents continuously making the transformer model parameters iteratively update until convergence in such recurrent fine tuning transfer learning not only the general knowledge and features learned from other existing stations are preserved but the model can be tuned to the target station to prevent overfitting to the source task after obtaining the target model after multiple rounds of knowledge transfer the model is then tested using the data from the target station to output water quality prediction results 3 4 overall algorithm of tlt algorithm 1 describes the process of the water quality prediction algorithm based on tlt in pseudocode we divide the data of the target monitoring stations into the target dataset d t and the test dataset d t and use other monitoring stations as the source dataset d s therefore d s has a different data distribution than d t but d t has the same distribution as d t f θ represents the transformer model function and θ denotes the updatable parameters of the model θ represents the parameters of the target model converged after recurrent fine tuning transfer learning earlystop is an early stopping mechanism which can stop training early to prevent the model from deviating from the data distribution of the target domain 4 experiment 4 1 datasets as shown in table 1 the dataset used in this experiment contains 120 monitoring stations and each station records water quality indicators ph do cod m n and nh 3 n and time once a week so the dataset features are four water quality indicators and timestamp moreover 52 800 water quality indicators are observed in the dataset and the sequence length of water quality indicators for each monitoring station is 110 table 2 shows the distribution of monitoring stations in different basins in china and the corresponding number of water quality observations 4 2 metrics in this study we use two commonly used evaluation indicators to evaluate the predictive performance of transformer and other benchmark models they are mean square error mse and mean absolute error mae calculations of these two metrics are shown in eqs 14 15 14 m s e 1 n h i 1 n j 1 h y i j y i j 2 15 m a e 1 n h i 1 n j 1 h y i j y i j where n represents the number of water quality data samples h indicates the predicted time range and y i j represents the observations of the jth predicted time step of the ith sample y i j represents the corresponding predicted values lower values of these two indicators mean higher prediction accuracy and better performance of the model 4 3 experiment settings the detailed software and hardware environment of this experiment is introduced as follows the experiments use pycharm as the python integrated development environment all codes are written in python 3 6 and called various packages and all deep learning models are built through the pytorch 1 9 0 framework in addition the hardware environment includes cpu i7 8750h and gpu gtx 1080 after applying the sliding window method to construct the historical data of 120 water quality stations as samples we take the samples of 90 stations as the source domain dataset and the samples of the other 30 stations as the target domain dataset as shown in table 3 we divided the six rivers and two lakes with the highest number of monitoring stations into the source domain and the rest as the target domain the others class contains 14 monitoring stations across rivers and 4 monitoring stations in different lakes which are suitable as target domains we take all the samples in the source domain dataset as pre training data some samples in the target domain dataset as the training set and the rest as the test set the training test division ratio in the target domain dataset belongs to 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 we first set a breakpoint on the time series according to the ratio and then use a sliding window to generate samples in chronological order the samples generated before the breakpoint are the training set and the samples generated after the breakpoint are the test set the smaller the ratio the more serious the problem of limited data samples in monitoring stations to verify the performance of the transformer model we compared it with five other baseline deep learning algorithms including multilayer perceptron mlp heddam 2016 convolutional neural network cnn barzegar et al 2020 lstm liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 bidirectional lstm bi lstm zou et al 2020 and hybrid cnn lstm model with attention cla yang et al 2021 in this study the hyperparameters and network structure of these baseline models are optimized based on water quality multi task learning and prediction therefore all models predict four water quality indicators simultaneously all the models compared are as follows mlp model there are two fully connected layers each containing a linear layer a relu activation function and a dropout layer applied with a dropout rate of 0 05 the two layers hidden neurons are 256 and 128 respectively the last layer is the linear output layer cnn model there is a convolutional layer a fully connected layer and finally a linear output layer the convolutional layer has 64 filters and a kernel size of 3 the fully connected layer has 64 hidden neurons and the activation function is the relu function lstm model this model consists of an lstm layer a fully connected layer and a linear output layer the lstm layer has 128 hidden neurons with a dropout rate of 0 05 the fully connected layer also has 128 neurons and the activation function is the relu activation function bi lstm model this model consists of two inverted lstm layers stacked together then goes through two fully connected layers and a linear output layer the hyperparameter settings of each lstm layer are consistent with the above lstm model the two fully connected layers have 256 and 128 hidden neurons in sequence each layer has a relu activation function cla model this model is mainly composed of a convolutional layer an lstm layer an attention layer a fully connected layer and finally a linear output layer the hyperparameter settings of the convolutional and lstm layers are consistent with the cnn and lstm model the attention layer has a hidden dimension of 128 and 8 attention heads the fully connected layer also has 128 hidden neurons the activation function of each layer is the relu function transformer model there are three encoder layers and three decoder layers the hidden layer dimension of the encoder and decoder is 512 the attention head is 8 and the dropout rate is 0 05 traditional transfer learning this method initializes the source model parameters and uses the source domain data to pre train the source model for n 30 epochs the loss function of the source model has converged early and the model parameters of the last epoch are saved based on the saved pre training model the training set data of the target domain is also used to optimize the model parameters for n 30 epochs and finally get the target model this process is the pre training and fine tuning process of traditional transfer learning in this experiment our task is the long term prediction of water quality so the forecast horizon h is set to 4 time steps that is to predict the water quality indicators in the next month due to the long term trend pattern of the water quality data we consider using the historical 12 month water quality to predict the water quality of the next month so the historical sliding window size is set to 52 adam is used as the optimizer during all the model training the adam optimization algorithm comprehensively considers the first moment of the gradient i e the mean of the gradient and the second moment of the gradient i e the variance of the gradient to update the step length which can automatically adjust the learning rate and adjust the fluctuation range is not too large kingma and ba 2014 due to the principle of the adam optimizer the initial learning rate should be small and we refer to the hyperparameter settings of other time series forecasting research to initialize the learning rate to 0 0001 wu et al 2021 we set the maximum epoch to 30 because the transformer model triggers the early stop mechanism before the 30 epoch and most of the baseline models also trigger this mechanism and the loss function of the remaining models will converge before the 30 epoch in addition the batch size should not be set too large so we perform a grid search on 10 20 25 30 for all models we sequentially select the batch size to train models at the train set and then evaluate the model performance on the test set the search results are shown in fig 4 for all models the batch size is too large or too small can significantly degrade performance among them mlp cnn lstm and bi lstm perform best when batch size is 20 while cla and transformer perform best when batch size is 25 since the performance of the latter two models varies small between batch sizes of 20 and 25 we set the batch size to 20 for all models finally the common hyperparameter settings for all models are shown in the table 4 5 results and discussion 5 1 overall performance comparison to verify the performance of the transformer model this study compared it with five other baseline deep learning algorithms the comparison results are presented in table 5 the metrics in table 5 are derived from the average of the mse and mae metrics of the 30 monitoring stations in the target domain among the six deep learning models the transformer model has the highest prediction accuracy for all water quality indicators showing that the model outperforms the other five baseline models this demonstrates that compared with the lstm based models the transformer model is a better choice for us in the complex scenario of long term prediction of multiple water quality indicators in addition none of the six deep learning algorithms introduced a transfer learning framework namely training and verifying models with only target domain datasets tlt represents the transformer model introducing the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework which improves the prediction accuracy of all water quality indicators compared to the transformer therefore the tlt model has the best prediction performance and greatly improves prediction accuracy compared with the suboptimal values the mse and mae of the water quality indicator do have the largest improvement which is increased by 24 84 and 18 42 respectively among the four water quality indicators the mse improvement of n h 3 n and the mae improvement of c o d m n are the smallest but their mse and mae are still improved by 12 28 and 10 49 respectively river and lake are very different systems in terms of biological processes therefore we explore the performance of the baseline models on two different domains river and lake and the effect of the tlt model on intra domain and cross domain transfer as shown in table 6 haihe river represents the target domain composed of the data of three monitoring stations in the haihe river and others lake represents the target domain composed of the data of the three lake monitoring stations of others tlt lake represents the tlt model pre trained from the source data of 10 monitoring stations in taihu lake and poyang lake and tlt huaihe river represents the tlt model pre trained from the source data of 10 monitoring stations in huaihe river the train test set split ratio of the target domain is 1 1 and the historical window size and prediction horizon are 12 and 4 respectively compared with the other five benchmark deep learning models the transformer can most accurately predict do c o d m n and n h 3 n in the haihe river and its prediction accuracy for ph is second only to cla however the transformer performed poorly in predicting the c o d m n and n h 3 n of others lake this suggests that transformer may be more advantageous in predictive modeling of river water quality indicators furthermore on both target domains the mae metrics of tlt lake and tlt huaihe river outperform other untransferred models this suggests that even though rivers and lakes have very different biological processes water quality data from the two domains can still be transferred to each other to gain positive knowledge similar to the findings of otović et al 2022 two unrelated time series domains can also achieve positive knowledge transfer effects meanwhile when the target domain is the haihe river the mae values of tlt huaihe river in ph do and c o d m n are significantly better than those of tlt lake while the difference in n h 3 n is small therefore compared with the lake the water quality data of the river may be more suitable as the source domain to transfer helpful knowledge thereby improving the prediction accuracy of water quality indicators for the target river 5 2 effect of recurrent fine tuning transfer learning the transformer model and the tlt model were deployed separately on a single monitoring station and the comparison of the predicted and observed values for the four water quality indicators is also shown in fig 5 the horizontal axis of the figure represents the rolling prediction time range from 1 to 50 weeks and the vertical axis represents the normalized value of water quality indicators the data at this station is divided into a train test set in a 1 1 ratio the train set is used to train the transformer model or fine tune the tlt model and the test set is used for both models to implement predictions therefore the time series predictions in fig 5 are all in the test set one monitoring station data is limited and the transformer model fails to learn sufficient knowledge for prediction resulting in high errors compared with training directly with limited data samples from the target monitoring station the fitting degree of the tlt model to the ground truth is significantly improved this study also explores the applicability of the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework and the traditional transfer learning framework to different deep learning algorithms the results are shown in fig 6 all deep learning algorithms improve their prediction accuracy after applying the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning framework while the effect of traditional transfer learning is not stable after applying the traditional transfer learning framework the prediction accuracy of mlp cla and transformer has deteriorated although the prediction effect of cnn lstm and bi lstm are improved after applying the traditional transfer learning framework the improvement is not as good as the recurrent fine tuning transfer learning in most cases this shows that traditional transfer learning methods are prone to introduce too much noise during knowledge transfer reduce the transfer effect and even produce a negative transfer phenomenon among six deep learning models transformer has the largest improvement in average mae of water quality indicators after applying transfer learning this may be because the network structure of the transformer is the most complex and the sample limited problem is more likely to limit the optimization of model parameters the results show that recurrent fine tuning transfer learning can effectively solve the problem of insufficient training of deep learning models deployed on monitoring stations with limited data and avoid the noise interference caused by overfitting in the source domain 5 3 influence of target domain dataset partitioning ratio the above experiments validate the effectiveness of the transfer learning method which can be used to solve the data shortage problem of new stations where the data is insufficient for training however an important question for the tlt is how to define a new station what effect does the extent of data shortage at these new stations affect the effect of transfer learning to explore this question we examined the performance of the models on different proportions of training sets in this experiment the target domain dataset partition ratio was used to simulate the limited monitoring station data when the ratio is smaller fewer historical samples are available at the monitoring station for modeling as shown in fig 7 we tested the performance of each model at different proportions as the proportion decreased the performance of cnn and bi lstm models is best at 1 3 this phenomenon may be because there are 420 sequence samples in the 1 3 training set which can make these models reach the local optimum while the data volume of 840 sequence samples in the 1 1 training set cannot achieve a better global optimum instead local overfitting occurs the performance of the other four baseline models without transfer learning degrades by varying degrees as the trainable data becomes more limited among them the decrease in transformer is the largest because the network structure of the transformer model is more complex and the limited training data negatively impacts its performance moreover as the proportion of the training data decreases the average mse of the water quality indicators of tlt gradually decreases first reaching a trough at 1 3 and then the curve is relatively gentle meanwhile the average mse difference between the tlt and transformer models is also increasing this result shows that when the problem of limited data samples of the target monitoring station is more prominent the performance improvement of introducing the transfer learning framework on the transformer model is more obvious 5 4 influence from the history window size in addition to the partition proportion of the target domain datasets the history window size is also an essential factor affecting the number of samples at the monitoring stations by setting different history window sizes the single sample sequence length of the new station will vary thus generating different numbers of training samples with the same amount of data for example if the prediction range is set to 4 weeks and the historical window size is set to 52 26 12 and 4 weeks the number of available samples for new stations will be 55 81 95 and 103 respectively thus the number of available samples at the monitoring stations is inversely proportional as the size of the historical window grows however when we make longer term water quality predictions larger historical window sizes may be required to capture long term time dependent patterns can tlt s transfer learning framework address the reduction of available samples due to the larger history window sizes needed for long term prediction table 7 presents the results of the models using or not using transfer learning with different history window sizes for all four water quality indicators the model performance improvement from tlt over transformer increases with the history window size when the history window size of new stations is very large such as a year 52 weeks the improvement of transfer learning to the model performance is quite significant this result suggests that the useful knowledge transferred by the model from the source domain data becomes increasingly important as the number of available samples at new stations becomes smaller when the historical window size is only one month both the transformer model and the tlt model perform the best in predicting ph which may be because the ph indicator has a strong neighbor dependence the study by yang et al 2021 shows that when the historical window size is 8 the 4 week historical data close to the prediction window is assigned about 80 of the attention weights therefore this phenomenon may be because when the size of the historical window is too large the attention weight of the neighboring data will be reduced which is not conducive to the accurate prediction of the ph indicator in addition the longer history window size compared to one month 4 weeks allowed tlt to obtain more accurate prediction results on three water quality indicators do cod m n and nh 3 n therefore we can extend the history window size to obtain long term dependency patterns when dealing with long term prediction tasks although this leads to a reduction in available samples tlt can alleviate this problem 6 conclusions and future work this paper proposes a deep transfer learning model based on transformer tlt to improve the long term prediction accuracy of multiple water quality indicators especially for water quality monitoring stations with limited historical observations through this study the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared to the other five baseline deep learning models the transformer model is better at capturing long term dependency patterns for more accurate multi time step water quality prediction 2 a tlt model based on recurrent fine tuning transfer learning can learn useful knowledge of water quality at other stations avoid noise interference and achieve state of the art performance at target stations with limited samples 3 the water quality data of rivers and lakes can be transferred to each other to obtain positive knowledge but the river domain is more suitable for intra domain transfer learning in recent years countries around the world have established many new monitoring stations to monitor and help predict water quality indicators however not all existing stations are suitable as source domains to transfer their knowledge the negative transfer effects of transfer sources are still not considered and improper selection of transfer sources may introduce noise and reduce the effectiveness of transfer learning in the future the selection of a more suitable existing monitoring station as a transfer source for a particular target domain monitoring station is a potential direction to improve the proposed approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15466,microplastics mps are known to act as carriers of heavy metals however little is known about the intrinsic chemical additives of mps such as hexabromocyclododecane hbcd in terms of the adsorption behaviors and migration risks of heavy metals on mps here we reported the potential mechanisms and risks of hbcd inherent in polystyrene ps mps with cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption desorption a comparison of the adsorption capacity of the metals onto hbcd ps composites hbcd ps mps 10 31 20 76 μmol g pure mps 0 3 60 μmol g and natural minerals 0 11 13 88 μmol g showed that the addition of hbcd significantly promoted the metals adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps and even exceeded that of natural particles isotherms and thermodynamic data suggested that the adsorption process of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps was spontaneous and endothermic and that the adsorption was a mainly multi ion process with an inclined direction furthermore the results of sem eds ftir and xps analyses as well as density functional theory well explained that the metals were mainly adsorbed on the o and br groups of the hbcd ps mps via electrostatic interactions and surface complexation more importantly by comparing the desorption activity with natural river water and seawater hbcd inherent in mps can enhance the long range transfer of metals carried by the hbcd ps mps from contamination sources to potential sink like oceans thus the hbcd ps mps with high loading of cu ii ni ii and zn ii could be potential secondary sources of these metals in seawater overall these findings revealed the potential risks of flame retardant in mps associated with metal migration and advocated that flame retardant related waste mps should be included in coastal sustainable development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption heavy metals microplastics chemical additive environmental risks 1 introduction the covid 19 pandemic emphasized the indispensable role of plastic products in our daily lives due to their excellent properties such as lightweight flexibility durability and chemical stability plastics are used in personal protective equipment packaging applications and commercial products which saw unprecedented growth during the pandemic patrício silva et al 2021 prata et al 2020 roberts et al 2021 however the deterioration of the environmental situation due to poor management of plastic waste has further reinforced the widespread perception of plastic as a harmful pollutant parashar and hait 2021 more seriously these plastics are subjected to physical chemical and biological degradation into smaller plastic fibers known as microplastics mps particle size 5 mm that pose a serious environmental pollution problem guan et al 2020 thompson et al 2004 as an abundant and persistent pollutant mps not only pose a direct or indirect threat to ecological environments ya et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and organisms li et al 2022b liu et al 2022a but also tend to adsorb some pollutants and migrate easily thus causing even more severe ecological and toxicological effects ouyang et al 2022 pestana et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in fact most commercial plastics contain inherent chemical additives that are required to meet the process and application requirements for better use in life do et al 2022 fauser et al 2022 yan et al 2021 these chemical additives may be released into the environment together with mps fauser et al 2022 tun et al 2022 found that about half of the additives e g phthalates and antioxidants in a study of drainage field soils were sourced from mps cao et al 2022 revealed that mps were a potential source of phthalate esters in the water environment and estimated their release to be approximately 57 8 to 16 100 kg of phthalate esters per year several recent studies have also demonstrated that the inclusion of chemical additives in mps could cause greater ecological risks and toxicity to organisms compared to virgin mps jang et al 2021 na et al 2021 however most previous studies focused on pure mps acting as carriers of heavy metals and information on the role of chemical additives in the migration and fate of mps and pollutants was highly lacking this knowledge gap has emerged as one of the central uncertainties in our understanding of the role of mps in the migration and fate of heavy metals hexabromocyclododecane hbcd a typical brominated flame retardant is extensively applied as insulation material for building materials decorative textiles and electronics covaci et al 2006 fromme et al 2014 lee et al 2019 generally hbcd is mixed with polystyrene ps plastics through extrusion and high impact methods duan et al 2016 which produces ps plastics containing hbcd hbcd ps that are frequently detected in the environment covaci et al 2006 lee et al 2019 lin et al 2021a for example hbcd was detected in substantial amounts in ps plastics up to 14 5 mg g collected in the coastal region of south korea hong kong canada and japan implying that hbcd ps composite contamination was a common and global environmental problem jang et al 2017 additionally hbcd has attracted worldwide attention due to its potential persistence toxicity and bioaccumulation jang et al 2021 liu et al 2018 this has led to the fact that the addition of hbcd to mps can therefore cause more serious toxic effects on organisms in the environment than virgin mps lackmann et al 2022 in our previous study we found that hbcd could significantly promote the enrichment behavior of pb ii onto ps mps lin et al 2021b which greatly enhanced the ability of mps to serve as contaminants carriers in the environment therefore it is necessary to further investigate the potential roles of hbcd in the adsorption of other heavy metals onto mps and their potential migration risks especially in the land sea migration process cu ii ni ii and zn ii are heavy metals widely used in multiple industries such as agriculture the electroplating industry and the dyestuff industry wang et al 2020 yildirim et al 2020 when released into water bodies without proper treatment these heavy metals can cause damage to human health and ecosystems due to their toxicity and biodegradability notably these metals can be highly toxic to lower and higher organisms when exceeding certain concentrations li et al 2022a tang et al 2021b and are thus included in the water framework directive quevauviller 2009 moreover cu zn and ni are concerned heavy metals in estuaries due to their historical and humanistic residues hong et al 2020 in this regard we selected these three heavy metals as the target pollutants overall the aims of this work are to i reveal the potential roles and mechanisms of hbcd inherent in ps mps with cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption ii investigate the influence of water chemistry e g solution ph salinity dissolved organic matter dom on the adsorption processes and iii evaluate the potential migration risks of hbcd ps mps associated with the metals desorption in river water and seawater media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the ps mps and hbcd ps mps hbcd 2 of total weight were obtained from a local material plant lianyungang qihang flame retardant material co ltd lianyungang china the detailed production process of the hbcd ps is shown in fig s1 the main difference between the ps mps and hbcd ps mps is that the latter have an additional step in the preparation process that involves the addition of hbcd comparison of ftir and xrd spectra of ps hbcd and hbcd ps demonstrates that hbcd and ps were successfully fused and mixed fig s2 in addition we prepared blank control groups with only ps treated ps or hbcd treated hbcd according to the preparation procedure of the hbcd ps mps the ps and hbcd ps mps were prepared into particles of 200 mesh size using a shredder for subsequent adsorption desorption experiments the other materials and chemicals

time for the metal adsorption onto these materials i e ps hbcd ps pa pe goethite kaolinite hematite through a 10 day pre sorption experiment hence the equilibration time for all subsequent experiments was set to 60 h detailed experimental steps including adsorption isotherms the effects of solution ph salinity and fa content as well as desorption tests are described in supplementary information text s2 2 3 mathematical models and analytical methods the langmuir freundlich and statistical physics models were fitted to the adsorption isotherms the gibbs free energy change and van t hoff equations were used to analyze the adsorption thermodynamics the details of these models and equations are described in supplementary information text s3 a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray analysis sem edx zeta potential organic elemental analyzer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection equipment atr ftir were conducted to characterize the hbcd ps mps with and without metals adsorption the cu ii ni ii and zn ii concentrations were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes detailed information about the instruments used and calculations of the metal adsorption capacity and removal rate are provided in supplementary information text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential behaviors of heavy metal adsorption onto hbcd ps mps 3 1 1 comparison of adsorption capacity in the control experiments while the hbcd or treated hbcd only accounted for 2 of the mass fraction of the hbcd ps mps it contributes 41 59 57 68 46 53 56 61 and 38 64 54 70 to the cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption by hbcd ps mps respectively fig s3 however the treated ps only contributes 2 15 7 71 to the metals adsorption by hbcd ps mps there results imply that hbcd plays an important role in the metals adsorption by hbcd ps mps furthermore the adsorption ability of the hbcd ps mps for cu ii ni ii and zn ii is evaluated by comparing some common mps and natural minerals fig 1 note that the adsorption capacity of the hbcd ps mps for the metals is significantly higher than that of some natural and artificial particles including ps pa pe goethite kaolinite and hematite which suggests that the adsorption capacity of the hbcd ps mps to the metals is outstanding this result was supported by ateia et al 2020 who showed that the adsorption capacity of pollutants onto pure polymers was lower than that of the actual mps however the adsorption capacity of the ps mps is negligible within the test errors which indicates that the addition of hbcd greatly promotes the metals adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps although many studies have focused on the adsorption behaviors of metal ions onto pure mps li et al 2022c liu et al 2021 xie et al 2021 here we again emphasize that the chemical additives e g hbcd inherent in mps are not to be underestimated for the influence on the adsorption and migration of heavy metals onto mps the adsorption affinity of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps follows cu ii zn ii ni ii according to the equilibrium adsorption capacity a similar result has been reported by tang et al 2021b who studied the interaction behaviors and mechanisms of metals adsorption onto aged nylon mps the adsorption affinity sequence of hbcd ps mps is determined by the inherent ionic properties of the different metals and is mainly listed in table s1 generally the electronegativity and hydrated ionic radii of metal ions relate to their affinity for forming electrostatic interactions tang et al 2021b zou et al 2020 the adsorption affinity is proportional to the softness of the metal ions if the formation of covalent bonds dominates the adsorption process davari et al 2015 the first hydrolysis constant log k meoh represents the breakage of chemical bonds upon the addition of solutions containing hydroxyl ions e g h2o thereby forming new bonds containing the h or oh component of the water molecule e g mo h moh 3 and moh 4 2 miranda et al 2022 as shown in table s1 the order of adsorption capacity is positively correlated with the log k meoh values of the metal ions hence compared with zn and ni cu is more easily hydrolyzed and adsorbed to the hbcd ps mps due to the formation of more stable complexes ding et al 2016 james and healy 1972 this result was supported by gu and evans 2008 who found that higher log k meoh values were beneficial to metal adsorption onto kaolinite therefore for these results log k meoh could be used as an indicator parameter for the adsorption affinity between the metals and hbcd ps mps 3 1 2 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics the plots of fitting by the freundlich and langmuir models for the adsorption isotherms of the hbcd ps mps are presented in fig 2 a b c according to the relatively larger coefficient of determination r 2 table s2 the langmuir isotherm can precisely predict the equilibrium process of cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps this result suggests that the adsorption process of hbcd ps mps may be monolayered and homogeneous alkurdi et al 2021 the maximum adsorption capacity q m of the hbcd ps mps for the metals follows the order cu ii zn ii ni ii which is consistent with the above discussion the q m values increase with increasing temperature indicating that high temperature conditions contribute to the metals adsorption furthermore the gibbs free energy change and van t hoff equation text s3 were applied to calculate the thermodynamic parameters including the gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs as listed in table s3 the values of δg are negative for cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption implying that the adsorption processes are spontaneous li et al 2021 the positive values of δh and δs reveal that the adsorption processes are endothermic with increasing randomness at the solid solution interface ahmad et al 2009 hong et al 2009 thus a higher temperature is beneficial to promote the adsorption of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps it can thus also be predicted that the accumulation and potential migration risks of the hbcd ps mps for heavy metals are relatively higher in summer than in winter 3 1 3 statistical physics models although the adsorption behaviors of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps were evaluated in the freundlich and langmuir models the obtained results were relatively superficial and devoid of physical statistical meaning hence the statistical physics models were used to further analyze the adsorption processes the most compatible statistical model was chosen based on the comparative r 2 and residual root mean square error rmse values thus the monolayer model with two energies model 2 well described the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii onto the hbcd ps mps fig 2 d e f table s4 this model is based on the assumption that the adsorption process is predominantly monolayer with two types of adsorption sites which is consistent with the langmuir model analysis above and the analysis in section 3 3 below the relevant fitting parameters q sat n i n im and δe are summarized in table s5 and discussed below the saturation adsorption capacity q sat relies on the number of molecules per site n i and the densities of receptor sites n im according to eq 1 1 q s a t i 1 2 q s a t i n 1 n 1 m n 2 n 2 m as expected the q sat and q m values are similar in a range for cu ii 33 275 48 217 μmol g ni ii 15 577 34 751 μmol g and zn ii 9 143 13 557 μmol g which further confirms that the adsorption affinity of the hbcd ps mps for the metals follows cu ii zn ii ni ii meanwhile the q sat values are found to increase with increasing temperature thus implying that the adsorption processes are endothermic li et al 2019b which is in agreement with the above thermodynamic analysis the parameter n i can reflect geometric properties and the aggregation degree of metal ions on the adsorbed surface li et al 2019a in general n i values less than 1 n i 1 indicate that the ions can interact with two or more functional groups of the adsorbent and are distributed horizontally on its surface multi docking mechanism conversely n i values greater than 1 n i 1 suggest the number of docked ions interact with one receptor site multi ion mechanism sellaoui et al 2019 the results of table s5 clearly show that the type i adsorption sites of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps are mainly a multi ion adsorption process with an inclined direction in which multiple ions can aggregate in solution to form a kind of aggregate that is fixed at a single site for example the n i value of cu ii adsorption is 30 289 indicating that each site of the hbcd ps mps could adsorb thirty probability of 71 1 or thirty one probability of 28 9 cu ii ions note that the values of type i receptor sites n 1 are higher than those of the type ii receptor sites n 2 implying a reduced aggregation phenomenon from the type i to type ii receptor sites manaa et al 2020 this can be explained that the type i receptor site is lower in energy for adsorption thus more ions are clustered all of the adsorption energy values δe 1 and δe 2 are greater than 25 kj mol which further verifies that the metals adsorption processes are endothermic and that chemical and physical interactions may be jointly involved in the adsorption processes sellaoui et al 2020 overall the adsorption of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps is dominated by spatial and energetic effects 3 2 effects of water chemistry on the adsorption processes generally some parameters in water environments e g salinity solution ph and dom can significantly affect the interface behaviors of heavy metals onto mps gao et al 2021 in this work the effect of nacl concentrations 0 3 5 as background salinity on cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption were investigated fig 3 a it can be observed that higher nacl concentrations clearly inhibit the adsorption capacities of the cu ii ni ii and zn ii onto the hbcd ps mps this phenomenon may be caused by the competitive action of co existing na ions on limited outer sphere adsorption sites guan et al 2020 lin et al 2022 which is consistent with the above analysis of log k meoh as an indicator parameter for the adsorption affinity adsorption is susceptible to changes in electrolyte concentration if electrostatic attraction and or outer sphere surface complexes are essential mechanisms chen et al 2017 wang 2011 here the results indicate that electrostatic attractions and outer sphere surface complexes may contribute to the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii ions on the hbcd ps mps this finding is consistent with those reported using mps as sorbents to adsorb metal ions from solutions of strong electrolytes qi et al 2021 zou et al 2020 in addition the strong nacl dependence in the solution can also be explained by the complexation of divalent metal ions represented by m2 with cl thus reducing the positive charge carried by metal complex ions as shown in fig s2 and the following eqs 2 5 wang et al 2011 2 m 2 c l mc l 3 m 2 2 c l mc l 2 4 m 2 3 c l mcl 3 5 m 2 4 c l mcl 4 2 fig 3b shows the influence of initial solution ph on the metals adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps the results opresent that the adsorption of the three metal ions decreased with decreasing solution ph especially at solution ph 2 and 3 where the metal ions hardly interacted with the hbcd ps mps this can be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between m2 and hbcd ps mps as analyzed by phzpc on the surface of the hbcd ps mps fig s3 fewer negative charges are exposed to the hbcd ps mps surface with decreasing solution ph however the charges on the hbcd ps mps surface are positive when the solution ph is less than approximately 3 71 ph phzpc thus electrostatic repulsion leads to an inability of metal ions to accumulate on the hbcd ps mps this finding was supported by turner and holmes 2015 who studied the adsorption of ag hg pb ni and cu ions onto virgin polyethylene pe mps fulvic acid fa a kind of typical and abundant dom in natural water environments that is susceptible to complexation with metal ions due to its richness in some active functional groups e g cooh oh and conh2 li et al 2018 tang et al 2021a as depicted in fig 3c the uptake of cu ii and zn ii ions onto the hbcd ps mps sharply decreased as the fa concentration increased from 0 5 to 20 mg l which may be attributed to the formation of fa metal complexes in the aqueous solution tang et al 2014 namely the negatively charged fa molecules can provide active sites for the metal ions adsorption resulting in a competitive effect liu et al 2022b the result was supported by tang et al 2021b who reported that fa inhibited the adsorption of cu ii and zn ii ions onto nylon mps zhao et al 2020 also highlighted the possibility of cd ii complexation with humic acid ha thus reducing the adsorption of cd ii on mps furthermore the stockholm humic model shm was applied to analyze the speciation diagrams of the three metals as a function of fa content gustafsson 2001 it can be seen from fig 3 d e f that the species of cu2 ni2 and zn2 continuously decrease with increasing fa content while the species of fa metal complexes e g fam aq and or fa2m aq and or fa m2 aq continue to increase for cu and zn complexes fa2cu and fa2zn as bidentate complexes may form steric hindrance on the surface of hbcd ps mps and thus inhibit the adsorption behaviors gao et al 2021 notably cu can form more fa2m complexes with fa than zn which well explains that the presence of fa has a relatively greater influence on cu ii adsorption these results further support the above discussion however the presence of fa promotes ni ii adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps and the promotion effect is increased with increasing fa concentration this may be explained by the fact that fani occupies only one active site adsorbed in hbcd ps mps while ni2 must occupy two active sites tang et al 2021b namely fa acts as a bridge between ni ii and hbcd ps mps facilitating ni ii adsorption onto the surface of hbcd ps mps hence the presence of fa can affect the adsorption of heavy metals onto hbcd ps mps which mainly depends on the species formed by the metals and fa in summary these results are useful for assessing the fate and adsorption behavior of the hbcd ps mps with heavy metals that are affected by water chemistry in the aquatic environment 3 3 characterization and proposed adsorption mechanisms the surface morphology and elemental distribution of the hbcd ps mps were observed by sem eds fig 4 as seen in fig 4a the hbcd ps mps have an irregular shape with an uneven and crack filled surface which may provide many contact sites for metals adsorption from the eds mapping fig 4b c d there are c o and br elements on the hbcd ps mps furthermore the content ratio of each element in the hbcd ps mps was determined by an organic elemental analyzer namely 83 16 0 03 c 13 92 0 06 h 1 33 0 09 o and 1 59 0 06 br table s6 among them the oxygen content in the hbcd ps mps is mainly produced by the materials ps and hbcd in the mixing and melting process under the action of mixing conveying and shearing in a twin screw extruder fig s1 this result can be supported by comparing the ftir spectra of the treated ps with the ps namely the new peaks that appeared at 1200 1400 cm 1 are caused by the c o o h stretching vibration fig s2 moreover the presence of oxygen content 1 25 0 15 o in treated ps further confirms this result table s6 after the metals adsorption the cu ni and zn atoms are mainly distributed around the o and br atoms which implies that these metals are principally adsorbed on the groups containing o and br fig 4 furthermore ftir and xps characterizations were applied to analyze the interaction mechanisms between the hbcd ps mps and metals in relation to the role of functional groups as shown in the ftir spectra fig s4 there are some functional groups including c h c c c c c o o h and c br in the hbcd ps mps bhagwat et al 2021 muñoz gonzález et al 2009 among them stretching c o and or bending o h are assigned to the 1200 1400 cm 1 absorption peaks after the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii no significant shift in the position of all absorption peaks occurred however the intensity of the c o o h and c br peaks increased indicating that the c o o h and c br groups may be involved in the adsorption processes of the hbcd ps mps han et al 2013 this result was supported by yu et al 2020 who studied the adsorption of levofloxacin onto polyvinyl chloride pvc mps further evidence can be determined by the xps analysis results the xps full spectrum shows that new cu2p ni2p and zn2p peaks appear after the metals adsorption indicating that cu ii ni ii and zn ii ions are indeed adsorbed onto the hbcd ps mps fig s5 this result can also be supported by the xps high resolution of cu2p ni2p and zn2p spectra fig 5 a the characteristic peaks of cu2p1 2 953 73 and 951 05 ev ni2p1 2 878 47 and 872 67 ev and zn2p1 2 1044 54 ev may be associated with m oh complexes on the hbcd ps mps boughrara et al 2021 hou et al 2018 xiong et al 2021 however the obvious peaks of cu2p3 2 933 94 and 931 43 ev ni2p3 2 860 73 and 855 09 ev and zn2p3 2 1021 54 ev may be related to the binding of the metals to br furthermore the high resolution c1s spectra show that there are some chemical bonds in the hbcd ps mps including c h c c c br c o c oh and π π in the hbcd ps mps fig s6 in which c o c oh corresponds to the o h chemical bonds in the high resolution o1s spectra fig 5b these results are consistent with the above ftir analysis after the metals adsorption the emerging peaks of cu o 530 45 ev ni o 531 41 ev and zn o 531 49 ev in the o1s spectra further confirm the adsorption of these metals onto the hbcd ps mps via oh groups zhao et al 2022 note that the binding energy of c br 285 45 ev and o h 532 57 ev decreases after the metals adsorption while the binding energy of c o c oh increases indicating that electrostatic interactions may be involved in the adsorption processes dong et al 2019 in fact with the growth of the outer electron cloud density the shielding effect of the outer electron cloud on the inner electron cloud significantly increases leading to a decrease in the binding energy of the inner electron cloud dong et al 2020 lin et al 2021b thus oh and br may be involved in the adsorption processes as electron absorbing groups density functional theory dft was used to confirm these adsorption mechanisms based on the above characterization analysis the pbe0 density functional method with the d3 bj dispersion correction was used in this work to carry out all the computations the def2 svp basis set was used for the atoms in geometry optimizations vibrational frequency analyses at the same level of theory were performed on all optimized structures to characterize stationary points as local minima generally hbcd is thermally less stable and starts to decompose into hbr at 150 c and the debromination reaction becomes violent when reaching 190 c therefore according to the process of the hbcd ps mps fabrication and the results of the above characterization we first optimized the structures of the hbcd ps mps molecule n 1 at the b3lyp def2 tzvp level of theory by gaussian 16 six different structures were considered and optimized to predict the most possible structure of graft or block copolymers formed by debrominated hbcd molecules in ps and the appearance of the oh group during preparation their energies were also calculated to compare their relative stability table s7 s8 s9 the six selected structures are based on the most likely structures of debrominated hbcd ps oh and their combinations the results show that the structure denoted by hbcd ps 2 is the energy minimum table s9 thus the hbcd ps 2 molecular is further used to analyze its electrostatic potential and metal coordination as shown in fig 6 the negative electrostatic potential presented on the surface of hbcd ps 2 is almost associated with o and br atoms which confirms that the metal cations can be bound to o and br atoms in hbcd ps 2 through electrostatic interactions wang et al 2020 in addition the coordination formed between hbcd ps 2 and the three metal ions e g cu2 ni2 and zn2 also is predicted and optimized fig 7 it can be seen that the interaction energies of hbcd ps 2 with cu2 303 33 and 312 87 kcal mol are the lowest compared to ni2 277 56 and 269 62 kcal mol and zn2 273 15 and 251 86 kcal mol which implies that the coordination of cu2 and hbcd ps 2 is more stable this result also confirms that the hbcd ps mps have a greater adsorption affinity for cu2 interestingly when the metal ions are coordinated to the o atoms in hbcd ps 2 both of the two nearby br atoms are involved in the reaction which makes them form more stable complexes fig 7a b c this result may be supported by the metals desorption yield of the treated ps hbcd and treated hbcd table s10 the desorption yields of the hbcd ps mps 0 057 14 072 in river water and seawater are much lower than those of the treated ps 5 424 71 365 hbcd 3 021 25 647 and treated hbcd 2 965 25 665 which may imply that there is a stronger force between the hbcd ps mps and metals compared to the treated ps hbcd and treated hbcd therefore the o and br atoms in the hbcd ps mps may be synergistically involved in coordination with the metals moreover the metal ions can be adsorbed by hbcd ps mps via coordination with br atoms fig 7d e f thus these results also emphasize the essential role of hbcd in the hbcd ps mps for the metal ions adsorption overall we conclude that electrostatic interaction and surface complexation are the main mechanisms for the hbcd ps mps to adsorb the metals and the potential interactions between cu ii ni ii and zn ii represented by m2 and the hbcd ps mps can be described as below eqs 6 8 6 x hbcd ps b r o y m 2 z h 2 o hbcd ps b r o x m y oh z 2 y 2 x z z h 7 x hbcd ps b r y m 2 z h 2 o hbcd ps br x m y oh z 2 y x z z h 8 x hbcd ps o y m 2 z h 2 o hbcd ps o x m y oh z 2 y x z z h in which x hbcd ps b r o hbcd ps b r and hbcd ps o are the surface groups in the hbcd ps mps phase hbcd ps b r o x m y oh z 2 y 2 x z hbcd ps br x m y oh z 2 y x z and hbcd ps o x m y oh z 2 y x z represent surface complexes x y and z are stoichiometric coefficients 3 4 potential migration risks the migration risks from one environmental media to another one of the hbcd ps mps for cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption desorption were evaluated by the solid liquid distribution coefficient k d and retention factor r f as follows eqs 9 10 fan et al 2007 sastre et al 2007 9 k d q e c e 10 r f k d d y where c e μmol l is the total dissolved adsorbate concentration remaining in solution at equilibrium q e μmol g is the concentration of adsorbate on the solid at equilibrium and d y is the desorption yields in this work all of the d y values under the river water and seawater are summarized in table s10 the k d based risk model relies on the assumption that metals in the solid phase are in equilibrium with metals in solution and can therefore be exchanged with them however the quantification of k d is affected by the processes flowing through different environments as shown by the desorption yields in different environmental media table s10 thus r f as the ratio of the batch k d values to the desorption yields is an excellent indicator for assessing the relative mobility of target contaminants in the material estimating the vulnerability of pollution event scenarios and predicting potential low or high risk scenarios as seen in table s11 all of the k d values of the hbcd ps mps are higher than those of pure mps and natural minerals which further indicates that the adsorption capacity of the hbcd ps mps for the metals is outstanding in natural environments however the k d values decrease with increasing initial metals content which is due to the adsorption sites of the adsorbent gradually saturated at high concentrations notably the risk of heavy metals release from the hbcd ps mps during migration increases with the number of heavy metals carried by the hbcd ps mps which involves the environmental media at the source of contamination as mentioned in section 3 2 above environmental factors including solution ph salinity and dom concentration play a crucial role in the adsorption processes with greater adsorption capacities of the hbcd ps mps associated with heavy metals at higher ph values and low salinity the rising concentration of fa in the solution increases the amount of adsorbed ni ii but inhibits the adsorption capacities of cu ii and zn ii therefore it is essential to investigate the source of the hbcd ps mps and their associated aqua chemical media when assessing the migration risk of heavy metals loaded the hbcd ps mps from one environmental media to another furthermore r f as the ratio of k d values to desorption yields can effectively assess the relative mobility of contaminants on material thus revealing their potential environmental risks a higher r f value represents lower mobility and environmental risk of the contaminant in the materials sastre et al 2007 the rf values for all scenarios material initial metal content different desorption media combinations are summarized in table 1 we can see that the rf values for all materials are lower at higher metal contents which means that the migration risk of metals in the materials increases with the metal content degree for the different materials the hbcd ps mps exhibit relatively high r f values in all cases which may be attributed to their excellent and stable adsorption ability for the metals as discussed above notably for pure mps e g pa and pe the r f values are far less than those of minerals and hbcd ps mps suggesting that the migration risks of the metals posed by pure mps are relatively high within a certain small range this result also highlights that the addition of hbcd slows the migration of the metals on mps to a small extent however on the other hand it should be mentioned that the metals adsorption by the hbcd ps mps may support a long range transfer from contamination sources to the potential sink like oceans it is also important to note that as shown by the current evidences the environmental conditions of sources and sinks determine the long range transport of the metals carried by the hbcd ps mps it has been reported that up to 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste flow from rivers into the ocean per year huang et al 2022 moreover hbcd was detected in substantial amounts in ps plastics up to 14 5 mg g collected in the coastal region of south korea hong kong canada and japan jang et al 2017 therefore it can be predicted that the hbcd ps mps with high loading of cu ii ni ii and zn ii can be potential secondary sources of these metals in the seawater thus posing a potential ecological risk overall we advocate that hbcd related waste microplastics should be included in coastal sustainable development 4 conclusions herein the potential roles and risks of hbcd inherent in ps mps associated with cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption desorption were investigated the results showed that the addition of hbcd greatly promoted the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii onto the mps the sem eds ftir and xps analyses as well as density functional theory well explained that the metals were mainly adsorbed on the o and br groups of the hbcd ps mps through electrostatic interactions and surface complexation it was noteworthy that the o and br atoms in the hbcd ps mps were synergistically involved in coordination with the metals which made them form more stable complexes for these the log k meoh of the metals could be used as an indicator parameter for the adsorption affinity between the metals and hbcd ps mps regarding environmental factors solution ph salinity and fulvic acid had a great effect on the metals adsorption which was related to the formation of metal complex species and adsorption mechanisms as expected within a certain small range the migration risks of the metals posed by pure mps are relatively high compared to natural minerals however it should be noted that the hbcd inherent in mps enhanced the long range transfer of the metals carried by the hbcd ps mps from contamination sources to the ocean thus the hbcd ps mps with high loading of cu ii ni ii and zn ii could be potential secondary sources of these metals in seawater in summary these results facilitated a deeper understanding of the role of hbcd in the migration and fate of heavy metals in mps we emphasized again that most mps in the environment contain chemical additives and thus the role of chemical additives cannot be ignored when assessing the potential risk of mps in the environment

15466,microplastics mps are known to act as carriers of heavy metals however little is known about the intrinsic chemical additives of mps such as hexabromocyclododecane hbcd in terms of the adsorption behaviors and migration risks of heavy metals on mps here we reported the potential mechanisms and risks of hbcd inherent in polystyrene ps mps with cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption desorption a comparison of the adsorption capacity of the metals onto hbcd ps composites hbcd ps mps 10 31 20 76 μmol g pure mps 0 3 60 μmol g and natural minerals 0 11 13 88 μmol g showed that the addition of hbcd significantly promoted the metals adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps and even exceeded that of natural particles isotherms and thermodynamic data suggested that the adsorption process of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps was spontaneous and endothermic and that the adsorption was a mainly multi ion process with an inclined direction furthermore the results of sem eds ftir and xps analyses as well as density functional theory well explained that the metals were mainly adsorbed on the o and br groups of the hbcd ps mps via electrostatic interactions and surface complexation more importantly by comparing the desorption activity with natural river water and seawater hbcd inherent in mps can enhance the long range transfer of metals carried by the hbcd ps mps from contamination sources to potential sink like oceans thus the hbcd ps mps with high loading of cu ii ni ii and zn ii could be potential secondary sources of these metals in seawater overall these findings revealed the potential risks of flame retardant in mps associated with metal migration and advocated that flame retardant related waste mps should be included in coastal sustainable development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption heavy metals microplastics chemical additive environmental risks 1 introduction the covid 19 pandemic emphasized the indispensable role of plastic products in our daily lives due to their excellent properties such as lightweight flexibility durability and chemical stability plastics are used in personal protective equipment packaging applications and commercial products which saw unprecedented growth during the pandemic patrício silva et al 2021 prata et al 2020 roberts et al 2021 however the deterioration of the environmental situation due to poor management of plastic waste has further reinforced the widespread perception of plastic as a harmful pollutant parashar and hait 2021 more seriously these plastics are subjected to physical chemical and biological degradation into smaller plastic fibers known as microplastics mps particle size 5 mm that pose a serious environmental pollution problem guan et al 2020 thompson et al 2004 as an abundant and persistent pollutant mps not only pose a direct or indirect threat to ecological environments ya et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and organisms li et al 2022b liu et al 2022a but also tend to adsorb some pollutants and migrate easily thus causing even more severe ecological and toxicological effects ouyang et al 2022 pestana et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in fact most commercial plastics contain inherent chemical additives that are required to meet the process and application requirements for better use in life do et al 2022 fauser et al 2022 yan et al 2021 these chemical additives may be released into the environment together with mps fauser et al 2022 tun et al 2022 found that about half of the additives e g phthalates and antioxidants in a study of drainage field soils were sourced from mps cao et al 2022 revealed that mps were a potential source of phthalate esters in the water environment and estimated their release to be approximately 57 8 to 16 100 kg of phthalate esters per year several recent studies have also demonstrated that the inclusion of chemical additives in mps could cause greater ecological risks and toxicity to organisms compared to virgin mps jang et al 2021 na et al 2021 however most previous studies focused on pure mps acting as carriers of heavy metals and information on the role of chemical additives in the migration and fate of mps and pollutants was highly lacking this knowledge gap has emerged as one of the central uncertainties in our understanding of the role of mps in the migration and fate of heavy metals hexabromocyclododecane hbcd a typical brominated flame retardant is extensively applied as insulation material for building materials decorative textiles and electronics covaci et al 2006 fromme et al 2014 lee et al 2019 generally hbcd is mixed with polystyrene ps plastics through extrusion and high impact methods duan et al 2016 which produces ps plastics containing hbcd hbcd ps that are frequently detected in the environment covaci et al 2006 lee et al 2019 lin et al 2021a for example hbcd was detected in substantial amounts in ps plastics up to 14 5 mg g collected in the coastal region of south korea hong kong canada and japan implying that hbcd ps composite contamination was a common and global environmental problem jang et al 2017 additionally hbcd has attracted worldwide attention due to its potential persistence toxicity and bioaccumulation jang et al 2021 liu et al 2018 this has led to the fact that the addition of hbcd to mps can therefore cause more serious toxic effects on organisms in the environment than virgin mps lackmann et al 2022 in our previous study we found that hbcd could significantly promote the enrichment behavior of pb ii onto ps mps lin et al 2021b which greatly enhanced the ability of mps to serve as contaminants carriers in the environment therefore it is necessary to further investigate the potential roles of hbcd in the adsorption of other heavy metals onto mps and their potential migration risks especially in the land sea migration process cu ii ni ii and zn ii are heavy metals widely used in multiple industries such as agriculture the electroplating industry and the dyestuff industry wang et al 2020 yildirim et al 2020 when released into water bodies without proper treatment these heavy metals can cause damage to human health and ecosystems due to their toxicity and biodegradability notably these metals can be highly toxic to lower and higher organisms when exceeding certain concentrations li et al 2022a tang et al 2021b and are thus included in the water framework directive quevauviller 2009 moreover cu zn and ni are concerned heavy metals in estuaries due to their historical and humanistic residues hong et al 2020 in this regard we selected these three heavy metals as the target pollutants overall the aims of this work are to i reveal the potential roles and mechanisms of hbcd inherent in ps mps with cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption ii investigate the influence of water chemistry e g solution ph salinity dissolved organic matter dom on the adsorption processes and iii evaluate the potential migration risks of hbcd ps mps associated with the metals desorption in river water and seawater media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the ps mps and hbcd ps mps hbcd 2 of total weight were obtained from a local material plant lianyungang qihang flame retardant material co ltd lianyungang china the detailed production process of the hbcd ps is shown in fig s1 the main difference between the ps mps and hbcd ps mps is that the latter have an additional step in the preparation process that involves the addition of hbcd comparison of ftir and xrd spectra of ps hbcd and hbcd ps demonstrates that hbcd and ps were successfully fused and mixed fig s2 in addition we prepared blank control groups with only ps treated ps or hbcd treated hbcd according to the preparation procedure of the hbcd ps mps the ps and hbcd ps mps were prepared into particles of 200 mesh size using a shredder for subsequent adsorption desorption experiments the other materials and chemicals used in this study include polyamide pa mps polyethylene pe mps goethite kaolinite hematite river water seawater fulvic acid fa copper nitrate cu no3 2 3h2o zinc nitrate zn no3 2 6h2o nickel nitrate ni no3 2 6h2o among other as described in supplementary information text s1 2 2 adsorption and desorption experiments before the adsorption and desorption experiments we determined the equilibrium time for the metal adsorption onto these materials i e ps hbcd ps pa pe goethite kaolinite hematite through a 10 day pre sorption experiment hence the equilibration time for all subsequent experiments was set to 60 h detailed experimental steps including adsorption isotherms the effects of solution ph salinity and fa content as well as desorption tests are described in supplementary information text s2 2 3 mathematical models and analytical methods the langmuir freundlich and statistical physics models were fitted to the adsorption isotherms the gibbs free energy change and van t hoff equations were used to analyze the adsorption thermodynamics the details of these models and equations are described in supplementary information text s3 a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray analysis sem edx zeta potential organic elemental analyzer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection equipment atr ftir were conducted to characterize the hbcd ps mps with and without metals adsorption the cu ii ni ii and zn ii concentrations were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes detailed information about the instruments used and calculations of the metal adsorption capacity and removal rate are provided in supplementary information text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential behaviors of heavy metal adsorption onto hbcd ps mps 3 1 1 comparison of adsorption capacity in the control experiments while the hbcd or treated hbcd only accounted for 2 of the mass fraction of the hbcd ps mps it contributes 41 59 57 68 46 53 56 61 and 38 64 54 70 to the cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption by hbcd ps mps respectively fig s3 however the treated ps only contributes 2 15 7 71 to the metals adsorption by hbcd ps mps there results imply that hbcd plays an important role in the metals adsorption by hbcd ps mps furthermore the adsorption ability of the hbcd ps mps for cu ii ni ii and zn ii is evaluated by comparing some common mps and natural minerals fig 1 note that the adsorption capacity of the hbcd ps mps for the metals is significantly higher than that of some natural and artificial particles including ps pa pe goethite kaolinite and hematite which suggests that the adsorption capacity of the hbcd ps mps to the metals is outstanding this result was supported by ateia et al 2020 who showed that the adsorption capacity of pollutants onto pure polymers was lower than that of the actual mps however the adsorption capacity of the ps mps is negligible within the test errors which indicates that the addition of hbcd greatly promotes the metals adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps although many studies have focused on the adsorption behaviors of metal ions onto pure mps li et al 2022c liu et al 2021 xie et al 2021 here we again emphasize that the chemical additives e g hbcd inherent in mps are not to be underestimated for the influence on the adsorption and migration of heavy metals onto mps the adsorption affinity of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps follows cu ii zn ii ni ii according to the equilibrium adsorption capacity a similar result has been reported by tang et al 2021b who studied the interaction behaviors and mechanisms of metals adsorption onto aged nylon mps the adsorption affinity sequence of hbcd ps mps is determined by the inherent ionic properties of the different metals and is mainly listed in table s1 generally the electronegativity and hydrated ionic radii of metal ions relate to their affinity for forming electrostatic interactions tang et al 2021b zou et al 2020 the adsorption affinity is proportional to the softness of the metal ions if the formation of covalent bonds dominates the adsorption process davari et al 2015 the first hydrolysis constant log k meoh represents the breakage of chemical bonds upon the addition of solutions containing hydroxyl ions e g h2o thereby forming new bonds containing the h or oh component of the water molecule e g mo h moh 3 and moh 4 2 miranda et al 2022 as shown in table s1 the order of adsorption capacity is positively correlated with the log k meoh values of the metal ions hence compared with zn and ni cu is more easily hydrolyzed and adsorbed to the hbcd ps mps due to the formation of more stable complexes ding et al 2016 james and healy 1972 this result was supported by gu and evans 2008 who found that higher log k meoh values were beneficial to metal adsorption onto kaolinite therefore for these results log k meoh could be used as an indicator parameter for the adsorption affinity between the metals and hbcd ps mps 3 1 2 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics the plots of fitting by the freundlich and langmuir models for the adsorption isotherms of the hbcd ps mps are presented in fig 2 a b c according to the relatively larger coefficient of determination r 2 table s2 the langmuir isotherm can precisely predict the equilibrium process of cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps this result suggests that the adsorption process of hbcd ps mps may be monolayered and homogeneous alkurdi et al 2021 the maximum adsorption capacity q m of the hbcd ps mps for the metals follows the order cu ii zn ii ni ii which is consistent with the above discussion the q m values increase with increasing temperature indicating that high temperature conditions contribute to the metals adsorption furthermore the gibbs free energy change and van t hoff equation text s3 were applied to calculate the thermodynamic parameters including the gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs as listed in table s3 the values of δg are negative for cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption implying that the adsorption processes are spontaneous li et al 2021 the positive values of δh and δs reveal that the adsorption processes are endothermic with increasing randomness at the solid solution interface ahmad et al 2009 hong et al 2009 thus a higher temperature is beneficial to promote the adsorption of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps it can thus also be predicted that the accumulation and potential migration risks of the hbcd ps mps for heavy metals are relatively higher in summer than in winter 3 1 3 statistical physics models although the adsorption behaviors of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps were evaluated in the freundlich and langmuir models the obtained results were relatively superficial and devoid of physical statistical meaning hence the statistical physics models were used to further analyze the adsorption processes the most compatible statistical model was chosen based on the comparative r 2 and residual root mean square error rmse values thus the monolayer model with two energies model 2 well described the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii onto the hbcd ps mps fig 2 d e f table s4 this model is based on the assumption that the adsorption process is predominantly monolayer with two types of adsorption sites which is consistent with the langmuir model analysis above and the analysis in section 3 3 below the relevant fitting parameters q sat n i n im and δe are summarized in table s5 and discussed below the saturation adsorption capacity q sat relies on the number of molecules per site n i and the densities of receptor sites n im according to eq 1 1 q s a t i 1 2 q s a t i n 1 n 1 m n 2 n 2 m as expected the q sat and q m values are similar in a range for cu ii 33 275 48 217 μmol g ni ii 15 577 34 751 μmol g and zn ii 9 143 13 557 μmol g which further confirms that the adsorption affinity of the hbcd ps mps for the metals follows cu ii zn ii ni ii meanwhile the q sat values are found to increase with increasing temperature thus implying that the adsorption processes are endothermic li et al 2019b which is in agreement with the above thermodynamic analysis the parameter n i can reflect geometric properties and the aggregation degree of metal ions on the adsorbed surface li et al 2019a in general n i values less than 1 n i 1 indicate that the ions can interact with two or more functional groups of the adsorbent and are distributed horizontally on its surface multi docking mechanism conversely n i values greater than 1 n i 1 suggest the number of docked ions interact with one receptor site multi ion mechanism sellaoui et al 2019 the results of table s5 clearly show that the type i adsorption sites of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps are mainly a multi ion adsorption process with an inclined direction in which multiple ions can aggregate in solution to form a kind of aggregate that is fixed at a single site for example the n i value of cu ii adsorption is 30 289 indicating that each site of the hbcd ps mps could adsorb thirty probability of 71 1 or thirty one probability of 28 9 cu ii ions note that the values of type i receptor sites n 1 are higher than those of the type ii receptor sites n 2 implying a reduced aggregation phenomenon from the type i to type ii receptor sites manaa et al 2020 this can be explained that the type i receptor site is lower in energy for adsorption thus more ions are clustered all of the adsorption energy values δe 1 and δe 2 are greater than 25 kj mol which further verifies that the metals adsorption processes are endothermic and that chemical and physical interactions may be jointly involved in the adsorption processes sellaoui et al 2020 overall the adsorption of the metals onto the hbcd ps mps is dominated by spatial and energetic effects 3 2 effects of water chemistry on the adsorption processes generally some parameters in water environments e g salinity solution ph and dom can significantly affect the interface behaviors of heavy metals onto mps gao et al 2021 in this work the effect of nacl concentrations 0 3 5 as background salinity on cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption were investigated fig 3 a it can be observed that higher nacl concentrations clearly inhibit the adsorption capacities of the cu ii ni ii and zn ii onto the hbcd ps mps this phenomenon may be caused by the competitive action of co existing na ions on limited outer sphere adsorption sites guan et al 2020 lin et al 2022 which is consistent with the above analysis of log k meoh as an indicator parameter for the adsorption affinity adsorption is susceptible to changes in electrolyte concentration if electrostatic attraction and or outer sphere surface complexes are essential mechanisms chen et al 2017 wang 2011 here the results indicate that electrostatic attractions and outer sphere surface complexes may contribute to the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii ions on the hbcd ps mps this finding is consistent with those reported using mps as sorbents to adsorb metal ions from solutions of strong electrolytes qi et al 2021 zou et al 2020 in addition the strong nacl dependence in the solution can also be explained by the complexation of divalent metal ions represented by m2 with cl thus reducing the positive charge carried by metal complex ions as shown in fig s2 and the following eqs 2 5 wang et al 2011 2 m 2 c l mc l 3 m 2 2 c l mc l 2 4 m 2 3 c l mcl 3 5 m 2 4 c l mcl 4 2 fig 3b shows the influence of initial solution ph on the metals adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps the results opresent that the adsorption of the three metal ions decreased with decreasing solution ph especially at solution ph 2 and 3 where the metal ions hardly interacted with the hbcd ps mps this can be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between m2 and hbcd ps mps as analyzed by phzpc on the surface of the hbcd ps mps fig s3 fewer negative charges are exposed to the hbcd ps mps surface with decreasing solution ph however the charges on the hbcd ps mps surface are positive when the solution ph is less than approximately 3 71 ph phzpc thus electrostatic repulsion leads to an inability of metal ions to accumulate on the hbcd ps mps this finding was supported by turner and holmes 2015 who studied the adsorption of ag hg pb ni and cu ions onto virgin polyethylene pe mps fulvic acid fa a kind of typical and abundant dom in natural water environments that is susceptible to complexation with metal ions due to its richness in some active functional groups e g cooh oh and conh2 li et al 2018 tang et al 2021a as depicted in fig 3c the uptake of cu ii and zn ii ions onto the hbcd ps mps sharply decreased as the fa concentration increased from 0 5 to 20 mg l which may be attributed to the formation of fa metal complexes in the aqueous solution tang et al 2014 namely the negatively charged fa molecules can provide active sites for the metal ions adsorption resulting in a competitive effect liu et al 2022b the result was supported by tang et al 2021b who reported that fa inhibited the adsorption of cu ii and zn ii ions onto nylon mps zhao et al 2020 also highlighted the possibility of cd ii complexation with humic acid ha thus reducing the adsorption of cd ii on mps furthermore the stockholm humic model shm was applied to analyze the speciation diagrams of the three metals as a function of fa content gustafsson 2001 it can be seen from fig 3 d e f that the species of cu2 ni2 and zn2 continuously decrease with increasing fa content while the species of fa metal complexes e g fam aq and or fa2m aq and or fa m2 aq continue to increase for cu and zn complexes fa2cu and fa2zn as bidentate complexes may form steric hindrance on the surface of hbcd ps mps and thus inhibit the adsorption behaviors gao et al 2021 notably cu can form more fa2m complexes with fa than zn which well explains that the presence of fa has a relatively greater influence on cu ii adsorption these results further support the above discussion however the presence of fa promotes ni ii adsorption onto the hbcd ps mps and the promotion effect is increased with increasing fa concentration this may be explained by the fact that fani occupies only one active site adsorbed in hbcd ps mps while ni2 must occupy two active sites tang et al 2021b namely fa acts as a bridge between ni ii and hbcd ps mps facilitating ni ii adsorption onto the surface of hbcd ps mps hence the presence of fa can affect the adsorption of heavy metals onto hbcd ps mps which mainly depends on the species formed by the metals and fa in summary these results are useful for assessing the fate and adsorption behavior of the hbcd ps mps with heavy metals that are affected by water chemistry in the aquatic environment 3 3 characterization and proposed adsorption mechanisms the surface morphology and elemental distribution of the hbcd ps mps were observed by sem eds fig 4 as seen in fig 4a the hbcd ps mps have an irregular shape with an uneven and crack filled surface which may provide many contact sites for metals adsorption from the eds mapping fig 4b c d there are c o and br elements on the hbcd ps mps furthermore the content ratio of each element in the hbcd ps mps was determined by an organic elemental analyzer namely 83 16 0 03 c 13 92 0 06 h 1 33 0 09 o and 1 59 0 06 br table s6 among them the oxygen content in the hbcd ps mps is mainly produced by the materials ps and hbcd in the mixing and melting process under the action of mixing conveying and shearing in a twin screw extruder fig s1 this result can be supported by comparing the ftir spectra of the treated ps with the ps namely the new peaks that appeared at 1200 1400 cm 1 are caused by the c o o h stretching vibration fig s2 moreover the presence of oxygen content 1 25 0 15 o in treated ps further confirms this result table s6 after the metals adsorption the cu ni and zn atoms are mainly distributed around the o and br atoms which implies that these metals are principally adsorbed on the groups containing o and br fig 4 furthermore ftir and xps characterizations were applied to analyze the interaction mechanisms between the hbcd ps mps and metals in relation to the role of functional groups as shown in the ftir spectra fig s4 there are some functional groups including c h c c c c c o o h and c br in the hbcd ps mps bhagwat et al 2021 muñoz gonzález et al 2009 among them stretching c o and or bending o h are assigned to the 1200 1400 cm 1 absorption peaks after the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii no significant shift in the position of all absorption peaks occurred however the intensity of the c o o h and c br peaks increased indicating that the c o o h and c br groups may be involved in the adsorption processes of the hbcd ps mps han et al 2013 this result was supported by yu et al 2020 who studied the adsorption of levofloxacin onto polyvinyl chloride pvc mps further evidence can be determined by the xps analysis results the xps full spectrum shows that new cu2p ni2p and zn2p peaks appear after the metals adsorption indicating that cu ii ni ii and zn ii ions are indeed adsorbed onto the hbcd ps mps fig s5 this result can also be supported by the xps high resolution of cu2p ni2p and zn2p spectra fig 5 a the characteristic peaks of cu2p1 2 953 73 and 951 05 ev ni2p1 2 878 47 and 872 67 ev and zn2p1 2 1044 54 ev may be associated with m oh complexes on the hbcd ps mps boughrara et al 2021 hou et al 2018 xiong et al 2021 however the obvious peaks of cu2p3 2 933 94 and 931 43 ev ni2p3 2 860 73 and 855 09 ev and zn2p3 2 1021 54 ev may be related to the binding of the metals to br furthermore the high resolution c1s spectra show that there are some chemical bonds in the hbcd ps mps including c h c c c br c o c oh and π π in the hbcd ps mps fig s6 in which c o c oh corresponds to the o h chemical bonds in the high resolution o1s spectra fig 5b these results are consistent with the above ftir analysis after the metals adsorption the emerging peaks of cu o 530 45 ev ni o 531 41 ev and zn o 531 49 ev in the o1s spectra further confirm the adsorption of these metals onto the hbcd ps mps via oh groups zhao et al 2022 note that the binding energy of c br 285 45 ev and o h 532 57 ev decreases after the metals adsorption while the binding energy of c o c oh increases indicating that electrostatic interactions may be involved in the adsorption processes dong et al 2019 in fact with the growth of the outer electron cloud density the shielding effect of the outer electron cloud on the inner electron cloud significantly increases leading to a decrease in the binding energy of the inner electron cloud dong et al 2020 lin et al 2021b thus oh and br may be involved in the adsorption processes as electron absorbing groups density functional theory dft was used to confirm these adsorption mechanisms based on the above characterization analysis the pbe0 density functional method with the d3 bj dispersion correction was used in this work to carry out all the computations the def2 svp basis set was used for the atoms in geometry optimizations vibrational frequency analyses at the same level of theory were performed on all optimized structures to characterize stationary points as local minima generally hbcd is thermally less stable and starts to decompose into hbr at 150 c and the debromination reaction becomes violent when reaching 190 c therefore according to the process of the hbcd ps mps fabrication and the results of the above characterization we first optimized the structures of the hbcd ps mps molecule n 1 at the b3lyp def2 tzvp level of theory by gaussian 16 six different structures were considered and optimized to predict the most possible structure of graft or block copolymers formed by debrominated hbcd molecules in ps and the appearance of the oh group during preparation their energies were also calculated to compare their relative stability table s7 s8 s9 the six selected structures are based on the most likely structures of debrominated hbcd ps oh and their combinations the results show that the structure denoted by hbcd ps 2 is the energy minimum table s9 thus the hbcd ps 2 molecular is further used to analyze its electrostatic potential and metal coordination as shown in fig 6 the negative electrostatic potential presented on the surface of hbcd ps 2 is almost associated with o and br atoms which confirms that the metal cations can be bound to o and br atoms in hbcd ps 2 through electrostatic interactions wang et al 2020 in addition the coordination formed between hbcd ps 2 and the three metal ions e g cu2 ni2 and zn2 also is predicted and optimized fig 7 it can be seen that the interaction energies of hbcd ps 2 with cu2 303 33 and 312 87 kcal mol are the lowest compared to ni2 277 56 and 269 62 kcal mol and zn2 273 15 and 251 86 kcal mol which implies that the coordination of cu2 and hbcd ps 2 is more stable this result also confirms that the hbcd ps mps have a greater adsorption affinity for cu2 interestingly when the metal ions are coordinated to the o atoms in hbcd ps 2 both of the two nearby br atoms are involved in the reaction which makes them form more stable complexes fig 7a b c this result may be supported by the metals desorption yield of the treated ps hbcd and treated hbcd table s10 the desorption yields of the hbcd ps mps 0 057 14 072 in river water and seawater are much lower than those of the treated ps 5 424 71 365 hbcd 3 021 25 647 and treated hbcd 2 965 25 665 which may imply that there is a stronger force between the hbcd ps mps and metals compared to the treated ps hbcd and treated hbcd therefore the o and br atoms in the hbcd ps mps may be synergistically involved in coordination with the metals moreover the metal ions can be adsorbed by hbcd ps mps via coordination with br atoms fig 7d e f thus these results also emphasize the essential role of hbcd in the hbcd ps mps for the metal ions adsorption overall we conclude that electrostatic interaction and surface complexation are the main mechanisms for the hbcd ps mps to adsorb the metals and the potential interactions between cu ii ni ii and zn ii represented by m2 and the hbcd ps mps can be described as below eqs 6 8 6 x hbcd ps b r o y m 2 z h 2 o hbcd ps b r o x m y oh z 2 y 2 x z z h 7 x hbcd ps b r y m 2 z h 2 o hbcd ps br x m y oh z 2 y x z z h 8 x hbcd ps o y m 2 z h 2 o hbcd ps o x m y oh z 2 y x z z h in which x hbcd ps b r o hbcd ps b r and hbcd ps o are the surface groups in the hbcd ps mps phase hbcd ps b r o x m y oh z 2 y 2 x z hbcd ps br x m y oh z 2 y x z and hbcd ps o x m y oh z 2 y x z represent surface complexes x y and z are stoichiometric coefficients 3 4 potential migration risks the migration risks from one environmental media to another one of the hbcd ps mps for cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption desorption were evaluated by the solid liquid distribution coefficient k d and retention factor r f as follows eqs 9 10 fan et al 2007 sastre et al 2007 9 k d q e c e 10 r f k d d y where c e μmol l is the total dissolved adsorbate concentration remaining in solution at equilibrium q e μmol g is the concentration of adsorbate on the solid at equilibrium and d y is the desorption yields in this work all of the d y values under the river water and seawater are summarized in table s10 the k d based risk model relies on the assumption that metals in the solid phase are in equilibrium with metals in solution and can therefore be exchanged with them however the quantification of k d is affected by the processes flowing through different environments as shown by the desorption yields in different environmental media table s10 thus r f as the ratio of the batch k d values to the desorption yields is an excellent indicator for assessing the relative mobility of target contaminants in the material estimating the vulnerability of pollution event scenarios and predicting potential low or high risk scenarios as seen in table s11 all of the k d values of the hbcd ps mps are higher than those of pure mps and natural minerals which further indicates that the adsorption capacity of the hbcd ps mps for the metals is outstanding in natural environments however the k d values decrease with increasing initial metals content which is due to the adsorption sites of the adsorbent gradually saturated at high concentrations notably the risk of heavy metals release from the hbcd ps mps during migration increases with the number of heavy metals carried by the hbcd ps mps which involves the environmental media at the source of contamination as mentioned in section 3 2 above environmental factors including solution ph salinity and dom concentration play a crucial role in the adsorption processes with greater adsorption capacities of the hbcd ps mps associated with heavy metals at higher ph values and low salinity the rising concentration of fa in the solution increases the amount of adsorbed ni ii but inhibits the adsorption capacities of cu ii and zn ii therefore it is essential to investigate the source of the hbcd ps mps and their associated aqua chemical media when assessing the migration risk of heavy metals loaded the hbcd ps mps from one environmental media to another furthermore r f as the ratio of k d values to desorption yields can effectively assess the relative mobility of contaminants on material thus revealing their potential environmental risks a higher r f value represents lower mobility and environmental risk of the contaminant in the materials sastre et al 2007 the rf values for all scenarios material initial metal content different desorption media combinations are summarized in table 1 we can see that the rf values for all materials are lower at higher metal contents which means that the migration risk of metals in the materials increases with the metal content degree for the different materials the hbcd ps mps exhibit relatively high r f values in all cases which may be attributed to their excellent and stable adsorption ability for the metals as discussed above notably for pure mps e g pa and pe the r f values are far less than those of minerals and hbcd ps mps suggesting that the migration risks of the metals posed by pure mps are relatively high within a certain small range this result also highlights that the addition of hbcd slows the migration of the metals on mps to a small extent however on the other hand it should be mentioned that the metals adsorption by the hbcd ps mps may support a long range transfer from contamination sources to the potential sink like oceans it is also important to note that as shown by the current evidences the environmental conditions of sources and sinks determine the long range transport of the metals carried by the hbcd ps mps it has been reported that up to 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste flow from rivers into the ocean per year huang et al 2022 moreover hbcd was detected in substantial amounts in ps plastics up to 14 5 mg g collected in the coastal region of south korea hong kong canada and japan jang et al 2017 therefore it can be predicted that the hbcd ps mps with high loading of cu ii ni ii and zn ii can be potential secondary sources of these metals in the seawater thus posing a potential ecological risk overall we advocate that hbcd related waste microplastics should be included in coastal sustainable development 4 conclusions herein the potential roles and risks of hbcd inherent in ps mps associated with cu ii ni ii and zn ii adsorption desorption were investigated the results showed that the addition of hbcd greatly promoted the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and zn ii onto the mps the sem eds ftir and xps analyses as well as density functional theory well explained that the metals were mainly adsorbed on the o and br groups of the hbcd ps mps through electrostatic interactions and surface complexation it was noteworthy that the o and br atoms in the hbcd ps mps were synergistically involved in coordination with the metals which made them form more stable complexes for these the log k meoh of the metals could be used as an indicator parameter for the adsorption affinity between the metals and hbcd ps mps regarding environmental factors solution ph salinity and fulvic acid had a great effect on the metals adsorption which was related to the formation of metal complex species and adsorption mechanisms as expected within a certain small range the migration risks of the metals posed by pure mps are relatively high compared to natural minerals however it should be noted that the hbcd inherent in mps enhanced the long range transfer of the metals carried by the hbcd ps mps from contamination sources to the ocean thus the hbcd ps mps with high loading of cu ii ni ii and zn ii could be potential secondary sources of these metals in seawater in summary these results facilitated a deeper understanding of the role of hbcd in the migration and fate of heavy metals in mps we emphasized again that most mps in the environment contain chemical additives and thus the role of chemical additives cannot be ignored when assessing the potential risk of mps in the environment

15467,water desalination using membrane technology is one of the main technologies to resolve water pollution and scarcity issues in the membrane treatment process mineral scale deposition and fouling is a severe challenge that can lead to filtration efficiency decrease permeate quality compromise and even membrane damage multiple methods have been developed to resolve this problem such as scale inhibitor addition product recovery ratio adjustment periodic membrane surface flushing the performance of these methods largely depends on the ability to accurately predict the kinetics of mineral scale deposition and fouling with or without inhibitors gypsum is one of the most common and troublesome inorganic mineral scales in membrane systems however no mechanistic model is available to accurately predict the induction time of gypsum crystallization and inhibition in this study a new gypsum crystallization and inhibition model based on the classical nucleation theory and a langmuir type adsorption isotherm has been developed through this model it is believed that gypsum nucleation may gradually transit from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation when the gypsum saturation index si decreases such transition is represented by a gradual decrease of surface tension at smaller si values this model assumes that the adsorption of inhibitors onto the gypsum nucleus can increase the nucleus superficial surface tension and prolong the induction time using the new model this study accurately predicted the gypsum crystallization induction times with or without nine commonly used scale inhibitors over wide ranges of temperature 25 90 c si 0 04 0 96 and background nacl concentration 0 6 mol l the fitted affinity constants between scale inhibitors and gypsum show a good correlation with those between the same inhibitors and barite indicating a similar inhibition mechanism via adsorption furthermore by incorporating this model with the two phase mineral deposition model our group developed previously this study accurately predicts the gypsum deposition time on the membrane material surfaces reported in the literature we believe that the model developed in this study can not only accurately predict the gypsum crystallization induction time with or without scale inhibitors elucidate the gypsum crystallization and inhibition mechanisms but also optimize the mineral scale control in the membrane filtration system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mineral scale membrane fouling antiscalant deposition data availability data is included in the supplementary information 1 introduction water scarcity is becoming more severe due to the continuously growing population developing economies and increasing water pollutions dai and li 2013 huang et al 2020 yu et al 2019 water desalination has been playing a more important role especially when cost continues to drop ghaffour et al 2013 huang et al 2020 ghaffour et al 2013 reported that the membrane process accounts for 63 7 of the total global desalted water capacity in membrane processes the elevation of ion concentrations the changes of temperature and pressure and the occurrence of concentration polarization can lead to the mineral scale formation and fouling in the membrane system al roomi and hussain 2016 lioliou et al 2006 warsinger et al 2015 yu et al 2019 such inorganic scale formation has become a major limiting factor of membrane system applications lin et al 2005 rabie et al 2001 seidel and elimelech 2002 speth et al 1998 van der bruggen et al 2001 specifically it can decrease the permeation rate increase the osmotic pressure increase contaminant breakthrough and compromise permeate water quality and cause membrane damage huang et al 2020 lin et al 2005 shirazi et al 2010 warsinger et al 2015 gypsum caso4 2h2o calcium sulfate dihydrate is one of the most common inorganic mineral scales in membrane systems warsinger et al 2015 yu et al 2019 since gypsum is not acid soluble and is a tenacious and adherent scale on the membrane surfaces it has become one of the most troublesome scale minerals gryta 2009 to effectively control the gypsum scale problem different strategies have been proposed to ensure the induction time is longer than the crystallization or deposition time in the membrane operation system using different techniques for example the cations i e ca2 and or anions i e so4 2 can be selectively removed to decrease the saturation level of gypsum and thus increase the induction time by ion exchange kelle zeiher et al 2003 mukhopadhyay 2003 or capacitive deionization process using composite electrodes zuo et al 2018 antony et al 2011 suggested to limit the product recovery so that the saturation level of gypsum in the concentrate stream is controlled below a certain saturation level which limited the economic efficiency of membrane system at the same time antony et al 2011 it was also proposed to periodically flush membrane surface or reverse flow directions to shorten the time for crystallization and deposition less than the induction time lee et al 2018 nghiem and cath 2011 pomerantz et al 2006 uchymiak et al 2009 warsinger et al 2015 at the same time various scale inhibitors or antiscalants have been widely used to prolong the induction time al roomi and hussain 2016 antony et al 2011 lin and singer 2005 lioliou et al 2006 rosenberg et al 2012 warsinger et al 2015 yu et al 2019 among all these methods above the accurate prediction of the gypsum crystallization induction time is critical to achieve optimal efficiency the mineral induction time tind is defined as the time elapsed between the establishment of supersaturation and the detection of mineral formation mullin 2001 nielsen 1964 this definition shows that the induction time has a significant practical meaning and it has been widely used to indicate when the damage starts to occur in various processes he et al 1996 knezic et al 2004 mullin 2001 nielsen 1964 van der leeden et al 1992 in previous research different experimental methods were utilized to measure the gypsum induction time including measuring the solution turbidity with a turbidity meter or a laser apparatus he et al 1994a 1994b lancia et al 1999 paudyal et al 2020 measuring the partial pressure change in a dynamic scale loop al roomi and hussain 2016 or measuring the frequency change on a qcm quartz crystal microbalance sensor alimi et al 2003 yan et al 2015 and zhang et al 2017 have confirmed that the induction time achieved by monitoring solution turbidity and partial pressure of tubing are comparable with each other yan et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 using these experimental apparatus the induction time of gypsum crystallization without inhibitors alimi et al 2003 he et al 1994a and with various inhibitors al roomi and hussain 2016 lioliou et al 2006 paudyal et al 2020 prisciandaro et al 2006 rosenberg et al 2012 yu et al 2019 have been determined unfortunately there is not a quantitative model available that can accurately predict gypsum induction time with or without scale inhibitors at different operation conditions he and his colleagues developed semi empirical models for the induction time prediction of calcite barite and celestite with or without scale inhibitors he et al 1999 1996 1995a 1995b 1994b however the induction times of gypsum does not show the similar trend with other minerals and cannot be described by the semi empirical models probably due to the relatively larger solubility and variable surface tension of gypsum at different saturation levels he et al 1994a it was also suggested that the fundamentals of inhibition mechanisms are not well understood with little guidance from literature al roomi and hussain 2016 therefore in order to optimize the gypsum scale control in the membrane system with the methods introduced above a quantitative model with solid theoretical basis is needed to accurately predict the gypsum crystallization induction time with or without inhibitors in this study a new model based on classical nucleation theory cnt with saturation index si dependent surface tension is developed to predict the induction time of gypsum crystallization this mechanistic model shows that the surface tension decreases when the gypsum crystallization transits from homogeneous nucleation at relatively larger si values to heterogeneous nucleation at smaller si values a langmuir type adsorption model was adopted to quantify the impacts of scale inhibitors this new model assumes that the inhibition mechanism is dominated by the inhibitor adsorption to the nucleus surface and the alternation of the effective surface tension and can accurately predict the gypsum crystallization induction time with or without nine commonly used scale inhibitors over wide ranges of temperature 25 90 c si 0 04 0 96 and background nacl concentration 0 6 mol l such good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data supports the validity of this new model this study also accurately predicts the gypsum deposition time on membrane material surfaces that is reported in the literature by incorporating the deposition model our group developed previously using this new model with solid theoretical basis the gypsum scale management strategies can be optimized such as recovery rate flow reversal frequencies inhibitor dosages to mention a few such optimizations can significantly increase membrane operation efficiencies drop the water desalination cost and promote wider applications of membrane technologies as well as other technologies wherein gypsum formation is problematic 2 materials and methods 2 1 induction time testing reagent grade cacl2 2h2o na2so4 and nacl salts were used to prepare solutions the cation cat and anion solution an solutions are prepared separately to include ca2 and so4 2 ions at designed concentrations table s1 respectively the saturation index of gypsum defined as the base ten briggsian logarithms of the ion activity product over the solubility product after mixing the cat and an solutions with equal volume

is plotted the multi channel laser testing apparatus for induction time testing designed by paudyal et al 2020 this apparatus is modified from the single channel laser testing apparatus used in previous research dai et al 2019a dai et al 2017b he et al 1995a yan et al 2015 the customized heating block chemglass cg 1991 03 has seven reaction vial with a volume of 30 ml holders and seven tests can be conducted simultaneously the laser light path was drilled in the heating block with a cross section view shown in fig 1 cat and an solutions were added at the same time into the reaction vial using two pipettes and the recording of induction time was started the heating and stirring is conducted by a digital hot plate stirrer mr hei tec the induction time is picked when the laser signal starts to drop by about 1 which indicates the formation of detectable minerals dai et al 2019b various commonly used scale inhibitors were added with different dosages in the an solution to evaluate the inhibitor impacts the tested inhibitors are listed in table 1 and their structures are plotted in fig 2 the relative errors of the induction time measurement are around 5 2 2 gypsum

equation a represents the activity of each species and equals to the product of the concentration mol kg h2o m and activity coefficient γ ksp is the gypsum solubility product si equals to 0 when the mineral is in equilibrium with the aqueous solution positive when the mineral is supersaturated and has the potential to precipitate and negative when the mineral is undersaturated the si values of each mineral and activity coefficient of each species at different conditions are calculated by the ssp model the supersaturation of minerals will lead to mineral crystallization with the decrease of gibbs free energy and the increase of interfacial energy mullin 2001 söhnel and mullin 1979 1988 assumed that the mineral crystallization started with nucleation followed by polynuclear growth in the crystal growth stage and the induction times were derived as follows nielsen 1964 söhnel and mullin 1988 2 t ind 3 2 π 1 4 v m 5 3 a v 8 3 d 4 c e q 1 4 10 s i 2 10 s i 2 1 2 1 4 exp β v m 2 σ 3 a v 4

second term is due to crystal growth he et al 1994a found that the logarithm of the gypsum crystallization induction time does not follow a simple linear relationship with si 2 as suggested by cnt he et al 1994a such deviation from the cnt was proposed to be because gypsum has two different effective surface tensions one for heterogeneous and one for homogenous nucleation mullin and ang 1976 söhnel and mullin 1988 1978 however this assumption did not specify the transition si value between these two types of nucleation and could lead to an abrupt change of induction time around the transition si which was inconsistent with the experimental observations in this study it is assumed that the gypsum nucleation is dominated by the homogeneous nucleation when the si is large huang et al 2020 lancia et al 1999 mullin 2001 when the gypsum si becomes smaller i e less supersaturated the nucleation process is gradually more dominated by heterogenous nucleation that may happen on the surface of impurities such transition can be represented by a gradual decrease of surface tension using the following sigmoid type of function 3 σ σ 0 1 λ t t 1 a 1 e b s i c where σ0 a b and c are constants to be fitted λt is the temperature dependence coefficient of surface tension it deserves notice that this sigmoid function is selected only to ensure a smooth transition between the homogenous and heterogenous dominated nucleation the calculated value represents the superficial surface tension changing with the supersaturation of gypsum it is proposed that the scale inhibitors will adsorb onto the surface of gypsum nucleus and thereby change the surface tension of the nucleus this mechanism was assumed to be the dominant mechanism in this model the adsorption can be described by a langmuir type adsorption isotherm as follows 4 q e q m k l i n h 1 k l i n h where qe is the effective inhibitor concentration on the nucleus surface mol m2 nucleus surface qm is the maximum inhibitor concentration on the surface mol m2 nucleus surface divide both sides by qm 5 θ k l i n h 1 k l i n h where θ qe qm and is the effective fraction coverage of the surface active sites the adsorption of inhibitors onto the surface of gypsum nucleus can change the surface tension of gypsum nucleus following a linear relationship proposed by eberhart 1996 for a two components binary system eberhart 1966 6 σ x y 1 x y σ x x y σ y where x and y are the two components x y is the mole fraction of component y for most cases the threshold scale inhibitors have a small molar ratio on the surface for example zieba et al 1996 suggested that the effective active site coverage is less than 5 for phosphonate inhibitors on gypsum and barite zieba et al 1996 tomson et al 2003 found that ntmp nitrilomethylene phosphonic acid occupies about 16 effective active sites of barite surface tomson et al 2003 zieba et al 1996 thus the surface tension of nuclei with inhibitor adsorption can be estimated to be 7 σ w i n h σ x x i n h σ i n h where σinh is the surface tension of the inhibitor xinh is proportional to the effective coverage fraction θ as x i n h b θ where b is the molar ratio of the active sites over mineral molecule on the nucleus surface thus the surface tension of gypsum in the presence of inhibitors is 8 σ w i n h σ x b k l i n h 1 k l i n h σ i n h σ x b σ inh k l i n h 1 k l i n h considering that the total adsorbed amount of inhibitor is minimal comparing with the initial total inhibitor concentration during the induction period the equilibrium inhibitor concentration i e inh is estimated to be equal to the initial total inhibitor concentration via minimizing the difference between the predicted and the measured induction time of all experiments table s1 the si dependent interfacial energy of gypsum effective diffusion coefficient interfacial energy of the inhibitor and the adsorption isotherms are optimized the induction time of gypsum with or without the presence of inhibitors can be calculated using the new mechanistic crystallization and inhibition model by substituting equation 8 in equation 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 induction time of gypsum crystallization without inhibitors based on eq 2 the surface tension of gypsum depending on temperature and gypsum si is fitted to be 4 54e 4 1 1 76e 3 t 1 79 19 1 exp 7 45 si 0 125 j m2 in fig 3 is plotted the surface tension changes with si with the red box showing the gypsum si range of the experimental data in this study it is shown the gypsum surface tension is about 17 26 mj m2 at large gypsum si values e g 1 1 at such high si values it is suggested that nucleation is homogeneous when si value drops the surface tension gradually decreases with the inflection point of si around 0 125 at si values above 0 48 the gypsum surface tension is above 90 of the homogeneous surface tension such surface tension change indicates the gradual transition from pure homogenous nucleation at large si values to the co occurrence of homogenous and heterogeneous nucleation at relatively lower si values in previous research it was proposed that mineral deposition can be initiated by two pathways 1 homogenous nucleation in the solution followed by solids attachment to the surface and 2 heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization directly on the surface huang et al 2020 matin et al 2019 the second path is believed to be more energy favorable and happens at low si values matin et al 2019 which matches with what has been observed in this study in fig 4 is plotted the induction time of gypsum without the presence of inhibitors changing with si 2 at different temperatures the comparison between the measured and predicted log10 tind at all conditions are plotted in the first subplot of fig 5 note that log10 tind does not follow a linear relationship with si 2 as predicted by cnt the si dependent surface tension fitted above equation 3 accurately explains such deviations from cnt at higher temperatures the new model prediction shows a larger deviation which might be due to potential phase change to hemihydrate or anhydrite at higher temperatures blount and dickson 1973 it was reported that the transition temperature between gypsum and anhydrite at 1 atm is around 40 c and gypsum is the dominant phase at temperatures below 40 c lu et al 2012 rolnick 1954 3 2 induction time of gypsum crystallization with inhibitors in fig 5 is plotted the comparison of the predicted and measured log10 tind with the presence and absence of various inhibitors at different conditions table 2 the background ionic strength is picked to cover the extreme conditions that may occur during various industrial processes e g heat exchange concentration polarization in membrane systems produced water production in the oil and gas production and geotherm energy exploitation most of the data lie along the 1 1 line within the 0 5 error band indicating the accuracy of this model due to the relative large uncertainty of such induction time measurements a 0 7 error band was used in previous research reznik et al 2012 in figs 6 and 7 are plotted the specific examples showing the comparison between measured symbols and predicted lines log10 tind of gypsum crystallization changing with inhibitor concentrations it was observed that different from that of the barite and calcite crystallization kinetics dai et al 2019a 2020 2017b he et al 1999 1996 1994b the log10 tind does not follow a linear relationship with the inhibitor concentration especially when the inhibitor concentrations are large such non linear correlations make the empirical models proposed before i e log 10 t i n d log 10 t i n d 0 b c i n h i b i t o r inapplicable to the gypsum crystallization and inhibition kinetics predictions the predicted induction times using this new model and the measured predicted induction times show good agreement with a few exceptions for some conditions for bhpmp hdtmp and ppca potentially due to experimental error especially for those cases wherein the induction time is longer than 2 h or more when large uncertainties exist or the lack of temperature dependence of the inhibitor surface tension such agreement also validates the assumption that scale inhibitors prolong the induction time by adsorbing onto nucleus surface following a langmuir type adsorption isotherm the wide ranges of temperature gypsum si and background nacl concentration give this model the potential to be widely applied to different industrial conditions furthermore once a single measurement of tind is made for any specific set of conditions and inhibitor concentration calculation of the effect of changing any specific condition or concentration from the initially measured value is reliable principally because this model is mechanistically based 3 3 adsorption of inhibitors on gypsum in table 3 are listed the fitted bσinh and kl values in eq 8 of different inhibitors for gypsum crystallization from this study the bσinh values indicate the maximum surface tension change if a large amount of scale inhibitor k l i n h 1 were available for example at large inhibitor concentrations hdtmp and ntmp show the largest surface tension change i e most effective of 117 and 120 mj m2 respectively while pvs shows the smallest surface tension change i e least effective of 51 mj m2 the b term is the molar ratio of inhibitors over the mineral molecules on the nucleus surface which was reported to be ranging from 5 zieba et al 1996 p 199 to 16 tomson et al 2003 on different minerals and inhibitor types thus the superficial surface tension of each inhibitor can be estimated by dividing the bσinh value with the estimated b term value the kl values represent the affinity of inhibitors to the mineral nucleus when inhibitor concentration is 1 kl the surface tension change is half of the maximum surface tension change i e 0 5 bσinh thus the inhibitors with smaller kl values e g cmi ntmp and hedp have weaker affinity to the mineral surface and require larger inhibitor concentrations mol l to reach their maximum efficiency the kl values between the inhibitors and celestite were fitted from the celestite crystallization induction times and are listed in table 3 zhao et al 2022 it was observed that the kl values of the three inhibitors i e dtpmp ppca and pvs with gypsum and celestite follow a linear relationship with slope of 1 07 and r2 of 0 9989 that implies that the inhibitors with a strong affinity to gypsum usually represent a strong affinity to celestite as well the kl values between the inhibitors and other minerals i e barite hydroxyapatite and calcite were also calculated from crystal growth and dissolution rate changes more studies to understand such differences will be valuable 3 4 applications in membrane system management this new model by substituting eq 8 in eq 2 can be used in understanding the gypsum crystallization and deposition or fouling for example huang et al 2020 studied the impacts of surface hydrophobicity on gypsum deposition huang et al 2020 they ran the testing at two different conditions table 4 to represent the homogeneous nucleation pathway at a higher si condition 1 and the heterogeneous nucleation pathway at a smaller si condition 2 respectively under condition 1 the predicted induction time and the two measured induction times are probably within experimental error in addition under this condition the surface tension is more than 90 of the homogenous nucleation surface tension equation 3 indicating that homogeneous nucleation will be dominated which matched reasonably well with their experimental results under condition 2 the predicted induction time matched well with the induction times measured by he et al 1996 and huang et al 2020 different than condition 1 huang et al 2020 believed that under condition 2 heterogeneous nucleation is dominated and thus they used qcm d quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation to monitor the deposition onto membrane material surfaces instead of using dls dynamic light scattering to monitor bulk crystallization according to the mineral crystallization surface deposition platform our group developed dai et al 2021 lu et al 2020a 2020b 2019 it is believed that the first phase deposition happens in the stagnant laminar sublayer following the same bulk crystallization kinetics the good agreement between the detection of surface deposition by huang et al 2020 with the bulk crystallization induction time measured by he et al 1994a and predicted by this study further confirms the validity of the gypsum crystallization model proposed in this study and the mineral crystallization surface deposition platform proposed previously dai et al 2021 the utility of having this complete crystallization and inhibition model is apparent in addition to predicting the initial induction times the impact on crystallization by varying the conditions temperature saturation index etc or addition of small amounts of threshold inhibitor can readily be calculated for example under condition 1 the addition of 1 mg l of ppca can prolong the induction time to about 17 5 h i e 104 80 s that means in a membrane water treatment system the addition of 1 mg l of ppca in the concentrate side can significantly reduce the periodical feed water flush frequency by a factor of 30 times if keeping the same recovery ratio 4 conclusions the unexpected mineral scale deposition and fouling in the membrane system has been one of the main reasons that limit the wide applications of membrane treatment technology however few mechanistic models are available to accurately predict the induction time of gypsum one of the most common and troublesome scale minerals this study developed a new crystallization and inhibition model based on the classical nucleation theory this model assumes that the gypsum surface tension is dependent on si at more supersaturated conditions the surface tension is larger and is homogeneous nucleation dominated at less saturated conditions the surface tension gradually decreases with more occurrences of heterogeneous nucleation a sigmoid function is used to describe such gradual transition from homogenous to heterogeneous nucleation this model accurately predicts the gypsum crystallization induction time at conditions of si from 0 04 to 0 96 temperature from25 to 90 c background nacl salt concentration from 0 to 6 mol l a langmuir type adsorption isotherm is adopted to describe the adsorption of inhibitors to the gypsum nucleus surface the surface tension of the gypsum nucleus will increase due to the inhibitor adsorption this study used this new model and accurately predicted the induction time of gypsum crystallization in the presence and absence of nine commonly used scale inhibitors the fitted affinity constants kl between these inhibitors and gypsum shows a good linear relationship with those between the same inhibitors and barite implying a similar adsorption mechanism this study successfully adopts the new crystallization model and resolves the long unsolved problem of gypsum crystallization kinetics prediction with or without the dosage of various scale inhibitors by incorporating the mineral surface deposition model developed before this model can accurately predict the deposition time of gypsum on the membrane material surface the utility of this model can help accurately evaluate the impacts of temperature saturation index and scale inhibitors such predictions can help improve the operational efficiency of membrane systems including product water recovery periodical feed water flush frequency scale inhibitor type

15467,water desalination using membrane technology is one of the main technologies to resolve water pollution and scarcity issues in the membrane treatment process mineral scale deposition and fouling is a severe challenge that can lead to filtration efficiency decrease permeate quality compromise and even membrane damage multiple methods have been developed to resolve this problem such as scale inhibitor addition product recovery ratio adjustment periodic membrane surface flushing the performance of these methods largely depends on the ability to accurately predict the kinetics of mineral scale deposition and fouling with or without inhibitors gypsum is one of the most common and troublesome inorganic mineral scales in membrane systems however no mechanistic model is available to accurately predict the induction time of gypsum crystallization and inhibition in this study a new gypsum crystallization and inhibition model based on the classical nucleation theory and a langmuir type adsorption isotherm has been developed through this model it is believed that gypsum nucleation may gradually transit from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation when the gypsum saturation index si decreases such transition is represented by a gradual decrease of surface tension at smaller si values this model assumes that the adsorption of inhibitors onto the gypsum nucleus can increase the nucleus superficial surface tension and prolong the induction time using the new model this study accurately predicted the gypsum crystallization induction times with or without nine commonly used scale inhibitors over wide ranges of temperature 25 90 c si 0 04 0 96 and background nacl concentration 0 6 mol l the fitted affinity constants between scale inhibitors and gypsum show a good correlation with those between the same inhibitors and barite indicating a similar inhibition mechanism via adsorption furthermore by incorporating this model with the two phase mineral deposition model our group developed previously this study accurately predicts the gypsum deposition time on the membrane material surfaces reported in the literature we believe that the model developed in this study can not only accurately predict the gypsum crystallization induction time with or without scale inhibitors elucidate the gypsum crystallization and inhibition mechanisms but also optimize the

the supplementary information 1 introduction water scarcity is becoming more severe due to the continuously growing population developing economies and increasing water pollutions dai and li 2013 huang et al 2020 yu et al 2019 water desalination has been playing a more important role especially when cost continues to drop ghaffour et al 2013 huang et al 2020 ghaffour et al 2013 reported that the membrane process accounts for 63 7 of the total global desalted water capacity in membrane processes the elevation of ion concentrations the changes of temperature and pressure and the occurrence of concentration polarization can lead to the mineral scale formation and fouling in the membrane system al roomi and hussain 2016 lioliou et al 2006 warsinger et al 2015 yu et al 2019 such inorganic scale formation has become a major limiting factor of membrane system applications lin et al 2005 rabie et al 2001 seidel and elimelech 2002 speth et al 1998 van der bruggen et al 2001 specifically it can decrease the permeation rate increase the osmotic pressure increase contaminant breakthrough and compromise permeate water quality and cause membrane damage huang et al 2020 lin et al 2005 shirazi et al 2010 warsinger et al 2015 gypsum caso4 2h2o calcium sulfate dihydrate is one of the most common inorganic mineral scales in membrane systems warsinger et al 2015 yu et al 2019 since gypsum is not acid soluble and is a tenacious and adherent scale on the membrane surfaces it has become one of the most troublesome scale minerals gryta 2009 to effectively control the gypsum scale problem different strategies have been proposed to ensure the induction time is longer than the crystallization or deposition time in the membrane operation system using different techniques for example the cations i e ca2 and or anions i e so4 2 can be selectively removed to decrease the saturation level of gypsum and thus increase the induction time by ion exchange kelle zeiher et al 2003 mukhopadhyay 2003 or capacitive deionization process using composite electrodes zuo et al 2018 antony et al 2011 suggested to limit the product recovery so that the saturation level of gypsum in the concentrate stream is controlled below a certain saturation level which limited the economic efficiency of membrane system at the same time antony et al 2011 it was also proposed to periodically flush membrane surface or reverse flow directions to shorten the time for crystallization and deposition less than the induction time lee et al 2018 nghiem and cath 2011 pomerantz et al 2006 uchymiak et al 2009 warsinger et al 2015 at the same time various scale inhibitors or antiscalants have been widely used to prolong the induction time al roomi and hussain 2016 antony et al 2011 lin and singer 2005 lioliou et al 2006 rosenberg et al 2012 warsinger et al 2015 yu et al 2019 among all these methods above the accurate prediction of the gypsum crystallization induction time is critical to achieve optimal efficiency the mineral induction time tind is defined as the time elapsed between the establishment of supersaturation and the detection of mineral formation mullin 2001 nielsen 1964 this definition shows that the induction time has a significant practical meaning and it has been widely used to indicate when the damage starts to occur in various processes he et al 1996 knezic et al 2004 mullin 2001 nielsen 1964 van der leeden et al 1992 in previous research different experimental methods were utilized to measure the gypsum induction time including measuring the solution turbidity with a turbidity meter or a laser apparatus he et al 1994a 1994b lancia et al 1999 paudyal et al 2020 measuring the partial pressure change in a dynamic scale loop al roomi and hussain 2016 or measuring the frequency change on a qcm quartz crystal microbalance sensor alimi et al 2003 yan et al 2015 and zhang et al 2017 have confirmed that the induction time achieved by monitoring solution turbidity and partial pressure of tubing are comparable with each other yan et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 using these experimental apparatus the induction time of gypsum crystallization without inhibitors alimi et al 2003 he et al 1994a and with various inhibitors al roomi and hussain 2016 lioliou et al 2006 paudyal et al 2020 prisciandaro et al 2006 rosenberg et al 2012 yu et al 2019 have been determined unfortunately there is not a quantitative model available that can accurately predict gypsum induction time with or without scale inhibitors at different operation conditions he and his colleagues developed semi empirical models for the induction time prediction of calcite barite and celestite with or without scale inhibitors he et al 1999 1996 1995a 1995b 1994b however the induction times of gypsum does not show the similar trend with other minerals and cannot be described by the semi empirical models probably due to the relatively larger solubility and variable surface tension of gypsum at different saturation levels he et al 1994a it was also suggested that the fundamentals of inhibition mechanisms are not well understood with little guidance from literature al roomi and hussain 2016 therefore in order to optimize the gypsum scale control in the membrane system with the methods introduced above a quantitative model with solid theoretical basis is needed to accurately predict the gypsum crystallization induction time with or without inhibitors in this study a new model based on classical nucleation theory cnt with saturation index si dependent surface tension is developed to predict the induction time of gypsum crystallization this mechanistic model shows that the surface tension decreases when the gypsum crystallization transits from homogeneous nucleation at relatively larger si values to heterogeneous nucleation at smaller si values a langmuir type adsorption model was adopted to quantify the impacts of scale inhibitors this new model assumes that the inhibition mechanism is dominated by the inhibitor adsorption to the nucleus surface and the alternation of the effective surface tension and can accurately predict the gypsum crystallization induction time with or without nine commonly used scale inhibitors over wide ranges of temperature 25 90 c si 0 04 0 96 and background nacl concentration 0 6 mol l such good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data supports the validity of this new model this study also accurately predicts the gypsum deposition time on membrane material surfaces that is reported in the literature by incorporating the deposition model our group developed previously using this new model with solid theoretical basis the gypsum scale management strategies can be optimized such as recovery rate flow reversal frequencies inhibitor dosages to mention a few such optimizations can significantly increase membrane operation efficiencies drop the water desalination cost and promote wider applications of membrane technologies as well as other technologies wherein gypsum formation is problematic 2 materials and methods 2 1 induction time testing reagent grade

using two pipettes and the recording of induction time was started the heating and stirring is conducted by a digital hot plate stirrer mr hei tec the induction time is picked when the laser signal starts to drop by about 1 which indicates the formation of detectable minerals dai et al 2019b various commonly used scale inhibitors were added with different dosages in the an solution to evaluate the inhibitor impacts the tested inhibitors are listed in table 1 and their structures are plotted in fig 2 the relative errors of the induction time measurement are around 5 2 2 gypsum

equation a represents the activity of each species and equals to the product of the concentration mol kg h2o m and activity coefficient γ ksp is the gypsum solubility product si equals to 0 when the mineral is in equilibrium with the aqueous solution positive when the mineral is supersaturated and has the potential to precipitate and negative when the mineral is undersaturated the si values of each mineral and activity coefficient of each species at different conditions are calculated by the ssp model the supersaturation of minerals will lead to mineral crystallization with the decrease of gibbs free energy and the increase of interfacial energy mullin 2001 söhnel and mullin 1979 1988 assumed that the mineral crystallization started with nucleation followed by polynuclear growth in the

second term is due to crystal growth he et al 1994a found that the logarithm of the gypsum crystallization induction time does not follow a simple linear relationship with si 2 as suggested by cnt he et al 1994a such deviation from the cnt was proposed to be because gypsum has two different effective surface tensions one for heterogeneous and one for homogenous nucleation mullin and ang 1976 söhnel and mullin 1988 1978 however this assumption did not specify the transition si value between these two types of nucleation and could lead to an abrupt change of induction time around the transition si which was inconsistent with the experimental observations in this study it is assumed that the gypsum nucleation is dominated by the homogeneous nucleation when the si is large huang et al 2020 lancia et al 1999 mullin 2001 when the gypsum si becomes smaller i e less supersaturated the nucleation process is gradually more dominated by heterogenous nucleation that may happen on the surface of impurities such transition can be represented by a gradual decrease of surface tension using the following sigmoid type of function 3 σ σ 0 1 λ t t 1 a 1 e b s i c where σ0 a b and c are constants to be fitted λt is the temperature dependence coefficient of surface tension it deserves notice that this sigmoid function is selected only to ensure a smooth transition between the homogenous and heterogenous dominated nucleation the calculated value represents the superficial surface tension changing with the supersaturation of gypsum it is proposed that the scale inhibitors will adsorb onto the surface of gypsum nucleus and thereby change the surface tension of the nucleus this mechanism was assumed to be the dominant mechanism in this model the adsorption can be

the adsorption of inhibitors onto the surface of gypsum nucleus can change the surface tension of gypsum nucleus following a linear relationship proposed by eberhart 1996 for a two components binary

ntmp nitrilomethylene phosphonic acid occupies about 16 effective active sites of barite surface tomson et al 2003 zieba et al 1996 thus the surface tension of nuclei with inhibitor adsorption can be estimated to be 7 σ w i n h σ x x i n h σ i n h where σinh is the surface tension of the inhibitor xinh is proportional to the effective coverage fraction θ as x i n h b θ where b is the molar ratio

nucleation at large si values to the co occurrence of homogenous and heterogeneous nucleation at relatively lower si values in previous research it was proposed that mineral deposition can be initiated by two pathways 1 homogenous nucleation in the solution followed by solids attachment to the surface and 2 heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization directly on the surface huang et al 2020 matin et al 2019 the second path is believed to be more energy favorable and happens at low si values matin et al 2019 which matches with what has been observed in this study in fig 4 is plotted the induction time of gypsum without the presence of inhibitors changing with si 2 at different temperatures the comparison between the measured and predicted log10 tind at all conditions are plotted in the first subplot of fig 5 note that log10 tind does not follow a linear relationship with si 2 as predicted by cnt the si dependent surface tension fitted above equation 3 accurately explains such deviations from cnt at higher temperatures the new model prediction shows a larger deviation which might be due to potential phase change to hemihydrate or anhydrite at higher temperatures blount and dickson 1973 it was reported that the transition temperature between gypsum and anhydrite at 1 atm is around 40 c and gypsum is the dominant phase at temperatures below 40 c lu et al 2012 rolnick 1954 3 2 induction time of gypsum crystallization with inhibitors in fig 5 is plotted the comparison of the predicted and measured log10 tind with the presence and absence of various inhibitors at different conditions table 2 the background ionic strength is picked to cover the extreme conditions that may occur during various industrial processes e g heat exchange concentration polarization in membrane systems produced water production in the oil and gas production and geotherm energy exploitation most of the data lie along the 1 1 line within the 0 5 error band indicating the accuracy of this model due to the relative large uncertainty of such induction time measurements a 0 7 error band was used in previous research reznik et al 2012 in figs 6 and 7 are plotted the specific examples showing the comparison between measured symbols and predicted lines log10 tind of gypsum crystallization changing with inhibitor concentrations it was observed that different from that of the barite and calcite crystallization kinetics dai et al 2019a 2020 2017b he et al 1999 1996 1994b the log10 tind does not follow a linear relationship with the inhibitor concentration especially when the inhibitor concentrations are large such non linear correlations make the empirical models proposed before i e log 10 t i n d log 10 t i n d 0 b c i n h i b i t o r inapplicable to the gypsum crystallization and inhibition kinetics predictions the predicted induction times using this new model and the measured predicted induction times show good agreement with a few exceptions for some conditions for bhpmp hdtmp and ppca potentially due to experimental error especially for those cases wherein the induction time is longer than 2 h or more when large uncertainties exist or the lack of temperature dependence of the inhibitor surface tension such agreement also validates the assumption that scale inhibitors prolong the induction time by adsorbing onto nucleus surface following a langmuir type adsorption isotherm the wide ranges of temperature gypsum si and background nacl concentration give this model the potential to be widely applied to different industrial conditions furthermore once a single measurement of tind is made for any specific set of conditions and inhibitor concentration calculation of the effect of changing any specific condition or concentration from the initially measured value is reliable principally because this model is mechanistically based 3 3 adsorption of inhibitors on gypsum in table 3 are listed the fitted bσinh and kl values in eq 8 of different inhibitors for gypsum crystallization from this study the bσinh values indicate the maximum surface tension change if a large amount of scale inhibitor k l i n h 1 were available for example at large inhibitor concentrations hdtmp and ntmp show the largest surface tension change i e most effective of 117 and 120 mj m2 respectively while pvs shows the smallest surface tension change i e least effective of 51 mj m2 the b term is the molar ratio of inhibitors over the mineral molecules on the nucleus surface which was reported to be ranging from 5 zieba et al 1996 p 199 to 16 tomson et al 2003 on different minerals and inhibitor types thus the superficial surface tension of each inhibitor can be estimated by dividing the bσinh value with the estimated b term value the kl values represent the affinity of inhibitors to the mineral nucleus when inhibitor concentration is 1 kl the surface tension change is half of the maximum surface tension change i e 0 5 bσinh thus the inhibitors with smaller kl values e g cmi ntmp and hedp have weaker affinity to the mineral surface and require larger inhibitor concentrations mol l to reach their maximum efficiency the kl values between the inhibitors and celestite were fitted from the celestite crystallization induction times and are listed in table 3 zhao et al 2022 it was observed that the kl values of the three inhibitors i e dtpmp ppca and pvs with gypsum and celestite follow a linear relationship with slope of 1 07 and r2 of 0 9989 that implies that the inhibitors with a strong affinity to gypsum usually represent a strong affinity to celestite as well the kl values between the inhibitors and other minerals i e barite hydroxyapatite and calcite were also calculated from crystal growth and dissolution rate changes more studies to understand such differences will be valuable 3 4 applications in membrane system management this new model by substituting eq 8 in eq 2 can be used in understanding the gypsum crystallization and deposition or fouling for example huang et al 2020 studied the impacts of surface hydrophobicity on gypsum deposition huang et al 2020 they ran the testing at two different conditions table 4 to represent the homogeneous nucleation pathway at a higher si condition 1 and the heterogeneous nucleation pathway at a smaller si condition 2 respectively under condition 1 the predicted induction time and the two measured induction times are probably within experimental error in addition under this condition the surface tension is more than 90 of the homogenous nucleation surface tension equation 3 indicating that homogeneous nucleation will be dominated which matched reasonably well with their experimental results under condition 2 the predicted induction time matched well with the induction times measured by he et al 1996 and huang et al 2020 different than condition 1 huang et al 2020 believed that under condition 2 heterogeneous nucleation is dominated and thus they used qcm d quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation to monitor the deposition onto membrane material surfaces instead of using dls dynamic light scattering to monitor bulk crystallization according to the mineral crystallization surface deposition platform our group developed dai et al 2021 lu et al 2020a 2020b 2019 it is believed that the first phase deposition happens in the stagnant laminar sublayer following the same bulk crystallization kinetics the good agreement between the detection of surface deposition by huang et al 2020 with the bulk crystallization induction time measured by he et al 1994a and predicted by this study further confirms the validity of the gypsum crystallization model proposed in this study and the mineral crystallization surface deposition platform proposed previously dai et al 2021 the utility of having this complete crystallization and inhibition model is apparent in addition to predicting the initial induction times the impact on crystallization by varying the conditions temperature saturation index etc or addition of small amounts of threshold inhibitor can readily be calculated for example under condition 1 the addition of 1 mg l of ppca can prolong the induction time to about 17 5 h i e 104 80 s that means in a membrane water treatment system the addition of 1 mg l of ppca in the concentrate side can significantly reduce the periodical feed water flush frequency by a factor of 30 times if keeping the same recovery ratio 4 conclusions the unexpected mineral scale deposition and fouling in the membrane system has been one of the main reasons that limit the wide applications of membrane treatment technology however few mechanistic models are available to accurately predict the induction time of gypsum one of the most common and troublesome scale minerals this study developed a new crystallization and inhibition model based on the classical nucleation theory this model assumes that the gypsum surface tension is dependent on si at more supersaturated conditions the surface tension is larger and is homogeneous nucleation dominated at less saturated conditions the surface tension gradually decreases with more occurrences of heterogeneous nucleation a sigmoid function is used to describe such gradual transition from homogenous to heterogeneous nucleation this model accurately predicts the gypsum crystallization induction time at conditions of si from 0 04 to 0 96 temperature from25 to 90 c background nacl salt concentration from 0 to 6 mol l a langmuir type adsorption isotherm is adopted to describe the adsorption of inhibitors to the gypsum nucleus surface the surface tension of the gypsum nucleus will increase due to the inhibitor adsorption this study used this new model and accurately predicted the induction time of gypsum crystallization in the presence and absence of nine commonly used scale inhibitors the fitted affinity constants kl between these inhibitors and gypsum shows a good linear relationship with those between the same inhibitors and barite implying a similar adsorption mechanism this study successfully adopts the new crystallization model and resolves the long unsolved problem of gypsum crystallization kinetics prediction with or without the dosage of various scale inhibitors by incorporating the mineral surface deposition model developed before this model can accurately predict the deposition time of gypsum on the membrane material surface the utility of this model can help accurately evaluate the impacts of temperature saturation index and scale inhibitors such predictions can help improve the operational efficiency of membrane systems including product water recovery periodical feed water flush frequency scale inhibitor type

15468,chlorination of a typical anticancer drug with annually ascending use and global prevalence methotrexate mtx in water has been studied in addition to the analysis of kinetics in different water wastewater matrices high resolution product identification and in depth secondary risk evaluation which were eagerly urged in the literature were performed it was found that the oxidation of mtx by free available chlorine fac followed first order kinetics with respect to fac and first order kinetics with respect to mtx the ph dependent rate constants k app ranged from 170 00 m 1 s 1 ph 5 0 to 2 68 m 1 s 1 ph 9 0 the moiety specific kinetic analysis suggested that 6 model substructures of mtx exhibited similar reactivity to the parent compound at ph 7 0 the presence of br greatly promoted mtx chlorination at ph 5 0 9 0 which may be ascribed to the formation of bromine with higher reactivity than fac comparatively coexisting i or humic acid inhibited the degradation of mtx by fac notably chlorination effectively abated mtx in different real water matrices the liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry analysis of multiple matrix mediated chlorinated samples indicated the generation of nine transformation products tps of mtx among which seven were identified during fac oxidation for the first time in addition to the reported electrophilic chlorination of mtx the major and dominant reaction pathway the initial attacks on the amide and tertiary amine moieties with c n bond cleavage constitute novel reaction mechanisms no genotoxicity was observed for mtx or chlorinated solutions thereof whereas some tps were estimated to show multi endpoint aquatic toxicity and higher biodegradation recalcitrance than mtx the chlorinated mixtures of mtx with or without br showed a significant ability to increase the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid carried antibiotic resistance genes within bacteria overall this work thoroughly examines the reaction

cancer related deaths worldwide in 2020 wild et al 2020 consequently large quantities of various synthetic anticancer drugs with different structures have been produced they are increasingly used to inhibit cellular proliferation during chemotherapeutic treatment wormington et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 among these frequently prescribed pharmaceuticals methotrexate mtx is commonly applied as an antimetabolite for the rapid disruption of folate metabolism and dna synthesis in growing tumor cells lai et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 the mtx molecule is structurally composed of several different moieties including 4 aminobenzamide 2 4 diamino 6 methylpteridine and l glutamic acid table s1 nevertheless the efficiency of mtx metabolism is low in patients and mtx shows structural recalcitrance to conventional water treatment processes these characteristics have resulted in the continuous discharge and ubiquitous distribution of mtx in global water environments such as wastewater effluents receiving surface water and finished drinking water systems li et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 in particular relatively high concentrations of mtx have been found in hospital effluents which are hotspots for pharmaceuticals ranging from a few to thousands of ng l in different countries mukherjee et al 2021 wormington et al 2020 recent publications have extensively reported multiple adverse health effects e g endocrine disrupting activity cytotoxicity and mutagenicity on aquatic species of different trophic levels triggered by mtx at its trace concentrations li et al 2021 mukherjee et al

the monochloro mtx product exhibited in silico carcinogenicity genotoxicity mutagenicity and in vitro inhibition of the proliferation of zebrafish liver cells the authors of both studies strongly urged the future application of high resolution analytical techniques for product identification and the evaluation of secondary environmental risks similarly electrochemical transformation photocatalysis and metal based oxidation result in higher toxicity of the reaction products relative to mtx itself lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the detection of monochloro mtx and dichloro mtx in real hospital effluents further suggested their persistence and possible environmental impacts yin et al 2017 additionally the potential for treatment driven higher toxicity of other anticancer drugs in water has been highlighted in our recent study zhang et al 2021 however detailed information regarding the ph dependent chlorination kinetics of mtx generation of other

chlorination of mtx and in depth investigations are required to better understand the environmental fate and risks of these products to fill the knowledge gaps in the literature the goals of the

3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination kinetics of mtx and its substructures in this study the time dependent degradation of mtx by excess fac levels was analyzed at varying ph values ph 5 0 9 0 following pseudo first order kinetics as indicated by linear plots r 2 0 95 0 99 fig 1 a no self decomposition of mtx was observed in the absence of fac during the reaction time fig s1 the linear correlation of the determined pseudo first order rate constants and the initial concentrations of fac fig s2 suggested that the overall oxidation reaction followed second order kinetics i e first order with respect to fac and first order with respect to mtx this can be described by considering the speciation of mtx and fac in eqs 1 and 2 furthermore the residual levels of fac were also monitored fig s3 accordingly the associated apparent second order rate constants k app hocl and half lives of mtx and fac were calculated and are shown in table s3 and fig 1b it is noted that the k app hocl values presented a reverse ph dependent trend i e the stepwise enhancement from 2 68 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 0 with a half life of 1243 78 min to 170 00 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 0 with a half life of 19 61

2002 which is in agreement with the higher rate observed at lower ph the reaction kinetics could be well modeled using eqs 3 and 4 and a kinetic model was established to estimate the ph dependent k app hocl values fig 1b this could be done by considering the intrinsic k results for each elementary reaction as presented in table 1 which were measured using nonlinear least square regression the

removal after 72 h of reaction fig s5 this result is in contrast with that of apt and needs further investigation overall mtx and most of the selected organic moieties exhibited largely similar reactivity to fac which was consistent with their abatement within the uv tio2 system lai et al 2017 3 2 effect of halide ions and ha on chlorination kinetics of mtx in this study cl br and i at different levels were individually introduced into the chlorination system of mtx at ph 7 0 buffered by 10 0 mm phosphate solution interestingly br enhanced mtx elimination in a dose dependent manner reducing the time for complete removal from 30 min no br addition to 4 min 10 0 μm br fig 2 a this might be ascribed to the rapid formation k 1550 m 1 s 1 of hypobromous acid hobr from the reaction between hocl and br lee and von gunten 2009 similar enhancement of br has also been observed during chlorination of some other organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons hu et al 2006 liu et al 2021 diclofenac dong et al 2018 and 17α ethinylestradiol lee and von gunten 2009 the k app hobr values of hobr and mtx under different ph conditions were determined following the competition kinetic method as described by lee and von gunten 2009 and yoom et al 2018 the much higher k app hobr values ranging from 8 00 104 m 1 s 1 ph 7 0 half life 2 50 s to 1 04 105 m 1 s 1 ph 9

resulting fits of data are depicted in fig 2c with the corresponding k app hobr and each k ij α i β j term in eqs 11 and 12 comparatively the mtx degradation was slightly inhibited in the presence of cl i and ha at ph 7 0 figs s6 2d and e a similar influence of cl was also reported for chlorodimethenamid formation during chlorination of herbicide dimethenamid at neutral ph whereas enhanced rate constants were reported with 3 30 mm cl under acidic ph conditions sivey et al 2010 it is known that i can be rapidly oxidized by fac to form hoi k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 which equilibrates to yield multiple iodine containing species e g i2 h2oi and hoi2 vikesland et al 2013 recent publications have observed the enhanced role of i in the chlorination of phenolic contaminants and diclofenac which may be attributed to their higher reactivity with hoi than fac dong et al 2018 vikesland et al 2013 in this sense our study suggests that hoi may possess a slower reaction with mtx than fac did no mineralization of mtx by fac oxidation with or without the addition of these halide ions was observed fig s8 suggesting the formation of recalcitrant tps in these systems additionally the introduction of 0 5 0 mg l ha inhibited the chlorination efficiency of mtx from 92 to 80 after 30 min of treatment the inhibitory role of ha has also been reported during the chlorination of bisphenol s and bromophenols gao et al 2018 xiang et al 2021 in which ha was proposed to inhibit the electron transfer reactions for phenoxyl radical formation overall ha induced pollutant inhibition mainly involves

water matrices to evaluate the reaction of fac with mtx in natural water and wastewater matrices 1 0 μm mtx was spiked into the collected wastewater effluent and pre disinfected drinking water fac was dosed at a substantial excess than mtx i e fac mtx 50 1 which simulated a pseudo first order reaction for kinetic modeling of mtx elimination eq 15 dodd et al 2005 dodd and huang 2007 2004 15 mtx mtx

disinfectants such as peracetic acid and ferrate vi campo et al 2020 dodd et al 2005 manoli et al 2020 balachandran et al 2021 therefore the fac decay from the background components can be expressed

model parameters d and k fac matrix in eq 16 and k app mtx in eq 18 were determined using an excel solver to minimize the difference between experimental and model predicted data for fac decay and mtx degradation respectively the d and k fac matrix values were determined to be 0 445 mg l and 0 002 1 s for effluent wastewater and 0 297 mg l and 0 001 1 s for pre disinfected drinking water respectively fig 3a and b show that the decomposition of fac in both effluent wastewater and pre disinfected drinking water could be described well by the model eq 16 the degradation of mtx was also predicted well by the models used here eqs 17 and 18 in both matrices fig 3a and b the fac ict based rate constant of mtx was determined as 0 026 l mg s and 0 007 l mg s for effluent wastewater and pre disinfected drinking water respectively interestingly faster degradation of mtx was observed in wastewater effluent than in pre disinfected drinking water the reason may be ascribed to the difference in the properties of coexisting water constituents such as dissolved organic matter which has multiple roles in enhancing or inhibiting micropollutant degradation during oxidative water treatments yang et al 2022 overall the obtained findings suggested that fac reacts with trace level mtx in different water treatment scenarios e g wastewater disinfection units and drinking water clearwells distribution networks 3 4 product identification of mtx by fac with or without halide ions and ha the formation of mtx transformation products during fac oxidation has been investigated in two previous studies in which only monochlorinated and dichlorinated mtx were preliminarily identified via a low resolution lc ms analysis yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 in the present work the tps of mtx after fac oxidation with or without different water constituents were characterized by a high resolution lc ms lc hrms technique in both positive and negative esi modes a total of 9 tps of mtx were detected and named tp 532 tp 488 tp 403 tp 359 tp 208 tp 205 tp 192 dhp tp 147 l glutamic acid and tp 122 benzoic acid according to their molecular weights table s4 mtx and nearly all of its tps except tp 122 were well identified in positive esi mode simultaneous detection of partial tps e g tp 532 tp 488 tp 403 and tp 359 in negative esi mode at the same retention time further confirmed their generation from fac oxidation of mtx additionally mtx solutions without fac addition with and without 1 month of storage time were individually analyzed after spe pretreatment to detect any self decomposed or hydrolyzed tps none of the above tps except tp 122 were found in these two samples suggesting their unique formation via the chlorination process tp 122 was also detected in the freshly prepared mtx sample and the increased peak area of this product was noted after chlorination data not shown it can be postulated that tp 122 was not only the impurity of mtx solution or a byproduct during its synthesis but also a possible product formed during mtx chlorination notably good m z accordance 5 ppm mass error was commonly observed between the measured and calculated m z values of all tps table s4 which facilitated accurate determination of their elementary compositions their structures were further proposed based on the ms ms spectra with fragmentation patterns and chlorination mechanisms figs s9 and s10 for example tp 532 was detected at m z 533 0914 and m z 531 0753 at the same retention time i e 5 01 min in positive and negative esi modes respectively table s4 seven ms ms fragments e g m z 404 0496 m z 386 0375 and m z 306 1116 were yielded in positive mode involving the fragmentation patterns of c n bond cleavage and loss of h2o and hbr from tp 532 and or its fragments fig s10k in negative esi mode tp 532 has three major ms ms fragments i e m z 487 0835 m z 402 0296 and m z 358 0404 corresponding to successive decarboxylation peptide bond cleavage and redecarboxylation fig s10j similar fragment analysis was also performed for all other tps and their chemical structures can thus be tentatively proposed among these tps tp 488 was also detected as a mono chlorinated product during mtx chlorination yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 while tp 147 was found within the electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation systems of mtx lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 these data may reflect the intrinsic structural susceptibility of mtx in interacting with different oxidizing species such as fac and hydroxyl radicals according to the identified tps the chlorination pathways of mtx were proposed fig 4 it is generally acknowledged that chlorination occurs via electrophilic substitution to preferentially oxidize the electron rich moieties of different organics dodd and huang 2007 gao et al 2018 specifically the cleavage of two c n bonds one refers to the peptide bond in the mtx molecule generated three fragments including tp 147 tp 122 and tp 205 this can be well explained by the high polarization and frontier electron density of these two bonds barışçı et al 2018 the c n cleavage of mtx has also been reported for advanced oxidation processes such as electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation lutterbeck et al 2015 lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 the breaking of the peptide bond of the mtx molecule to form tp 147 l glutamic acid may take place via n chlorination or o chlorination of the amide group although the precise mechanisms remain unknown by forming an iminol intermediate as the most favorable mechanism this reaction has been previously proposed to be involved in the chlorination of amide containing pharmaceuticals such as iopamidol wendel et al 2014 and carbamazepine šakić et al 2014 on the other hand fac attack on the tertiary amine moiety of organic compounds was reported to form the highly reactive chlorammonium intermediate ion r3ncl dodd et al 2005 el najjar et al 2013 it can thus be inferred that fac oxidation of mtx yielded the mtx cl intermediate which underwent rapid conversion to form tp 205 subsequent oxidation of tp 205 occurred with the successive generation of tp 192 and tp 208 via hydroxylation substitution and rehydroxylation respectively particularly the recovery of tp 192 dhp during solid phase extraction was calculated at 29 43 and its evolution as a function of the chlorination time of mtx is shown in fig s12 it was calculated that the yield of tp 192 was 2 4 after 30 min of reaction theoretically the chlorinated by products may be numerous during the aqueous chlorination of organic micropollutants however only two chlorinated tps i e tp 488 and tp 359 were identified in this study the formation of mono chlorinated mtx i e tp 488 was detected by fac induced electrophilic substitution h by cl in the ortho position to a substituent on the aromatic ring this is in agreement with two previous studies on the degradation of mtx by chlorine yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 further oxidation occurred in breaking the peptide bond or loss of l glutamic acid moiety to yield tp 359 in addition to the identification of the tps of mtx by fac the kinetic analysis of mtx and its model substructures was performed to distinguish the major and minor reaction pathways for the initial attack of fac on mtx as summarized in fig s4g the second order rate constants of mtx and its model compounds except for dhp with fac are all in the same order of magnitude k 19 85 89 50 m 1 s 1 dhp contains primary amines but not the reactive aromatic ring and reacts more slowly k 1 38 m 1 s 1 than the other compounds since the primary amines should be more reactive than the secondary amines present in the mtx structure this finding suggests that fac reaction with the primary amines is not the predominant mechanism therefore it is reasonable to propose that electrophilic substitution h by cl of mtx molecule is most likely the dominant reaction pathway while fac attack on the amine moieties of mtx contributes to minor reaction patterns this is in agreement with two previous studies on aqueous chlorination of mtx yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 in which only chlorinated products of mtx with high abundance were identified using the low resolution lc ms technique in the presence of br all the above reaction pathways were involved additional oxidation of mtx formed mono brominated mtx i e tp 532 via hobr mediated electrophilic substitution h by br accompanied by electron rich peptide bond cleavage to generate tp 403 the generation of these two brominated tps was further verified according to their specific bromine isotope patterns in both positive and negative esi modes fig s11 comparatively the introduction of i in the fac oxidation of mtx did not alter the product composition suggesting the same mtx reaction pathways as chlorination only this was distinct from the aqueous oxidation of phenolic compounds and diclofenac by fac where hoi mediated formation of iodinated products was reported vikesland et al 2013 dong et al 2018 in the presence of ha only 4 tps i e tp 488 tp 208 tp 205 and tp 122 of mtx were detected during chlorination the relative hydrolysis stability of all identified tps of mtx was analyzed by storing the related aqueous samples under dark conditions for 1 month it is noteworthy that most of the tps except tp 403 tp 359 and tp 147 remained structurally stable table 2 suggesting their potential persistence in the aqueous environment in particular the detection of tp 488 i e mono chlorinated mtx has been previously reported in real samples collected from hospital wastewater effluent yin et al 2017 furthermore in addition to the reported electrophilic chlorination of mtx yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 the initial attacks on the amide and tertiary amine moieties with c n bond cleavage were observed in our study as the novel reaction mechanisms 3 5 toxicity risk assessment of the tps of mtx during chlorination increasing numbers of studies have commonly demonstrated that chlorination of emerging organic contaminants can introduce higher environmental health risks e g acute aquatic toxicity genotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects than the parent compound jaén gil et al 2020 zhang and parker 2018 andrzejczyk et al 2020 knutson et al 2021 chen et al 2016 in particular as one of the most important global challenges the emergence and transmission of antibiotic resistance have been linked to several millions of human deaths annually jiang et al 2022 lu and guo 2021 it is generally acknowledged that sublethal levels of antibiotics are the leading cause of the induction and propagation of args by triggering oxidative stress to disrupt the associated regulatory genes jiang et al 2022 lu and guo 2021 more recently increasing evidence has validated that nonantibiotic pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and triclosan can significantly enhance the conjugation related horizontal transfer of args jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2021 in this study the promoting role of mtx and its tps during chlorination in arg spread was first evaluated using a well established escherichia coli e coli conjugative transfer model system as shown in fig 5 a mtx itself and most of the reacted samples did not exhibit an enhanced conjugative transfer rate compared to the control surprisingly the samples of mtx after 6 min of fac oxidation and after 1 min of fac br treatment showed an accelerated conjugative transfer frequency of args fig 5a and b the correspondingly increased fold changes of conjugation were recorded as 4 5 and 2 0 relative to the control further validation was performed using gel electrophoresis showing the successful transfer of a plasmid carrying the tet gene from the donor bacteria to the recipient fig 5c therefore these phenomena provide the first indication that the chlorination of mtx could facilitate the propagation of args and cause microbial risks that were overlooked in all previous studies notably mtx has been ubiquitously detected in natural water bodies including drinking water groundwater surface water and wastewater at a global scale wormington et al 2020 considering that chlorine disinfection is the last treatment process in multiple water and wastewater treatment plants globally the obtained results of the present paper suggest that chlorinated mtx containing water may enhance the spread of args in different environmental water matrices and or especially in the human gut environment furthermore the genotoxic effect of mtx and its reacted samples during chlorination was assessed via the standardized sos umu test different from the chlorinated samples of cefazolin li et al 2013 and naproxen zhou et al 2020 which exhibited increased genotoxicity mtx and its mixtures with the chlorinated brominated tps were determined as not genotoxic fig 5d and e similar phenomena were also reported during the aqueous oxidation of mtx by using high valent metal oxo oxidants zhang et al 2022 in addition different kinds of in silico qsar based prediction approaches i e ecosar biowin qsar toolbox and comptox were employed to estimate the toxicity and biodegradability of mtx and its tps recent studies have widely demonstrated that these prediction methods could be used as excellent supplements for the toxicity assessment of organic pollutants and their tps especially due to the lack of tp standards for biological assays westphal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 2022 khaleel et al 2019 as listed in table s5 carcinogenicity and mutagenicity alerts were commonly observed for mtx and most of its tps according to the predicted results from the qsar toolbox in a previous investigation roig et al 2014 also reported the possible carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of mtx and its chlorinated products on multiple model organisms using different qsar modules the comptox data suggested that mtx and its tps did not possess the capability to induce ames mutagenicity and estrogen receptor binding nevertheless developmental toxicity was recorded for mtx and some decomposition products e g tp 192 tp 205 tp 208 tp 359 and tp 403 table s5 the biodegradable potential and aquatic toxicity of mtx and its tps were also evaluated herein it is noteworthy that mtx was categorized as not readily biodegradable while most of the tps presented more recalcitrance to biodegradation fig 6 a similar phenomena were observed by applying the closed bottle test to the uv h2o2 treated mtx solutions for 28 days lutterbeck et al 2015 additionally higher acute chronic toxicity to daphnia magna than to fish and green algae was observed for the structurally similar tps compared to mtx itself fig 6b consistent with our findings li et al 2021 recently reported that crustaceans possess higher sensitivity to most anticancer drugs than other species overall similar to the increased toxic potency of the mtx solution treated by electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 chlorination of mtx also triggered higher secondary environmental risks especially the discovered microbial risks regarding the propagation and transmission of args in aqueous environments 4 conclusion based on the above systematic results and discussion the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the ph dependent reactivity of mtx with fac was determined and the k app hocl values were decreased from 170 m 1 s 1 ph 5 0 to 2 68 m 1 s 1 ph 9 0 six model substructures of mtx exhibited similar reactivity to the parent compound at ph 7 0 2 the introduction of br at 1 0 10 0 μm enhanced the chlorination efficiency of mtx at ph 5 0 9 0 the measured k app hobr values with mtx were 3 5 magnitudes higher than the k app hocl values comparatively the addition of i or ha slightly inhibited the elimination of mtx by fac oxidation fac reacted with mtx rapidly in the real water and wastewater samples indicating that this reaction may occur during the chlorination of mtx containing water in water and wastewater treatment plants 3 a total of 9 reaction intermediates were identified using an lc hrms technique during chlorination of mtx with or without different water constituents among them 7 tps were detected for the first time and most of the tps remained structurally stable even after 1 month notably in addition to the reported electrophilic chlorination of the mtx molecule the major and dominant reaction pathway initial attacks on the amide and tertiary amine moieties with c n bond cleavage were observed in our study as novel reaction mechanisms 4 chlorination of mtx with and without br accelerated the induction of conjugative transfer capability of args confirming the unexpected microbial risks in the propagation and transmission of args in aquatic ecosystems further investigation is needed to clarify the key tp s and or the possible mixture effects responsible for the increased risks no genotoxicity was observed for these samples whereas multi endpoint toxicity especially developmental toxicity and biodegradability recalcitrance of the tps of mtx were found overall these results suggested that chlorination of mtx may introduce different stable tps with higher environmental risks than the parent compound declaration of competing interest the authors declared no conflict of

15468,chlorination of a typical anticancer drug with annually ascending use and global prevalence methotrexate mtx in water has been studied in addition to the analysis of kinetics in different water wastewater matrices high resolution product identification and in depth secondary risk evaluation which were eagerly urged in the literature were performed it was found that the oxidation of mtx by free available chlorine fac followed first order kinetics with respect to fac and first order kinetics with respect to mtx the ph dependent rate constants k app ranged from 170 00 m 1 s 1 ph 5 0 to 2 68 m 1 s 1 ph 9 0 the moiety specific kinetic analysis suggested that 6 model substructures of mtx exhibited similar reactivity to the parent compound at ph 7 0 the presence of br greatly promoted mtx chlorination at ph 5 0 9 0 which may be ascribed to the formation of bromine with higher reactivity than fac comparatively coexisting i or humic acid inhibited the degradation of mtx by fac notably chlorination effectively abated mtx in different real water matrices the liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry analysis of multiple matrix mediated chlorinated samples indicated the generation of nine transformation products tps of mtx among which seven were identified during fac oxidation for the first time in addition to the reported electrophilic chlorination of mtx the major and dominant reaction pathway the initial attacks on the amide and tertiary amine moieties with c n bond cleavage constitute novel reaction mechanisms no genotoxicity was observed for mtx or chlorinated solutions thereof whereas some tps were estimated to show multi endpoint aquatic toxicity and higher biodegradation recalcitrance than mtx the chlorinated mixtures of mtx with or without

chlorination kinetics transformation mechanisms microbial risks 1 introduction markedly escalating cancer incidences have caused an increasing number of human deaths during recent decades along with an increasing global burden of cancer treatment and prevention negreira et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 it has been reported that 19 million emerging cancer cases occurred with approximately 10 million cancer related deaths worldwide in 2020 wild et al 2020 consequently large quantities of various synthetic anticancer drugs with different structures have been produced they are increasingly used to inhibit cellular proliferation during chemotherapeutic treatment wormington et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 among these frequently prescribed pharmaceuticals methotrexate mtx is commonly applied as an antimetabolite for the rapid disruption of folate metabolism and dna synthesis in growing tumor cells lai et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 the mtx molecule is structurally composed of several different moieties including 4 aminobenzamide 2 4 diamino 6 methylpteridine and l glutamic acid table s1 nevertheless the efficiency of mtx metabolism is low in patients and mtx shows structural recalcitrance to conventional water treatment processes these characteristics have resulted in the continuous discharge and ubiquitous distribution of mtx in global water environments such as wastewater effluents receiving surface water and finished drinking water systems li et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 in particular relatively high concentrations of mtx have been found in hospital effluents which are hotspots for pharmaceuticals ranging from a few to thousands of ng l in different countries mukherjee et al 2021 wormington et al 2020 recent publications have extensively reported multiple adverse health effects e g endocrine disrupting activity cytotoxicity and mutagenicity on aquatic species of different trophic levels triggered by mtx at its trace concentrations li et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 for the aforementioned reasons mtx has been recognized as an emerging contaminant of great environmental concern lai et al 2017 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 2022 wormington et al 2020 as a

et al 2021 wendel et al 2014 negreira et al 2015 xiang et al 2021 in the case of mtx two previous studies reported its fast reaction with chlorine yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 the authors found that the monochloro mtx product exhibited in silico carcinogenicity genotoxicity mutagenicity and in vitro inhibition of the proliferation of zebrafish liver cells the authors of both studies strongly urged the future application of high resolution analytical techniques for product identification and the evaluation of secondary environmental risks similarly electrochemical transformation photocatalysis and metal based oxidation result in higher toxicity of the reaction products relative to mtx itself lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the detection of monochloro mtx and dichloro mtx in real hospital effluents further suggested their persistence and possible environmental impacts yin et al 2017 additionally the potential for treatment driven higher toxicity of other anticancer drugs in water has been highlighted in our recent study zhang et al 2021 however detailed information regarding the ph dependent chlorination kinetics of mtx generation of other

2006 jaén gil et al 2020 vikesland et al 2013 qu et al 2018 furthermore the promotion of the spread of antibiotic resistance genes args by nonantibiotic pollutants via the induction of conjugative transfer has been receiving considerable attention worldwide jiang et al 2022 lu and guo 2021 wang et al 2021 unfortunately much less attention has been paid to the two above aspects of the chlorination of mtx and in depth investigations are required to better understand the environmental fate and risks of these products to fill the knowledge gaps in the literature the goals of the

reactors at ambient temperature i e 25 0 1 0 c the reactions were initiated by adding an aliquot of fac stock solution under rapid mixing into the 10 0 mm phosphate buffered mtx solution at ph 5 0 9 0 the initial ph values of the reaction solutions were adjusted by using small amounts of h3po4 and naoh solutions it is noted that no ph change was observed during the reaction the mtx concentration was selected as 5 0 μm for all degradation experiments except for the chlorination of effluent wastewater and pre disinfected drinking water in which mtx was spiked at 1 0 μm to simulate its trace

3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination kinetics of mtx and its substructures in this study the time dependent degradation of mtx by excess fac levels was analyzed at varying ph values ph 5 0 9 0 following pseudo first order kinetics as indicated by linear plots r 2 0 95 0 99 fig 1 a no self decomposition of mtx was observed in the absence of fac during the reaction time fig s1 the linear correlation of the determined pseudo first order rate constants and the initial concentrations of fac fig s2 suggested that the overall oxidation reaction followed second order kinetics i e first order with respect to fac and first order with respect to mtx this can be described by considering the speciation of mtx and fac in eqs 1 and 2 furthermore the residual levels of fac were also monitored fig s3 accordingly the associated apparent second order rate constants k app hocl and half lives of mtx and fac were calculated and are shown in table s3 and fig 1b it is noted that the k app hocl values presented a reverse ph dependent trend i e the stepwise enhancement from 2 68 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 0 with a half life of 1243 78 min to 170 00 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 0 with a half life of 19 61

2002 which is in agreement with the higher rate observed at lower ph the reaction kinetics could be well modeled using eqs 3 and 4 and a kinetic model was established to estimate the ph dependent k

removal after 72 h of reaction fig s5 this result is in contrast with that of apt and needs further investigation overall mtx and most of the selected organic moieties exhibited largely similar reactivity to fac which was consistent with their abatement within the uv tio2 system lai et al 2017 3 2 effect of halide ions and ha on chlorination kinetics of mtx in this study cl br and i at different levels were individually introduced into the chlorination system of mtx at ph 7 0 buffered by 10 0 mm phosphate solution interestingly br enhanced mtx elimination in a dose dependent manner reducing the time for complete removal from 30 min no br addition to 4 min 10 0 μm br fig 2 a this might be ascribed to the rapid formation k 1550 m 1 s 1 of hypobromous acid hobr from the reaction between hocl and br lee and von gunten 2009 similar enhancement of br has also been observed during chlorination of some other organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons hu et al 2006 liu et al 2021 diclofenac dong et al 2018 and 17α ethinylestradiol lee and von gunten 2009 the k app hobr values of hobr and mtx under different ph conditions were determined following the competition kinetic method as described by lee and von gunten 2009 and yoom et al 2018 the much higher k app hobr values ranging from 8 00 104 m 1 s 1 ph 7 0 half life 2 50 s to 1 04 105 m 1 s 1 ph 9

resulting fits of data are depicted in fig 2c with the corresponding k app hobr and each k ij α i β j term in eqs 11 and 12 comparatively the mtx degradation was slightly inhibited in the presence of cl i and ha at ph 7 0 figs s6 2d and e a similar influence of cl was also reported for chlorodimethenamid formation during chlorination of herbicide dimethenamid at neutral ph whereas enhanced rate constants were reported with 3 30 mm cl under acidic ph conditions sivey et al 2010 it is known that i can be rapidly oxidized by fac to form hoi k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 which equilibrates to yield multiple iodine containing species e g i2 h2oi and hoi2 vikesland et al 2013 recent publications have observed the enhanced role of i in the chlorination of phenolic contaminants and diclofenac which may be attributed to their higher reactivity with hoi than fac dong et al 2018 vikesland et al 2013 in this sense our study suggests that hoi may possess a slower reaction with mtx than fac did no mineralization of mtx by fac oxidation with or without the addition of these halide ions was observed fig s8 suggesting the formation of recalcitrant tps in these systems additionally the introduction of 0 5 0 mg l ha inhibited the chlorination efficiency of mtx from 92 to 80 after 30 min of treatment the inhibitory role of ha has also been reported during the chlorination of bisphenol s and bromophenols gao et al 2018 xiang et al 2021 in which ha was proposed to inhibit the electron transfer reactions for phenoxyl radical formation overall ha induced pollutant inhibition mainly involves its competitive consumption of reactive fac oxidants 10 k app hobr hobr t mtx t i 1 2 3 j 3 4 α i β j hobr t mtx t 11 k app hobr k 13 α 1 β 3 k 14 α 1 β 4 k 23 α 2 β 3 k 24 α 2 β 4 k 33 α 3 β 3 k 34 α

water matrices to evaluate the reaction of fac with mtx in natural water and wastewater matrices 1 0 μm mtx was spiked into the collected wastewater effluent and pre disinfected drinking water fac was dosed at a substantial excess than mtx i e fac mtx 50 1 which simulated a pseudo first order reaction for kinetic modeling of mtx elimination eq 15 dodd et al 2005 dodd and huang 2007 2004 15 mtx mtx 0 e k a p p mtx 0 t fac dt given the simultaneous consumption of fac by coexisting nucleophilic water components e g nom reduced metal ions and amino acids the decay of fac was taken into account to facilitate the degradation modeling of mtx in these real water samples fac in water wastewater underwent an initial rapid consumption by the highly reactive background chemicals i e initial demand d in mg l and followed by a slower decomposition in the remaining chlorination time i e first order kinetics k facmatrix in 1 s fig 3 which is in agreement with the literature on fac and other chemical disinfectants such as peracetic acid and ferrate vi campo et al 2020 dodd et al 2005 manoli et al 2020 balachandran et al 2021 therefore the fac decay from the background components can be expressed by eq 16 manoli et al 2019 16 fac fac 0 d e k fac matrix integration of eq 16 results in eq 17 representing the exposure to fac i e the integral of fac concentration over time fac ict santoro et al 2015 17 fac ict fac 0 d k fac matrix 1 e k fac matrix t adding eq 17 to 15 yields eq 18 which can be used to predict mtx degradation in different water matrices 18 mtx mtx 0 e k a p p mtx fac ict the model parameters d and k fac matrix in eq 16 and k app mtx in eq 18 were determined using an excel solver to minimize the difference between experimental and model predicted data for fac decay and mtx degradation respectively the d and k fac matrix values were determined to be 0 445 mg l and 0 002 1 s for effluent wastewater and 0 297 mg l and 0 001 1 s for pre disinfected drinking water respectively fig 3a and b show that the decomposition of fac in both effluent wastewater and pre disinfected drinking water could be described well by the model eq 16 the degradation of mtx was also predicted well by the models used here eqs 17 and 18 in both matrices fig 3a and b the fac ict based rate constant of mtx was determined as 0 026 l mg s and 0 007 l mg s for effluent wastewater and pre disinfected drinking water respectively interestingly faster degradation of mtx was observed in wastewater effluent than in pre disinfected drinking water the reason may be ascribed to the difference in the properties of coexisting water constituents such as dissolved organic matter which has multiple roles in enhancing or inhibiting micropollutant degradation during oxidative water treatments yang et al 2022 overall the obtained findings suggested that fac reacts with trace level mtx in different water treatment scenarios e g wastewater disinfection units and drinking water clearwells distribution networks 3 4 product identification of mtx by fac with or without halide ions and ha the formation of mtx transformation products during fac oxidation has been investigated in two previous studies in which only monochlorinated and dichlorinated mtx were preliminarily identified via a low resolution lc ms analysis yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 in the present work the tps of mtx after fac oxidation with or without different water constituents were characterized by a high resolution lc ms lc hrms technique in both positive and negative esi modes a total of 9 tps of mtx were detected and named tp 532 tp 488 tp 403 tp 359 tp 208 tp 205 tp 192 dhp tp 147 l glutamic acid and tp 122 benzoic acid according to their molecular weights table s4 mtx and nearly all of its tps except tp 122 were well identified in positive esi mode simultaneous detection of partial tps e g tp 532 tp 488 tp 403 and tp 359 in negative esi mode at the same retention time further confirmed their generation from fac oxidation of mtx additionally mtx solutions without fac addition with and without 1 month of storage time were individually analyzed after spe pretreatment to detect any self decomposed or hydrolyzed tps none of the above tps except tp 122 were found in these two samples suggesting their unique formation via the chlorination process tp 122 was also detected in the freshly prepared mtx sample and the increased peak area of this product was noted after chlorination data not shown it can be postulated that tp 122 was not only the impurity of mtx solution or a byproduct during its synthesis but also a possible product formed during mtx chlorination notably good m z accordance 5 ppm mass error was commonly observed between the measured and calculated m z values of all tps table s4 which facilitated accurate determination of their elementary compositions their structures were further proposed based on the ms ms spectra with fragmentation patterns and chlorination mechanisms figs s9 and s10 for example tp 532 was detected at m z 533 0914 and m z 531 0753 at the same retention time i e 5 01 min in positive and negative esi modes respectively table s4 seven ms ms fragments e g m z 404 0496 m z 386 0375 and m z 306 1116 were yielded in positive mode involving the fragmentation patterns of c n bond cleavage and loss of h2o and hbr from tp 532 and or its fragments fig s10k in negative esi mode tp 532 has three major ms ms fragments i e m z 487 0835 m z 402 0296 and m z 358 0404 corresponding to successive decarboxylation peptide bond cleavage and redecarboxylation fig s10j similar fragment analysis was also performed for all other tps and their chemical structures can thus be tentatively proposed among these tps tp 488 was also detected as a mono chlorinated product during mtx chlorination yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 while tp 147 was found within the electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation systems of mtx lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 these data may reflect the intrinsic structural susceptibility of mtx in interacting with different oxidizing species such as fac and hydroxyl radicals according to the identified tps the chlorination pathways of mtx were proposed fig 4 it is generally acknowledged that chlorination occurs via electrophilic substitution to preferentially oxidize the electron rich moieties of different organics dodd and huang 2007 gao et al 2018 specifically the cleavage of two c n bonds one refers to the peptide bond in the mtx molecule generated three fragments including tp 147 tp 122 and tp 205 this can be well explained by the high polarization and frontier electron density of these two bonds barışçı et al 2018 the c n cleavage of mtx has also been reported for advanced oxidation processes such as electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation lutterbeck et al 2015 lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 the breaking of the peptide bond of the mtx molecule to form tp 147 l glutamic acid may take place via n chlorination or o chlorination of the amide group although the precise mechanisms remain unknown by forming an iminol intermediate as the most favorable mechanism this reaction has been previously proposed to be involved in the chlorination of amide containing pharmaceuticals such as iopamidol wendel et al 2014 and carbamazepine šakić et al 2014 on the other hand fac attack on the tertiary amine moiety of organic compounds was reported to form the highly reactive chlorammonium intermediate ion r3ncl dodd et al 2005 el najjar et al 2013 it can thus be inferred that fac oxidation of mtx yielded the mtx cl intermediate which underwent rapid conversion to form tp 205 subsequent oxidation of tp 205 occurred with the successive generation of tp 192 and tp 208 via hydroxylation substitution and rehydroxylation respectively particularly the recovery of tp 192 dhp during solid phase extraction was calculated at 29 43 and its evolution as a function of the chlorination time of mtx is shown in fig s12 it was calculated that the yield of tp 192 was 2 4 after 30 min of reaction theoretically the chlorinated by products may be numerous during the aqueous chlorination of organic micropollutants however only two chlorinated tps i e tp 488 and tp 359 were identified in this study the formation of mono chlorinated mtx i e tp 488 was detected by fac induced electrophilic substitution h by cl in the ortho position to a substituent on the aromatic ring this is in agreement with two previous studies on the degradation of mtx by chlorine yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 further oxidation occurred in breaking the peptide bond or loss of l glutamic acid moiety to yield tp 359 in addition to the identification of the tps of mtx by fac the kinetic analysis of mtx and its model substructures was performed to distinguish the major and minor reaction pathways for the initial attack of fac on mtx as summarized in fig s4g the second order rate constants of mtx and its model compounds except for dhp with fac are all in the same order of magnitude k 19 85 89 50 m 1 s 1 dhp contains primary amines but not the reactive aromatic ring and reacts more slowly k 1 38 m 1 s 1 than the other compounds since the primary amines should be more reactive than the secondary amines present in the mtx structure this finding suggests that fac reaction with the primary amines is not the predominant mechanism therefore it is reasonable to propose that electrophilic substitution h by cl of mtx molecule is most likely the dominant reaction pathway while fac attack on the amine moieties of mtx contributes to minor reaction patterns this is in agreement with two previous studies on aqueous chlorination of mtx yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 in which only chlorinated products of mtx with high abundance were identified using the low resolution lc ms technique in the presence of br all the above reaction pathways were involved additional oxidation of mtx formed mono brominated mtx i e tp 532 via hobr mediated electrophilic substitution h by br accompanied by electron rich peptide bond cleavage to generate tp 403 the generation of these two brominated tps was further verified according to their specific bromine isotope patterns in both positive and negative esi modes fig s11 comparatively the introduction of i in the fac oxidation of mtx did not alter the product composition suggesting the same mtx reaction pathways as chlorination only this was distinct from the aqueous oxidation of phenolic compounds and diclofenac by fac where hoi mediated formation of iodinated products was reported vikesland et al 2013 dong et al 2018 in the presence of ha only 4 tps i e tp 488 tp 208 tp 205 and tp 122 of mtx were detected during chlorination the relative hydrolysis stability of all identified tps of mtx was analyzed by storing the related aqueous samples under dark conditions for 1 month it is noteworthy that most of the tps except tp 403 tp 359 and tp 147 remained structurally stable table 2 suggesting their potential persistence in the aqueous environment in particular the detection of tp 488 i e mono chlorinated mtx has been previously reported in real samples collected from hospital wastewater effluent yin et al 2017 furthermore in addition to the reported electrophilic chlorination of mtx yin et al 2017 roig et al 2014 the initial attacks on the amide and tertiary amine moieties with c n bond cleavage were observed in our study as the novel reaction mechanisms 3 5 toxicity risk assessment of the tps of mtx during chlorination increasing numbers of studies have commonly demonstrated that chlorination of emerging organic contaminants can introduce higher environmental health risks e g acute aquatic toxicity genotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects than the parent compound jaén gil et al 2020 zhang and parker 2018 andrzejczyk et al 2020 knutson et al 2021 chen et al 2016 in particular as one of the most important global challenges the emergence and transmission of antibiotic resistance have been linked to several millions of human deaths annually jiang et al 2022 lu and guo 2021 it is generally acknowledged that sublethal levels of antibiotics are the leading cause of the induction and propagation of args by triggering oxidative stress to disrupt the associated regulatory genes jiang et al 2022 lu and guo 2021 more recently increasing evidence has validated that nonantibiotic pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and triclosan can significantly enhance the conjugation related horizontal transfer of args jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2021 in this study the promoting role of mtx and its tps during chlorination in arg spread was first evaluated using a well established escherichia coli e coli conjugative transfer model system as shown in fig 5 a mtx itself and most of the reacted samples did not exhibit an enhanced conjugative transfer rate compared to the control surprisingly the samples of mtx after 6 min of fac oxidation and after 1 min of fac br treatment showed an accelerated conjugative transfer frequency of args fig 5a and b the correspondingly increased fold changes of conjugation were recorded as 4 5 and 2 0 relative to the control further validation was performed using gel electrophoresis showing the successful transfer of a plasmid carrying the tet gene from the donor bacteria to the recipient fig 5c therefore these phenomena provide the first indication that the chlorination of mtx could facilitate the propagation of args and cause microbial risks that were overlooked in all previous studies notably mtx has been ubiquitously detected in natural water bodies including drinking water groundwater surface water and wastewater at a global scale wormington et al 2020 considering that chlorine disinfection is the last treatment process in multiple water and wastewater treatment plants globally the obtained results of the present paper suggest that chlorinated mtx containing water may enhance the spread of args in different environmental water matrices and or especially in the human gut environment furthermore the genotoxic effect of mtx and its reacted samples during chlorination was assessed via the standardized sos umu test different from the chlorinated samples of cefazolin li et al 2013 and naproxen zhou et al 2020 which exhibited increased genotoxicity mtx and its mixtures with the chlorinated brominated tps were determined as not genotoxic fig 5d and e similar phenomena were also reported during the aqueous oxidation of mtx by using high valent metal oxo oxidants zhang et al 2022 in addition different kinds of in silico qsar based prediction approaches i e ecosar biowin qsar toolbox and comptox were employed to estimate the toxicity and biodegradability of mtx and its tps recent studies have widely demonstrated that these prediction methods could be used as excellent supplements for the toxicity assessment of organic pollutants and their tps especially due to the lack of tp standards for biological assays westphal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 2022 khaleel et al 2019 as listed in table s5 carcinogenicity and mutagenicity alerts were commonly observed for mtx and most of its tps according to the predicted results from the qsar toolbox in a previous investigation roig et al 2014 also reported the possible carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of mtx and its chlorinated products on multiple model organisms using different qsar modules the comptox data suggested that mtx and its tps did not possess the capability to induce ames mutagenicity and estrogen receptor binding nevertheless developmental toxicity was recorded for mtx and some decomposition products e g tp 192 tp 205 tp 208 tp 359 and tp 403 table s5 the biodegradable potential and aquatic toxicity of mtx and its tps were also evaluated herein it is noteworthy that mtx was categorized as not readily biodegradable while most of the tps presented more recalcitrance to biodegradation fig 6 a similar phenomena were observed by applying the closed bottle test to the uv h2o2 treated mtx solutions for 28 days lutterbeck et al 2015 additionally higher acute chronic toxicity to daphnia magna than to fish and green algae was observed for the structurally similar tps compared to mtx itself fig 6b consistent with our findings li et al 2021 recently reported that crustaceans possess higher sensitivity to most anticancer drugs than other species overall similar to the increased toxic potency of the mtx solution treated by electrochemical and photocatalytic oxidation lai et al 2017 barışçı et al 2018 chlorination of mtx also triggered higher secondary environmental risks especially the discovered microbial risks regarding the propagation and transmission of args in aqueous environments 4 conclusion based on the above systematic results and discussion the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the ph dependent reactivity of mtx with fac was determined and the k app hocl values were decreased from 170 m 1 s 1 ph 5 0 to 2 68 m 1 s 1 ph 9 0 six model substructures of mtx exhibited similar reactivity to the parent compound at ph 7 0 2 the introduction of br at 1 0 10 0 μm enhanced the chlorination efficiency of mtx at ph 5 0 9 0 the measured k app hobr values with mtx were 3 5 magnitudes higher than the k app hocl values comparatively the addition of i or ha slightly inhibited the elimination of mtx by fac oxidation fac reacted with mtx rapidly in the real water and wastewater samples indicating that this reaction may occur during the chlorination of mtx containing water in water and wastewater treatment plants 3 a total of 9 reaction intermediates were identified using an lc hrms technique during chlorination of mtx with or without different water constituents among them 7 tps were detected for the first time and most of the tps remained structurally stable even after 1 month notably in addition to the reported electrophilic chlorination of the mtx molecule the major and dominant reaction pathway initial attacks on the amide and tertiary amine moieties with c n bond cleavage were observed in our study as novel reaction mechanisms 4 chlorination of mtx with and without br accelerated the induction of conjugative transfer capability of args confirming the unexpected microbial risks in the propagation and transmission of args in aquatic ecosystems further investigation is needed to clarify the key tp s and or the possible mixture effects responsible for the increased risks no genotoxicity was observed for these samples whereas multi endpoint toxicity especially developmental toxicity and biodegradability recalcitrance of the tps of mtx were found overall these results suggested that chlorination of mtx may introduce different stable tps with higher environmental risks than the parent compound declaration of competing interest the authors declared no conflict of

15469,reasonable and efficient removal of mixed pollutants nitrate and heavy metals in industrial wastewater under heavy metal pollution has attracted more attention in recent years the target strain aquabacterium sp xl4 was immobilized with different iron ore wastes iow using polyvinyl alcohol pva to construct four immobilized bioreactors the results showed that when the ratio of c n was 1 5 and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 8 0h the denitrification performance of the bioreactor was the best and the maximum denitrification efficiency of the bioreactor with sponge iron si as the iron source was 97 19 2 42mg l 1 h 1 furthermore by adjusting the concentration of cu2 and pb2 the stress behavior of the bioreactor to heavy metals under the influence of each iow was investigated the bioreactor has stronger tolerance and removal efficiency to pb2 and cu2 in the presence of pellets ore po and refined iron ore ro respectively moreover the high throughput data showed that aquabacterium accounted for a high proportion in the immobilized bioreactor and the prediction of functional genes based on the kegg database showed that the addition of iow was closely related to the acceleration of nitrate transformation and the inflow and outflow of iron in cells graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron ore wastes denitrification hydrogel bioreactor heavy metal functional gene prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction various types of nitrogen pollution including nitrate no3 n ammonia nh4 n and dissolved organic nitrogen don has received more widespread attention in recent years due to the unreasonable discharge of nitrogen containing substances in industry and agriculture geng et al 2022 negi et al 2022 mallick et al 2022 compared with the harsh conditions and difficult operation of physicochemical methods zhang et al 2022a biological treatment has become the most common method in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as its economic cost low energy consumption and non polluting products and common biological methods include denitrification bai et al 2022a partial denitrification and annamox ji et al 2020 and aerobic granulation guo et al 2019 among the above nitrogen pollution nitrate is the main source of water eutrophication and occupies a large proportion of total nitrogen tn in wwtps and the removal of nitrate by biological denitrification process has received more and more attention xu et al 2021a su et al 2020 in recent years the biological denitrification process under the condition of a low c n ratio c n 2 0 mainly uses the addition of exogenous carbon sources you et al 2021 or the addition of additional electron donors such as ferrous xu et al 2022a sulfur liu et al 2016 and manganese yang et al 2022a to meet the electron transfer required for denitrification however the additional carbon source would incur the cost of the treatment process and finding a suitable additional electron donor is important for nitrate removal from wwtps moreover the biogeochemical redox cycle of fe ⅱ fe ⅲ has received the most intensive attention to treat the problem of low c n ratio in nitrate contaminated water due to its wide source of iron sources and easy recovery of products yang et al 2022b xu et al 2021b on the other hand due to the continuous progress of industrialization nitrate pollution often contains mixed pollution of heavy metals mal et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 which makes the removal of nitrate more difficult moreover xie et al 2022 showed that excessive cu2 5mg l 1 would directly affect the process of biological denitrification in hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor and jia et al 2020 found that the inflow of pb2 2mg l 1 had a negative impact on denitrification performance in constructed wetlands and reduced denitrification efficiency by 19 43 therefore it is of great significance to explore the effects of cu2 and pb2 on biological denitrification and their simultaneous removal under low organic carbon conditions iron ore wastes iow is often closely related to the development of the steel industry and the global annual steel production is also increasing year by year barik et al 2022 which makes the output of various iow increase per annum moreover various iow are used for heavy metal adsorption xu et al 2022b and actual operation of denitrification bioreactors li et al 2021a with its slow release iron properties or high biocompatibility therefore the rational use of iow cannot only provide additional electron donors for the process of biological denitrification to treat water bodies polluted by heavy metals under the condition of low carbon sources to ensure complete denitrification xu et al 2021a yang et al 2022a but also better resist the influence of heavy metals appropriate biomass plays a key role in the operation of wwtps to treat low organic carbon and heavy metal contaminated wastewater and common methods of maintaining biomass include molecular sieves pan et al 2015 hydro cyclone xu et al 2018a and bio immobilization mehrotra et al 2021 in the research comparing these methods of maintaining bacterial quantity bio immobilization has become a research hotspot because of its slowing down of hydraulic shear maintaining suitable living conditions and simple preparation zhang and okabe 2017 xu et al 2021a moreover as a hydrogel carrier material for bio immobilization pva has become the outstanding bio immobilization raw materials due to its reasonable cost and strong physical strength wang et al 2007 berillo et al 2019 however there were few studies on hydrogel bio immobilization combined with iow and the analysis of the operational benefits and differences of heavy metals in the actual bioreactor for this biocarrier has not been clear and studying this research direction is of great significance to the utilization of iow resources and efficient denitrification herein the strain aquabacterium sp xl4 with the iron oxidation and denitrification performance xu et al 2022a was used in this study si po and rio were selected as iow resource and pva was used as the main hydrogel component for 240 days of bioreactor operation the main purposes of this study were i to determine the optimal operating parameters by changing the operating conditions of the bioreactor ii to explore the effect of the bioreactor on denitrification performance and the feasibility of simultaneous removal of nitrate and heavy metals under single heavy metal stress iii clear the differences in nitrogen removal performance of bioreactors under mixed heavy metal stress and their possible biochemical responses iv analysis of nitrogen and iron conversion metabolism in bioreactors under heavy metal stress based on kegg database 2 material and methods 2 1 strain source and composition of simulated wastewater according to the study of xu et al 2022a the aquabacterium sp xl4 has efficient denitrification performance and can use ferrous ions fe2 as an additional electron donor for complete denitrification the composition of the simulated wastewater is show in table s1 in addition the organic carbon source of the aquabacterium sp xl4 was sodium acetate ch3coona to realize the change of the c n ratio of the influent and all the ph of simulated wastewater was adjusted by 1 m hcl and naoh to 6 50 0 5 2 2 preparation method of hydrogel biocarrier briefly the pva 10g was added to 90ml of deionized water and treated in an autoclave at 121 c for 30min after the autoclave treatment 10ml of mother liquor the od600 value was 0 08 of the aquabacterium sp xl4 was added to the cooled pva and the mixture was poured into a 1 1cm mold and placed in a refrigerator of 20 c for three cycles the freezing time was 1 h 2 h and 12 h the finally obtained hydrogel biocarrier was called hb furthermore in order to add various types of iow into the hydrogel 0 5 g of iow was added to 90 ml of deionized water and mixed with pva before it was placed in the autoclave the different mixtures of pva and iow after autoclave treatment were mixed with strain aquabacterium sp xl4 according to the above freezing steps and finally hydrogel biocarrier composite of si pva shb po pva phb and rio pva rhb were obtained 2 3 bioreactor construction and design of operating condition four bioreactors used in this study was made of plexiglass and its height was 600 mm its inner diameter was 50 mm and its effective volume was 1 0 l the hydrogel biocarrier occupies 30 of the bioreactor volume new hydrogel was supplemented every 5 weeks to ensure stable denitrification performance in the bioreactor and the supplement quantity was 2 to 5 of the volume of hydrogel added and the peristaltic pump was used to regulate the hrt and feed simulated wastewater from the bottom of the bioreactor furthermore according to the various influencing conditions of strain aquabacterium sp xl4 xu et al 2022a and the key factors of the bioreactor zeng et al 2021 this study determined the optimal conditions of the bioreactor by adjusting the c n ratio and hrt table 1 after clarifying the optimal conditions the heavy metal removal efficiency and the stress response of the single heavy metal concentration period 3 and period 4 and the mixed heavy metal concentration period 5 of the simulated wastewater were studied 2 4 analytical and characterization methods the changes of no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n during the operation of the bioreactor were measured by a spectrophotometer uv 2600 unocal instrument co china according to standard methods apha 2012 and all the water quality indexes were measured in triplicate ensure the credibility of the experimental data in addition a fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem f 7000 hitachi co japan was used to detect changes in dissolved organic matter in bioreactor effluent under various conditions and to avoid the influence of total suspended solid tss all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm hydrophilic polypropylene filter sgroi et al 2017 furthermore x ray diffraction xrd rigaku tokyo japan fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir is50 usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scalab 250xi thermo fisher usa and field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 germany were used to explore the changes in the physicochemical properties of the hydrogel biocarriers before and after the operation the removal efficiency nre and removal rate of nitrate nrr mg l 1 h 1 were calculated according to the previous study xu et al 2021a 2 5 high throughput and functional gene level prediction based on kegg in order to clarify the biocenosis differences in each bioreactor primers 338f and 806r xu et al 2021b were used to probe into the 16s rdna gene of l0 hb l1 shb l2 phb and l3 rhb in addition sample l4 refers to the microbial community in shb at the end of period 5 by comparing the high throughput sequencing results with the kegg database the genes involved in the growth and metabolic process of the different bioreactors can be predicted li et al 2021b 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of operating conditions for bioreactors 3 1 1 investigating the effect of hrt hrt is the contact reaction time between microorganisms and pollutants in the bioreactor and appropriate hrt can reduce operating costs and meet water performance requirements li et al 2021a zeng et al 2021 merging with fig 1 a and b it can be seen that the nre of all kinds of bioreactors increases with the increase of hrt furthermore the nre of hb was the lowest in the hrt of 4 0 and 8 0 h and the average nre of hb 85 79 and phb 83 39 was not significantly different when the hrt was 8 0 h when the hrt was 8 0 h the highest value of nitrite accumulation in phb was only 0 07 mg l 1 but the nitrite accumulation in hb was 1 65 mg l 1 this signifies that the addition of iow provides additional electron donors for the microbial denitrification process in the bioreactor making the denitrification process more complete xu et al 2022a interestingly the denitrification properties of shb and rhb were quite different although the denitrification performance of rhb 99 14 2 47 mg l 1 h 1 was moderately higher than that of rhb 97 19 2 42 mg l 1 h 1 with the hrt of 8 0 h the accumulation of nitrite in rhb was obvious 0 84 mg l 1 higher than the shb almost no accumulation which demonstrates that si is the most suitable exogenous iron source for the bioreactor li et al 2021b and that rio only stimulates the process of nitrate to nitrite to get incomplete denitrification performance jia et al 2020 zhang et al 2022b furthermore the hrt of the later bioreactor operation was selected as 8 0 h to ensure the complete denitrification process 3 1 2 selecting the optimal c n ratio required for bioreactor operation fig 1a and b show the denitrification performance of the bioreactor at various c n ratios in period 2 according to the nre during the operation process the gradual increase of the c n ratio made the denitrification performance of the bioreactor more excellent and when the c n ratio was 2 0 the nre of various bioreactors was above 95 which indicated that the carbon source was abundant under this condition xu et al 2022b moreover nitrite accumulation was obvious in the hb and rhb groups when the c n ratio was 2 0 and the highest nitrite accumulation in the two bioreactors was 0 75 and 0 83 mg l 1 respectively this phenomenon was similar to the trend in the change of hrt which once again confirms that the addition of rio has a beneficial effect on the nitrate to nitrite process in the bioreactor but not the nitrite conversion process bai et al 2022b li et al 2021b in addition the addition of si and po both played a favorable role in completing the denitrification performance in the bioreactor in particular the addition of si allowed the average nre value in the bioreactor to reach 73 83 1 84 mg l 1 h 1 when the c n ratio was 1 0 and the accumulation of nitrite was close to zero indicating that si can play a key role as an additional electron donor and iron source in the bioreactor and can accelerate the denitrification performance of microorganisms in the bioreactor xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2022b considering the difference in denitrification performance and operating cost of the bioreactor when the c n ratio was 2 0 and 1 5 the c n ratio was set to 1 5 in the subsequent experiments 3 2 effects of the single and mixed heavy metal system on nre different heavy metal pollution conditions were set to explore the effect of heavy metals on the denitrification performance of the bioreactor according to table 1 from fig 1a and b hb was the most affected by the inflow of cu2 and pb2 and the nitrite accumulation was still at the maximum value of each bioreactor group this also shows that the addition of various iow in the bioreactor has a resistance to the influence of heavy metals xu et al 2018b crucially with the increase of cu2 concentration from 2 0 to 6 0 mg l 1 the nre of various bioreactors showed an increasing trend in which the nre of shb reached 99 69 2 50 mg l 1 h 1 when the cu2 increased to 6 0 mg l 1 moreover the nitrite accumulation amount was 0 29 mg l 1 which may be because cu2 could become an electron donating substance in the denitrification process xie et al 2022 in addition although the nre of rhb was reduced under the influence of cu2 the accumulation of nitrite in its effluent was the minimum value of various biological bioreactors and the nitrite of rhb was only 0 08 mg l 1 when the concentration of cu2 was 4 0 mg l 1 this phenomenon indicates that ro can better resist the inhibition of cu2 on nitrite reduction during denitrification in the process of changing the pb2 concentration this study found that the influx of pb2 had greater impact on different bioreactors and the shb and phb were more resistant to pb2 when the pb2 concentration was 2 0 mg l 1 the nre in shb 93 20 was still the highest and the difference in nre between phb 88 54 and rhb 89 99 was not large however on account of the sudden influx of pb2 the accumulation of nitrite in each shb 0 30 to 0 49 mg l 1 and rhb 0 14 to 0 59 mg l 1 increased in period 4 1 but the nitrite in phb reduced from 0 83 to 0 12 mg l 1 indicating that phb was more adaptable to pb2 and could withstand the sudden appearance of low concentrations of pb2 and this phenomenon may be due to the adsorption performance of po on pb2 so that it can play a better protective effect on the microorganisms in the reactor in the short term jia et al 2020 yang et al 2022b in particular compared with period 4 3 pb2 4 0 mg l 1 when the pb2 concentration decreased and there was influx of cu2 higher nre appeared in shb this may because the lower concentration of pb2 was favorable for the release of fe2 by si lin et al 2021 and cu2 could play a certain initiative role in shb consistent with the phenomenon of period 3 and compared with other iron ore wastes the denitrification promotion of si was more prominent 3 3 removal performance of bioreactors for single and mixed heavy metals in addition to studying the effect of heavy metal influx on the denitrification performance of the bioreactor the removal efficiency of heavy metals in each bioreactor was also investigated at period 3 to period 5 it was found that the removal efficiency of heavy metals in hb was the worst both lower than 50 and the removal difference between cu2 and pb2 was not obvious fig 2 in terms of the difference caused by the change of cu2 concentration the removal efficiency of cu2 in rhb was the highest and with the increase of cu2 concentration from 2 0 to 6 0 mg l 1 the average removal efficiency of cu2 decreases from 94 2 to 77 6 the difference in removal efficiency indicated that cu2 removal was not only adsorption but also related to the participation of cu2 in denitrification process xie et al 2022 on the other hand with the increase of pb2 concentration there was little difference in the removal efficiency of pb2 in phb and shb and showed high removal performance compared to other bioreactors fig 2a moreover the removal efficiency of heavy metals in each bioreactor decreased under the inflow of mixed heavy metals fig 2b and c which was related to the difference in the effects of cu2 and pb2 on microorganisms when the concentration of pb2 was higher period 5 1 the cu2 removal efficiency of shb 83 2 was the lowest value of the bioreactor with iow added and pb2 removal efficiency of rhb 58 2 was the lowest value except for hb correspondingly when cu2 concentration was higher period 5 2 phb had the highest pb2 removal efficiency 69 2 while cu2 removal efficiency 78 3 was the lowest except hb this phenomenon corresponded to the difference in denitrification performance in the bioreactor under the influence of various heavy metals section 3 2 indicating that the removal performance of heavy metals in the bioreactor was also closely related to biological metabolism yang et al 2022b su et al 2020 3 4 deciphering the difference of soluble biological metabolites by 3d eem the 3d eem spectra of the outlet under various conditions were shown in fig 3 and table s2 s3 s4 and fig s3 and the fluorescence regional integration fri analysis can divide the spectra into five regions table 2 tyrosine like protein and tryptophan like protein reflected the differences in protein contents in the microbial metabolism process in the bioreactors you et al 2021 sgroi et al 2017 according to fig 3a and b with the gradual increase of the c n ratio the intensity and the proportion of the two types of proteins in shb gradually increased but the soluble microbial by product decreased which indicates that under the condition of low carbon source in the bioreactor has the ability to utilize eps to resist external adverse conditions zhang et al 2022b on the other hand after the cu2 flowed into the shb the intensity of humic acid like organics in shb showed a gradual upward trend but the change trend of this matter during the inflow of pb2 was opposite humic acid like organics often shows the microorganisms in response to environmental changes of the cells burst xu et al 2022c and a small amount of humic acid like organics would accelerate the electron transfer in the process of denitrifying microorganism sun et al 2016 this was related to the improvement of denitrification efficiency with the increase of cu2 concentration and the influx of pb2 directly affects the cellular metabolic process which can be seen from the gradual increase of pb2 concentration but the gradual decrease of the intensity and proportion of soluble microbial by product in shb moreover the trends of various metabolites in hb phb and rhb were similar to shb tables s2 s4 fig s3 3 5 changes in physicochemical properties of hydrogels before and after operation 3 5 1 ftir spectra and sem analysis the ftir peak spectra of different bioreactors at the end period 2 5 and 5 2 are shown in fig 4 a according to the research of andjelkovic et al 2015 the functional group corresponding to the peak value of about 500 is feo fig 4a and the feo appeared in all the bioreactors and at all periods indicating that the addition of iow made iron oxide persist in the bioreactors to provide a certain amount of electron donors to ensure the denitrification process the band at 1080 and 1425 cm 1 represented the extracellular polysaccharide co and ch bending vibration respectively xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2022a interestingly the intensity of extracellular polysaccharides during microbial metabolism in shb showed decreasing trend after the influence of heavy metals indicating that microbes in the bioreactor under these conditions endogenously consumed the polysaccharides su et al 2020 in addition the enhancement of ch fig 4a was positively correlated with the hydrophilicity of proteins in bacterial metabolites and the enhancement in rhb indicates that the ro increases the hydrophilicity of proteins under the stress of heavy metals hu et al 2022 which is beneficial for bacteria to use their extracellular polymeric substance eps to resist the impact of heavy metal influx jia et al 2020 this phenomenon was consistent with the increase in the strength of another pivotal functional group of eps oh around 3400 cm 1 the amide i in the region of 1600 to 1700 cm 1 is often used to calculate its peak shift to analyze changes in protein secondary structure in metabolites in bioreactors zhang et al 2020a the proportion of α helice in shb and phb decreased from 22 0 25 2 to 20 0 and 23 4 respectively and the proportion of β sheets increased from 19 6 19 2 to 21 7 and 23 5 table 3 figs 4b s1 this trend indicated that under the influence of heavy metals the protein tightness in microbial metabolites was reduced and the hydrophily was weakened which may be because the protein structure of the microorganisms in the two bioreactors was affected to looser by the influx of heavy metals zhang et al 2020a lin et al 2021 on the contrary the proportion of α helice in rhb increased from 26 5 to 37 0 and the proportion of β sheets decreased from 23 2 to 33 8 indicating that under the influence of heavy metals the proteins metabolized by microorganisms become more compact and can better resist the influence of external adverse factors jia et al 2020 yang et al 2022b from the sem image of the original hydrogel biocarrier fig 5 a it can be seen that it has a filamentous cross linked structure inside with a high degree of cross linking and large pores which made the immobilization of aquabacterium sp xl4 more practical isaka et al 2012 sakarva et al 2021 as shown in fig 5b for the hydrogel biocarriers with si the internal filamentous structure is more prominent and the slight weakening of the degree of cross linking provides more space for the attachment of microorganisms su et al 2020 at the same time the hydrogel has abundant si encapsulated with microorganisms fig 5c which makes the bioreactor better resistant to the influence of heavy metals moreover a small amount of nano scale iron oxides adhered to the surface of the microorganisms prior to period 2 5 fig 5d which also played the protective role for the later heavy metal experiments of the bioreactor yang et al 2022a xu et al 2022a furthermore the bacteria inside the hydrogel biocarrier were covered with membrane like substances at period 5 2 fig 5e which may be related to the eps of microorganisms in the biocarrier bai et al 2022a jia et al 2020 in addition to the aggravation of eps the extracellular protection of si by microorganisms was also particularly obvious fig 5f which is inseparable from the oxidation products of ferrous iron released by the addition of si through the denitrification process xu et al 2022b li et al 2021b 3 5 2 xrd and xps spectra analysis as can be seen from fig 6 a the main components in the initial iow are ferric oxide fe3o4 ferric oxide fe2o3 and a small amount of hydroxyl oxide feooh however the xrd patterns before and after the operation of shb showed that zero valent iron fe0 was also a major component of si and the peak strength of fe0 decreased with the extension of running time indicating that fe could be released with ferrous ions in water to supply the required electron donors in the denitrification process li et al 2021c jia et al 2020 moreover feooh was the main iron product in the denitrification process of strain aquabacterium sp xl4 xu et al 2022c and feooh was present in all three bioreactors without heavy metal inflow however it was worth considering that only the peak of feooh in shb was significantly weakened when heavy metals influx which was due to the fact that the microorganisms in shb release eps to resist the influence of heavy metals and make iron hydroxyl oxide in an amorphous state xu et al 2021a sun et al 2016 fig 6b shows the xps fully scanned spectra of different bioreactors and fig 6c to j shows the xps spectra of c1s o1s fe2p cu2p and pb4f of si in shb at different periods according to figs 6b and s2 except for the peak around 288 6 ev oco in iron products of shb biological metabolism at the end of period 2 5 the peak of carbon of other conditions and the bioreactors were 248 8 ev c c c h and 287 8 ev co this phenomenon may be due to the influence of si on the structure of hydrogel during freezing and the subsequent oco fracture under the influence of heavy metals guo et al 2015 moreover under the 529 7 531 0 and 533 5 ev in o1s appeared three peaks it respectively represents the carbonyl iron oxide compounds feoh iron oxide feo and the hydroxyl coc compounds xu et al 2022b and the proportion of fe oh increased from 16 1 to 48 7 with the increase of operation time indicating that the production of feooh increased and its adsorption of heavy metals and protection of microorganisms cannot be ignored xu et al 2022a on the other hand it can be seen from the fe2p spectra that when the peak value is 724 5 and 707 1 ev it represents fe0 you et al 2021 and it can be seen from fig 6g h that there was fe0 in si only and the proportion of fe0 decreased from 30 63 to 22 5 at the end of the bioreactor operation which was consistent with the peak value in xrd furthermore the change of iron valence state was closely related to the fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle in the denitrification process involving all kinds of iow in terms of cu2p fig 6i the two peaks at 932 3 and 952 2 ev can be attributed to cu or cu0 yang et al 2022c the occurrence of the two peaks often indicates that cu2 has indeed participated in the bioreactor denitrification process xie et al 2022 from the point of view of pb4f in shb fig 6j the main peaks are located at 138 8 and 143 5 ev and the corresponding substances were pbco3 yang et al 2022b and pbo mal et al 2021 respectively indicating that the removal of pb is mainly caused by precipitation and adsorption of pva caused by alkalinity generated in the process of denitrification 3 6 biotic community difference of bioreactors through high throughput data fig 7 a rarefaction curve for the chao and table 4 show the alpha diversity differences of various bioreactors l1 had the largest chao1 index 356 3 in each sample and shannon index 3 04 was second only to l3 3 32 which indicates that shb had a better microbial richness and diversity than other bioreactors before the influx of heavy metals song et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b moreover after the influx of heavy metals the abundance and diversity of organisms in shb were reduced revealing that the influence of heavy metals cannot be ignored lin et al 2021 it can be seen from fig 7b that the top two fractions at the phylum level in all kinds of bioreactors were proteobacteria 93 9 91 1 81 68 and 94 50 of l0 l1 l2 and l3 respectively bacteroidetes 3 2 3 0 12 0 and 3 6 of l0 l1 l2 and l3 respectively in addition according to the differences between l1 and l4 the main phylum in shb were not significantly different under the influence of heavy metals which was consistent with the excellent denitrification efficiency section 3 2 at the class level fig 7c there were significant differences among the bioreactors although the top five species richness ratios in all bioreactors were betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria chitinophagia gammaproteobacteria holophagae it is noteworthy that the proportion of alphaproteobacteria in sample l2 61 8 was the largest which was significantly different from the large proportion of betaproteobacteria in other bioreactors moreover compared with the proportion of betaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria in l1 the proportion of betaproteobacteria in l4 is increased and the proportion of alphaproteobacteria is decreased indicating that in the presence of si the influx of heavy metals has little influence on betaproteobacteria making it still play the primary role guo et al 2022 on the other hand from the perspective of genus level fig 7d the strain aquabacterium xu et al 2022a used in this study has the highest abundance ratio among samples l0 83 7 l1 80 5 and l4 84 0 and the strain aquabacterium has the second abundance ratio among samples l2 33 4 and l3 43 3 this indicated that pva had achieved good results in the immobilization of the aquabacterium sp xl4 which was closely related to the high efficiency of denitrification in the bioreactor xu et al 2021a su et al 2020 furthermore the strains with the highest abundance in l2 and l3 were azospirillum 57 0 and dechloromonas 49 8 respectively azospirillum is another type of bacteria with iron reduction and denitrification performance zhang et al 2020b the increase of its abundance combined with aquabacterium prompted the phb to play a better effect on fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle xu et al 2022c dechloromonas is a bacterium that often appears in denitrifying biofilm reactors li et al 2021d and it also has the function of phosphorus accumulation bai et al 2022b the abundance of dechloromonas in rhb was the largest indicating that the addition of ro can promote the growth of dechloromonas and have the dual benefits of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 7 prediction of functional genes of different bioreactors based on kegg 3 7 1 prediction of functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism the functional genes related to denitrification include nitrate reductase no3 n no2 n nitrite reductase no2 n no or nh4 n etc pandey et al 2020 as can be seen from fig 8 a the abundance of functional genes related to nitrate reduction was high in hb and shb take napa k02567 periplasmic nitrate reductase for example its abundance was 449 8 420 1 326 2 and 236 9 per million in the four bioreactors respectively and napa did not fluctuate intensively under the influence of heavy metals sample l4 447 8 per million indicating that the presence of si was indeed highly resistant to the influence of heavy metals carvalho et al 2021 as can be seen from fig 8a nark k02575 nitrate nitrite transporter had the highest abundance in rhb 915 3 per million which was consistent with the phenomenon that nre was fast but nitrite accumulated more in the early research process of changing hrt goddard et al 2016 in addition this phenomenon was consistent with the minimum abundance of nosz k00376 nitrous oxide reductase 248 1 per million in rhb indicating that the addition of ro had an impact on the transformation of nitrite and gaseous products in the denitrification process of bacterial strains in the bioreactor pang and wang 2020 it is worth noting that the abundance of nirb k00362 nitrite reductase nadh large subunit in shb increased from 890 8 to 952 6 per million after the addition of heavy metals suggesting that this was closely related to the presence of partial ammonia nitrogen in effluent under the influence of heavy metals pandey et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a 3 7 2 prediction of genes related to fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle the analysis of functional genes related to fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle was helpful to understand the difference mechanism of denitrification in various bioreactors fig 8b firstly shb has the highest abundance among most functional genes related to iron entry and exit of cells fig 8b for example abc k02015 iron complex transport system permease protein 878 5 per million and feoa k04758 ferrous iron transport protein a 289 5 per million were considered to be key functional genes for ferrous iron transfer and ferric iron release makui et al 2000 lin et al 2021 jia et al 2020 the optimal abundance of these two genes indicates that si was the most optimal iow to promote iron transformation in bioreactors accordingly fief k13283 ferrous iron efflux pump 104 5 per million another type of genes related to ferrous iron transfer also has the highest abundance in shb in addition the abundance of afua k02010 iron iii transport system atp binding protein afub k02011 iron iii transport system permease protein and afuc k02012 iron iii transport system substrate binding protein related to ferric iron transport were relatively high in the bioreactor with iow added compared with hb and were reduced around 30 3 after the influx of heavy metals in shb indicating that the addition of iow plays an induction effect on biological iron transformation ash et al 2010 xu et al 2022a and the influence of heavy metals would reduce iron transformation leading to the worse denitrification performance 4 conclusions this study explored the denitrification performance heavy metal tolerance and removal efficiency of each iow on the bioreactor by adjusting the operation conditions of immobilized bioreactor the denitrification performance of each immobilized bioreactor could reach the optimal when the c n ratio was 1 5 and hrt was 8 0 h under this condition the inflow of pb2 and cu2 inhibited the denitrification performance of each bioreactor and the addition of different iow makes the bioreactor have different tolerance to pb2 and cu2 xrd xps ftir and 3d eem data showed that the removal of heavy metals in the bioreactor was related to the adsorption of hydrogel and the metabolic process of microorganisms moreover high throughput data and kegg database prediction of functional genes in each bioreactor showed that the addition of iow could indeed accelerate the denitrification process and fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15469,reasonable and efficient removal of mixed pollutants nitrate and heavy metals in industrial wastewater under heavy metal pollution has attracted more attention in recent years the target strain aquabacterium sp xl4 was immobilized with different iron ore wastes iow using polyvinyl alcohol pva to construct four immobilized bioreactors the results showed that when the ratio of c n was 1 5 and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 8 0h the denitrification performance of the bioreactor was the best and the maximum denitrification efficiency of the bioreactor with sponge iron si as the iron source was 97 19 2 42mg l 1 h 1 furthermore by adjusting the concentration of cu2 and pb2 the stress behavior of the bioreactor to heavy metals under the influence of each iow was investigated the bioreactor has stronger tolerance and removal efficiency to pb2 and cu2 in the presence of pellets ore po and refined iron ore ro respectively moreover the high throughput data showed that aquabacterium accounted for a high proportion in the immobilized bioreactor and the prediction of functional genes based on the kegg database showed that the addition of iow was closely related to the acceleration of nitrate transformation and the inflow and outflow of iron in cells graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron ore wastes denitrification hydrogel bioreactor heavy metal functional gene prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction various types of nitrogen pollution including nitrate no3 n ammonia nh4 n and dissolved organic nitrogen don has received more widespread attention in recent years due to the unreasonable discharge of nitrogen containing substances in industry and agriculture geng et al 2022 negi et al 2022 mallick et al 2022 compared with the harsh conditions and difficult operation of physicochemical methods zhang et al 2022a biological treatment has become the most common method in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as its economic cost low energy consumption and non polluting products and common biological methods include denitrification bai et al 2022a partial denitrification and annamox ji et al 2020 and aerobic granulation guo et al 2019 among the above nitrogen pollution nitrate is the main source of water eutrophication and occupies a large proportion of total nitrogen tn in wwtps and the removal of nitrate by biological denitrification process has received more and more attention xu et al 2021a su et al 2020 in recent years the biological denitrification process under the condition of a low c n ratio c n 2 0 mainly uses the addition of exogenous carbon sources you et al 2021 or the addition of additional electron donors such as ferrous xu et al 2022a sulfur liu et al 2016 and manganese yang et al 2022a to meet the electron transfer required for denitrification however the additional carbon source would incur the cost of the treatment process and finding a suitable additional electron donor is important for nitrate removal from wwtps moreover the biogeochemical redox cycle of fe ⅱ fe ⅲ has received the most intensive attention to treat the problem of low c n ratio in nitrate contaminated water due to its wide source of iron sources and easy recovery of products yang et al 2022b xu et al 2021b on the other hand due to the continuous progress of industrialization nitrate pollution often contains mixed pollution of heavy metals mal et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 which makes the removal of nitrate more difficult moreover xie et al 2022 showed that excessive cu2 5mg l 1 would directly affect the process of biological denitrification in hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor and jia et al 2020 found that the inflow of pb2 2mg l 1 had a negative impact on denitrification performance in constructed wetlands and reduced denitrification efficiency by 19 43 therefore it is of great significance to explore the effects of cu2 and pb2 on biological denitrification and their simultaneous removal under low organic carbon conditions iron ore wastes iow is often closely related to the development of the steel industry and the global annual steel production is also increasing year by year barik et al 2022 which makes the output of various iow increase per annum moreover various iow are used for heavy metal adsorption xu et al 2022b and actual operation of denitrification bioreactors li et al 2021a with its slow release iron properties or high biocompatibility therefore the rational use of iow cannot only provide additional electron donors for the process of biological denitrification to treat water bodies polluted by heavy metals under the condition of low carbon sources to ensure complete denitrification xu et al 2021a yang et al 2022a but also better resist the influence of heavy metals appropriate biomass plays a key role in the operation of wwtps to treat low organic carbon and heavy metal contaminated wastewater and common methods of maintaining biomass include molecular sieves pan et al 2015 hydro cyclone xu et al 2018a and bio immobilization mehrotra et al 2021 in the research comparing these methods of maintaining bacterial quantity bio immobilization has become a research hotspot because of its slowing down of hydraulic shear maintaining suitable living conditions and simple preparation zhang and okabe 2017 xu et al 2021a moreover as a hydrogel carrier material for bio immobilization pva has become the outstanding bio immobilization raw materials due to its reasonable cost and strong physical strength wang et al 2007 berillo et al 2019 however there were few studies on hydrogel bio immobilization combined with iow and the analysis of the operational benefits and differences of heavy metals in the actual bioreactor for this biocarrier has not been clear and studying this research direction is of great significance to the utilization of iow resources and efficient denitrification herein the strain aquabacterium sp xl4 with the iron oxidation and denitrification performance xu et al 2022a was used in this study si po and rio were selected as iow resource and pva was used as the main hydrogel component for 240 days of bioreactor operation the main purposes of this study were i to determine the optimal operating parameters by changing the operating conditions of the bioreactor ii to explore the effect of the bioreactor on denitrification performance and the feasibility of simultaneous removal of nitrate and heavy metals under single heavy metal stress iii clear the differences in nitrogen removal performance of bioreactors under mixed heavy metal stress and their possible biochemical responses iv analysis of nitrogen and iron conversion metabolism in bioreactors under heavy metal stress based on kegg database 2 material and methods 2 1 strain source and composition of simulated wastewater according to the study of xu et al 2022a the aquabacterium sp xl4 has efficient denitrification performance and can use ferrous ions fe2 as an additional electron donor for complete denitrification the composition of the simulated wastewater is show in table s1 in addition the organic carbon source of the aquabacterium sp xl4 was sodium acetate ch3coona to realize the change of the c n ratio of the influent and all the ph of simulated wastewater was adjusted by 1 m hcl and naoh to 6 50 0 5 2 2 preparation method of hydrogel biocarrier briefly the pva 10g was added to 90ml of deionized water and treated in an autoclave at 121 c for 30min after the autoclave treatment 10ml of mother liquor the od600 value was 0 08 of the aquabacterium sp xl4 was added to the cooled pva and the mixture was poured into a 1 1cm mold and placed in a refrigerator of 20 c for three cycles the freezing time was 1 h 2 h and 12 h the finally obtained hydrogel biocarrier was called hb furthermore in order to add various types of iow into the hydrogel 0 5 g of iow was added to 90 ml of deionized water and mixed with pva before it was placed in the autoclave the different mixtures of pva and iow after autoclave treatment were mixed with strain aquabacterium sp xl4 according to the above freezing steps and finally hydrogel biocarrier composite of si pva shb po pva phb and rio pva rhb were obtained 2 3 bioreactor construction and design of operating condition four bioreactors used in this study was made of plexiglass and its height was 600 mm its inner diameter was 50 mm and its effective volume was 1 0 l the hydrogel biocarrier occupies 30 of the bioreactor volume new hydrogel was supplemented every 5 weeks to ensure stable denitrification performance in the bioreactor and the supplement quantity was 2 to 5 of the volume of hydrogel added and the peristaltic pump was used to regulate the hrt and feed simulated wastewater from the bottom of the bioreactor furthermore according to the various influencing conditions of strain aquabacterium sp xl4 xu et al 2022a and the key factors of the bioreactor zeng et al 2021 this study determined the optimal conditions of the bioreactor by adjusting the c n ratio and hrt table 1 after clarifying the optimal conditions the heavy metal removal efficiency and the stress response of the single heavy metal concentration period 3 and period 4 and the mixed heavy metal concentration period 5 of the simulated wastewater were studied 2 4 analytical and characterization methods the changes of no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n during the operation of the bioreactor were measured by a spectrophotometer uv 2600 unocal instrument co china according to standard methods apha 2012 and all the water quality indexes were measured in triplicate ensure the credibility of the experimental data in addition a fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem f 7000 hitachi co japan was used to detect changes in dissolved organic matter in bioreactor effluent under various conditions and to avoid the influence of total suspended solid tss all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm hydrophilic polypropylene filter sgroi et al 2017 furthermore x ray diffraction xrd rigaku tokyo japan fourier transform infrared

changes in the physicochemical properties of the hydrogel biocarriers before and after the operation the removal efficiency nre and removal rate of nitrate nrr mg l 1 h 1 were calculated according to the previous study xu et al 2021a 2 5 high throughput and functional gene level prediction based on kegg in order to clarify the biocenosis differences in each bioreactor primers 338f and 806r xu et al 2021b were used to probe into the 16s rdna gene of l0 hb l1 shb l2 phb and l3 rhb in addition sample l4 refers to the microbial community in shb at the end of period 5 by comparing the high throughput sequencing results with the kegg database the genes involved in the growth and metabolic process of the different bioreactors can be predicted li et al 2021b 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of operating conditions for bioreactors 3 1 1 investigating the effect of hrt hrt is the contact reaction time between microorganisms and pollutants in the bioreactor and appropriate hrt can reduce operating costs and meet water performance requirements li et al 2021a zeng et al 2021 merging with fig 1 a and b it can be seen that the nre of all kinds of bioreactors increases with the increase of hrt furthermore the nre of hb was the lowest in the hrt of 4 0 and 8 0 h and the average nre of hb 85 79 and phb 83 39 was not significantly different when the hrt was 8 0 h when the hrt was 8 0 h the highest value of nitrite accumulation in phb was only 0 07 mg l 1 but the nitrite accumulation in hb was 1 65 mg l 1 this signifies that the addition of iow provides additional electron donors for the microbial denitrification process in the bioreactor making the denitrification process more complete xu et al 2022a interestingly the denitrification properties of shb and rhb were quite different although the denitrification performance of rhb 99 14 2 47 mg l 1 h 1 was moderately higher than that of rhb 97 19 2 42 mg l 1 h 1 with the hrt of 8 0 h the accumulation of nitrite in rhb was obvious 0 84 mg l 1 higher than the shb almost no accumulation which demonstrates that si is the most suitable exogenous iron source for the bioreactor li et al 2021b and that rio only stimulates the process of nitrate to nitrite to get incomplete denitrification performance jia et al 2020 zhang et al 2022b furthermore the hrt of the later bioreactor operation was selected as 8 0 h to ensure the complete denitrification process 3 1 2 selecting the optimal c n ratio required for bioreactor operation fig 1a and b show the denitrification performance of the bioreactor at various c n ratios in period 2 according to the nre during the operation process the gradual increase of the c n ratio made the denitrification performance of the bioreactor more excellent and when the c n ratio was 2 0 the nre of various bioreactors was above 95 which indicated that the carbon source was abundant under this condition xu et al 2022b moreover nitrite accumulation was obvious in the hb and rhb groups when the c n ratio was 2 0 and the highest nitrite accumulation in the two bioreactors was 0 75 and 0 83 mg l 1 respectively this phenomenon was similar to the trend in the change of hrt which once again confirms that the addition of rio has a beneficial effect on the nitrate to nitrite process in the bioreactor but not the nitrite conversion process bai et al 2022b li et al 2021b in addition the addition of si and po both played a favorable role in completing the denitrification performance in the bioreactor in particular the addition of si allowed the average nre value in the bioreactor to reach 73 83 1 84 mg l 1 h 1 when the c n ratio was 1 0 and the accumulation of nitrite was close to zero indicating that si can play a key role as an additional electron donor and iron source in the bioreactor and can accelerate the denitrification performance of microorganisms in the bioreactor xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2022b considering the difference in denitrification performance and operating cost of the bioreactor when the c n ratio was 2 0 and 1 5 the c n ratio was set to 1 5 in the subsequent experiments 3 2 effects of the single and mixed heavy metal system on nre different heavy metal pollution conditions were set to explore the effect of heavy metals on the denitrification performance of the bioreactor according to table 1 from fig 1a and b hb was the most affected by the inflow of cu2 and pb2 and the nitrite accumulation was still at the maximum value of each bioreactor group this also shows that the addition of various iow in the bioreactor has a resistance to the influence of heavy metals xu et al 2018b crucially with the increase of cu2 concentration from 2 0 to 6 0 mg l 1 the nre of various bioreactors showed an increasing trend in which the nre of shb reached 99 69 2 50 mg l 1 h 1 when the cu2 increased to 6 0 mg l 1 moreover the nitrite accumulation amount was 0 29 mg l 1 which may be because cu2 could become an electron donating substance in the denitrification process xie et al 2022 in addition although the nre of rhb was reduced under the influence of cu2 the accumulation of nitrite in its effluent was the minimum value of various biological bioreactors and the nitrite of rhb was only 0 08 mg l 1 when the concentration of cu2 was 4 0 mg l 1 this phenomenon indicates that ro can better resist the inhibition of cu2 on nitrite reduction during denitrification in the process of changing the pb2 concentration this study found that the influx of pb2 had greater impact on different bioreactors and the shb and phb were more resistant to pb2 when the pb2 concentration was 2 0 mg l 1 the nre in shb 93 20 was still the highest and the difference in nre between phb 88 54 and rhb 89 99 was not large however on account of the sudden influx of pb2 the accumulation of nitrite in each shb 0 30 to 0 49 mg l 1 and rhb 0 14 to 0 59 mg l 1 increased in period 4 1 but the nitrite in phb reduced from 0 83 to 0 12 mg l 1 indicating that phb was more adaptable to pb2 and could withstand the sudden appearance of low concentrations of pb2 and this phenomenon may be due to the adsorption performance of po on pb2 so that it can play a better protective effect on the microorganisms in the reactor in the short term jia et al 2020 yang et al 2022b in particular compared with period 4 3 pb2 4 0 mg l 1 when the pb2 concentration decreased and there was influx of cu2 higher nre appeared in shb this may because the lower concentration of pb2 was favorable for the release of fe2 by si lin et al 2021 and cu2 could play a certain initiative role in shb consistent with the phenomenon of period 3 and compared with other iron ore wastes the denitrification promotion of si was more prominent 3 3 removal performance of bioreactors for single and mixed heavy metals in addition to studying the effect of heavy metal influx on the denitrification performance of the bioreactor the removal efficiency of heavy metals in each bioreactor was also investigated at period 3 to period 5 it was found that the removal efficiency of heavy metals in hb was the worst both lower than 50 and the removal difference between cu2 and pb2 was not obvious fig 2 in terms of the difference caused by the change of cu2 concentration the removal efficiency of cu2 in rhb was the highest and with the increase of cu2 concentration from 2 0 to 6 0 mg l 1 the average removal efficiency of cu2 decreases from 94 2 to 77 6 the difference in removal efficiency indicated that cu2 removal was not only adsorption but also related to the participation of cu2 in denitrification process xie et al 2022 on the other hand with the increase of pb2 concentration there was little difference in the removal efficiency of pb2 in phb and shb and showed high removal performance compared to other bioreactors fig 2a moreover the removal efficiency of heavy metals in each bioreactor decreased under the inflow of mixed heavy metals fig 2b and c which was related to the difference in the effects of cu2 and pb2 on microorganisms when the concentration of pb2 was higher period 5 1 the cu2 removal efficiency of shb 83 2 was the lowest value of the bioreactor with iow added and pb2 removal efficiency of rhb 58 2 was the lowest value except for hb correspondingly when cu2 concentration was higher period 5 2 phb had the highest pb2 removal efficiency 69 2 while cu2 removal efficiency 78 3 was the lowest except hb this phenomenon corresponded to the difference in denitrification performance in the bioreactor under the influence of various heavy metals section 3 2 indicating that the removal performance of heavy metals in the bioreactor was also closely related to biological metabolism yang et al 2022b su et al 2020 3 4 deciphering the difference of soluble biological metabolites by 3d eem the 3d eem spectra of the outlet under various conditions were shown in fig 3 and table s2 s3 s4 and fig s3 and the fluorescence regional integration fri analysis can divide the spectra into five regions table 2 tyrosine like protein and tryptophan like protein reflected the differences in protein contents in the microbial metabolism process in the bioreactors you et al 2021 sgroi et al 2017 according to fig 3a and b with the gradual increase of the c n ratio the intensity and the proportion of the two types of proteins in shb gradually increased but the soluble microbial by product decreased which indicates that under the condition of low carbon source in the bioreactor has the ability to utilize eps to resist external adverse conditions zhang et al 2022b on the other hand after the cu2 flowed into the shb the intensity of humic acid like organics in shb showed a gradual upward trend but the change trend of this matter during the inflow of pb2 was opposite humic acid like organics often shows the microorganisms in response to environmental changes of the cells burst xu et al 2022c and a small amount of humic acid like organics would accelerate the electron transfer in the process of denitrifying microorganism sun et al 2016 this was related to the improvement of denitrification efficiency with the increase of cu2 concentration and the influx of pb2 directly affects the cellular metabolic process which can be seen from the gradual increase of pb2 concentration but the gradual decrease of the intensity and proportion of soluble microbial by product in shb moreover the trends of various metabolites in hb phb and rhb were similar to shb tables s2 s4 fig s3 3 5 changes in physicochemical properties of hydrogels before and after operation 3 5 1 ftir spectra and sem analysis the ftir peak spectra of different bioreactors at the end period 2 5 and 5 2 are shown in fig 4 a according to the research of andjelkovic et al 2015 the functional group corresponding to the peak value of about 500 is feo fig 4a and the feo appeared in all the bioreactors and at all periods indicating that the addition of iow made iron oxide persist in the bioreactors to provide a certain amount of electron donors to ensure the denitrification process the band at 1080 and 1425 cm 1 represented the extracellular polysaccharide co and ch bending vibration respectively xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2022a interestingly the intensity of extracellular polysaccharides during microbial metabolism in shb showed decreasing trend after the influence of heavy metals indicating that microbes in the bioreactor under these conditions endogenously consumed the polysaccharides su et al 2020 in addition the enhancement of ch fig 4a was positively correlated with the hydrophilicity of proteins in bacterial metabolites and the enhancement in rhb indicates that the ro increases the hydrophilicity of proteins under the stress of heavy metals hu et al 2022 which is beneficial for bacteria to use their extracellular polymeric substance eps to resist the impact of heavy metal influx jia et al 2020 this phenomenon was consistent with the increase in the strength of another pivotal functional group of eps oh around 3400 cm 1 the amide i in the region of 1600 to 1700 cm 1 is often used to calculate its peak shift to analyze changes in protein secondary structure in metabolites in bioreactors zhang et al 2020a the proportion of α helice in shb and phb decreased from 22 0 25 2 to 20 0 and 23 4 respectively and the proportion of β sheets increased from 19 6 19 2 to 21 7 and 23 5 table 3 figs 4b s1 this trend indicated that under the influence of heavy metals the protein tightness in microbial metabolites was reduced and the hydrophily was weakened which may be because the protein structure of the microorganisms in the two bioreactors was affected to looser by the influx of heavy metals zhang et al 2020a lin et al 2021 on the contrary the proportion of α helice in rhb increased from 26 5 to 37 0 and the proportion of β sheets decreased from 23 2 to 33 8 indicating that under the influence of heavy metals the proteins metabolized by microorganisms become more compact and can better resist the influence of external adverse factors jia et al 2020 yang et al 2022b from the sem image of the original hydrogel biocarrier fig 5 a it can be seen that it has a filamentous cross linked structure inside with a high degree of cross linking and large pores which made the immobilization of aquabacterium sp xl4 more practical isaka et al 2012 sakarva et al 2021 as shown in fig 5b for the hydrogel biocarriers with si the internal filamentous structure is more prominent and the slight weakening of the degree of cross linking provides more space for the attachment of microorganisms su et al 2020 at the same time the hydrogel has abundant si encapsulated with microorganisms fig 5c which makes the bioreactor better resistant to the influence of heavy metals moreover a small amount of nano scale iron oxides adhered to the surface of the microorganisms prior to period 2 5 fig 5d which also played the protective role for the later heavy metal experiments of the bioreactor yang et al 2022a xu et al 2022a furthermore the bacteria inside the hydrogel biocarrier were covered with membrane like substances at period 5 2 fig 5e which may be related to the eps of microorganisms in the biocarrier bai et al 2022a jia et al 2020 in addition to the aggravation of eps the extracellular protection of si by microorganisms was also particularly obvious fig 5f which is inseparable from the oxidation products of ferrous iron released by the addition of si through the denitrification process xu et al 2022b li et al 2021b 3 5 2 xrd and xps spectra analysis as can be seen from fig 6 a the main components in the initial iow are ferric oxide fe3o4 ferric oxide fe2o3 and a small amount of hydroxyl oxide feooh however the xrd patterns before and after the operation of shb showed that zero valent iron fe0 was also a major component of si and the peak strength of fe0 decreased with the extension of running time indicating that fe could be released with ferrous ions in water to supply the required electron donors in the denitrification process li et al 2021c jia et al 2020 moreover feooh was the main iron product in the denitrification process of strain aquabacterium sp xl4 xu et al 2022c and feooh was present in all three bioreactors without heavy metal inflow however it was worth considering that only the peak of feooh in shb was significantly weakened when heavy metals influx which was due to the fact that the microorganisms in shb release eps to resist the influence of heavy metals and make iron hydroxyl oxide in an amorphous state xu et al 2021a sun et al 2016 fig 6b shows the xps fully scanned spectra of different bioreactors and fig 6c to j shows the xps spectra of c1s o1s fe2p cu2p and pb4f of si in shb at different periods according to figs 6b and s2 except for the peak around 288 6 ev oco in iron products of shb biological metabolism at the end of period 2 5 the peak of carbon of other conditions and the bioreactors were 248 8 ev c c c h and 287 8 ev co this phenomenon may be due to the influence of si on the structure of hydrogel during freezing and the subsequent oco fracture under the influence of heavy metals guo et al 2015 moreover under the 529 7 531 0 and 533 5 ev in o1s appeared three peaks it respectively represents the carbonyl iron oxide compounds feoh iron oxide feo and the hydroxyl coc compounds xu et al 2022b and the proportion of fe oh increased from 16 1 to 48 7 with the increase of operation time indicating that the production of feooh increased and its adsorption of heavy metals and protection of microorganisms cannot be ignored xu et al 2022a on the other hand it can be seen from the fe2p spectra that when the peak value is 724 5 and 707 1 ev it represents fe0 you et al 2021 and it can be seen from fig 6g h that there was fe0 in si only and the proportion of fe0 decreased from 30 63 to 22 5 at the end of the bioreactor operation which was consistent with the peak value in xrd furthermore the change of iron valence state was closely related to the fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle in the denitrification process involving all kinds of iow in terms of cu2p fig 6i the two peaks at 932 3 and 952 2 ev can be attributed to cu or cu0 yang et al 2022c the occurrence of the two peaks often indicates that cu2 has indeed participated in the bioreactor denitrification process xie et al 2022 from the point of view of pb4f in shb fig 6j the main peaks are located at 138 8 and 143 5 ev and the corresponding substances were pbco3 yang et al 2022b and pbo mal et al 2021 respectively indicating that the removal of pb is mainly caused by precipitation and adsorption of pva caused by alkalinity generated in the process of denitrification 3 6 biotic community difference of bioreactors through high throughput data fig 7 a rarefaction curve for the chao and table 4 show the alpha diversity differences of various bioreactors l1 had the largest chao1 index 356 3 in each sample and shannon index 3 04 was second only to l3 3 32 which indicates that shb had a better microbial richness and diversity than other bioreactors before the influx of heavy metals song et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b moreover after the influx of heavy metals the abundance and diversity of organisms in shb were reduced revealing that the influence of heavy metals cannot be ignored lin et al 2021 it can be seen from fig 7b that the top two fractions at the phylum level in all kinds of bioreactors were proteobacteria 93 9 91 1 81 68 and 94 50 of l0 l1 l2 and l3 respectively bacteroidetes 3 2 3 0 12 0 and 3 6 of l0 l1 l2 and l3 respectively in addition according to the differences between l1 and l4 the main phylum in shb were not significantly different under the influence of heavy metals which was consistent with the excellent denitrification efficiency section 3 2 at the class level fig 7c there were significant differences among the bioreactors although the top five species richness ratios in all bioreactors were betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria chitinophagia gammaproteobacteria holophagae it is noteworthy that the proportion of alphaproteobacteria in sample l2 61 8 was the largest which was significantly different from the large proportion of betaproteobacteria in other bioreactors moreover compared with the proportion of betaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria in l1 the proportion of betaproteobacteria in l4 is increased and the proportion of alphaproteobacteria is decreased indicating that in the presence of si the influx of heavy metals has little influence on betaproteobacteria making it still play the primary role guo et al 2022 on the other hand from the perspective of genus level fig 7d the strain aquabacterium xu et al 2022a used in this study has the highest abundance ratio among samples l0 83 7 l1 80 5 and l4 84 0 and the strain aquabacterium has the second abundance ratio among samples l2 33 4 and l3 43 3 this indicated that pva had achieved good results in the immobilization of the aquabacterium sp xl4 which was closely related to the high efficiency of denitrification in the bioreactor xu et al 2021a su et al 2020 furthermore the strains with the highest abundance in l2 and l3 were azospirillum 57 0 and dechloromonas 49 8 respectively azospirillum is another type of bacteria with iron reduction and denitrification performance zhang et al 2020b the increase of its abundance combined with aquabacterium prompted the phb to play a better effect on fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle xu et al 2022c dechloromonas is a bacterium that often appears in denitrifying biofilm reactors li et al 2021d and it also has the function of phosphorus accumulation bai et al 2022b the abundance of dechloromonas in rhb was the largest indicating that the addition of ro can promote the growth of dechloromonas and have the dual benefits of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 7 prediction of functional genes of different bioreactors based on kegg 3 7 1 prediction of functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism the functional genes related to denitrification include nitrate reductase no3 n no2 n nitrite reductase no2 n no or nh4 n etc pandey et al 2020 as can be seen from fig 8 a the abundance of functional genes related to nitrate reduction was high in hb and shb take napa k02567 periplasmic nitrate reductase for example its abundance was 449 8 420 1 326 2 and 236 9 per million in the four bioreactors respectively and napa did not fluctuate intensively under the influence of heavy metals sample l4 447 8 per million indicating that the presence of si was indeed highly resistant to the influence of heavy metals carvalho et al 2021 as can be seen from fig 8a nark k02575 nitrate nitrite transporter had the highest abundance in rhb 915 3 per million which was consistent with the phenomenon that nre was fast but nitrite accumulated more in the early research process of changing hrt goddard et al 2016 in addition this phenomenon was consistent with the minimum abundance of nosz k00376 nitrous oxide reductase 248 1 per million in rhb indicating that the addition of ro had an impact on the transformation of nitrite and gaseous products in the denitrification process of bacterial strains in the bioreactor pang and wang 2020 it is worth noting that the abundance of nirb k00362 nitrite reductase nadh large subunit in shb increased from 890 8 to 952 6 per million after the addition of heavy metals suggesting that this was closely related to the presence of partial ammonia nitrogen in effluent under the influence of heavy metals pandey et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a 3 7 2 prediction of genes related to fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle the analysis of functional genes related to fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle was helpful to understand the difference mechanism of denitrification in various bioreactors fig 8b firstly shb has the highest abundance among most functional genes related to iron entry and exit of cells fig 8b for example abc k02015 iron complex transport system permease protein 878 5 per million and feoa k04758 ferrous iron transport protein a 289 5 per million were considered to be key functional genes for ferrous iron transfer and ferric iron release makui et al 2000 lin et al 2021 jia et al 2020 the optimal abundance of these two genes indicates that si was the most optimal iow to promote iron transformation in bioreactors accordingly fief k13283 ferrous iron efflux pump 104 5 per million another type of genes related to ferrous iron transfer also has the highest abundance in shb in addition the abundance of afua k02010 iron iii transport system atp binding protein afub k02011 iron iii transport system permease protein and afuc k02012 iron iii transport system substrate binding protein related to ferric iron transport were relatively high in the bioreactor with iow added compared with hb and were reduced around 30 3 after the influx of heavy metals in shb indicating that the addition of iow plays an induction effect on biological iron transformation ash et al 2010 xu et al 2022a and the influence of heavy metals would reduce iron transformation leading to the worse denitrification performance 4 conclusions this study explored the denitrification performance heavy metal tolerance and removal efficiency of each iow on the bioreactor by adjusting the operation conditions of immobilized bioreactor the denitrification performance of each immobilized bioreactor could reach the optimal when the c n ratio was 1 5 and hrt was 8 0 h under this condition the inflow of pb2 and cu2 inhibited the denitrification performance of each bioreactor and the addition of different iow makes the bioreactor have different tolerance to pb2 and cu2 xrd xps ftir and 3d eem data showed that the removal of heavy metals in the bioreactor was related to the adsorption of hydrogel and the metabolic process of microorganisms moreover high throughput data and kegg database prediction of functional genes in each bioreactor showed that the addition of iow could indeed accelerate the denitrification process and fe ⅱ fe ⅲ redox cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
