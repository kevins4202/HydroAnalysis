9395,prolonged drought conditions and soil desiccation have caused extensive damage and reduction in yields of the largest rain fed fig trees ficus carica l sabz grove located in the semi arid region of estahban iran in this experiment the effect of suspended shade net and two types of water penetration systems covered with organic mulch on plant water status and productivity of the rain fed fig trees on the foothill slopes with traditional micro catchment were investigated during 2018 2020 the first experimental factors included ctrl without shade net and s covering the tree canopy with 25 shade intensity white suspended shade net and the second experimental factors included ctrl the local traditional practice 25 m2 bare soil micro catchment only m application of wheat straw as organic mulch under the tree canopy with two concentrating infiltration pipes and mp application of wheat straw mulch over the soil under the tree canopy with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of 4 m of overall plowing rows perpendicular to the slope to a depth of 40 cm and a width of 3 m at a distance of 2 5 m upslope of the tree trunk mp treatment significantly increased and retained the average of soil moisture content by 79 9 in comparison with the local traditional practice the results showed that s mp had the greatest effect on inducing the physiological attribute of fig trees such as leaf stomatal conductance 121 1 leaf transpiration 52 5 leaf light saturated net co2 assimilation 96 6 and the leaf water potential 30 9 as the main effective variable in association with increment of commercial fruit yield this treatment had the highest impacts on the increment of yield 187 7 and commercial and healthy quality of sabz fig dry fruit under severe drought conditions in rain fed orchards keywords mulch drought shade net soil water content water infiltration systems 1 introduction iran is currently the 5th largest world fig fruit ficus carica l producer reaching an annual production of 86 372 tons fao 2019 sabz fig cultivar is the most important traditional rainfed crops cultivated in estahban region as a sustainable heritage of fig culture systems fao 2011 in the south east region of fars province iran green or sabz cultivar is a smyrna type cultivar and produce the most dried fruit figs from syconia of second crop main crop which grows on the leaf axils of the current season by specific pollination the fruits of caprifigs cultivars as pollinizer with certain type of wasp blastophaga psenes are needed this cultivar is one of the most drought tolerant compared with other cultivars and thrive in areas with long and hot summers sedaghat and rahemi 2018 90 of the country s dried fig production in rainfed conditions belongs to the estahban region and the precipitation status plays an important role in local resident s income jafari et al 2012 in recent years many prolonged rainfall deficits and drought conditions chronically impedes rainfed fig trees growth also in some cases extreme drought conditions caused severe damage to rainfed fig trees and results in massive leaf abscission and about 10 of trees branches were dried that caused a reduction in fruit quantity and quality gholami et al 2012 jafari et al 2015 karimi et al 2012 tehrani et al 2016 zare et al 2019 sometimes in these situations the trees themselves were exposed to death and the priority for fig producers is the tree survival zare et al 2019 improper distribution and limited precipitation results in a slow water recharge to a deep soil layer and subsequently a water deficit for deep rooted trees in rainfed drylands ding et al 2021 qian et al 2015 also long term drought conditions can significantly reduce the deep soil moisture qu et al 2019 the recent rise in air temperature intensity of solar radiation meena et al 2016 considerable reduction in annual cold nights increase in the number of annual warm nights alexander et al 2006 howden et al 2007 increased the destructive effects of drought on fig trees these conditions cause the plant wilting reduced photosynthesis stomatal conductance water use efficiency relative water content and leaf chlorophyll content arora et al 2002 also the increment of transpiration accelerates the soil moisture depletion and scarcity the soil moisture reservation is an important factor for sustainable development of fig production in the region the scarcity and unreliability of rainfall and its disproportionate distribution necessitate the preservation and storage of soil moisture and the optimal use of rainfall in the region also fully utilizing rainwater resources soil moisture management and applying protective treatments are important factors to increase the resilience of the rain fed fig against drought stress and maintain the sustainable crop production according to this the use of water harvesting techniques shade net and mulching measures along with other horticultural management such as severe thinning out of one year old lateral branches can improve the efficiency of rainwater utilization that is crucial for sustainable productivity of rain fed fig trees abdolahipour et al 2019 rainwater harvesting in the region is a traditional practice for supplying water by using semicircular micro catchments built perpendicular to the foothill slopes for intercepting run off collecting rain water and increasing soil water content abdolahipour et al 2019 semicircular micro catchments enhance the local impoundment and infiltration of rainfall jiang et al 2014 especially when faced with heavy storms of a short duration guo et al 2019 in addition to the water harvesting techniques among the various methods to enhance the soil moisture and reduce the effects of drought stress jokar et al 2021 zare 2021 the most effective ones could be the application of mulch with multi holed infiltration pipes ding et al 2021 song et al 2018 and suspended shade net mudau et al 2017 this procedure could provide the favorable conditions for infiltration and recharge of water in the deep soil layers and enhance water storage in the soil profile decrease the evapotranspiration rate and enhance the photosynthetic activity and adverse effects of drought on plant growth zhou et al 2018 rainwater harvesting with infiltration multi holed pipe and mulching could be useful to efficiently utilize rainwater resources and improve the soil moisture content and increase in the spatial extent of wetted areas over both horizontal and vertical soil layers for rain fed orchards this technique promoted fine roots growth which was directly related to wetted soil guo et al 2019 song et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that application of soil surface organic mulches and incorporate the mulch to soil as an effective water conservation technique significantly improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity liao et al 2021 applying a layer of organic mulches as a physical isolation layer reduces the amount of heat radiation reaching the ground and thus causes the regulate soil temperature variations reduction of soil water evaporation prevent weeds and fugitive dust from soil improve soil microbiology and fertility and increase the water infiltration crop yields and water use efficiency especially for rainfed trees growing in semiarid areas jafari 2012 liu et al 2014 truong and marschner 2021 wang et al 2015 mulches effectively protect the roots of plants against extreme summer heat applying wheat straw mulches had significant positive impacts on the growth and fruit quality of fig orchards and was recommended as organic mulch in the estahban region jafari 2012 wheat straw mulches had a soft compacted porous surface that was created after the first rainfall and hindered the loss of moisture and weed growing also straw mulch reduces nutrient and total organic carbon transport by runoff korkanç and şahin 2021 the combined water harvesting techniques straw mulching and the 36 m2 micro catchment improved soil moisture content plant height and leaf number per tree as well as the physiology of pistachio trees tadros et al 2021 the combination of organic mulching and rainwater harvesting with infiltration techniques could have both potential positive environmental and productive effects due to their benefits of water infiltration and fine root growth in the field ecosystem when the air temperature is high the quality of dried figs drops sharply and the fruit becomes small black and hollow suspended shade nets can improve the microclimates harvesting operation and the quality of fruit and lowering postharvest losses jokar et al 2021 mudau et al 2017 application of shade net reduces the labor cost and the damage caused by pests fungi and physical wind damage selahle et al 2015 tinyane 2013 therefore the objectives of this study were to evaluate the simple and interactive effect of the application of suspended shade net with two water penetration system application of infiltration pipes and plowing perpendicular upslope along with wheat straw

intensity of solar radiation had destructive effects on fig trees the increment of evapotranspiration accelerates the soil moisture depletion and decrease the soil and plant moisture reservation that is an important factor for sustainable development of rain fed fig production in the region collecting rainwater in microcatchment is a unique way to provide moisture for rain fed fig trees in estahban semi arid regions with limited and variable rainfall soil infiltration soil moisture potential and local bed slope determine the amount of water collected in the microcatchment and excess water is overflowed over the microcatchments jafari et al 2012 in addition to this conventional method in the region other water harvesting and infiltration systems with different efficiency can be applied to improve the availability of water and maintain adequate soil water content for an extended period and assist sustainable yields under such condition especially during drought periods mandal et al 2020 tadros et al 2021 vetter and rieger 2019 in our experiment infiltrating the surface streams of rainwater and water collected in the microcatchment in the depth of the soil by plowing upstream of trees and concentrating infiltration pipes and also maintaining soil moisture by using wheat straw as organic mulch significantly improved the physiological characteristics and the yield of fig trees in rainfed conditions increasing and maintaining soil moisture at all three soil depths especially at lower depths had a significant effect on increasing the yield of fig trees in rainfed conditions table 8 this can be due to the further growth and expansion of fig roots systems at the depth of 50 100 cm green and clothier 1999 jafari et al 2012 the interaction between plant and soil depends more on the activity of the fine root system in which their growth and distribution in the soil profile are positively correlated with changes in the soil moisture content powers et al 2005 song et al 2018 soil moisture depends on environmental parameters reducing the solar energy reaching the soil surface and soil temperature by using organic mulch horton et al 1996 wang et al 2015 could be associated with less evaporation from the soil wheat straw with low porosity blocks the direct water connection between the soil surface and the atmosphere and effectively reduces soil evaporation thus improves the soil moisture content and soil moisture conservation gholami et al 2014 liao et al 2021 tang et al 2021 using organic mulch treatments especially during warm conditions in summer can play an effective role in soil moisture retention in comparison with control more average soil moisture retention between april to september belongs to mp treatment 15 3 followed by m treatment 8 66 also in the rainy seasons of the years october to march the average soil moisture content significantly increased with the application of mp and m treatment by 28 8 and 7 76 in comparison to the control the use of shade net s and especially s mp increased the soil moisture storage especially in the depths of fig root system expansion the amount of soil moisture content especially at greater soil depths should be reduced much more slowly during the drought by covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net application of m and mp can significantly increase the extent of wetted areas in the whole soil spatial profile also this treatment could enhance the ability of soil moisture infiltration to deeper soil layers and preserve the soil moisture and enhance the regulation of soil moisture reservoirs ding et al 2021 straw mulch with 10 cm thickness absorbs part of the rainfall liao et al 2021 but when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate the absorption and gradually release capability of water by wheat straw and its effect on the roughness and tortuosity of flow paths can promote water infiltration liu et al 2014 rahma et al 2017 4 2 growth and physiological characteristics fig plant show an adaptive behavior to prolonged water stress responding through large leaf abscission and closure of stomata moreover when exposed to water stress leaf expansion thickness inclination and gas exchange modiﬁcations occurred ammar et al 2022 another strategy of defense is the maintenance of leaf cell turgidity and cell membrane function due to increase in osmolytes mardinata et al 2021 this can be occurred by consuming photo assimilates in compensation of decreased quantitative and qualitative yield of the fig fruit covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and its interaction with the application of wheat straw and adjuvant soil water penetration systems had desirable effects on the increment of current year shoot length shoot diameter and number of leaves per shoot over the course of the study these results are in accordance with the reports of jokar et al 2021 that showed the growth of fig trees was improved by the use of shade nets these treatments could have improved the shoot growth which resulted in more internodes and consequently more leaves and fruits by providing the favorable weather conditions such as reducing the air temperature and increasing the relative humidity in the canopy of fig trees and increment of soil moisture content unlike stressful situations under such condition s plants dedicate more photo assimilates and resources to shoot elongation and leaf development brutnell 2006 high intensity of radiation air temperature and low leaf water potential can cause leaf chlorophyll decay and chlorosis and induce the leaf fall in fig trees that can be an indicator of the death risk in fig trees zare et al 2019 ficus carica is a delayed greening species that could be a strategy to cope with environmental stress under hot and drought conditions also fig trees showed an increase in leaf inclination to avoid excess sunlight that could cause photo oxidation and to prevent photoinhibition in summer and reduce transpiration by lowering leaf temperature gonzález rodríguez and peters 2010 improving the microclimate conditions by covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and increasing the soil moisture content using wheat straw and adjuvant soil water penetration systems might have provided a more suitable condition for reducing the radiation intensity and in consequent leaf temperature and increment of leaf water potential also this condition could have desirable effects on the leaf physiological characteristics such as leaf chlorophyll content index leaf areas leaf stomatal conductance leaf transpiration and leaf light saturated net co2 assimilation which ultimately improves the vegetative growth and reproductive characteristics of fig trees in rainfed conditions according to the principal component analysis increment of light saturated net co2 assimilation leaf water potential shoot length leaf chlorophyll content index stomatal conductance leaf transpiration number of leaves per shoot leaf areas and shoot diameter respectively had significant positive correlation with the enhancement of yield and improvement of reproductive characteristics of sabz fig table 8 high leaf temperatures and lower leaf water potential in association with senescence and cell membrane permeability decrease the rate of carbon assimilation and consequently the fruit yield abdolahipour et al 2019 wey and schultz 2006 in the warm regions application of shading nets decreases the red farred ratio of solar radiation and thus causing a reduction in leaf temperature and air vapor pressure shortage which increase leaf gas exchange carbon assimilation and in consequent vegetative growth manja and aoun 2019 mupambi et al 2018 solomakhin and blanke 2010 shading increase the leaf dimension relative water content and stomatal conductance and reduced defects and leaf cell ion leakage zare et al 2019 reducing the leaf temperature and increment of leaf water potential along with the increment of soil moisture content could significantly reduce the

rate of cell expansion and development kumar and purohit 2003 li 2002 4 3 reproductive characteristics favorable moisture conditions especially during the third phase of fruit development increases the synthesis and transfer of photo assimilates and improves the quality of fruit size and weight graf et al 2008 jafari et al 2012 high air temperature and drought cause the dehydration in the fig tree and prevents the tree from producing fruit fruit drop is also a mechanism for tree to survive in these conditions in the rainfed fig production the net profit depends more on the quality of the fruits the physiological quality and metabolites contents of the fruit are mainly affected by the air temperature and relative humidity in our experiment the use of shade net and wheat straw mulch along with adjuvant soil water penetration systems significantly increased the number of grade aa as the best quality among fig fruits with light yellow skin and high commercial value also application of shade net improved the effect of wheat straw mulch with adjuvant soil water penetration systems on increment of fruit quality traits such as fruit total soluble solids and fruit flavor index increasing the number of fruits with diameters 22 mm grade aa and with diameters 17 22 mm grade a respectively had a significant effect on increasing the yield of fig trees in addition to improving the effect of vegetative growth on reproductive characteristics increment of the fruit size could be due to enhancing the duration of fruit ripening by the use of shade net the number of grade aa fruits in estahban orchards depends not only on the amount of soil moisture but also on the caprification which depends on the tree best growing conditions for the activity of the wasp blastophaga psenes as common fig trees ficus carica l sabz pollinators jafari et al 2012 although the increment and retention of soil moisture content with the use of wheat straw mulch along with adjuvant soil water penetration systems increased the yield and the number of desirable fruits but also increased the number of dark brown skin fruits which reduces its profitability increment of the fruit moisture during the warm season with the high solar radiation intensity and air temperature could provide the condition for fig fruits to turn brown during the ripening faghih and sabet sarvestani 2001 flaishman et al 2008 browning is one of the problems that could be occurred by the non enzymatic browning reaction millard which is accelerated by the increment of the fruit temperature and moisture asadi yousefabad et al 2013 khalil et al 2013 in these conditions the use of 25 intensity white suspended shade net can reduce the canopy temperature and the fruit non enzymatic browning reaction and as a result improves the fruit color quality the application of shade net s significantly increased the fruit yield of fig trees under rain fed conditions the highest amount of fig fruit yield belongs to the application of shade net and wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees s mp among the different treatments covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and using wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees s mp had the greatest effect on improving the vegetative growth and physiological attribute of fig trees this treatment had the highest impacts on the increment of yield and fruit quality of sabz fig in rainfed conditions also reduces the labor costs for harvesting and also increases the health quality of fig fruit in terms of the possibility of contamination with aflatoxins 5 conclusions the efficiency of the water harvesting system depends on the amount of water consumed by the crop and the amount of rainfall received in the catchment area in fact the overall efficiency of the system can be affected by local bed slope soil infiltration soil moisture potential and plant evapotranspiration experimental application of wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees mp resulted in significant improvement in the soil moisture content within 0 180 cm soil depth over three years and the efficiency of rainwater resources for rain fed fig orchards in estahban region by changing the structure of the underlying surface wheat straw mulching and plowing could increase infiltration after heavy rains increment of the soil water content and application of shade net resulted in higher leaf gas exchange light saturated net co2 assimilation and leaf water potential as the main effective variable in association with increment of fig trees growth and commercial fruit yield results indicate that application of 25 intensity white suspended shade net not only improved both vegetative and reproductive characteristics but also reduced the thermal browning reaction and enhanced the fruit color quality in comparison with the use of conventional microcatchment ctrl the use of shade s and its interaction with the application of wheat straw mulch with adjacent soil water penetration alleviated the drought damage in fig trees in particular the interactive effect of covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and using wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees s mp treatment performed the best among the different treatments investigated in this study and had the high profitability due to the increment of the fruit yield and its commercial quality of sabz fig under severe droughts in rainfed conditions the production of high quality fig fruit is the key factor in market competitiveness thus can drive the producers to apply integrated

annual production of 86 372 tons fao 2019 sabz fig cultivar is the most important traditional rainfed crops cultivated in estahban region as a sustainable heritage of fig culture systems fao 2011 in the south east region of fars province iran green or sabz cultivar is a smyrna type cultivar and produce the most dried fruit figs from syconia of second crop main crop which grows on the leaf axils of the current season by specific pollination the fruits of caprifigs cultivars as pollinizer with certain type of wasp blastophaga psenes are needed this cultivar is one of the most drought tolerant compared with other cultivars and thrive in areas with long and hot summers sedaghat and rahemi 2018 90 of the country s dried fig production in rainfed conditions belongs to the estahban region and the precipitation status plays an important role in local resident s income jafari et al 2012 in recent years many prolonged rainfall deficits and drought conditions chronically impedes rainfed fig trees growth also in some cases extreme drought conditions caused severe damage to rainfed fig trees and results in massive leaf abscission and about 10 of trees branches were dried that caused a reduction in fruit quantity and quality gholami et al 2012 jafari et al 2015 karimi et al 2012 tehrani et al 2016 zare et al 2019 sometimes in these situations the trees themselves were exposed to death and the priority for fig producers is the tree survival zare et al 2019 improper distribution and limited precipitation results in a slow water recharge to a deep soil layer and subsequently a water deficit for deep rooted trees in rainfed drylands ding et al 2021 qian et al 2015 also long term drought conditions can significantly reduce the deep soil moisture qu et al 2019 the recent rise in air temperature intensity of solar radiation meena et al 2016 considerable reduction in annual cold nights increase in the number of annual warm nights alexander et al 2006 howden et al 2007 increased the destructive effects of drought on fig trees these conditions cause the plant wilting reduced photosynthesis stomatal conductance water use efficiency relative water content and leaf chlorophyll content arora et al 2002 also the increment of transpiration accelerates the soil moisture depletion and scarcity the soil moisture reservation is an important factor for sustainable development of fig production in the region the scarcity and unreliability of rainfall and its disproportionate distribution necessitate the preservation and storage of soil moisture and the optimal use of rainfall in the region also fully utilizing rainwater resources soil moisture management and applying protective treatments are important factors to increase the resilience of the rain fed fig against drought stress and maintain the sustainable crop production according to this the use of water harvesting techniques shade net and mulching measures along with other horticultural management such as severe thinning out of one year old lateral branches can improve the efficiency of rainwater utilization that is crucial for sustainable productivity of rain fed fig trees abdolahipour et al 2019 rainwater harvesting in the region is a traditional practice for supplying water by using semicircular micro catchments built perpendicular to the foothill slopes for intercepting run off collecting rain water and increasing soil water content abdolahipour et al 2019 semicircular micro catchments enhance the local impoundment and infiltration of rainfall jiang et al 2014 especially when faced with heavy storms of a short duration guo et al 2019 in addition to the water harvesting techniques among the various methods to enhance the soil moisture and reduce the effects of drought stress jokar et al 2021 zare 2021 the most effective ones could be the application of mulch with multi holed infiltration pipes ding et al 2021 song et al 2018 and suspended shade net mudau et al 2017 this procedure could provide the favorable conditions for infiltration and recharge of water in the deep soil layers and enhance water storage in the soil profile decrease the evapotranspiration rate and enhance the photosynthetic activity and adverse effects of drought on plant growth zhou et al 2018 rainwater harvesting with infiltration multi holed pipe and mulching could be useful to efficiently utilize rainwater resources and improve the soil moisture content and increase in the spatial extent of wetted areas over both horizontal and vertical soil layers for rain fed orchards this technique promoted fine roots growth which was directly related to wetted soil guo et al 2019 song et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that application of soil surface organic mulches and incorporate the mulch to soil as an effective water conservation technique significantly improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity liao et al 2021 applying a layer of organic mulches as a physical isolation layer reduces the amount of heat radiation reaching the ground and thus causes the regulate soil temperature variations reduction of soil water evaporation prevent weeds and fugitive dust from soil improve soil microbiology and fertility and increase the water infiltration crop yields and water use efficiency especially for rainfed trees growing in semiarid areas jafari 2012 liu et al 2014 truong and marschner 2021 wang et al 2015 mulches effectively protect the roots of plants against extreme summer heat applying wheat straw mulches had significant positive impacts on the growth and fruit quality of fig orchards and was recommended as organic mulch in the estahban region jafari 2012 wheat straw mulches had a soft compacted porous surface that was created after the first rainfall and hindered the loss of moisture and weed growing also straw mulch reduces nutrient and total organic carbon transport by runoff korkanç and şahin 2021 the combined water harvesting techniques straw mulching and the 36 m2 micro catchment improved soil moisture content plant height and leaf number per tree as well as the physiology of pistachio trees tadros et al 2021 the combination of organic mulching and rainwater harvesting with infiltration techniques could have both potential positive environmental and productive effects due to their benefits of water infiltration and fine root growth in the field ecosystem when the air temperature is high the quality of dried figs drops sharply and the fruit becomes small black and hollow suspended shade nets can improve the microclimates harvesting operation and the quality of fruit and lowering postharvest losses jokar et al 2021 mudau et al 2017 application of shade net reduces the labor cost and the damage caused by pests fungi and physical wind damage selahle et al 2015 tinyane 2013 therefore the objectives of this study were to evaluate the simple and interactive effect of the application of suspended shade net with two water penetration system application of infiltration pipes and plowing perpendicular upslope along with wheat straw

intensity of solar radiation had destructive effects on fig trees the increment of evapotranspiration accelerates the soil moisture depletion and decrease the soil and plant moisture reservation that is an important factor for sustainable development of rain fed fig production in the region collecting rainwater in microcatchment is a unique way to provide moisture for rain fed fig trees in estahban semi arid regions with limited and variable rainfall soil infiltration soil moisture potential and local bed slope determine the amount of water collected in the microcatchment and excess water is overflowed over the microcatchments jafari et al 2012 in addition to this conventional method in the region other water harvesting and infiltration systems with different efficiency can be applied to improve the availability of water and maintain adequate soil water content for an extended period and assist sustainable yields under such condition especially during drought periods mandal et al 2020 tadros et al 2021 vetter and rieger 2019 in our experiment infiltrating the surface streams of rainwater and water collected in the microcatchment in the depth of the soil by plowing upstream of trees and concentrating infiltration pipes and also maintaining soil moisture by using wheat straw as organic mulch significantly improved the physiological characteristics and the yield of fig trees in rainfed conditions increasing and maintaining soil moisture at all three soil depths especially at lower depths had a significant effect on increasing the yield of fig trees in rainfed conditions table 8 this can be due to the further growth and expansion of fig roots systems at the depth of 50 100 cm green and clothier 1999 jafari et al 2012 the interaction between plant and soil depends more on the activity of the fine root system in which their growth and distribution in the soil profile are positively correlated with changes in the soil moisture content powers et al 2005 song et al 2018 soil moisture depends on environmental parameters reducing the solar energy reaching the soil surface and soil temperature by using organic mulch horton et al 1996 wang et al 2015 could be associated with less evaporation from the soil wheat straw with low porosity blocks the direct water connection between the soil surface and the atmosphere and effectively reduces soil evaporation thus improves the soil moisture content and soil moisture conservation gholami et al 2014 liao et al 2021 tang et al 2021 using organic mulch treatments especially during warm conditions in summer can play an effective role in soil moisture retention in comparison with control more average soil moisture retention between april to september belongs to mp treatment 15 3 followed by m treatment 8 66 also in the rainy seasons of the years october to march the average soil moisture content significantly increased with the application of mp and m treatment by 28 8 and 7 76 in comparison to the control the use of shade net s and especially s mp increased the soil moisture storage especially in the depths of fig root system expansion the amount of soil moisture content especially at greater soil depths should be reduced much more slowly during the drought by covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net application of m and mp can significantly increase the extent of wetted areas in the whole soil spatial profile also this treatment could enhance the ability of soil moisture infiltration to deeper soil layers and preserve the soil moisture and enhance the regulation of soil moisture reservoirs ding et al 2021 straw mulch with 10 cm thickness absorbs part of the rainfall liao et al 2021 but when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate the absorption and gradually release capability of water by wheat straw and its effect on the roughness and tortuosity of flow paths can promote water infiltration liu et al 2014 rahma et al 2017 4 2 growth and physiological characteristics fig plant show an adaptive behavior to prolonged water stress responding through large leaf abscission and closure of stomata moreover when exposed to water stress leaf expansion thickness inclination and gas exchange modiﬁcations occurred ammar et al 2022 another strategy of defense is the maintenance of leaf cell turgidity and cell membrane function due to increase in osmolytes mardinata et al 2021 this can be occurred by consuming photo assimilates in compensation of decreased quantitative and qualitative yield of the fig fruit covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and its interaction with the application of wheat straw and adjuvant soil water penetration systems had desirable effects on the increment of current year shoot length shoot diameter and number of leaves per shoot over the course of the study these results are in accordance with the reports of jokar et al 2021 that showed the growth of fig trees was improved by the use of shade nets these treatments could have improved the shoot growth which resulted in more internodes and consequently more leaves and fruits by providing the favorable weather conditions such as reducing the air temperature and increasing the relative humidity in the canopy of fig trees and increment of soil moisture content unlike stressful situations under such condition s plants dedicate more photo assimilates and resources to shoot elongation and leaf development brutnell 2006 high intensity of radiation air temperature and low leaf water potential can cause leaf chlorophyll decay and chlorosis and induce the leaf fall in fig trees that can be an indicator of the death risk in fig trees zare et al 2019 ficus carica is a delayed greening species that could be a strategy to cope with environmental stress under hot and drought conditions also fig trees showed an increase in leaf inclination to avoid excess sunlight that could cause photo oxidation and to prevent photoinhibition in summer and reduce transpiration by lowering leaf temperature gonzález rodríguez and peters 2010 improving the microclimate conditions by covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and increasing the soil moisture content using wheat straw and adjuvant soil water penetration systems might have provided a more suitable condition for reducing the radiation intensity and in consequent leaf temperature and increment of leaf water potential also this condition could have desirable effects on the leaf physiological characteristics such as leaf chlorophyll content index leaf areas leaf stomatal conductance leaf transpiration and leaf light saturated net co2 assimilation which ultimately improves the vegetative growth and reproductive characteristics of fig trees in rainfed conditions according to the principal component analysis increment of light saturated net co2 assimilation leaf water potential shoot length leaf chlorophyll content index stomatal conductance leaf transpiration number of leaves per shoot leaf areas and shoot diameter respectively had significant positive correlation with the enhancement of yield and improvement of reproductive characteristics of sabz fig table 8 high leaf temperatures and lower leaf water potential in association with senescence and cell membrane permeability decrease the rate of carbon assimilation and consequently the fruit yield abdolahipour et al 2019 wey and schultz 2006 in the warm regions application of shading nets decreases the red farred ratio of solar radiation and thus causing a reduction in leaf temperature and air vapor pressure shortage which increase leaf gas exchange carbon assimilation and in consequent vegetative growth manja and aoun 2019 mupambi et al 2018 solomakhin and blanke 2010 shading increase the leaf dimension relative water content and stomatal conductance and reduced defects and leaf cell ion leakage zare et al 2019 reducing the leaf temperature and increment of leaf water potential along with the increment of soil moisture content could significantly reduce the number of sunburned leaves per shoot and its effects on fig trees drought stress and reduction of turgor affects the growth rate stem elongation leaves expansion and stomatal aperture by reducing the rate of cell expansion and development kumar and purohit 2003 li 2002 4 3 reproductive characteristics favorable moisture conditions especially during the third phase of fruit development increases the synthesis and transfer of photo assimilates and improves the quality of fruit size and weight graf et al 2008 jafari et al 2012 high air temperature and drought cause the dehydration in the fig tree and prevents the tree from producing fruit fruit drop is also a mechanism for tree to survive in these conditions in the rainfed fig production the net profit depends more on the quality of the fruits the physiological quality and metabolites contents of the fruit are mainly affected by the air temperature and relative humidity in our experiment the use of shade net and wheat straw mulch along with adjuvant soil water penetration systems significantly increased the number of grade aa as the best quality among fig fruits with light yellow skin and high commercial value also application of shade net improved the effect of wheat straw mulch with adjuvant soil water penetration systems on increment of fruit quality traits such as fruit total soluble solids and fruit flavor index increasing the number of fruits with diameters 22 mm grade aa and with diameters 17 22 mm grade a respectively had a significant effect on increasing the yield of fig trees in addition to improving the effect of vegetative growth on reproductive characteristics increment of the fruit size could be due to enhancing the duration of fruit ripening by the use of shade net the number of grade aa fruits in estahban orchards depends not only on the amount of soil moisture but also on the caprification which depends on the tree best growing conditions for the activity of the wasp blastophaga psenes as common fig trees ficus carica l sabz pollinators jafari et al 2012 although the increment and retention of soil moisture content with the use of wheat straw mulch along with adjuvant soil water penetration systems increased the yield and the number of desirable fruits but also increased the number of dark brown skin fruits which reduces its profitability increment of the fruit moisture during the warm season with the high solar radiation intensity and air temperature could provide the condition for fig fruits to turn brown during the ripening faghih and sabet sarvestani 2001 flaishman et al 2008 browning is one of the problems that could be occurred by the non enzymatic browning reaction millard which is accelerated by the increment of the fruit temperature and moisture asadi yousefabad et al 2013 khalil et al 2013 in these conditions the use of 25 intensity white suspended shade net can reduce the canopy temperature and the fruit non enzymatic browning reaction and as a result improves the fruit color quality the application of shade net s significantly increased the fruit yield of fig trees under rain fed conditions the highest amount of fig fruit yield belongs to the application of shade net and wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees s mp among the different treatments covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and using wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees s mp had the greatest effect on improving the vegetative growth and physiological attribute of fig trees this treatment had the highest impacts on the increment of yield and fruit quality of sabz fig in rainfed conditions also reduces the labor costs for harvesting and also increases the health quality of fig fruit in terms of the possibility of contamination with aflatoxins 5 conclusions the efficiency of the water harvesting system depends on the amount of water consumed by the crop and the amount of rainfall received in the catchment area in fact the overall efficiency of the system can be affected by local bed slope soil infiltration soil moisture potential and plant evapotranspiration experimental application of wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees mp resulted in significant improvement in the soil moisture content within 0 180 cm soil depth over three years and the efficiency of rainwater resources for rain fed fig orchards in estahban region by changing the structure of the underlying surface wheat straw mulching and plowing could increase infiltration after heavy rains increment of the soil water content and application of shade net resulted in higher leaf gas exchange light saturated net co2 assimilation and leaf water potential as the main effective variable in association with increment of fig trees growth and commercial fruit yield results indicate that application of 25 intensity white suspended shade net not only improved both vegetative and reproductive characteristics but also reduced the thermal browning reaction and enhanced the fruit color quality in comparison with the use of conventional microcatchment ctrl the use of shade s and its interaction with the application of wheat straw mulch with adjacent soil water penetration alleviated the drought damage in fig trees in particular the interactive effect of covering the tree canopy with 25 intensity white suspended shade net and using wheat straw mulch with two concentrating infiltration pipes and on the surface of plowing perpendicular to the upstream slope of the trees s mp treatment performed the best among the different treatments investigated in this study and had the high profitability due to the increment of the fruit yield and its commercial quality of sabz fig under severe droughts in rainfed conditions the production of high quality fig fruit is the key factor in market competitiveness thus can drive the producers to apply integrated management such as shade net and wheat straw mulch along with adjuvant soil water penetration systems to realize these targets especially under water scarcity conditions ethics approval not applicable

9396,while the oryza crop model has been widely used in the simulation of rice growth its computation ability is limited in terms of simulating the water balance components wbcs of paddy fields under water saving irrigation conditions such as alternate wetting and drying awd regimes in this study a new water balance simulation framework wbsf reflecting the characteristics of awd is integrated into the original oryza2000 v2 13 model to simulate the wbc of paddy fields in addition algorithms for dynamically simulating the root length growing rate are added to the original oryza algorithms quantifying water stress are also modified the improved model is further applied to paddy fields in yongkang and tuanlin which are two typical rice growing areas in china the results show that the improved model performs well at simulating wbcs the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of daily ponded water depth ranged from 0 82 to 0 94 across experiments under continuous flooding and awd at the two sites showing an increase in nse of at least 0 23 compared to oryza v3 levels the absolute value of relative errors a re between simulated and measured values for total irrigation and drainage amount was mostly no more than 10 and showed a reduction of at least 11 the improved model also showed better performance in terms of evapotranspiration percolation and root length simulation compared to oryza v3 the yield predictive accuracy of the improved model is slightly better than that of oryza2000 v2 13 but worse than that of oryza v3 which might be due to the poor performance of nitrogen balance modules in the improved model in general given the results achieved it is possible to state that the wbsf of the improved oryza2000 showed an enhanced capability to simulate wbcs which are recommended for use in water balance simulations of paddy fields keywords oryza model improvement water balance simulation paddy rice water saving irrigation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most important food crops in the world and consumes a large amount of water for agricultural irrigation carrijo et al 2017 gao et al 2021 lampayan et al 2015a as water resources become increasingly scarce exploring effective water saving irrigation techniques to increase the water productivity of rice will greatly benefit agricultural water management field experiments are an important means to understand the effects of water saving irrigation on rice growth and water balance though they are labor and time intensive belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 in addition the results of experiments are difficult to extrapolate since factors that affect rice growth i e climate and soil fertility in other areas might be different model simulation is a reliable means to complement empirical results feng et al 2007 a crop water model that can accurately simulate the growth of rice and water balance components wbcs under different water saving irrigation regimes will surely benefit the study of water saving irrigation the oryza model is a process based crop model that can simulate rice growth in situations of potential production water limitations and nitrogen limitations bouman et al 2001 li et al 2017 when the model is used for water limited simulations modules related to water balance are used by the model to simulate the effect of water stress on rice growth and to estimate wbcs including ponded water depth pwd soil water content swc evaporation transpiration percolation irrigation and drainage amount to date oryza has been widely used to investigate the relationships between rice growth and water consumption bouman et al 2007 sudhir et al 2012 yadav et al 2011 alternate wetting and drying awd is a mode of water saving irrigation widely applied for lowland rice lampayan et al 2015a li et al 2004 however the original oryza cannot schedule irrigation and drainage according to the actual control criteria of awd irrigation regimes and cannot accurately simulate the dynamics of wbcs in paddy fields under awd in the original oryza the upper limit of pwd after an irrigation application can only be set as a constant value throughout the growing season while this depth might vary across different stages in practice mao 2002 in addition drainage surface drainage is assumed to occur when pwd exceeds the bund height in the original oryza while farmers usually drain before pwd reaches the bund height pan et al 2017 when paddy field conditions change from wet to dry the original oryza assumes that the ponded water is consumed by evaporation first and then by transpiration which might underestimate actual transpiration levels and thus affect the quantification of water stress in addition percolation is assumed to be valued at zero when ponded water disappears while percolation still exists when soil is unsaturated in actual fields li and luo 2003 in addition root lengths affect rice water uptake however the original oryza assumes that the root length grows at a fixed rate throughout the whole growing season which diverges from the results of existing experiments das and jat 1977 this approach might misestimate root length and thus affect water balance simulation therefore modules of the original oryza related to water balance are not suitable for the wbcs simulation of actual paddy fields especially for fields subjected to awd obtaining accurate measurements of rice yield and water consumption levels is essential for the evaluation of water savings and yield increases in water saving irrigation regimes in addition irrigation managers wish to know the irrigation water consumption levels needed to ensure crop yields of different irrigation modes which can provide decision making support for agricultural water management this study improves modules related to water balance simulation of the original oryza2000 v2 13 model the main objectives of this study are 1 propose a water balance simulation framework wbsf based on oryza model for paddy fields under awd 2 apply the improved oryza2000 that incorporates the new wbsf in two case studies yongkang and tuanlin in china to evaluate the capabilities of the improved model in simulating pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation and drainage amounts root lengths and rice yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 oryza model description two widely used versions of oryza are oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 and oryza v3 li et al 2017 which are programed by fortran language the source code of oryza2000 v2 13 is publicly available and can be found at https sites google com a irri org oryza2000 oryza v3 is the successor of oryza2000 constructed by li et al and adds soil carbon nitrogen and temperature dynamic modules based on oryza2000 to our knowledge the source code of oryza v3 has not been publicly available online by now the key modules of these two versions are basically the same and include 1 et which calculates reference evapotranspiration et0 and potential evapotranspiration etm the sum of potential evaporation and transpiration supplementary section 1 1 3 illustrates the main equations of etm computation used in the et module 2 wstress which calculates factors to quantify the effects of water stress on rice growth and estimates actual transpiration 3 oryza1 which simulates variables related to rice growth 4 ncrop which calculates the nitrogen uptake of rice 5 nsoil which calculates nitrogen supply from soil and fertilizer 6 irrig which calculates the irrigation amount and 7 paddy which calculates drainage amount actual evaporation and percolation after simulation begins the model first sets the initial conditions and then uses different modules to calculate variables related to rice growth and water balance over daily time steps until rice maturity when oryza is used to simulate rice growth in situations of water nitrogen limitation modules are applied in the following order et wstress oryza1 ncrop nsoil irrig and paddy 2 2 model improvements since the source code of oryza2000 v2 13 is publicly available and algorithms related to the calculation of potential evapotranspiration actual evaporation transpiration and percolation as well as soil water transport are basically the same between oryza2000 v2 13 and oryza v3 the improvements of water balance modules were done on oryza2000 v2 13 using fortran language the modifications are done as follows 1 a new irrigation and drainage module irdr is included to schedule irrigation and drainage the irrg module is no longer used for the calculation of daily irrigation amount 2 algorithms for calculating etm in the et module have been modified 3 algorithms for computing actual transpiration evaporation and percolation have been modified in the paddy module actual transpiration is no longer calculated by the wstress module 4 algorithms simulating root length in the oryza1 module have been modified 5 modules of the improved model are applied in the following new order et paddy wstress oryza1 ncrop and nsoil algorithms for calculating water stress factors have also been modified 2 2 1 water balance simulation framework for paddy fields under alternate wetting and drying conditions paddy fields are always bounded and most of them are puddled and have a plow sole with large resistance to water flow wopereis et al 1992 in the two original oryza models oryza2000 2 13 and oryzav3 the vertical profile of paddy field is mainly schematically described by four layers including a ponded water layer a muddy layer with little resistance to water flow a plow sole and a nonpuddled subsoil wopereis et al 1994 fig 1 these three soil layers can be divided into several sublayers according to the requirement of users and each layer is schematized with a reservoir the bottom boundary can be set as a free drainage boundary fig 1 a or a groundwater table fig 1 b since the oryza is a one dimensional model the model only simulated the transformation of soil water in vertical direction the improved oryza2000 follows the schematization of the paddy field in the original models however the bottom boundary was assumed to be a free drainage boundary which is because the groundwater table under a specific field strongly responds to rainfall and irrigation events and is influenced by the hydrology of a broader environment and thus a one dimensional model i e oryza might have difficulty accurately simulating the dynamic change in groundwater levels belder et al 2007 bouman et al 2005 besides for most puddled paddy field percolation rates are fairly stable during cropping season and little affected by groundwater table depths bouman et al 1994 in addition for irrigated paddy fields ponded water presence in most of the time during the whole growth periods of rice belder et al 2004 han et al 2021 pan et al 2017 and thus capillary rise causing by shallow groundwater table has relatively short time to affect the water content in the root zone therefore to simplify the structure of the improved oryza2000 the bottom boundary is assumed to be a free drainage boundary fig 1 a while the selection of setting groundwater table from the original model is still kept the wbcs of paddy fields include precipitation irrigation drainage capillary rise percolation seepage evaporation transpiration seepage occurs due to the piezometer head differences between fields or due to differences in water levels between fields and surrounding drains ditches or creeks bouman et al 2001 therefore seepage is not computed separately in the two original oryza models neither do the improved oryza2000 the capillary rise is only computed based on the depth of groundwater table when the bottom boundary is set as groundwater table in the two original models bouman et al 2001 since the bottom boundary in the improved oryza2000 is assumed to be a free drainage boundary capillary rise is not computed separately in this model the other wbcs are computed by et wstress irrg and paddy modules in the two original models in the improved oryza2000 a new wbsf was used to compute the irrigation drainage percolation evaporation and transpiration the difference between the original and the improved models in wbcs simulation are described as follows 2 2 1 1 irrigation and drainage irrigation time can be determined by different trigger conditions in the two original oryza models including the lower limit of ponded water critical soil water content or tension or days after the disappearance of ponded water bouman et al 2001 in a simulation only one kind of trigger condition can be selected in oryza2000 v2 13 although this limitation is addressed in oryza v3 the threshold of each trigger condition can still only be set as a fixed value throughout the growing season in addition the water amount per irrigation application can only be set as fixed in the simulation of oryza2000 v2 13 in oryza v3 variable autodept is included to determine the upper limit of pwd of each irrigation event however autodept can only be set as a fixed value moreover drainage only occurs when ponded water is above the bund height in these two versions of oryza in fact some water saving regimes may require different thresholds to trigger irrigation and drainage at different stages while the irrigation amount provided at each irrigation event may change with rice growth han et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 thus a new irrigation and drainage module irdr was used to schedule irrigation and drainage in the improved oryza2000 in irdr precipitation is read first and supplies the ponded water and soil layers from top to bottom a new variable called the bottleneck layer bnl is added to determine the lowest soil layer below the field that rainfall can supply the bnl has the following characteristics ① the saturated hydraulic conductivity kst of this layer is less than the water deficit of the adjacent subsoil layer ② the kst of this layer is less than that of all upper soil layers after considering the precipitation supply irrigation or drainage is determined a technique using three thresholds is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields guo 1997 wu et al 2019 the three thresholds include the minimum fitting threshold h min or θ min the maximum fitting depth h max and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment h p irrigation is triggered and automatically fills h max when pwd is less than h min or swc is less than θ min the drainage is triggered when pwd is above h p the three thresholds can be set as different values in different stages the flow chart illustrating the computation of daily irrigation and drainage amounts are shown in fig 2 supplementary section 1 1 1 illustrates the detailed computation and equations 2 2 1 2 evaporation transpiration and percolation in the two original oryza models the evaporation transpiration and percolation are computed according to the following steps 1 first the total potential evaporation evm and transpiration trm are computed based on the reference evapotranspiration et0 and leaf area index lai by the et module 2 then the transpiration demand of each layer are computed based on the trm and the soil water tensions by the wstress module 3 finally water balance simulation are implemented from top ponded water layer to bottom nonpuddled subsoil layer by paddy module in paddy module evaporation demand of each layer is firstly computed based on evm and the amount of water in the upper layers that sustain for evaporation then water available in each layer sustains evaporation demand first and then transpiration demand percolation is the vertical movement of water beyond the root zone bouman et al 2001 and is assumed to be zero without ponded water if there is ponded water ponded water is assumed to be lost in the form of evaporation first then transpiration and finally percolation therefore the flux calculation of the paddy module can be divided into four different situations 1 ponded water can sustain both evaporation and transpiration demand the rest of the ponded water sustains percolation demand 2 ponded water can sustain evaporation but only part of transpiration the rest of transpiration demand is sustained by soil water and percolation is zero 3 ponded water can sustain only part of the evaporation demand the rest of the evaporation demand and transpiration demand is sustained by soil water while percolation is zero 4 no ponded water both the evaporation and transpiration demand are met by taking soil water however percolation still exists in soil when ponded water disappears li et al 2021 sonkar et al 2019 since soil hydraulic conductivity is not equal to zero in this case ghanbarian 2021 rad et al 2019 besides these three loss paths should occur simultaneously when water is abundant in the improved oryza2000 actual evaporation and transpiration and downward flux df of each layer ponded water layer muddy layer plow sole nonpuddled subsoil layer are computed from top to bottom in each layer water available in the layer is firstly computed considering the water supply from the adjacent upper layer the actual df of the adjacent upper layer meanwhile evaporation transpiration and df demand in this layer are computed then the available water of this layer is allocated to meet evaporation transpiration and df demands according to their relative portion finally the terminal pwd and swc of the daily simulation are computed based on water balance the actual evaporation and transpiration of each layer are sum up as the total actual evaporation and transpiration and the df of the bottom soil layer within the root zone is taken as percolation fig 3 illustrates the flowchart of the evaporation transpiration and df computation from fig 3 the following explanations are provided 1 available water both in the original and improved oryza models the available water of the ponded water layer is equal to the pwd the computation of available water in soil layers are different among the two original models and the improved oryza2000 in oryza2000 v2 13 soil water between saturation and wilting point can sustain the demand of evapotranspiration completely bouman et al 2001 while in oryza v3 a factor called dtf dtf 2 86 are added to adjust the extractability of soil water li et al 2017 according to the previous study soil water above the wilting point cannot be fully taken up since water uptake is limited by rising soil mechanical resistance under drying da silva et al 1994 de lima et al 2020 letey 2011 in the improved oryza2000 a simplified way is incorporated to computed the available water in soil layers li and luo 2003 the water available in soil layer is divided into quick acting water and delayed acting water by a critical water content between field capacity and the wilting point quick acting water is soil water available above the critical content while delayed acting water is soil water available between the critical content level and wilting point the improved model assumes that the continuous state of soil moisture will be disrupted when the actual swc is less than the critical content level and thus soil water available between the wilting point and critical content level is reduced to quantify the effect of drought detailed equations of available water computation are illustrated in the supplementary section 1 1 2 2 evaporation and transpiration in the two original oryza models reference evapotranspiration et0 can be computed through three methods the penman monteith method priestley taylor method and makkink method bouman et al 2001 et0 is further separated into the aerodynamic term etae and radiation term etrd to compute the evm and trm and then sum to the etm the simulated lai is also used in the calculation of evm and trm since the lai predictive accuracy of oryza is not stable bouman and van laar 2006 jing et al 2007 yuan et al 2017 the error of the lai simulation might affect the accuracy of the evm and trm output therefore two factors evk1 and trk2 are added to the exponential term containing lai in the original equations see the supplementary equation s13 and s14 by changing the value of evk1 and trk2 the simulated etm can be adjusted to be close to the corresponding observed values the evk1 and trk2 can be set based on the observed daily pwd and evapotranspiration under continuous flooding treatments detailed equations of evm trm and etm computation are illustrated in the supplementary section 1 1 3 after the evm and trm computation these two values are used for the computation of evaporation and transpiration demand in each layer the two original models assume that the evm and trm are firstly sustained by ponded water thus the evaporation and transpiration demand of ponded water layer are equal to evm and trm respectively when ponded water cannot sustain evm and trm soil water is used to sustain the deficit of evaporation and transpiration therefore the deficit of evaporation and transpiration are the evaporation and transpiration demand of soil layers the improved oryza2000 follows the assumptions related to evapotranspiration demand above the two original oryza models assume that only water from the ponded water layer and the first soil layer below the field can be lost in the form of evaporation this limitation is eliminated in the improved oryza2000 because water from deeper soil might also be lost due to evaporation in the improved model the number of soil layers that can sustain water for evaporation demand can be determined by users detailed equations of evaporation computation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 4 in oryza2000 v2 13 transpiration demand is distributed to soil layers within the root zone based on root length in each layer bouman et al 2001 in oryza v3 transpiration demand is distributed based on root biomass in each soil layer li et al 2017 in the improved oryza2000 water from soil layers with higher swc are assumed to be absorbed by plant more easily a new set of equations are used to compute the transpiration demand of soil layers based on the swc and root length according to feddes et al s study feddes et al 1976 detailed equations of transpiration computation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 5 3 downward flux and percolation in the two original oryza models percolation can be set as a fixed value or computed by a module called satflx bouman et al 2001 and is assumed to be zero when the ponded water disappears in the improved oryza2000 the df of each layer is computed and df of the bottom soil layer within the root zone is taken as percolation when roots penetrate a soil layer water may flow along the gap between roots and soil and thus might affect the df of this layer wang 2018 neither oryza2000 v2 13 nor oryza v3 consider the effect of root penetration and the models might thus underestimate percolation in the late stages of rice growth in the improved model a new equation was constructed to correct the kst to quantify this phenomenon where the kst of a soil layer will increase as the length of root in this layer increase besides variable bnl was also used in the computation of df in the improved model the df demand of the ponded water layer is determined by the kst of the bnl and water deficits of soil layers not lower than the bnl df demand of soil layer i is determined by the kst of the bnl and water deficits of soil layers between layer i and the bnl and is limited by the actual hydraulic conductivity of layer i detailed equations of df computation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 6 4 water allocation in the improved oryza2000 water available in each layer is allocated according to the relative ratio of evaporation transpiration and df demands besides if the swc of a specific soil layer is less than field capacity the actual df of this layer is set to zero detailed equations of water allocation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 7 2 2 2 modification of root length simulation some previous studies have shown that the root length of rice does not grow linearly during the whole growing period beyrouty et al 1988 das and jat 1977 and rice roots will grow deeper when rice is subjected to water stress mao et al 2003 besides root length of rice will decrease in the late growth stage such as that observed for root biomass because of the senescence of roots hao et al 2009 the two original oryza models simulate root length at a fixed growth rate and remain at a maximum after flowering which might not be able to determine the range of soil that can sustain water for rice evapotranspiration the improved oryza2000 dynamically compute the growth rate of root length based on the growth rate of root biomass and consider the effect of water stress on root length growth see the supplementary equation s36 and s37 in addition root length growth is assumed to stop at flowering a new equation was added to quantify the effect of senescence on root length after flowering see the supplementary equation s38 2 2 3 modification of water stress simulation since the wstress module is called before the paddy module in the daily simulation of the two original oryza models the soil tension used to compute the water stress factors is read from the output of the previous day which might not be able to accurately quantify the impact of the actual water deficit for that day therefore the paddy module is instead called before the wstress module in the improved oryza2000 actual transpiration computed by the new wbsf is used to compute the water stress factor 2 3 model application 2 3 1 field experiments data from experiments performed in yongkang and tuanlin china were used to test the improved oryza2000 in yongkang 28 42 n 120 12 e in zhejiang province china experiments were performed on clay loam from an experimental station located in a hilly area of central zhejiang cultivar zhongzheyou1 was used for experiments in 2007 and 2008 the experiments involved two water treatments continuous flooding cf and awd the nitrogen application rate was set as 230 kg hm2 according to local farmers practices in tuanlin 30 52 n 112 1 e in hubei province china experiments were performed on silty clay loam from the experimental station of the zhanghe irrigation system two cultivars were used xinliangyou xiang4 in 2009 and hybrid premium63 in 2010 as done for the experiments conducted in yongkang the experiments applied cf and awd treatments the nitrogen application rate was set as 180 kg hm2 the locally used application rate in these two experiments the two water treatments were tested with three replicates in six plots the plots in yongkang and tuanlin were 12 5 m 8 m and 15 m 4 m in size respectively each plot was puddled before transplanting the dates of rice transplanting panicle initiation flowering and maturity were recorded during the experiments table 1 the root lengths of rice in different stages were observed and yields were measured at maturity in addition daily precipitation pwd percolation irrigation and drainage amounts were monitored during the experiments daily precipitation was measured by weather station at experiment site pwd was observed by a water gauge at 8 00 a m every day percolation was monitored by a thin walled cylinder covered to prevent rain and sunlight which was installed at the bottom of the root zone in each plot water depth in the cylinder was monitored every day and the difference of water depth between two adjacent days is taken as the percolation irrigation was measured by water meter installed in each plot drainage was measured based on the difference between the pwd before and after drainage and evapotranspiration was computed on a ten day time step according to the following water balance equation 1 cet pwd cpre cir cperc cdr where pwd is the difference between the initial and terminal pwd over ten days mm cet is cumulative evapotranspiration mm cpre is cumulative precipitation mm cir is the cumulative irrigation amount mm cperc is cumulative percolation mm and cdr is the cumulative drainage amount mm the above cumulative wbcs were computed over ten days eq 1 can only be used when ponded water exists on both the initial and terminal days thus the calculation time step of cet under awd was fine tuned on a ten day basis to adjust to the usage requirements of the equation the cumulative value of water balance components during the whole growth period are shown in table 2 daily weather data including sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed and relative humidity were measured from meteorological stations at the two experimental sites soil textures were obtained from the local soil database which are representative of the experimental sites 2 3 2 model setup calibration and validation at yks data for 2007 and 2008 were used for calibration and validation respectively at tls data for 2009 and 2010 were used for calibration and validation respectively the setup of the two original oryza models and the improved oryza2000 follows the steps below 1 determine the soil profile at the yongkang experimental station yks a soil profile with a depth of 45 cm was specified during the simulation the soil domain was further divided into eight layers 5 cm thickness for the first four layers muddy layer 5 cm thickness for the fifth and sixth layers plow sole and 5 cm and 10 cm thicknesses for the seventh and eighth layers respectively nonpuddled subsoil at the tuanlin experimental station tls a soil profile with a depth of 48 cm was specified the soil domain was again divided into eight layers 5 cm thickness for the first four layers muddy layer 8 cm thickness for the fifth layer plow sole and 5 cm 5 cm and 10 cm thicknesses for the sixth seventh and eighth layers respectively nonpuddled subsoil the soil profile was set to the same among the three orzya models at each site 2 set the values of parameters related to soil properties soil hydraulic parameters including saturated swc van genuchten parameters and kst were first calculated by an embedded module of oryza named soilhydrau exe based on the soil texture of yks and tls then the kst of the plow sole were refined according to the measured percolation value the values of these above soil parameters were set to the same among the three orzya models at each site 3 set the values of parameters related to field management the transplantation date plant density nitrogen application values were determined according to experiments records the values of these above management parameters were set the same among the three orzya models at each site for the irrigation and drainage setting the actual irrigation modes during experiments at each site were set in the format required by irdr module in the improved model while irrigation modes were set in the format required by irrg module in the two original models 4 calibrate the values of parameters related to crop growth in this step the development rate in the juvenile phase dvrj development rate in the photoperiod sensitive phase dvri development rate in the panicle formation phase dvrp and development rate in the grain filling phase dvrr were selected to be calibrated since these parameters have higher sensitivity to the variable related to rice growth compared with other crop parameters tan et al 2016 development rates were calculated using observed phenology table 1 to investigate the impact of model structure differences on the simulation results the values of the crop parameters were set to be the same default values of the model among the two original models and the improved model through the above four steps the setup and calibration of the two original oryza models are finished since some new parameters are added to the improved model a sensitivity analysis was done on these new parameters see the supplementary section 2 then these parameters were calibrated by trial and error based on the observed pwd evapotranspiration percolation root length detailed calibration steps and values of these new parameters used in simulation are shown in the supplementary section 3 2 3 3 model evaluation metrics variables extracted to evaluate the efficiency of the improved orzya included pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation and drainage amounts root length and yield since irrigation is scheduled more optimally in oryza v3 than in oryza2000 v2 13 the results of oryza v3 were compared with those of the improved oryza2000 in the evaluation of variables related to water balance in addition to investigate the effects of the modifications applied in this study on rice growth simulation the results of oryza2000 v2 13 were compared to those of the improved oryza2000 in root length and yield simulation evaluations as oryza v3 was shown to exhibit better rice growth simulation performance than oryza2000 li et al 2017 the results of oryza v3 were also added to the evaluation of variables related to rice growth in this study model efficiency was evaluated using a combination of visual and statistical comparisons of observed and simulated variables five quantitative statistics were chosen including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 correlation coefficient corr root mean square error rmse absolute value of the relative error are and mean of the absolute relative error mare the nse value ranges from to 1 when nse is closer to 1 the simulation is more efficient the corr value ranges from 1 1 the model performs better when the absolute value of corr is closer to 1 the values of rmse are and mare range from 0 to when rmse are and mare are closer to 0 the model is more accurate these quantitative statistics were computed as follows 2 nse 1 i m y o i y s i 2 i m y o i y o 2 3 corr cov y o y s var y o var y s 4 rmse i m y o i y s i 2 m 5 are i m y o i y s i y o i 6 mare i m y o i y s i y o i m where y s i and y o i denote the simulation and corresponding observation respectively m is the number of observations y o is the average of m observations cov y o y s is the covariance of the observation and simulation and var y o and var y s are the variance of the observation and simulation respectively 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation for ponded water depth fig 4 fig 5 and table 3 show that the improved oryza2000 adapts well to paddy fields in terms of pwd in the calibration and validation periods in the validation period of yks 2008 several observations are higher than the corresponding simulated pwd because drainage is carried out after rainfall during the experiment causing rainwater to be stored in the field so that the pwd is higher than the maximum allowable depth of impoundment in some periods in addition oryza v3 does not perform as well as the improved model in the oryza v3 simulation the bund height was set as the maximum h p of the whole growing season and autodept was set as the average of h max of different growing stages however this setting is proven unable to schedule irrigation and drainage according to actual treatments especially under treatments with complex irrigation and drainage operations i e fig 5 c 3 2 calibration and validation for evapotranspiration the simulated actual evaporation and transpiration were summed as actual evapotranspiration to draw comparisons to the corresponding observed values fig 6 b and d show that the improved oryza2000 has good evapotranspiration simulation performance in the calibration and validation periods table 4 shows that the rmse and mare of awd are higher than those of cf in the simulation of yks this might be because the irrigation duration after the drying period is short such that the soil is not fully saturated therefore the pwd measured after irrigation might be higher than that measured when soil is fully saturated which might underestimate evapotranspiration during the drying period according to eq 1 leading to higher rmse and mare values under awd the rmse and mare values under awd are not significantly lower than those obtained under cf in the tls simulation which might be attributed to the drying periods under awd being short thus the drawback of eq 1 in estimating evapotranspiration during the drying period is not obvious in addition the performance of the improved oryza2000 is almost better than that of oryza v3 in the cf treatment actual evapotranspiration is mainly determined by etm the performance of oryza v3 and the improved oryza2000 under cf shows that the original etm computation method cannot generate accurate results for different years which might be because this method is only suitable for specific environments however after adding correct factors evk1 and trk2 the performance of the improved model under cf shows significant improvements for the calibration periods of yks and tls and for the validation period of yks showing that adding correction factors to localize the original method can improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration prediction in the awd treatment actual evapotranspiration is affected by etm and swc the improved evapotranspiration simulation of the improved model under awd can be attributed to the improved etm calculation method and reasonable field water dynamic simulation method 3 3 calibration and validation for percolation the simulated percolation was summed over ten days and compared to the corresponding measured values fig 7 b and d show that the improved oryza2000 exhibits good percolation simulation performance for the calibration and validation periods table 5 shows that the rmse and mare under awd were slightly higher than those observed under cf in the simulations of yks and tls this is because percolation under awd is affected by kst and swc as the drying and wetting periods of the simulation are not completely the same as those of the experiments the errors between simulated and measured percolation values increase in the simulation under cf the percolation predictive accuracy of the improved oryza2000 was found to be slightly better than that of oryza v3 because the improved model quantifies the effect of root growth on the percolation rate the percolation rate simulated by the improved model increased in late stages of rice growth in the simulation under awd the improved oryza2000 performed significantly better than oryza v3 illustrating the rationality of the percolation simulation of the improved model under awd in addition the better performance of the improved model in terms of pwd simulation contributes to the improvement of percolation simulation since the percolation rate is also affected by the water dynamics of paddy fields 3 4 calibration and validation for irrigation and drainage amounts the daily irrigation and drainage amounts simulated during the whole growing season were summed and compared to the corresponding measured values fig 8 shows that the improved oryza2000 performs well in total irrigation and drainage amounts simulation as shown in table 6 are of the total irrigation and drainage amounts under awd in the validation period of yks are greater than 30 this is because continuous rainfall occurred after irrigation in mid july 2008 under the awd treatment during the experiment however in the simulation of the improved model rainfall supply was considered first in mid july and thus irrigation was not triggered while drainage amount after continuous rainfall also decreased therefore the decrease in irrigation and drainage amounts led to a high are in addition are of the total drainage amount under cf treatment in the validation period of tls is large because the measured drainage amount is only 22 mm although the absolute error between the simulated and measured drainage amounts is 12 mm are reaches 52 in addition the performance of the improved oryza2000 in terms of estimating irrigation and drainage amounts is almost better than that of oryza v3 which is mainly because the newly added irdr module can schedule irrigation and drainage according to experimental treatments 3 5 calibration and validation for root length fig 9 shows that the root lengths observed in yks and tls first increase and then decrease during the whole growth period echoing the results of a previous study das and jat 1977 the root lengths simulated by oryza2000 v2 13 and oryza v3 first increase and then remain constant while the root lengths simulated by the improved oryza2000 grow in a way that mimicked the observations although the rmse and mare of the improved oryza2000 are not always lower than those of the other two versions table 7 the growth dynamics of root length simulated by the improved model more closely reflect actual conditions 3 6 calibration and validation for yield as shown in table 8 are of the improved model are slightly lower than that of oryza2000 v2 13 which might be because the water dynamics of paddy fields simulated by the improved model closely reflected actual conditions and thus the impacts of water conditions on rice growth were quantified more accurately are of oryza v3 is higher than that of the other two models which might be because oryza v3 includes modules to simulate the migration and transformation processes of soil nitrogen in paddy fields although nitrogen application was set to be the same in the simulations of these three models the impact of nitrogen conditions on rice growth might be quantified more accurately in the oryza v3 model and thus lead to better yield simulation performance this illustrates that an improvement of yield simulation should take into account improvements in water and nitrogen balance simulation 4 discussion three modifications of the improved oryza2000 model are further described here the first involves assuming that rainfall occurs at the beginning of a daily simulation for a model using a time step of 1 day i e oryza it is impossible to distinguish whether a rainfall event occurred at night or during the day feng et al 2007 since irrigation should complement rainfall li and luo 2003 the improved model assumes an ideal situation in which rainfall events occur during the day thus irrigation or drainage is applied after considering rainfall supply in the simulation following this hypothesis irrigation or drainage amounts might be lower than those calculated from experimental measurements and rainfall utilization might be higher in the simulation than in actual fields i e fig 5 and table 6 the second modification involves using new variable bnl in the computation of df this modification replaces the downfl and backfl subroutines of the two original oryza models bouman et al 2001 since the kst of the bnl is lower than that of all upper soil layers the df is controlled by the bnl when the upper soil is saturated when paddy soil is dried the kst of the bnl is lower than the water deficit of the adjacent subsoil layer meaning that the df of the bnl cannot saturate the adjacent subsoil layer of the bnl in a daily simulation if all upper soil is saturated by the water supply that is the soil layer that df of a specific layer can saturate is not deeper than its bnl and thus the bnl of the ponded water layer is also used to determine the maximum soil range that rainfall supply can saturate the third modification involves the calculation of the available water of soil layers the critical water content used to divide quick and delayed acting water echoes the concept of a safe threshold of awd which determines the threshold at which evapotranspiration and rice growth are affected by drought lampayan et al 2015a however the safe threshold is not a fixed value since it might be affected by several factors including soil properties groundwater levels climate and so on lampayan et al 2015b zhang et al 2009 therefore the threshold at which evapotranspiration starts to be suppressed should be determined depending on site conditions bueno et al 2010 in this study the critical content of yks and tls were set as 0 96 of field capacity according to li et al and mao li and luo 2003 mao et al 2003 because these authors results are representative of rice growing areas in china in addition a ratio of etm and swc is used in the computation of delayed acting water since soil water is dynamic the removal of water also occurs due to evaporation and transpiration kirkham 2014 thus the ratio of etm and swc quantifies the effects of climate and soil moisture on the amount of available soil water to improve water productivity water saving irrigation techniques are gradually being promoted under the water saving irrigation mode a paddy field usually has characteristics of awd and irrigation and drainage schedules are more complex than those of the traditional cf mode however most of the existing crop models simplify the irrigation and drainage module bouman et al 2001 jones et al 2003 mccown et al 1996 and thus are unsuited for the study of water saving irrigation this study modifies several modules related to water balance simulation in the orzya2000 v2 13 model and proposes a new wbsf for paddy fields under awd irrigation the improved oryza2000 is proven effective at simulating pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation and drainage amount root length and yield values under cf and awd modes since monitoring wbcs is labor and time intensive feng et al 2007 the improved model might serve as a new way to complement and extrapolate the results of field experiments the improved oryza2000 performs better than oryza v3 in water balance simulation for the following reasons 1 irrigation and drainage are scheduled more accurately by the irdr module existing versions of the oryza model focus on modifying irrigation functions and still follow the assumption that drainage occurs when pwd is higher than the bund height however drainage before pwd reaches the bund height is a common operation for example mid season drainage or sunk baking is widely used to control unproductive tillers by draining ponded water to 0 in the late period of the tillering stage in china han et al 2019 pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in addition h p might change in different stages liu et al 2019 since the original oryza model cannot simulate this kind of drainage ponded water cannot descend to a certain depth in time this will surely impact the computation of evapotranspiration and percolation while impacting the schedule of irrigation and drainage in the subsequent periods 2 actual evapotranspiration and percolation are computed more reasonably which ensures that irrigation or drainage occurs at times that mimic actual conditions some existing studies have tested the performance of the original oryza in simulating pwd and report good agreement between simulations and observations belder et al 2007 feng et al 2007 gao et al 2021 however irrigation depths and times are specified according to experimental records in the simulations of these studies in the present study irrigation and drainage were auto scheduled by irdr module and strong performance by the improved model in simulating several wbcs is shown in figs 4 7 this comparison illustrates that the improved model offers more advantages in terms of irrigation and drainage control and is more suitable for irrigation and drainage forecast conducted under different irrigation modes the wbsf incorporated in the improved oryza2000 assumes a situation with bottom boundary of free drainage meanwhile the selection of setting groundwater table is still kept in the model code since the groundwater table in the two study sites hardly affect the water balance of paddy the schematization of paddy field in the improved model is suitable for these two sites and other similar areas for areas with shallow groundwater table the effectiveness of the improved model is still needed to be evaluated and the combination of the wbsf and the groundwater table setting requires further analysis 5 conclusion in this study the original oryza model was improved based on the characteristics of paddy fields observed under awd a new framework was used for the water balance simulation of the improved oryza2000 data from experiments carried out at two sites yongkang and tuanlin were used to test the performance of the improved model the simulated pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation amount and drainage amount values from the improved oryza2000 are in good agreement with the corresponding observed values and the improved oryza2000 performs much better in simulating these wbcs than oryza v3 moreover the dynamic change in root length from the improved model is in line with empirical results and the predictive accuracy of yields is slightly increase compared with the oryza2000 v2 13 consequently this study proposes an efficient wbsf for simulating the wbcs of paddy fields under cf and awd although the improvement was developed for awd the improved model can be also be used for simulation under other irrigation modes since the source code of oryza2000 is freely accessible with the equations using in the wbsf experts for research purposes can implement the improved oryza2000 under a fortran language environment the improved oryza2000 will surely be beneficial to the study of

9396,while the oryza crop model has been widely used in the simulation of rice growth its computation ability is limited in terms of simulating the water balance components wbcs of paddy fields under water saving irrigation conditions such as alternate wetting and drying awd regimes in this study a new water balance simulation framework wbsf reflecting the characteristics of awd is integrated into the original oryza2000 v2 13 model to simulate the wbc of paddy fields in addition algorithms for dynamically simulating the root length growing rate are added to the original oryza algorithms quantifying water stress are also modified the improved model is further applied to paddy fields in yongkang and tuanlin which are two typical rice growing areas in china the results show that the improved model performs well at simulating wbcs the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of daily ponded water depth ranged from 0 82 to 0 94 across experiments under continuous flooding and awd at the two sites showing an increase in nse of at least 0 23 compared to oryza v3 levels the absolute value of relative errors a re between simulated and measured values for total irrigation and drainage amount was mostly no more than 10 and showed a reduction of at least 11 the improved model also showed better performance in terms of evapotranspiration percolation and root length simulation compared to oryza v3 the yield predictive accuracy of the improved model is slightly better than that of oryza2000 v2 13 but worse than that of oryza v3 which might be due to the poor performance of nitrogen balance modules in the improved model in general given the results achieved it is possible to state that the wbsf of the improved oryza2000 showed an enhanced capability to simulate wbcs which are recommended for use in water balance simulations of paddy fields keywords oryza model improvement water balance simulation paddy rice water saving irrigation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most important food crops in the world and consumes a large amount of water for agricultural irrigation carrijo et al 2017 gao et al 2021 lampayan et al 2015a as water resources become increasingly scarce exploring effective water saving irrigation techniques to increase the water productivity of rice will greatly benefit agricultural water management field experiments are an important means to understand the effects of water saving irrigation on rice growth and water balance though they are labor and time intensive belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 in addition the results of experiments are difficult to extrapolate since factors that affect rice growth i e climate and soil fertility in other areas might be different model simulation is a reliable means to complement empirical results feng et al 2007 a crop water model that can accurately simulate the growth of rice and water balance components wbcs under different water saving irrigation regimes will surely benefit the study of water saving irrigation the oryza model is a process based crop model that can simulate rice growth in situations of potential production water limitations and nitrogen limitations bouman et al 2001 li et al 2017 when the model is used for water limited simulations modules related to water balance are used by the model to simulate the effect of water stress on rice growth and to estimate wbcs including ponded water depth pwd soil water content swc evaporation transpiration percolation irrigation and drainage amount to date oryza has been widely used to investigate the relationships between rice growth and water consumption bouman et al 2007 sudhir et al 2012 yadav et al 2011 alternate wetting and drying awd is a mode of water saving irrigation widely applied for lowland rice lampayan et al 2015a li et al 2004 however the original oryza cannot schedule irrigation and drainage according to the actual control criteria of awd irrigation regimes and cannot accurately simulate the dynamics of wbcs in paddy fields under awd in the original oryza the upper limit of pwd after an irrigation application can only be set as a constant value throughout the growing season while this depth might vary across different stages in practice mao 2002 in addition drainage surface drainage is assumed to occur when pwd exceeds the bund height in the original oryza while farmers usually drain before pwd reaches the bund height pan et al 2017 when paddy field conditions change from wet to dry the original oryza assumes that the ponded water is consumed by evaporation first and then by transpiration which might underestimate actual transpiration levels and thus affect the quantification of water stress in addition percolation is assumed to be valued at zero when ponded water disappears while percolation still exists when soil is unsaturated in actual fields li and luo 2003 in addition root lengths affect rice water uptake however the original oryza assumes that the root length grows at a fixed rate throughout the whole growing season which diverges from the results of existing experiments das and jat 1977 this approach might misestimate root length and thus affect water balance simulation therefore modules of the original oryza related to water balance are not suitable for the wbcs simulation of actual paddy fields especially for fields subjected to awd obtaining accurate measurements of rice yield and water consumption levels is essential for the evaluation of water savings and yield increases in water saving irrigation regimes in addition irrigation managers wish to know the irrigation water consumption levels needed to ensure crop yields of different irrigation modes which can provide decision making support for agricultural water management this study improves modules related to water balance simulation of the original oryza2000 v2 13 model the main objectives of this study are 1 propose a water balance simulation framework wbsf based on oryza model for paddy fields under awd 2 apply the improved oryza2000 that incorporates the new wbsf in two case studies yongkang and tuanlin in china to evaluate the capabilities of the improved model in simulating pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation and drainage amounts root lengths and rice yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 oryza model description two widely used versions of oryza are oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 and oryza v3 li et al 2017 which are programed by fortran language the source code of oryza2000 v2 13 is publicly available and can be found at https sites google com a irri org oryza2000 oryza v3 is the successor of oryza2000 constructed by li et al and adds soil carbon nitrogen and temperature dynamic modules based on oryza2000 to our knowledge the source code of oryza v3 has not been publicly available online by now the key modules of these two versions are basically the same and include 1 et which calculates reference evapotranspiration et0 and potential evapotranspiration etm the sum of potential evaporation and transpiration supplementary section 1 1 3 illustrates the main equations of etm computation used in the et module 2 wstress which calculates factors to quantify the effects of water stress on rice growth and estimates actual transpiration 3 oryza1 which simulates variables related to rice growth 4 ncrop which calculates the nitrogen uptake of rice 5 nsoil which calculates nitrogen supply from soil and fertilizer 6 irrig which calculates the irrigation amount and 7 paddy which calculates drainage amount actual evaporation and percolation after simulation begins the model first sets the initial conditions and then uses different modules to calculate variables related to rice growth and water balance over daily time steps until rice maturity when oryza is used to simulate rice growth in situations of water nitrogen limitation modules are applied in the following order et wstress oryza1 ncrop nsoil irrig and paddy 2 2 model improvements since the source code of oryza2000 v2 13 is publicly available and algorithms related to the calculation of potential evapotranspiration actual evaporation transpiration and percolation as well as soil water transport are basically the same between oryza2000 v2 13 and oryza v3 the improvements of water balance modules were done on oryza2000 v2 13 using fortran language the modifications are done as follows 1 a new irrigation and drainage module irdr is included to schedule irrigation and drainage the irrg module is no longer used for the calculation of daily irrigation amount 2 algorithms for calculating etm in the et module have been modified 3 algorithms for computing actual transpiration evaporation and percolation have been modified in the paddy module actual transpiration is no longer calculated by the wstress module 4 algorithms simulating root length in the oryza1 module have been modified 5 modules of the improved model are applied in the following new order et paddy wstress oryza1 ncrop and nsoil algorithms for calculating water stress factors have also been modified 2 2 1 water balance simulation framework for paddy fields under alternate wetting and drying conditions paddy fields are always bounded and most of them are puddled and have a plow sole with large resistance to water flow wopereis et al 1992 in the two original oryza models oryza2000 2 13 and oryzav3 the vertical profile of paddy field is mainly schematically described by four layers including a ponded water layer a muddy layer with little resistance to water flow a plow sole and a nonpuddled subsoil wopereis et al 1994 fig 1 these three soil layers can be divided into several sublayers according to the requirement of users and each layer is schematized with a reservoir the bottom boundary can be set as a free drainage boundary fig 1 a or a groundwater table fig 1 b since the oryza is a one dimensional model the model only simulated the transformation of soil water in vertical direction the improved oryza2000 follows the schematization of the paddy field in the original models however the bottom boundary was assumed to be a free drainage boundary which is because the groundwater table under a specific field strongly responds to rainfall and irrigation events and is influenced by the hydrology of a broader environment and thus a one dimensional model i e oryza might have difficulty accurately simulating the dynamic change in groundwater levels belder et al 2007 bouman et al 2005 besides for most puddled paddy field percolation rates are fairly stable during cropping season and little affected by groundwater table depths bouman et al 1994 in addition for irrigated paddy fields ponded water presence in most of the time during the whole growth periods of rice belder et al 2004 han et al 2021 pan et al 2017 and thus capillary rise causing by shallow groundwater table has relatively short time to affect the water content in the root zone therefore to simplify the structure of the improved oryza2000 the bottom boundary is assumed to be a free drainage boundary fig 1 a while the selection of setting groundwater table from the original model is still kept the wbcs of paddy fields include precipitation irrigation drainage capillary rise percolation seepage evaporation transpiration seepage occurs due to the piezometer head differences between fields or due to differences in water levels between fields and surrounding drains ditches or creeks bouman et al 2001 therefore seepage is not computed separately in the two original oryza models neither do the improved oryza2000 the capillary rise is only computed based on the depth of groundwater table when the bottom boundary is set as groundwater table in the two original models bouman et al 2001 since the bottom boundary in the improved oryza2000 is assumed to be a free drainage boundary capillary rise is not computed separately in this model the other wbcs are computed by et wstress irrg and paddy modules in the two original models in the improved oryza2000 a new wbsf was used to compute the irrigation drainage percolation evaporation and transpiration the difference between the original and the improved models in wbcs simulation are described as follows 2 2 1 1 irrigation and drainage irrigation time can be determined by different trigger conditions in the two original oryza models including the lower limit of ponded water critical soil water content or tension or days after the disappearance of ponded water bouman et al 2001 in a simulation only one kind of trigger condition can be selected in oryza2000 v2 13 although this limitation is addressed in oryza v3 the threshold of each trigger condition can still only be set as a fixed value throughout the growing season in addition the water amount per irrigation application can only be set as fixed in the simulation of oryza2000 v2 13 in oryza v3 variable autodept is included to determine the upper limit of pwd of each irrigation event however autodept can only be set as a fixed value moreover drainage only occurs when ponded water is above the bund height in these two versions of oryza in fact some water saving regimes may require different thresholds to trigger irrigation and drainage at different stages while the irrigation amount provided at each irrigation event may change with rice growth han et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 thus a new irrigation and drainage module irdr was used to schedule irrigation and drainage in the improved oryza2000 in irdr precipitation is read first and supplies the ponded water and soil layers from top to bottom a new variable called the bottleneck layer bnl is added to determine the lowest soil layer below the field that rainfall can supply the bnl has the following characteristics ① the saturated hydraulic conductivity kst of this layer is less than the water deficit of the adjacent subsoil layer ② the kst of this layer is less than that of all upper soil layers after considering the precipitation supply irrigation or drainage is determined a technique using three thresholds is incorporated to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy fields guo 1997 wu et al 2019 the three thresholds include the minimum fitting threshold h min or θ min the maximum fitting depth h max and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment h p irrigation is triggered and automatically fills h max when pwd is less than h min or swc is less than θ min the drainage is triggered when pwd is above h p the three thresholds can be set as different values in different stages the flow chart illustrating the computation of daily irrigation and drainage amounts are shown in fig 2 supplementary section 1 1 1 illustrates the detailed computation and equations 2 2 1 2 evaporation transpiration and percolation in the two original oryza models the evaporation transpiration and percolation are computed according to the following steps 1 first the total potential evaporation evm and transpiration trm are computed based on the reference evapotranspiration et0 and leaf area index lai by the et module 2 then the transpiration demand of each layer are computed based on the trm and the soil water tensions by the wstress module 3 finally water balance simulation are implemented from top ponded water layer to bottom nonpuddled subsoil layer by paddy module in paddy module evaporation demand of each layer is firstly computed based on evm and the amount of water in the upper layers that sustain for evaporation then water available in each layer sustains evaporation demand first and then transpiration demand percolation is the vertical movement of water beyond the root zone bouman et al 2001 and is assumed to be zero without ponded water if there is ponded water ponded water is assumed to be lost in the form of evaporation first then transpiration and finally percolation therefore the flux calculation of the paddy module can be divided into four different situations 1 ponded water can sustain both evaporation and transpiration demand the rest of the ponded water sustains percolation demand 2 ponded water can sustain evaporation but only part of transpiration the rest of transpiration demand is sustained by soil water and percolation is zero 3 ponded water can sustain only part of the evaporation demand the rest of the evaporation demand and transpiration demand is sustained by soil water while percolation is zero 4 no ponded water both the evaporation and transpiration demand are met by taking soil water however percolation still exists in soil when ponded water disappears li et al 2021 sonkar et al 2019 since soil hydraulic conductivity is not equal to zero in this case ghanbarian 2021 rad et al 2019 besides these three loss paths should occur simultaneously when water is abundant in the improved oryza2000 actual evaporation and transpiration and downward flux df of each layer ponded water layer muddy layer plow sole nonpuddled subsoil layer are computed from top to bottom in each layer water available in the layer is firstly computed considering the water supply from the adjacent upper layer the actual df of the adjacent upper layer meanwhile evaporation transpiration and df demand in this layer are computed then the available water of this layer is allocated to meet evaporation transpiration and df demands according to their relative portion finally the terminal pwd and swc of the daily simulation are computed based on water balance the actual evaporation and transpiration of each layer are sum up as the total actual evaporation and transpiration and the df of the bottom soil layer within the root zone is taken as percolation fig 3 illustrates the flowchart of the evaporation transpiration and df computation from fig 3 the following explanations are provided 1 available water both in the original and improved oryza models the available water of the ponded water layer is equal to the pwd the computation of available water in soil layers are different among the two original models and the improved oryza2000 in oryza2000 v2 13 soil water between saturation and wilting point can sustain the demand of evapotranspiration completely bouman et al 2001 while in oryza v3 a factor called dtf dtf 2 86 are added to adjust the extractability of soil water li et al 2017 according to the previous study soil water above the wilting point cannot be fully taken up since water uptake is limited by rising soil mechanical resistance under drying da silva et al 1994 de lima et al 2020 letey 2011 in the improved oryza2000 a simplified way is incorporated to computed the available water in soil layers li and luo 2003 the water available in soil layer is divided into quick acting water and delayed acting water by a critical water content between field capacity and the wilting point quick acting water is soil water available above the critical content while delayed acting water is soil water available between the critical content level and wilting point the improved model assumes that the continuous state of soil moisture will be disrupted when the actual swc is less than the critical content level and thus soil water available between the wilting point and critical content level is reduced to quantify the effect of drought detailed equations of available water computation are illustrated in the supplementary section 1 1 2 2 evaporation and transpiration in the two original oryza models reference evapotranspiration et0 can be computed through three methods the penman monteith method priestley taylor method and makkink method bouman et al 2001 et0 is further separated into the aerodynamic term etae and radiation term etrd to compute the evm and trm and then sum to the etm the simulated lai is also used in the calculation of evm and trm since the lai predictive accuracy of oryza is not stable bouman and van laar 2006 jing et al 2007 yuan et al 2017 the error of the lai simulation might affect the accuracy of the evm and trm output therefore two factors evk1 and trk2 are added to the exponential term containing lai in the original equations see the supplementary equation s13 and s14 by changing the value of evk1 and trk2 the simulated etm can be adjusted to be close to the corresponding observed values the evk1 and trk2 can be set based on the observed daily pwd and evapotranspiration under continuous flooding treatments detailed equations of evm trm and etm computation are illustrated in the supplementary section 1 1 3 after the evm and trm computation these two values are used for the computation of evaporation and transpiration demand in each layer the two original models assume that the evm and trm are firstly sustained by ponded water thus the evaporation and transpiration demand of ponded water layer are equal to evm and trm respectively when ponded water cannot sustain evm and trm soil water is used to sustain the deficit of evaporation and transpiration therefore the deficit of evaporation and transpiration are the evaporation and transpiration demand of soil layers the improved oryza2000 follows the assumptions related to evapotranspiration demand above the two original oryza models assume that only water from the ponded water layer and the first soil layer below the field can be lost in the form of evaporation this limitation is eliminated in the improved oryza2000 because water from deeper soil might also be lost due to evaporation in the improved model the number of soil layers that can sustain water for evaporation demand can be determined by users detailed equations of evaporation computation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 4 in oryza2000 v2 13 transpiration demand is distributed to soil layers within the root zone based on root length in each layer bouman et al 2001 in oryza v3 transpiration demand is distributed based on root biomass in each soil layer li et al 2017 in the improved oryza2000 water from soil layers with higher swc are assumed to be absorbed by plant more easily a new set of equations are used to compute the transpiration demand of soil layers based on the swc and root length according to feddes et al s study feddes et al 1976 detailed equations of transpiration computation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 5 3 downward flux and percolation in the two original oryza models percolation can be set as a fixed value or computed by a module called satflx bouman et al 2001 and is assumed to be zero when the ponded water disappears in the improved oryza2000 the df of each layer is computed and df of the bottom soil layer within the root zone is taken as percolation when roots penetrate a soil layer water may flow along the gap between roots and soil and thus might affect the df of this layer wang 2018 neither oryza2000 v2 13 nor oryza v3 consider the effect of root penetration and the models might thus underestimate percolation in the late stages of rice growth in the improved model a new equation was constructed to correct the kst to quantify this phenomenon where the kst of a soil layer will increase as the length of root in this layer increase besides variable bnl was also used in the computation of df in the improved model the df demand of the ponded water layer is determined by the kst of the bnl and water deficits of soil layers not lower than the bnl df demand of soil layer i is determined by the kst of the bnl and water deficits of soil layers between layer i and the bnl and is limited by the actual hydraulic conductivity of layer i detailed equations of df computation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 6 4 water allocation in the improved oryza2000 water available in each layer is allocated according to the relative ratio of evaporation transpiration and df demands besides if the swc of a specific soil layer is less than field capacity the actual df of this layer is set to zero detailed equations of water allocation are shown in the supplementary section 1 1 7 2 2 2 modification of root length simulation some previous studies have shown that the root length of rice does not grow linearly during the whole growing period beyrouty et al 1988 das and jat 1977 and rice roots will grow deeper when rice is subjected to water stress mao et al 2003 besides root length of rice will decrease in the late growth stage such as that observed for root biomass because of the senescence of roots hao et al 2009 the two original oryza models simulate root length at a fixed growth rate and remain at a maximum after flowering which might not be able to determine the range of soil that can sustain water for rice evapotranspiration the improved oryza2000 dynamically compute the growth rate of root length based on the growth rate of root biomass and consider the effect of water stress on root length growth see the supplementary equation s36 and s37 in addition root length growth is assumed to stop at flowering a new equation was added to quantify the effect of senescence on root length after flowering see the supplementary equation s38 2 2 3 modification of water stress simulation since the wstress module is called before the paddy module in the daily simulation of the two original oryza models the soil tension used to compute the water stress factors is read from the output of the previous day which might not be able to accurately quantify the impact of the actual water deficit for that day therefore the paddy module is instead called before the wstress module in the improved oryza2000 actual transpiration computed by the new wbsf is used to compute the water stress factor 2 3 model application 2 3 1 field experiments data from experiments performed in yongkang and tuanlin china were used to test the improved oryza2000 in yongkang 28 42 n 120 12 e in zhejiang province china experiments were performed on clay loam from an experimental station located in a hilly area of central zhejiang cultivar zhongzheyou1 was used for experiments in 2007 and 2008 the experiments involved two water treatments continuous flooding cf and awd the nitrogen application rate was set as 230 kg hm2 according to local farmers practices in tuanlin 30 52 n 112 1 e in hubei province china experiments were performed on silty clay loam from the experimental station of the zhanghe irrigation system two cultivars were used xinliangyou xiang4 in 2009 and hybrid premium63 in 2010 as done for the experiments conducted in yongkang the experiments applied cf and awd treatments the nitrogen application rate was set as 180 kg hm2 the locally used application rate in these two experiments the two water treatments were tested with three replicates in six plots the plots in yongkang and tuanlin were 12 5 m 8 m and 15 m 4 m in size respectively each plot was puddled before transplanting the dates of rice transplanting panicle initiation flowering and maturity were recorded during the experiments table 1 the root lengths of rice in different stages were observed and yields were measured at maturity in addition daily precipitation pwd percolation irrigation and drainage amounts were monitored during the experiments daily precipitation was measured by weather station at experiment site pwd was observed by a water gauge at 8 00 a m every day percolation was monitored by a thin walled cylinder covered to prevent rain and sunlight which was installed at the bottom of the root zone in each plot water depth in the cylinder was monitored every day and the difference of water depth between two adjacent days is taken as the percolation irrigation was measured by water meter installed in each plot drainage was measured based on the difference between the pwd before and after drainage and evapotranspiration was computed on a ten day time step according to the following water balance equation 1 cet pwd cpre cir cperc cdr where pwd is the difference between the initial and terminal pwd over ten days mm cet is cumulative evapotranspiration mm cpre is cumulative precipitation mm cir is the cumulative irrigation amount mm cperc is cumulative percolation mm and cdr is the cumulative drainage amount mm the above cumulative wbcs were computed over ten days eq 1 can only be used when ponded water exists on both the initial and terminal days thus the calculation time step of cet under awd was fine tuned on a ten day basis to adjust to the usage requirements of the equation the cumulative value of water balance components during the whole growth period are shown in table 2 daily weather data including sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed and relative humidity were measured from meteorological stations at the two experimental sites soil textures were obtained from the local soil database which are representative of the experimental sites 2 3 2 model setup calibration and validation at yks data for 2007 and 2008 were used for calibration and validation respectively at tls data for 2009 and 2010 were used for calibration and validation respectively the setup of the two original oryza models and the improved oryza2000 follows the steps below 1 determine the soil profile at the yongkang experimental station yks a soil profile with a depth of 45 cm was specified during the simulation the soil domain was further divided into eight layers 5 cm thickness for the first four layers muddy layer 5 cm thickness for the fifth and sixth layers plow sole and 5 cm and 10 cm thicknesses for the seventh and eighth layers respectively nonpuddled subsoil at the tuanlin experimental station tls a soil profile with a depth of 48 cm was specified the soil domain was again divided into eight layers 5 cm thickness for the first four layers muddy layer 8 cm thickness for the fifth layer plow sole and 5 cm 5 cm and 10 cm thicknesses for the sixth seventh and eighth layers respectively nonpuddled subsoil the soil profile was set to the same among the three orzya models at each site 2 set the values of parameters related to soil properties soil hydraulic parameters including saturated swc van genuchten parameters and kst were first calculated by an embedded module of oryza named soilhydrau exe based on the soil texture of yks and tls then the kst of the plow sole were refined according to the measured percolation value the values of these above soil parameters were set to the same among the three orzya models at each site 3 set the values of parameters related to field management the transplantation date plant density nitrogen application values were determined according to experiments records the values of these above management parameters were set the same among the three orzya models at each site for the irrigation and drainage setting the actual irrigation modes during experiments at each site were set in the format required by irdr module in the improved model while irrigation modes were set in the format required by irrg module in the two original models 4 calibrate the values of parameters related to crop growth in this step the development rate in the juvenile phase dvrj development rate in the photoperiod sensitive phase dvri development rate in the panicle formation phase dvrp and development rate in the grain filling phase dvrr were selected to be calibrated since these parameters have higher sensitivity to the variable related to rice growth compared with other crop parameters tan et al 2016 development rates were calculated using observed phenology table 1 to investigate the impact of model structure differences on the simulation results the values of the crop parameters were set to be the same default values of the model among the two original models and the improved model through the above four steps the setup and calibration of the two original oryza models are finished since some new parameters are added to the improved model a sensitivity analysis was done on these new parameters see the supplementary section 2 then these parameters were calibrated by trial and error based on the observed pwd evapotranspiration percolation root length detailed calibration steps and values of these new parameters used in simulation are shown in the supplementary section 3 2 3 3 model evaluation metrics variables extracted to evaluate the efficiency of the improved orzya included pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation and drainage amounts root length and yield since irrigation is scheduled more optimally in oryza v3 than in oryza2000 v2 13 the results of oryza v3 were compared with those of the improved oryza2000 in the evaluation of variables related to water balance in addition to investigate the effects of the modifications applied in this study on rice growth simulation the results of oryza2000 v2 13 were compared to those of the improved oryza2000 in root length and yield simulation evaluations as oryza v3 was shown to exhibit better rice growth simulation performance than oryza2000 li et al 2017 the results of oryza v3 were also added to the evaluation of variables related to rice growth in this study model efficiency was evaluated using a combination of visual and statistical comparisons of observed and simulated variables five quantitative statistics were chosen including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 correlation coefficient corr root mean square error rmse absolute value of the relative error are and mean of the absolute relative error mare the nse value ranges from to 1 when nse is closer to 1 the simulation is more efficient the corr value ranges from 1 1 the model performs better when the absolute value of corr is closer to 1 the values of rmse are and mare range from 0 to when rmse are and mare are closer to 0 the model is more accurate these quantitative statistics were computed as follows 2 nse 1 i m y o i y s i 2 i m y o i y o 2 3 corr cov y o y s var y o var y s 4 rmse i m y o i y s i 2 m 5 are i m y o i y s i y o i 6 mare i m y o i y s i y o i m where y s i and y o i denote the simulation and corresponding observation respectively m is the number of observations y o is the average of m observations cov y o y s is the covariance of the observation and simulation and var y o and var y s are the variance of the observation and simulation respectively 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation for ponded water depth fig 4 fig 5 and table 3 show that the improved oryza2000 adapts well to paddy fields in terms of pwd in the calibration and validation periods in the validation period of yks 2008 several observations are higher than the corresponding simulated pwd because drainage is carried out after rainfall during the experiment causing rainwater to be stored in the field so that the pwd is higher than the maximum allowable depth of impoundment in some periods in addition oryza v3 does not perform as well as the improved model in the oryza v3 simulation the bund height was set as the maximum h p of the whole growing season and autodept was set as the average of h max of different growing stages however this setting is proven unable to schedule irrigation and drainage according to actual treatments especially under treatments with complex irrigation and drainage operations i e fig 5 c 3 2 calibration and validation for evapotranspiration the simulated actual evaporation and transpiration were summed as actual evapotranspiration to draw comparisons to the corresponding observed values fig 6 b and d show that the improved oryza2000 has good evapotranspiration simulation performance in the calibration and validation periods table 4 shows that the rmse and mare of awd are higher than those of cf in the simulation of yks this might be because the irrigation duration after the drying period is short such that the soil is not fully saturated therefore the pwd measured after irrigation might be higher than that measured when soil is fully saturated which might underestimate evapotranspiration during the drying period according to eq 1 leading to higher rmse and mare values under awd the rmse and mare values under awd are not significantly lower than those obtained under cf in the tls simulation which might be attributed to the drying periods under awd being short thus the drawback of eq 1 in estimating evapotranspiration during the drying period is not obvious in addition the performance of the improved oryza2000 is almost better than that of oryza v3 in the cf treatment actual evapotranspiration is mainly determined by etm the performance of oryza v3 and the improved oryza2000 under cf shows that the original etm computation method cannot generate accurate results for different years which might be because this method is only suitable for specific environments however after adding correct factors evk1 and trk2 the performance of the improved model under cf shows significant improvements for the calibration periods of yks and tls and for the validation period of yks showing that adding correction factors to localize the original method can improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration prediction in the awd treatment actual evapotranspiration is affected by etm and swc the improved evapotranspiration simulation of the improved model under awd can be attributed to the improved etm calculation method and reasonable field water dynamic simulation method 3 3 calibration and validation for percolation the simulated percolation was summed over ten days and compared to the corresponding measured values fig 7 b and d show that the improved oryza2000 exhibits good percolation simulation performance for the calibration and validation periods table 5 shows that the rmse and mare under awd were slightly higher than those observed under cf in the simulations of yks and tls this is because percolation under awd is affected by kst and swc as the drying and wetting periods of the simulation are not completely the same as those of the experiments the errors between simulated and measured percolation values increase in the simulation under cf the percolation predictive accuracy of the improved oryza2000 was found to be slightly better than that of oryza v3 because the improved model quantifies the effect of root growth on the percolation rate the percolation rate simulated by the improved model increased in late stages of rice growth in the simulation under awd the improved oryza2000 performed significantly better than oryza v3 illustrating the rationality of the percolation simulation of the improved model under awd in addition the better performance of the improved model in terms of pwd simulation contributes to the improvement of percolation simulation since the percolation rate is also affected by the water dynamics of paddy fields 3 4 calibration and validation for irrigation and drainage amounts the daily irrigation and drainage amounts simulated during the whole growing season were summed and compared to the corresponding measured values fig 8 shows that the improved oryza2000 performs well in total irrigation and drainage amounts simulation as shown in table 6 are of the total irrigation and drainage amounts under awd in the validation period of yks are greater than 30 this is because continuous rainfall occurred after irrigation in mid july 2008 under the awd treatment during the experiment however in the simulation of the improved model rainfall supply was considered first in mid july and thus irrigation was not triggered while drainage amount after continuous rainfall also decreased therefore the decrease in irrigation and drainage amounts led to a high are in addition are of the total drainage amount under cf treatment in the validation period of tls is large because the measured drainage amount is only 22 mm although the absolute error between the simulated and measured drainage amounts is 12 mm are reaches 52 in addition the performance of the improved oryza2000 in terms of estimating irrigation and drainage amounts is almost better than that of oryza v3 which is mainly because the newly added irdr module can schedule irrigation and drainage according to experimental treatments 3 5 calibration and validation for root length fig 9 shows that the root lengths observed in yks and tls first increase and then decrease during the whole growth period echoing the results of a previous study das and jat 1977 the root lengths simulated by oryza2000 v2 13 and oryza v3 first increase and then remain constant while the root lengths simulated by the improved oryza2000 grow in a way that mimicked the observations although the rmse and mare of the improved oryza2000 are not always lower than those of the other two versions table 7 the growth dynamics of root length simulated by the improved model more closely reflect actual conditions 3 6 calibration and validation for yield as shown in table 8 are of the improved model are slightly lower than that of oryza2000 v2 13 which might be because the water dynamics of paddy fields simulated by the improved model closely reflected actual conditions and thus the impacts of water conditions on rice growth were quantified more accurately are of oryza v3 is higher than that of the other two models which might be because oryza v3 includes modules to simulate the migration and transformation processes of soil nitrogen in paddy fields although nitrogen application was set to be the same in the simulations of these three models the impact of nitrogen conditions on rice growth might be quantified more accurately in the oryza v3 model and thus lead to better yield simulation performance this illustrates that an improvement of yield simulation should take into account improvements in water and nitrogen balance simulation 4 discussion three modifications of the improved oryza2000 model are further described here the first involves assuming that rainfall occurs at the beginning of a daily simulation for a model using a time step of 1 day i e oryza it is impossible to distinguish whether a rainfall event occurred at night or during the day feng et al 2007 since irrigation should complement rainfall li and luo 2003 the improved model assumes an ideal situation in which rainfall events occur during the day thus irrigation or drainage is applied after considering rainfall supply in the simulation following this hypothesis irrigation or drainage amounts might be lower than those calculated from experimental measurements and rainfall utilization might be higher in the simulation than in actual fields i e fig 5 and table 6 the second modification involves using new variable bnl in the computation of df this modification replaces the downfl and backfl subroutines of the two original oryza models bouman et al 2001 since the kst of the bnl is lower than that of all upper soil layers the df is controlled by the bnl when the upper soil is saturated when paddy soil is dried the kst of the bnl is lower than the water deficit of the adjacent subsoil layer meaning that the df of the bnl cannot saturate the adjacent subsoil layer of the bnl in a daily simulation if all upper soil is saturated by the water supply that is the soil layer that df of a specific layer can saturate is not deeper than its bnl and thus the bnl of the ponded water layer is also used to determine the maximum soil range that rainfall supply can saturate the third modification involves the calculation of the available water of soil layers the critical water content used to divide quick and delayed acting water echoes the concept of a safe threshold of awd which determines the threshold at which evapotranspiration and rice growth are affected by drought lampayan et al 2015a however the safe threshold is not a fixed value since it might be affected by several factors including soil properties groundwater levels climate and so on lampayan et al 2015b zhang et al 2009 therefore the threshold at which evapotranspiration starts to be suppressed should be determined depending on site conditions bueno et al 2010 in this study the critical content of yks and tls were set as 0 96 of field capacity according to li et al and mao li and luo 2003 mao et al 2003 because these authors results are representative of rice growing areas in china in addition a ratio of etm and swc is used in the computation of delayed acting water since soil water is dynamic the removal of water also occurs due to evaporation and transpiration kirkham 2014 thus the ratio of etm and swc quantifies the effects of climate and soil moisture on the amount of available soil water to improve water productivity water saving irrigation techniques are gradually being promoted under the water saving irrigation mode a paddy field usually has characteristics of awd and irrigation and drainage schedules are more complex than those of the traditional cf mode however most of the existing crop models simplify the irrigation and drainage module bouman et al 2001 jones et al 2003 mccown et al 1996 and thus are unsuited for the study of water saving irrigation this study modifies several modules related to water balance simulation in the orzya2000 v2 13 model and proposes a new wbsf for paddy fields under awd irrigation the improved oryza2000 is proven effective at simulating pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation and drainage amount root length and yield values under cf and awd modes since monitoring wbcs is labor and time intensive feng et al 2007 the improved model might serve as a new way to complement and extrapolate the results of field experiments the improved oryza2000 performs better than oryza v3 in water balance simulation for the following reasons 1 irrigation and drainage are scheduled more accurately by the irdr module existing versions of the oryza model focus on modifying irrigation functions and still follow the assumption that drainage occurs when pwd is higher than the bund height however drainage before pwd reaches the bund height is a common operation for example mid season drainage or sunk baking is widely used to control unproductive tillers by draining ponded water to 0 in the late period of the tillering stage in china han et al 2019 pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in addition h p might change in different stages liu et al 2019 since the original oryza model cannot simulate this kind of drainage ponded water cannot descend to a certain depth in time this will surely impact the computation of evapotranspiration and percolation while impacting the schedule of irrigation and drainage in the subsequent periods 2 actual evapotranspiration and percolation are computed more reasonably which ensures that irrigation or drainage occurs at times that mimic actual conditions some existing studies have tested the performance of the original oryza in simulating pwd and report good agreement between simulations and observations belder et al 2007 feng et al 2007 gao et al 2021 however irrigation depths and times are specified according to experimental records in the simulations of these studies in the present study irrigation and drainage were auto scheduled by irdr module and strong performance by the improved model in simulating several wbcs is shown in figs 4 7 this comparison illustrates that the improved model offers more advantages in terms of irrigation and drainage control and is more suitable for irrigation and drainage forecast conducted under different irrigation modes the wbsf incorporated in the improved oryza2000 assumes a situation with bottom boundary of free drainage meanwhile the selection of setting groundwater table is still kept in the model code since the groundwater table in the two study sites hardly affect the water balance of paddy the schematization of paddy field in the improved model is suitable for these two sites and other similar areas for areas with shallow groundwater table the effectiveness of the improved model is still needed to be evaluated and the combination of the wbsf and the groundwater table setting requires further analysis 5 conclusion in this study the original oryza model was improved based on the characteristics of paddy fields observed under awd a new framework was used for the water balance simulation of the improved oryza2000 data from experiments carried out at two sites yongkang and tuanlin were used to test the performance of the improved model the simulated pwd evapotranspiration percolation irrigation amount and drainage amount values from the improved oryza2000 are in good agreement with the corresponding observed values and the improved oryza2000 performs much better in simulating these wbcs than oryza v3 moreover the dynamic change in root length from the improved model is in line with empirical results and the predictive accuracy of yields is slightly increase compared with the oryza2000 v2 13 consequently this study proposes an efficient wbsf for simulating the wbcs of paddy fields under cf and awd although the improvement was developed for awd the improved model can be also be used for simulation under other irrigation modes since the source code of oryza2000 is freely accessible with the equations using in the wbsf experts for research purposes can implement the improved oryza2000 under a fortran language environment the improved oryza2000 will surely be beneficial to the study of

9397,agricultural pollution due to excessive land fertilization affects the quality of both surface and ground water this paper presents a conceptual and reservoir based model that simulates the time variation of nitrate concentrations no3 at the outlet of a subsurface drainage network referred to herein as nit drain the model is based on a simplified scheme of water and nitrate transfer processes by decomposing the soil profile located between the drain and the mid drain into three interconnected and conceptual compartments hence the fast transfer throughout the macroporosity located above the pipe is described by the first compartment while the low and residual nitrate transfers are managed by the two other compartments the model assumes that all seasonal nitrogen transformations at the field scale lead to the remaining pool of nitrate available for leaching at the beginning of the winter season rnbw this variable is updated by the model at the beginning of each hydrological year the nit drain model requires two input data the measured or simulated drainage discharge and the rnbw seven parameters were introduced to manage nitrate leaching and water flow through the three soil compartments using two different transfer functions the calibration and validation step c v was performed to assess the performance of the model in reproducing the nitrate concentration observations acquired at rampillon 355 ha data for 6 years located east of paris france the results showed performance criteria of kge greater than 0 5 and of rmse less than 5 mgno3 l which confirm the ability of the model to simulate the observed nitrate concentrations with a good agreement the annual model calibration framework implemented to assess the parameter variability confirms the model stability and consistency however the use of simulated drainage discharges as input underlines the need to reproduce with accuracy the earlier low discharge values by the drainage model the innovative management of nitrate transfer through the conceptual compartments based on the annual update of the rnbw variable enables the simulation of the nitrate concentrations with a high performance using a limited number of input data in addition the periods of flushing and dilution are clearly identified by the nit drain model thanks to the accurate estimation of the nitrate storage variation inside each model compartment graphical abstract ga1 keywords nitrate modeling nitrate concentrations agricultural drainage conceptual modeling nitrate leaching preferential flow 1 introduction nitrogen n is available in agricultural soils in different compositions the one most easily assimilated by crops is the nitrate ion no3 nitrate contributes to crop growth and to improved crop yield fertilizers mainly composed of nitrate are spread periodically over agricultural land to maintain the required quantity of nitrate for crop development however a considerable increase of nitrate leaching to rivers and aquifers leading to water resource pollution was observed when the amount of nitrate available in the soil exceeded the actual need of the crop agrawal et al 1999 almasri and kaluarachchi 2004 billen et al 2013 kumazawa 2002 lassaletta et al 2014 the practice of agricultural drainage through the installation of buried perforated pipes or open ditches is widely used in land suffering from frequent winter soil waterlogging in order to eliminate the excess of water thus agricultural drainage aims to increase crop yields mohtadullah 1990 and allows for better access to fields by farmers although this practice has existed for several thousands of years beauchamp and pavelis 1987 the installation of drainage networks has been greatly intensified in the last few decades this may be linked to some negative aspects such as the faster transfer of agricultural pollutants to the drain outlet schilling et al 2012 scholefield et al 1993 skaggs et al 1994 zhi and li 2020 the reduction in pollutants leaching e g nitrate from agricultural drained lands has been supported by the european water framework directive dce directive 1991 since the beginning of the 21st century hence several studies have been conducted around this topic dinnes et al 2002 suggested a set of strategies to mitigate nitrate leaching from agricultural drained soils such as the use of controlled drainage and the optimization of the timing amount spread of fertilizers by considering the n turnover features and by testing the nitrogen availability of the soil prior to any fertilizer application magdoff et al 1990 furthermore the late spring soil nitrate test lsnt could be useful for assessing the available quantity of nitrate and for reducing nitrate loss at the end of the spring season jaynes et al 2004 the same approaches could be used to estimate the remaining quantity of nitrate pool in the soil for the autumn season typically at this period cover crops are commonly not observed bare soils resulting in a greater potential for nitrate leaching after the first few rain events hansen and djurhuus 1996 kirchmann et al 2002 the use of winter cover crops can limit nitrate losses significantly meyer et al 2020 2018 from an agronomical standpoint bockstaller et al 2021 have evaluated the potential of nitrate leaching based on the cover crop concept and agronomical modeling the latter requires the availability of crop rotation data and local measurements of nitrogen soil storage in this paper the terminology remaining pools of nitrate at the beginning of the winter season rnbw refers to the potentially leachable quantity of nitrate initially trapped in the soil profile between the topsoil and drains depth at the beginning of each winter season compared with the lsnt rnbw field sampling has an environmental focus rather than an economic one salomez and hofman 2002 therefore a limited frequency sampling of the rnbw essentially due to the expensive acquisition fees makes these data scarce most of the time clay et al 1997 this fact has led to studies of the potential relationship between nitrate concentrations and surpluses arlot 1999 oenema et al 1998 to allow for the estimation of the nitrate available for leaching based on nitrate concentration data in the past several papers focused on tracer experimentations to describe solute transfer through shallow soil depths utermann et al 1990 and gaur et al 2006 consider the existing vertical connection between the unsaturated and the saturated zones of the soil by using appropriate transfer functions while kohler et al 2003 separate the subsurface soil into two conceptual compartments to describe the preferential and matrix flow paths one can note that preferential flows occur near the drain location while a residual matrix flow is a horizontal transitional flow between the mid drain and the drain outlet the decomposition of the solute movement over the agricultural drainage soil porosities and the consideration of the dual permeability modeling approach have been widely investigated by the research community frey et al 2016 gerke and maximilian köhne 2004 richard and steenhuis 1988 a set of modeling experiments have been conducted using the physically based hydrus 2d model simunek et al 1999 to approach the solute transfer velocities between the soil surface and the drain outlet paris 2004 thus a significant decrease in the solute travel time at the proximity of the tile drain has been noticed suggesting the necessity to consider both preferential and residual soil matrix flows kjær et al 2011 observed similar solute transport pathways when the chloride tracer experiment was conducted on a 1 26 ha tile drained agricultural area in denmark in addition a relatively recent review by jacobsen and kjær 2007 indicates that rapid solute transport is observed when macropores are located near the drain outlet noting that water flow pathways depend on hydraulic conditions and soil structure and proprieties as well today high frequency nitrate concentration samplings 1 h are carried out in order to ensure better monitoring and obtain more information on the intraday nitrate behavior such experiments require the use of automatic sensors providing up to sub hourly chemographs burns et al 2019 liu et al 2020 which could be expensive time consuming and involve at least one qualified operator the use of water quality modeling might represent an alternative way to simulate the substantial lack of data e g soil nitrate concentrations or to estimate the temporal variation of the soil nitrate pool different modeling approaches are described in the literature payraudeau 2002 conceptual water quality modeling is commonly considered as a simplification of the existing and complex physical and biogeochemical processes that need advanced knowledge on the interaction between the different ecosystem components by contrast process based models require a large dataset to operate due to the consideration of complex nutrient interactions and transfer processes through multiple soil layers moriasi et al 2012 provide a detailed technical description of 25 hydrologic and water quality models e g simulated processes spatial and temporal scale open source code or not one can identify process based crop models taking into account the data on farming practices to estimate crop yield and nutrient exportations the biogeochemical dndc model li et al 1992a b enables the estimation of carbon sequestration and nitrogen denitrification while a newly updated version of this model includes a better description of the drainage hydrology smith et al 2020 an objective comparison of rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 and dndc modeling predictive performances indicates that rzwqm2 is more suitable for greenhouse gas emissions and water continent simulations jiang et al 2020 one can note the stics model brisson et al 2003 which is decomposed on a set of modules managing crop growth soil water and nitrogen balances based on climatic and agronomic input data a recent application of stics using 34 years of experimental data collected at the fagnières site in france confirms its satisfactory performance in simulating the nitrate flux yin et al 2020 moreover tournebize et al 2004 adapted the stics model to consider the subsurface drainage modeling accordingly process based models e g dndc stics require a large number of data crop data in particular puech et al 2020 propose the spatial distribution of crop data at the regional scale however the scarcity of such data at a large scale could be considered a hindrance to wider uses in addition the dynamic assessment of the amount of potentially leachable nutrients toward groundwater and rivers is often poorly described finally the statistically based model nutting n enables a good estimation of nitrate loads and eutrophication risk using a limited number of input data dupas et al 2013 2015 while detailed local model inputs are however needed to enhance the performance of the regionalized model semi distributed hydrological models taking into account drainage and water quality processes such as hype lindström et al 2010 or swat g arnold et al 2012 make it possible to simulate nitrate losses with a good performance however they still require the introduction of spatially distributed data which are difficult to collect for most application cases other modeling approaches focused on the identification of the concentration flow c q relationship either at one rainfall event or at the seasonal scale using empirical equations arlot 1999 liu et al 2020 tunqui neira et al 2020 the c q relationship is difficult to handle for the whole nitrate leaching cycle including both flushing and dilution patterns agricultural subsurface drainage models are specifically developed to design drainage networks and to enhance the comprehension and the assessment of both drainage discharge behavior and nutrient transport the drainmod nii process based model is based on the water balance calculation to simulate the drainage discharge and it uses the most important components of the nitrogen cycle to predict nitrogen dynamics and turnover youssef et al 2005 skaggs et al 2012 the process based model adapt gowda et al 2012 which considers the macrospore flow transfer is derived from the combination of the drainage model drainmod skaggs et al 2012 and the water quality model gleams leonard et al 1987 both the drainmod nii and the adapt models performances have been investigated by ale et al 2013 the two models show very similar performances in terms of water and nitrate leaching simulation under large time steps e g months and years arlot 1999 noted the complexity of the interaction between biogeochemical and hydraulic processes assuming that biogeochemical interactions can be neglected in winter due to the low soil temperatures e g 8 c in the north of france hence arlot 1999 has proposed the use of hydraulic processes including essentially the nitrate transfer pathway and velocity through the soil porosities to simulate nitrate leaching in the agricultural drainage context selecting the appropriate model depends on the study purpose on input data availability and on computing resources the choice of model can be a tricky and complex task in some cases end users may look at some objective indicators to guide their choice including the identification of the nature and the availability of the model inputs simulation efficiency and model parsimony perrin et al 2001 moreover developing parsimonious water quality models can become a difficult task hence the use of a stepwise prioritization approach might lead to the simplification of some complex physical processes as indicated by tang et al 2019 the main objective of this study is to develop and validate a new conceptual nitrate model applied in the context of agricultural subsurface drainage the modeling approach considers the flushing and dilution patterns using the nitrate data at hourly and daily time steps the model structure takes into account 1 the preferential flow transfer which describes fast and vertical nitrate infiltration above the drain location and 2 the soil matrix flow highlighting the residual low and lateral nitrate transfer achieved between the mid drain and the drain location in addition to the non consideration of the n turnover processes arlot 1999 we assume that the major components of the nitrogen cycle might be gathered in one annual input variable rnbw the model requires a limited number of input data and parameters first the model is validated based on hourly observed drainage discharge data second the nitrate concentration error resulting from the use of daily drainage discharge simulations i e derived from a validated drainage model instead of observations inputs is assessed accordingly 2 study site and experimental data the experimental set up is in the rampillon catchment 355 ha located upstream of the ancœur agricultural catchment 132 2 km² 70 km southeast of paris france 03 03 37 300e 48 32 16 700 n fig 1 the soil is mainly of luvisol type mander et al 2021 tournebize et al 2012 and lies on a shallow impermeable layer due to the clay accumulation typical of french waterlogging soils these two conditions support the presence of a shallow water table which affects crop growth by reducing the yield and the quality of the harvest both a large part of the ancœur catchment 80 and the whole rampillon area have been subsurface drained since 1980 to prevent frequent winter soil saturation tournebize et al 2012 the drainage network consists of perforated pvc pipes spaced 10 m apart and buried at about 90 cm deep allowing for better soil tillage and a satisfactory crop yield it is noteworthy that 98 of the total area is tilled mainly following the crop rotation winter wheat sugar beet corn beans and rape fig 2 thus one can distinguish winter crops e g winter wheat winter barley and rape from spring crops e g corn sugar beet beans the winter wheat and barley are generally sown in october and harvested in early july while corn is sown in april and harvested in october in this agricultural setup using catch crops could be very helpful in limiting excessive nitrate leaching meyer et al 2018 on average 150 kgn year of mineral fertilizer is applied three times end of february end of may and end of june the average values of corn and wheat yield reported between 2013 and 2017 by agreste survey are of 9 7 t ha and 8 3 t ha respectively https agreste agriculture gouv fr four seasons are available in the studied region including a winter marked by relatively low temperatures t 3 c the local climate is oceanic and temperate with a mean annual temperature and rainfall of 10 5 c and 689 mm respectively the rampillon experimental set up consists of a continuous measurement of subsurface drainage discharge and water quality parameters at the catchment outlet a doppler flowmeter sigma 950 hach was installed to record hourly drainage discharge values and a multiparameter spectrophotometer spectrolyser uv vis s can was implemented for hourly measurements of nitrate concentrations rainfall data were obtained by means of a local pluviometer installed at the study site the potential evapotranspiration pet data are extracted from the safran database vidal et al 2010 at the daily time step pet data values are calculated following the penman monteith formula and converted into hourly time steps using a gaussian distribution with 12 p m at the top and 6 a m at the bottom the nitrogen soil metrics are extracted from the annual dashboard which is provided by aquibrie https www aquibrie fr publications tableau de bord 2016 2017 the local field sampling of the soil profile using a soil auger was conducted between 2014 and 2018 at the end of the autumn season in order to measure the remaining nitrogen pools rnbw in fact nitrate storage in the study soils covers several agricultural parcels and crop turnover at the scale of the seine et marne department 5915 km2 thus the mean rnbw values are obtained by surface weighting the local measured values for typical crop plots a summary of the 6 years of data collected between 2014 and 2020 at the rampillon experimental set up is presented in table 1 one can distinguish 2017 2018 as a wet season with more than 900 mm of rainfall that generates 485 mm of cumulative drained water the 2016 2017 season was typically dry with less than 90 mm of cumulative drained water thus a low quantity of drained water in this dry year shows a high average nitrate concentration this contrast in terms of weather supports the reliability of our study the yearly mean surface weighted values of rnbw range between 49 and 78 kgn ha 1 year 1 generally the main nitrate flux exportations are observed during the winter months i e between september and february according to kladivko et al 1991 and depending on the spring rainfall amount the part of the nitrate flux observed from march to september does not go beyond 10 of the total cumulative exportations in addition low temperatures are observed during the winter season which tends to limit the impact of the nitrate processes other than leaching thus only data extracted between september and february are included to simulate nitrate concentrations 3 model description the nit drain model nitrate drainage aims to simulate nitrate concentrations at the scale of subsurface drainage parcels collecting water from one or several agricultural fields based on global and conceptual approaches the model is driven by a set of assumptions 1 rnbw values are estimated by the model to approximate the initial quantity of nitrate available for leaching at the beginning of the winter season 2 all biogeochemical processes affecting n turnover are neglected due to the low temperatures in the winter season and a weak crop n uptake 3 the high amount of nitrate exportations during the winter season kladivko et al 1991 added to the significant impact of spring fertilizations on the nitrate balance during the spring season led us to consider only the winter period for nitrate simulations 4 nitrate removal processes inside drains are reduced to zero low time of residence 5 no deep n losses pipes lying on an impervious layer or surface runoff are considered henine et al 2022 the model is designed to be simple and robust with the use of a limited number of input data and parameters the drainage discharge decomposed on highflow and baseflow is used as model input three conceptual reservoirs interconnected by three transfer functions are implemented to describe the water and nitrate transfer in the soil profile extending between the drain and the mid drain the modeling approach highlights the nitrate flushing and dilution patterns through the consideration of contrasting nitrate transfer velocities i e fast and slow transfers more details on the model approach and structure are described in the sections that follow 3 1 conceptual soil reservoirs the reservoir based approach used in the nit drain model is derived from the pestdrain and tammodel modeling concepts branger et al 2009 steenhuis et al 1997 here a similar modeling approach is adopted to estimate and assess the dynamic of the nitrate leaching from drained soil profiles thus one can consider three conceptual reservoirs to describe the nitrate transfer in the soil using specific transfer functions f1 f2 and f3 fig 3 the first and the second reservoirs i e superficial slow compartment overlaying deep slow compartment referred to as ssc and dsc respectively describe the slow solute transfer kjær et al 2011 paris 2004 the third conceptual reservoir i e the fast compartment referred to as fc is designed to describe the fast solute transfer occurring above the drain mainly through preferential flows rnbw is considered as an input variable and its amount is updated at the beginning of each hydrological year the rnbw value is split using the parameter α between the fc and the ssc as follows 1 rnbw s 1 0 s 2 0 s 1 0 1 α rnbw s 2 0 α rnbw α 0 1 where s 1 0 and s 2 0 are respectively the initial amount of leachable nitrate contained inside compartments fc and ssc at the beginning of each hydrological season 3 2 consideration of the flushing dilution patterns several studies and review papers have described and identified the nitrate flushing and dilution patterns at either seasonal or storm event scales arlot 1999 burns et al 2019 minaudo et al 2019 ruiz et al 2002 the methods involved highlight the existing link between the discharge and the concentration of pollutants using transfer functions burns 1974 magesan et al 1994 unnikrishna et al 1995 or by considering c q relationship liu et al 2021 minaudo et al 2019 these approaches describe the correct simulation of nitrate concentrations at the scale of one rainfall event however there are very scarce models that can correctly simulate both the event and the seasonal flushing dilution patterns of nitrate concentrations moreover existing models involve the use of a large number of parameters and low frequency observations data which potentially limit the identification of the extreme variations of nitrate concentrations occurring at small timeframes the flushing pattern process represents the abrupt increase of nitrate concentrations during a flooding event fig 4 this behavior is observed at the beginning of the drainage season i e following the first drainage discharge events the high nitrate quantity available on shallow soil depths during this specific period of the year is related to its previous post harvest accumulation the latter is mostly due to the increase in nitrogen mineralization following high temperatures and the absence of a potential catch crop during the summer season the dilution pattern process generally occurs when a flooding event generates a decrease in nitrate concentrations fig 4 although concentrations are lower dilution patterns are usually presented following the leaching of a large part of nitrate i e initially trapped in the top soil layers at the beginning of the drainage season or after significant fertilizer applications hence flushing patterns are mainly provided by the compartment fc at the beginning of the drainage season describing fast nitrate transfer velocities where dilution patterns are essentially managed by compartments ssc and dsc characterizing slow nitrate transfer velocities 3 3 flow decomposition to consider the slow and fast nitrate transfers several research results indicate the significant contribution of the baseflow to the annual nitrate flux exportation jordan et al 1997 schilling and zhang 2004 schilling et al 2012 spahr et al 2010 the nit drain model considers the distribution of the nitrate transfer velocities between the drain and the mid drain by decomposing the drainage discharge data simulated or observed at the drain outlet into two parts hence one can consider the baseflow separation techniques such as the one proposed by eckhardt 2005 hereinafter the simplified linear formula eq 2 is used to separate the total drainage discharge value we assume that the baseflow q b drives the nitrate transfer from the superficial and deep slow soil reservoirs ssc and dsc respectively whereas the highflow q p describes the nitrate transfer from the fast soil reservoir fc 2 q t t q p t q b t q p t 1 β q t t q b t β q t t where β and 1 β terms represent the parts of the drainage discharge moving through the slow compartments i e ssc dsc and the fast compartment fc respectively the empirical β parameter is fixed to 0 33 after testing several value combinations which means that the baseflow part is assumed to constitute one third of the total drainage discharge 3 4 description of the model transfer functions the quantity of nitrates transferred through subsurface drained soils depends on both the water flow and the nitrate available for leaching at different soil layers arlot 1999 otherwise water flow in the soil enables the mobilization and the transfer of nitrate through the soil porosity toward the drain outlet the solute movement and redistribution through the different soil compartments could be described using appropriate transfer functions burns s transfer function eq 3 a facilitates the prediction of nitrate leaching by assuming a uniform initial distribution of nitrate quantity on a given soil profile burns 1974 1975 1976 this function is generally applied to describe vertical solute transfers in soils the latter has been implemented in the 1d lixim model mary et al 1999 to predict the nitrate mineralization in bare soils hence burns s equation has been applied for wet drained soils showing preferential flow moreover the pestdrain model branger et al 2009 considers the exponential transfer function eq 3 b described in magesan et al 1994 and derived by jury and roth 1990 in addition the exponential formulation is known as the most adapted transfer function for modeling the subsurface drained flow according to arlot 1999 the nit drain model considers both the burns and the magesan leaching functions illustrated by eq 3 a and b respectively to simulate the nitrate transfer from the three conceptual reservoirs to the drain outlet hence burns s function characterizes preferential nitrate transfers from the fc reservoir to the drain while the exponential function describes the lateral nitrate transfer in soil first from the ssc to the dsc reservoir and then from the dsc to the drain outlet 3 x l d d θ f c 100 z a x l θ l θ 0 1 e x p d z θ l b where x l represents the fraction of solute leached below the soil layer depth z θ fc θ l and θ 0 are respectively the volumetric water content at field capacity the leaching porosity and the initial volumetric water content in eq 3 d corresponds to the cumulative drained water volume expressed in the steady state regime given the small model time step hours days we suppose that flow rates q b t and q p t correspond to a succession of steady state flow that form the transient flow regime branger et al 2009 these two equations are then adapted to define the leaching functions f1 f2 and f3 eqs 4 5 and 6 the latter calculates the nitrate flux transferred from the ssc dsc and fc compartments respectively 4 f 1 t s 2 t p 1 1 exp q b t vl 1 5 f 2 t dn t p 2 1 exp q b t vl 2 6 f 3 t s 1 t q p t q p t θ p 3 in eqs 4 and 5 we introduce vl 1 z 1 θ l and vl 2 z 2 θ l as the part of soil porosity contributing to nitrate transfer from the ssc and dsc compartments respectively p1 and p2 consist of weighting coefficients used to modulate the quantity of nitrate exported from the ssc and dsc respectively z1 z2 and p3 from eq 6 describe the soil depth related to reservoirs ssc dsc and fc respectively s 1 t s 2 t and d n t constitute the temporal evolution of the nitrate quantity stored in the fc ssc and dsc soil reservoirs respectively hence the total exported nitrate flux f t at the time step t is calculated by the model as follows 7 f t f 2 t f 3 t then the nitrate concentration no 3 is calculated by dividing the total nitrate flux f t by the total drainage discharge q t t 8 no 3 f t q t t nitrate mass balance is preserved by updating the quantity of nitrate at the time step t 1 for each soil reservoir eq 9 9 s 2 t 1 s 2 t f 1 t dn t 1 dn t f 1 t f 2 t s 1 t 1 s 1 t f 3 t the state variables and the input parameters and variables of the nitrate model are listed in table 2 in total we can count seven input parameters to be calibrated and one input variable rnbw to be estimated 4 model evaluation strategy the validation of the new nit drain model is based on the assessment of the nitrate concentration simulations against the available observations 4 1 model calibration and validation three steps i ii and iii are considered in order to evaluate the model performance and the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations for each step the model parameters are calibrated using the grg gradient and iterative descent algorithm lasdon et al 1978 this algorithm searches for the optimal solution starting from arbitrary values of parameters we note the annual rnbw value estimations using the same iterative approach i based on nitrate concentration observations the model parameters and the rnbw values are optimized yearly in order to assess their stability and consistency each modeled hydrological period begins in september and ends in february of the next year in all six parameter sets are calibrated corresponding to the 6 years of data hence the variability of the parameters indicates the degree of robustness of the model ii the model evaluation is performed using the split sample test klemeš 1986 by dividing the whole of the observed data table 1 into two equivalent periods p1 and p2 the period p1 corresponds to the three 3 years of data 2014 2017 while p2 covers the years between 2017 and 2020 for each period the model is run in turns for both calibration and validation we note the calibration of the model parameters based on the whole period of interest 2014 2020 for comparison purposes in addition rnbw values are specific to each hydrological year their values should be estimated accordingly on september 1st of each simulated year for both calibration and validation periods iii the potential of the nit drain model to perform using drainage discharge simulations instead of observations is investigated hence the nitrate model will run under a daily time step to be in accordance with the daily drainage discharge outputs simulated by the selected agricultural drainage model in this study the simulated drainage discharges are derived from the sidra ru model henine et al 2022 jeantet et al 2021 as we plan to couple the two models i e nit drain and sidra ru in a future work this step is included in order to provide a more detailed overview of the impact of discharge simulation mismatches on the quality of the nitrate simulations 4 2 objective criteria all parameters were estimated simultaneously using the well known nse objective criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse values range from to 1 and require data on both simulated and observed nitrate concentrations eq 10 nse value close to 1 indicates that the simulations are strongly fitted to the observations in addition to nse used here as the principal performance criteria the following metrics are calculated in order to consolidate the performance results obtained the kling gupta efficiency kge criteria gupta et al 2009 ranging from to 1 eq 11 and the root mean square error rmse kenney and keeping 1962 ranging between 0 and eq 12 10 nse 1 t 1 t t x t x t ² t 1 t t x t x t ² 11 kge 1 cov x t x t σ x t 2 σ x t 2 1 2 x t x t 1 2 σ x t σ x t 1 2 12 rmse 1 t t 1 t x t x t 2 where x t and x t correspond to the observations and the simulations at the time step t respectively x t and x t are defined as the mean values of the observations and the simulations respectively throughout the whole period of interest t note that cov x t x t refers to the covariance between x t and x t while σ indicates the standard deviation note also the use of relative ξ rel and absolute ξ abs error formulas eq 13 in order to describe the discrepancy between observations x and simulations x of respectively nitrate concentrations and discharge 13 ξ abs x x ξ rel x x x lastly the coefficient of variation cv is calculated to assess the variability of the yearly calibrated parameters this statistical standardized index is obtained by dividing the standard deviation σ by the average value µ of the parameter of interest 14 cv σ µ 100 5 results this section reports the simulation performance results obtained by the nit drain model using three evaluation methods first the model calibration based on nitrate concentration observations is performed year per year over the entire dataset period in order to evaluate the annual variability of the model parameters then the model is evaluated over a wider time scale using the split sample test in order to check the efficiency and the robustness of the nitrate concentration simulations finally the model performance is assessed using drainage discharge simulations as input data instead of observations 5 1 model assessment based on annual calibration annual model calibration based on hourly observations of nitrate concentrations is performed over the six hydrological years ranging from september 1st 2014 to february 5th 2020 fig 5 shows the modeling behavior of nitrates for the 2017 2018 hydrological season in a we compare the observed nitrate concentrations with the simulated nitrate concentrations the flushing and dilution periods are separated by the vertical dashed line in b we highlight the linear correlation between observed and simulated nitrate concentrations showing a value of r² 0 83 based on fig 5 a and fig 5 b one can note the well simulation of nitrate concentrations in addition the corresponding metrics listed in table 3 e g nse 0 83 and kge 0 86 objectively confirm the high quality of the model simulations in c we illustrate the temporal nitrate exportations from the fc and dsc soil reservoirs while the temporal evolution of the nitrate storage in each of the three conceptual reservoirs i e fc ssc and dsc fig 3 is presented in d from fig 5a and d we observe that the nitrate transfer switches from a flushing to a dilution pattern i e separation by the dashed vertical lines when the nitrate quantity stored in the dsc reservoir overtakes the one available in the fc reservoir the change in the nitrate pattern may occur at the beginning of the intensive drainage season ids note that the ids is reached when the soil profile is fully saturated by water lesaffre 1988 thus the high quantity of nitrate which is initially stored in the surface layer of the soil i e corresponding to the fc reservoir in the model is in large part exported by the first flows of the season this pattern leads to the fast emptying of the fc conceptual soil reservoir giving way to the gradual introduction of nitrate dilution phenomena headed by the deep slow soil reservoir dsc this behavior can be confirmed by the data in fig 5c where the significant nitrate exportations from the fast soil reservoir fc decrease with time resulting in a gradual increase of nitrate exportations from the deep slow reservoir dsc this result stresses the importance of preferential flows occurring above the drains after the first winter rainfall the annual calibrated parameters and the corresponding estimated rnbw values are reported in table 3 along with their respective nse and kge metrics one can see that the p 3 and α parameters present the lowest values of cv i e 4 3 and 19 5 respectively this result means that these two parameters did not show a high variability between seasons thus the mean values of p 3 and α could be considered as references the coefficient of variation related to the other parameters remains lower than 100 however such a degree of variability requires further advanced analysis e g sensitivity analysis to identify the impact of each parameter on the model response we note that the wet and dry seasons e g 2019 2020 and 2016 2017 respectively table 1 tend generally to show a contrasted values of α i e high and low values for wet and dry seasons respectively the resulting performances indicated by means of nse and kge indices confirm the high quality of the nitrate concentration simulation in addition the calculated mismatches between simulated and observed cumulative nitrate exportations i e δf get closer to zero for the overall calibrated years the corresponding rmse value remains less than 0 06 kgn ha 1 year 1 which confirms the ability of the model to reproduce faithfully the observations 5 2 model assessment using the split sample test approach two model calibration tests were carried out the first test consists in calibrating the model parameters on the entire dataset period i e 2014 2020 while the second consists in using the split sample test sst to assess the robustness of simulations over the two equivalent subperiods p1 2014 2017 and p2 2017 2020 this second test enables the consideration of the disparity and heterogeneity coming from the temporal variation of the discharge and nitrate data in drained agricultural soils the two calibration tests are based on the hourly observations of nitrate concentrations at the drainage network outlet table 4 combines the parameter sets and metric values resulting from both the sst model calibration and validation a and the full sample test fst calibration b the good model performance obtained from the two tests is noteworthy the corresponding kge and nse values extend to 0 84 and 0 74 respectively in the calibration period and up to 0 70 and 0 66 respectively in the validation period however one can identify the relatively satisfactory kge and nse values for the p2 validation period this short drop in performance could be mainly assigned to the data variability of period p1 which is much drier as compared with p2 the kge and nse listed in table 4 refer to the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations in fact nitrate flux simulations show a systematically high performance e g nse and kge 0 9 thus the model calibration and validation could be considered as successfully completed a graphical comparison between simulated and observed nitrate concentrations in the periods p1 and p2 is presented in figure a 1 and figure a 2 see the supplemental material section the calibrated parameter values in p1 in p2 and in the total period remain robust and are comparable with those obtained by the annual calibration framework table 3 rnbw values are estimated under the three model evaluation strategies e g annual calibration sst and fst calibration see section 4 1 it is important to note that one value of rnbw is estimated per season by the model the bar graph presented in fig 6 indicates the six estimated rnbw values according to each calibration strategy carried out the rnbw surface weighted values ranging from 49 to 78 kgn ha 1 year 1 table 1 and fig 6 remain consistent with the estimated values by the nitrate model fig 6 except for the 2014 2015 season the rnbw measurements are close to the average of the estimations i e less than 5kgn ha 1 year 1 of mismatch the calculated rnbw values are of the same order regardless of the estimation approach some exceptions should be noted such as the marked difference between the estimated rnbw values using annual calibration and those estimated using sst or global calibrations i e underestimated for 2015 2016 and overestimated for the 2016 2017 dry season 5 3 model assessment using simulated drainage discharge this section shows the impact of the discharge input source on the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations we note the use of the nit drain parameters calibrated over the entire period of data see section 5 2 table 4 part b hence we focus on the quantification of the error in nitrate simulations resulting from the use of simulated discharges instead of observed discharges as input data the satisfactory performance obtained when simulating the drainage discharge using the sidra ru model is noteworthy indeed the rmse value corresponds to 1 16 mm per day when nse and kge are equal to 0 53 and 0 78 respectively the nit drain model performance i e rmse nse and kge corresponding to the use of drainage discharge simulations as input are presented in table 5 on the one hand a significant impact is observed on the performance e g δnse 1 31 when simulating nitrate concentrations using simulated discharges sidra ru model output instead of observed discharges on the other hand the performance of the nit drain is less impacted in the case of nitrate flux simulations e g δnse 0 41 fig 7 shows the monthly amplitude of the generated absolute errors on discharge purple boxplots and relative errors on nitrate concentration simulations green and orange boxplots in comparison with their respective observations green boxplots describe the relative errors of nitrate concentration simulations when using discharge observations as model input in this case the monthly distribution of the relative error does not exceed 30 conversely significant error up to 60 can be noted when using the drainage discharge simulations as input data in the nitrate model orange boxplots this experiment is conducted in order to have a more detailed view concerning the seasonal distribution of the error of both nitrate concentrations and drainage discharges errors obtained on low drainage discharge leading to small nitrate flux values i e observed at the beginning of the drainage season have a substantial impact on the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations the opposite is observed during the intensive drainage season from december to february where a relatively significant error in drainage discharge simulations has only a small impact on the quality of nitrate concentrations moreover fig 8 shows the hourly variation of the simulated a drainage discharge b nitrate flux and c nitrate concentrations against their respective observations blue lines for the 2017 2018 hydrological year nitrate flux and concentrations are systematically well simulated when using observed discharges as input for the nitrate model green lines otherwise the first months of the drainage season are marked by worse nitrate simulations when replacing the drainage discharge observations by simulations red lines in addition an overestimation of nitrate concentrations red lines is observed during the intensive drainage season i e december to february these results suggest that the low drainage discharge values may have a significant impact on nitrate concentration modeling but less so for flux simulation which is in agreement with the results presented in fig 7 this is particularly applicable at the beginning of the drainage season when the soil is highly loaded with nitrate 6 discussion the nit drain modeling approach has been designed to enable the simple description of the nitrate transfer in the soil profile toward the drain the model requires the rnbw data and the drainage discharge as inputs to simulate nitrate concentrations and flux at the agricultural drainage outlet the nit drain modeling approach is based on the decomposition of the subsurface soil profile into three interconnected and conceptual reservoirs hence two transfer functions were considered from the literature to allow for the nitrate movement between these three defined reservoirs this approach was tested and validated over the 6 years of hourly observation data collected from the experimental agricultural field of rampillon this study focused on the improvement of nitrate concentration modeling this variable remains much more challenging than nitrate flux modeling which has been addressed in a number of studies to date the originality of the model lies in the fact that no process other than nitrate lixiviation is considered hence we have assumed the nitrogen processes during the winter season to be negligible e g nitrate denitrification mineralization or assimilation by plants due to the low temperatures and the fast flow transfer velocities caused by the presence of tile drainage this led us to limit the simulation to the non growing season ranging between september and february thus the results confirm that only hydraulics are responsible for nitrate exportations during this period moreover the importance of the non growing season has been stressed by ren et al 2022 indeed this period has been identified as critical in terms of water and nutrient losses due to the low values of evapotranspiration and plant uptake according to ren et al 2022 this period of the year is responsible for the main water and nitrate exportations through the tile drain in addition the study conducted by liu et al 2020 showed that the top 27 of the drainage discharge generally occurring during the non growing season contributes to 75 of the total nitrate exportations the nit drain model makes it possible to consider both flushing and dilution patterns on the one hand the flushing episodes are observed when the superficial soil is loaded with a significant quantity of nitrate thus leading to the occurrence of the preferential nitrate transfer above the drain location on the other hand dilution episodes emphasize the low lateral nitrate transfer characterized by a significant residence time the data analysis indicates that the wet years tend to show significant dilution episodes while the dry years are usually characterized by frequent flushing episodes according to the nit drain model flushing patterns are due to the high nitrate exportations from the fast compartment fc typically observed during the first flow events of the drainage season fig 5c thus the fc compartment becomes almost completely empty when rainfall infiltrations leached most of the nitrate initially available at low soil depths in this period of the year the residual nitrate concentrations exported with water from the ssc and dsc low compartments are mixed with the lightly nitrate loaded water coming from the fc compartment this transfer mode promotes the occurrence of dilution patterns in general our modeling approach enables an accurate shifting between flushing and dilution patterns which involves preferential and matrix flow contributions respectively several studies have shown the significant contribution of preferential flow due to the presence of soil macropores above the tile drain location thus multiple conceptual models have been implemented while considering a dual permeability approach frey et al 2016 gerke and maximilian köhne 2004 in addition stone and wilson 2006 highlighted the role of preferential flow pathways through the consideration of a conservative mixing analysis and a hydrograph separation method according to their study the contribution rate of preferential flows ranges from 11 to 51 of the total flow as long as an agricultural drainage network is in place our results are in agreement with their finding thus indicating that on average 18 i e 1 α of the total available nitrate for leaching is exported from the model compartment fc responsible for preferential transfers in this paper rnbw values were estimated through different temporal calibration intervals and compared with the measurements in order to assess the model robustness and accuracy thus the rnbw values estimated on multiannual and global calibration periods are comparable to the measurements however the annual estimated values of rnbw show some exceptions fig 6 due mainly to a significant degree of freedom and data heterogeneity leading to equifinality issues table 3 in general less than 5 kgn ha year was recorded as the difference between rnbw measurements and estimations this difference is considered insignificant compared to the average imprecision calculated in the n surpluses in agricultural soils according to poisvert et al 2017 in fact the uncertainty in n surpluses considered in their study reached 45 kgn ha 1 year 1 despite the diversity of their dataset taking into account nitrogen balances over 70 years and based on agricultural soils distributed over more than 90 departments in france in addition the difference between the observations and the simulations of nitrate exportations n losses according to the nit drain model does not exceed 0 6 kgn ha 1 per year related to an rmse of 0 06 kgn ha 1 and 0 1 kgn ha 1 using drainage discharge observations and simulations as inputs respectively this result is considered encouraging when compared with other model outputs indeed malone et al 2010 obtained rmse values of 5 15 kgn ha 1 and 9 03 kgn ha 1 respectively when simulating nitrate losses from their two field experiments in addition one should take into consideration the existing difference between areas covering the rnbw measurements 5915 km² seine et marne department and estimations 3 55 km² rampillon the availability of rnbw measurements at a local scale may be useful to consolidate the accuracy of our results in all cases we recommend the use of multiannual calibration intervals including both dry and wet seasons in order to limit the solution possibilities and ensure the uniqueness of parameter and rnbw values an annual calibration framework was carried out to access the model performance and the inter annual variability of the inputs according to moriasi et al 2015 an nse value greater than 0 35 is considered as satisfactory in the case of nitrate concentration no3 modeling the model approach presented in this study shows nse values ranging from 0 52 to 0 91 which confirms the ability of the model to simulate faithfully nitrate concentrations by using rnbw and drainage discharge observations as input data the use of the rnbw variable can be viewed as a strong indicator that could provide a good estimation of the soil nitrate load in subsurface drained agricultural lands at the beginning of the winter season the annual model calibration shows different variability levels of the parameters indeed the sharing α and soil depth p3 coefficients show the lowest variability while the other parameters may require further investigations to limit their temporal variation in general the performance obtained with the annual calibration remains satisfactory and promising in regard to nitrate concentration simulations a sensitivity analysis sa can help to understand in depth the impact of these parameters on the model performance pianosi et al 2016 the nit drain parameter values were also estimated using the sst and global calibration methods the result is consistent with the one obtained using annual calibration and confirms the robustness of the model this positive performance should be further consolidated by testing the spatial robustness of the model jeantet et al 2021 lindström et al 2010 the model testing on additional data fields that involve variable spatial scales and soil proprieties could be useful for confirming the spatial robustness of the parameters such as those related to the soil proprieties e g vl i nitrate transfer velocities the nit drain was also tested on a daily time step using drainage discharge simulation as input data the measured data e g drainage discharge nitrate flux and concentrations were aggregated from hourly into daily time step in order to allow for the use of simulated discharge as model input instead of observed discharge the results show that simulations of nitrate concentrations are strongly dependent on the accuracy of the simulated drainage discharge values indeed fig 7 shows that the model outputs i e nitrate concentrations are highly sensitive to the error resulting from the low values of drainage discharge simulated at the beginning of the hydrological season in particular on the one hand the use of simulated drainage discharge increases the total mean relative error of nitrate concentration simulations versus observations by 10 e g 8 when using qobs up to 18 with the use of qsim on the other hand one can observe that nitrate flux is correctly simulated and less exposed to discharge discrepancies in comparison with nitrate concentrations table 5 this finding was expected since the error on drainage discharge has a direct impact on nitrate concentrations at the same time the discrepancy related to nitrate flux simulations is lower due to the combined and mitigated effect of discharge and nitrate concentration errors hence while several water quality models focus on nitrate flux simulations instead of concentrations ale et al 2013 gowda et al 2012 motarjemi et al 2021 santhi et al 2001 the nit drain model shows a significant ability to correctly simulate both flux and nitrate concentrations 7 conclusion this paper describes the new conceptual model called nit drain the model is able to simulate up to hourly nitrate exportations from agricultural drained lands using a limited number of inputs the nit drain model needs the calibration of seven parameters which manage the nitrate quantity and velocity transferred between the three defined conceptual reservoirs the adopted approach has been tested and validated using data obtained from the fully drained agricultural catchment of rampillon 355 ha the dataset covers 6 years of nitrate and drainage discharge observations at the hourly time step the model robustness was tested by calibrating the input parameters according to the available observations of nitrate concentrations through different time scales i e annual multiannual over the entire dataset period these tests showed an accurate model simulation of nitrate flux and concentrations at the drainage system outlet in addition high consistency between the parameter values was observed by using either multiannual or global calibration frameworks one of the key points of this modeling approach is the correct simulation of the nitrate flushing and dilution patterns through the consideration of both preferential and matrix flows indeed we focused on the best assessment of the preferential flow since several recent studies emphasized the significant role of macropores which supports the occurrence of this type of flow the derived approach allows the nit drain model to switch correctly between different nitrate transfer processes in addition the total residual quantity of nitrate in the three conceptual model reservoirs by the end of february constitutes a valuable indicator to farmers this information can help them to modulate the nitrate input depending on the available mineral nitrogen of the soil at this period otherwise the spring fertilization supply will be taken into consideration in a future work by estimating the nitrate quantity of the soil during the spring season using variational data assimilation approach chelil et al 2022 in some cases the temporal variability of the model parameters has been noted when using the annual calibration framework this issue is common to several conceptual models and can be resolved by improving the model structure or by applying further constraints to the model including high frequency observations and local rnbw measurements finally the spatial robustness of the model should be investigated through the

9397,agricultural pollution due to excessive land fertilization affects the quality of both surface and ground water this paper presents a conceptual and reservoir based model that simulates the time variation of nitrate concentrations no3 at the outlet of a subsurface drainage network referred to herein as nit drain the model is based on a simplified scheme of water and nitrate transfer processes by decomposing the soil profile located between the drain and the mid drain into three interconnected and conceptual compartments hence the fast transfer throughout the macroporosity located above the pipe is described by the first compartment while the low and residual nitrate transfers are managed by the two other compartments the model assumes that all seasonal nitrogen transformations at the field scale lead to the remaining pool of nitrate available for leaching at the beginning of the winter season rnbw this variable is updated by the model at the beginning of each hydrological year the nit drain model requires two input data the measured or simulated drainage discharge and the rnbw seven parameters were introduced to manage nitrate leaching and water flow through the three soil compartments using two different transfer functions the calibration and validation step c v was performed to assess the performance of the model in reproducing the nitrate concentration observations acquired at rampillon 355 ha data for 6 years located east of paris france the results showed performance criteria of kge greater than 0 5 and of rmse less than 5 mgno3 l which confirm the ability of the model to simulate the observed nitrate concentrations with a good agreement the annual model calibration framework implemented to assess the parameter variability confirms the model stability and consistency however the use of simulated drainage discharges as input underlines the need to reproduce with accuracy the earlier low discharge values by the drainage model the innovative management of nitrate transfer through the conceptual compartments based on the annual update of the rnbw variable enables the simulation of the nitrate concentrations with a high performance using a limited number of input data in addition the periods of flushing and dilution are clearly identified by the nit drain model thanks to the accurate estimation of the nitrate storage variation inside each model compartment graphical abstract ga1 keywords nitrate modeling nitrate concentrations agricultural drainage conceptual modeling nitrate leaching preferential flow 1 introduction nitrogen n is available in agricultural soils in different compositions the one most easily assimilated by crops is the nitrate ion no3 nitrate contributes to crop growth and to improved crop yield fertilizers mainly composed of nitrate are spread periodically over agricultural land to maintain the required quantity of nitrate for crop development however a considerable increase of nitrate leaching to rivers and aquifers leading to water resource pollution was observed when the amount of nitrate available in the soil exceeded the actual need of the crop agrawal et al 1999 almasri and kaluarachchi 2004 billen et al 2013 kumazawa 2002 lassaletta et al 2014 the practice of agricultural drainage through the installation of buried perforated pipes or open ditches is widely used in land suffering from frequent winter soil waterlogging in order to eliminate the excess of water thus agricultural drainage aims to increase crop yields mohtadullah 1990 and allows for better access to fields by farmers although this practice has existed for several thousands of years beauchamp and pavelis 1987 the installation of drainage networks has been greatly intensified in the last few decades this may be linked to some negative aspects such as the faster transfer of agricultural pollutants to the drain outlet schilling et al 2012 scholefield et al 1993 skaggs et al 1994 zhi and li 2020 the reduction in pollutants leaching e g nitrate from agricultural drained lands has been supported by the european water framework directive dce directive 1991 since the beginning of the 21st century hence several studies have been conducted around this topic dinnes et al 2002 suggested a set of strategies to mitigate nitrate leaching from agricultural drained soils such as the use of controlled drainage and the optimization of the timing amount spread of fertilizers by considering the n turnover features and by testing the nitrogen availability of the soil prior to any fertilizer application magdoff et al 1990 furthermore the late spring soil nitrate test lsnt could be useful for assessing the available quantity of nitrate and for reducing nitrate loss at the end of the spring season jaynes et al 2004 the same approaches could be used to estimate the remaining quantity of nitrate pool in the soil for the autumn season typically at this period cover crops are commonly not observed bare soils resulting in a greater potential for nitrate leaching after the first few rain events hansen and djurhuus 1996 kirchmann et al 2002 the use of winter cover crops can limit nitrate losses significantly meyer et al 2020 2018 from an agronomical standpoint bockstaller et al 2021 have evaluated the potential of nitrate leaching based on the cover crop concept and agronomical modeling the latter requires the availability of crop rotation data and local measurements of nitrogen soil storage in this paper the terminology remaining pools of nitrate at the beginning of the winter season rnbw refers to the potentially leachable quantity of nitrate initially trapped in the soil profile between the topsoil and drains depth at the beginning of each winter season compared with the lsnt rnbw field sampling has an environmental focus rather than an economic one salomez and hofman 2002 therefore a limited frequency sampling of the rnbw essentially due to the expensive acquisition fees makes these data scarce most of the time clay et al 1997 this fact has led to studies of the potential relationship between nitrate concentrations and surpluses arlot 1999 oenema et al 1998 to allow for the estimation of the nitrate available for leaching based on nitrate concentration data in the past several papers focused on tracer experimentations to describe solute transfer through shallow soil depths utermann et al 1990 and gaur et al 2006 consider the existing vertical connection between the unsaturated and the saturated zones of the soil by using appropriate transfer functions while kohler et al 2003 separate the subsurface soil into two conceptual compartments to describe the preferential and matrix flow paths one can note that preferential flows occur near the drain location while a residual matrix flow is a horizontal transitional flow between the mid drain and the drain outlet the decomposition of the solute movement over the agricultural drainage soil porosities and the consideration of the dual permeability modeling approach have been widely investigated by the research community frey et al 2016 gerke and maximilian köhne 2004 richard and steenhuis 1988 a set of modeling experiments have been conducted using the physically based hydrus 2d model simunek et al 1999 to approach the solute transfer velocities between the soil surface and the drain outlet paris 2004 thus a significant decrease in the solute travel time at the proximity of the tile drain has been noticed suggesting the necessity to consider both preferential and residual soil matrix flows kjær et al 2011 observed similar solute transport pathways when the chloride tracer experiment was conducted on a 1 26 ha tile drained agricultural area in denmark in addition a relatively recent review by jacobsen and kjær 2007 indicates that rapid solute transport is observed when macropores are located near the drain outlet noting that water flow pathways depend on hydraulic conditions and soil structure and proprieties as well today high frequency nitrate concentration samplings 1 h are carried out in order to ensure better monitoring and obtain more information on the intraday nitrate behavior such experiments require the use of automatic sensors providing up to sub hourly chemographs burns et al 2019 liu et al 2020 which could be expensive time consuming and involve at least one qualified operator the use of water quality modeling might represent an alternative way to simulate the substantial lack of data e g soil nitrate concentrations or to estimate the temporal variation of the soil nitrate pool different modeling approaches are described in the literature payraudeau 2002 conceptual water quality modeling is commonly considered as a simplification of the existing and complex physical and biogeochemical processes that need advanced knowledge on the interaction between the different ecosystem components by contrast process based models require a large dataset to operate due to the consideration of complex nutrient interactions and transfer processes through multiple soil layers moriasi et al 2012 provide a detailed technical description of 25 hydrologic and water quality models e g simulated processes spatial and temporal scale open source code or not one can identify process based crop models taking into account the data on farming practices to estimate crop yield and nutrient exportations the biogeochemical dndc model li et al 1992a b enables the estimation of carbon sequestration and nitrogen denitrification while a newly updated version of this model includes a better description of the drainage hydrology smith et al 2020 an objective comparison of rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 and dndc modeling predictive performances indicates that rzwqm2 is more suitable for greenhouse gas emissions and water continent simulations jiang et al 2020 one can note the stics model brisson et al 2003 which is decomposed on a set of modules managing crop growth soil water and nitrogen balances based on climatic and agronomic input data a recent application of stics using 34 years of experimental data collected at the fagnières site in france confirms its satisfactory performance in simulating the nitrate flux yin et al 2020 moreover tournebize et al 2004 adapted the stics model to consider the subsurface drainage modeling accordingly process based models e g dndc stics require a large number of data crop data in particular puech et al 2020 propose the spatial distribution of crop data at the regional scale however the scarcity of such data at a large scale could be considered a hindrance to wider uses in addition the dynamic assessment of the amount of potentially leachable nutrients toward groundwater and rivers is often poorly described finally the statistically based model nutting n enables a good estimation of nitrate loads and eutrophication risk using a limited number of input data dupas et al 2013 2015 while detailed local model inputs are however needed to enhance the performance of the regionalized model semi distributed hydrological models taking into account drainage and water quality processes such as hype lindström et al 2010 or swat g arnold et al 2012 make it possible to simulate nitrate losses with a good performance however they still require the introduction of spatially distributed data which are difficult to collect for most application cases other modeling approaches focused on the identification of the concentration flow c q relationship either at one rainfall event or at the seasonal scale using empirical equations arlot 1999 liu et al 2020 tunqui neira et al 2020 the c q relationship is difficult to handle for the whole nitrate leaching cycle including both flushing and dilution patterns agricultural subsurface drainage models are specifically developed to design drainage networks and to enhance the comprehension and the assessment of both drainage discharge behavior and nutrient transport the drainmod nii process based model is based on the water balance calculation to simulate the drainage discharge and it uses the most important components of the nitrogen cycle to predict nitrogen dynamics and turnover youssef et al 2005 skaggs et al 2012 the process based model adapt gowda et al 2012 which considers the macrospore flow transfer is derived from the combination of the drainage model drainmod skaggs et al 2012 and the water quality model gleams leonard et al 1987 both the drainmod nii and the adapt models performances have been investigated by ale et al 2013 the two models show very similar performances in terms of water and nitrate leaching simulation under large time steps e g months and years arlot 1999 noted the complexity of the interaction between biogeochemical and hydraulic processes assuming that biogeochemical interactions can be neglected in winter due to the low soil temperatures e g 8 c in the north of france hence arlot 1999 has proposed the use of hydraulic processes including essentially the nitrate transfer pathway and velocity through the soil porosities to simulate nitrate leaching in the agricultural drainage context selecting the appropriate model depends on the study purpose on input data availability and on computing resources the choice of model can be a tricky and complex task in some cases end users may look at some objective indicators to guide their choice including the identification of the nature and the availability of the model inputs simulation efficiency and model parsimony perrin et al 2001 moreover developing parsimonious water quality models can become a difficult task hence the use of a stepwise prioritization approach might lead to the simplification of some complex physical processes as indicated by tang et al 2019 the main objective of this study is to develop and validate a new conceptual nitrate model applied in the context of agricultural subsurface drainage the modeling approach considers the flushing and dilution patterns using the nitrate data at hourly and daily time steps the model structure takes into account 1 the preferential flow transfer which describes fast and vertical nitrate infiltration above the drain location and 2 the soil matrix flow highlighting the residual low and lateral nitrate transfer achieved between the mid drain and the drain location in addition to the non consideration of the n turnover processes arlot 1999 we assume that the major components of the nitrogen cycle might be gathered in one annual input variable rnbw the model requires a limited number of input data and parameters first the model is validated based on hourly observed drainage discharge data second the nitrate concentration error resulting from the use of daily drainage discharge simulations i e derived from a validated drainage model instead of observations inputs is assessed accordingly 2 study site and experimental data the experimental set up is in the rampillon catchment 355 ha located upstream of the ancœur agricultural catchment 132 2 km² 70 km southeast of paris france 03 03 37 300e 48 32 16 700 n fig 1 the soil is mainly of luvisol type mander et al 2021 tournebize et al 2012 and lies on a shallow impermeable layer due to the clay accumulation typical of french waterlogging soils these two conditions support the presence of a shallow water table which affects crop growth by reducing the yield and the quality of the harvest both a large part of the ancœur catchment 80 and the whole rampillon area have been subsurface drained since 1980 to prevent frequent winter soil saturation tournebize et al 2012 the drainage network consists of perforated pvc pipes spaced 10 m apart and buried at about 90 cm deep allowing for better soil tillage and a satisfactory crop yield it is noteworthy that 98 of the total area is tilled mainly following the crop rotation winter wheat sugar beet corn beans and rape fig 2 thus one can distinguish winter crops e g winter wheat winter barley and rape from spring crops e g corn sugar beet beans the winter wheat and barley are generally sown in october and harvested in early july while corn is sown in april and harvested in october in this agricultural setup using catch crops could be very helpful in limiting excessive nitrate leaching meyer et al 2018 on average 150 kgn year of mineral fertilizer is applied three times end of february end of may and end of june the average values of corn and wheat yield reported between 2013 and 2017 by agreste survey are of 9 7 t ha and 8 3 t ha respectively https agreste agriculture gouv fr four seasons are available in the studied region including a winter marked by relatively low temperatures t 3 c the local climate is oceanic and temperate with a mean annual temperature and rainfall of 10 5 c and 689 mm respectively the rampillon experimental set up consists of a continuous measurement of subsurface drainage discharge and water quality parameters at the catchment outlet a doppler flowmeter sigma 950 hach was installed to record hourly drainage discharge values and a multiparameter spectrophotometer spectrolyser uv vis s can was implemented for hourly measurements of nitrate concentrations rainfall data were obtained by means of a local pluviometer installed at the study site the potential evapotranspiration pet data are extracted from the safran database vidal et al 2010 at the daily time step pet data values are calculated following the penman monteith formula and converted into hourly time steps using a gaussian distribution with 12 p m at the top and 6 a m at the bottom the nitrogen soil metrics are extracted from the annual dashboard which is provided by aquibrie https www aquibrie fr publications tableau de bord 2016 2017 the local field sampling of the soil profile using a soil auger was conducted between 2014 and 2018 at the end of the autumn season in order to measure the remaining nitrogen pools rnbw in fact nitrate storage in the study soils covers several agricultural parcels and crop turnover at the scale of the seine et marne department 5915 km2 thus the mean rnbw values are obtained by surface weighting the local measured values for typical crop plots a summary of the 6 years of data collected between 2014 and 2020 at the rampillon experimental set up is presented in table 1 one can distinguish 2017 2018 as a wet season with more than 900 mm of rainfall that generates 485 mm of cumulative drained water the 2016 2017 season was typically dry with less than 90 mm of cumulative drained water thus a low quantity of drained water in this dry year shows a high average nitrate concentration this contrast in terms of weather supports the reliability of our study the yearly mean surface weighted values of rnbw range between 49 and 78 kgn ha 1 year 1 generally the main nitrate flux exportations are observed during the winter months i e between september and february according to kladivko et al 1991 and depending on the spring rainfall amount the part of the nitrate flux observed from march to september does not go beyond 10 of the total cumulative exportations in addition low temperatures are observed during the winter season which tends to limit the impact of the nitrate processes other than leaching thus only data extracted between september and february are included to simulate nitrate concentrations 3 model description the nit drain model nitrate drainage aims to simulate nitrate concentrations at the scale of subsurface drainage parcels collecting water from one or several agricultural fields based on global and conceptual approaches the model is driven by a set of assumptions 1 rnbw values are estimated by the model to approximate the initial quantity of nitrate available for leaching at the beginning of the winter season 2 all biogeochemical processes affecting n turnover are neglected due to the low temperatures in the winter season and a weak crop n uptake 3 the high amount of nitrate exportations during the winter season kladivko et al 1991 added to the significant impact of spring fertilizations on the nitrate balance during the spring season led us to consider only the winter period for nitrate simulations 4 nitrate removal processes inside drains are reduced to zero low time of residence 5 no deep n losses pipes lying on an impervious layer or surface runoff are considered henine et al 2022 the model is designed to be simple and robust with the use of a limited number of input data and parameters the drainage discharge decomposed on highflow and baseflow is used as model input three conceptual reservoirs interconnected by three transfer functions are implemented to describe the water and nitrate transfer in the soil profile extending between the drain and the mid drain the modeling approach highlights the nitrate flushing and dilution patterns through the consideration of contrasting nitrate transfer velocities i e fast and slow transfers more details on the model approach and structure are described in the sections that follow 3 1 conceptual soil reservoirs the reservoir based approach used in the nit drain model is derived from the pestdrain and tammodel modeling concepts branger et al 2009 steenhuis et al 1997 here a similar modeling approach is adopted to estimate and assess the dynamic of the nitrate leaching from drained soil profiles thus one can consider three conceptual reservoirs to describe the nitrate transfer in the soil using specific transfer functions f1 f2 and f3 fig 3 the first and the second reservoirs i e superficial slow compartment overlaying deep slow compartment referred to as ssc and dsc respectively describe the slow solute transfer kjær et al 2011 paris 2004 the third conceptual reservoir i e the fast compartment referred to as fc is designed to describe the fast solute transfer occurring above the drain mainly through preferential flows rnbw is considered as an input variable and its amount is updated at the beginning of each hydrological year the rnbw value is split using the parameter α between the fc and the ssc as follows 1 rnbw s 1 0 s 2 0 s 1 0 1 α rnbw s 2 0 α rnbw α 0 1 where s 1 0 and s 2 0 are respectively the initial amount of leachable nitrate contained inside compartments fc and ssc at the beginning of each hydrological season 3 2 consideration of the flushing dilution patterns several studies and review papers have described and identified the nitrate flushing and dilution patterns at either seasonal or storm event scales arlot 1999 burns et al 2019 minaudo et al 2019 ruiz et al 2002 the methods involved highlight the existing link between the discharge and the concentration of pollutants using transfer functions burns 1974 magesan et al 1994 unnikrishna et al 1995 or by considering c q relationship liu et al 2021 minaudo et al 2019 these approaches describe the correct simulation of nitrate concentrations at the scale of one rainfall event however there are very scarce models that can correctly simulate both the event and the seasonal flushing dilution patterns of nitrate concentrations moreover existing models involve the use of a large number of parameters and low frequency observations data which potentially limit the identification of the extreme variations of nitrate concentrations occurring at small timeframes the flushing pattern process represents the abrupt increase of nitrate concentrations during a flooding event fig 4 this behavior is observed at the beginning of the drainage season i e following the first drainage discharge events the high nitrate quantity available on shallow soil depths during this specific period of the year is related to its previous post harvest accumulation the latter is mostly due to the increase in nitrogen mineralization following high temperatures and the absence of a potential catch crop during the summer season the dilution pattern process generally occurs when a flooding event generates a decrease in nitrate concentrations fig 4 although concentrations are lower dilution patterns are usually presented following the leaching of a large part of nitrate i e initially trapped in the top soil layers at the beginning of the drainage season or after significant fertilizer applications hence flushing patterns are mainly provided by the compartment fc at the beginning of the drainage season describing fast nitrate transfer velocities where dilution patterns are essentially managed by compartments ssc and dsc characterizing slow nitrate transfer velocities 3 3 flow decomposition to consider the slow and fast nitrate transfers several research results indicate the significant contribution of the baseflow to the annual nitrate flux exportation jordan et al 1997 schilling and zhang 2004 schilling et al 2012 spahr et al 2010 the nit drain model considers the distribution of the nitrate transfer velocities between the drain and the mid drain by decomposing the drainage discharge data simulated or observed at the drain outlet into two parts hence one can consider the baseflow separation techniques such as the one proposed by eckhardt 2005 hereinafter the simplified linear formula eq 2 is used to separate the total drainage discharge value we assume that the baseflow q b drives the nitrate transfer from the superficial and deep slow soil reservoirs ssc and dsc respectively whereas the highflow q p describes the nitrate transfer from the fast soil reservoir fc 2 q t t q p t q b t q p t 1 β q t t q b t β q t t where β and 1 β terms represent the parts of the drainage discharge moving through the slow compartments i e ssc dsc and the fast compartment fc respectively the empirical β parameter is fixed to 0 33 after testing several value combinations which means that the baseflow part is assumed to constitute one third of the total drainage discharge 3 4 description of the model transfer functions the quantity of nitrates transferred through subsurface drained soils depends on both the water flow and the nitrate available for leaching at different soil layers arlot 1999 otherwise water flow in the soil enables the mobilization and the transfer of nitrate through the soil porosity toward the drain outlet the solute movement and redistribution through the different soil compartments could be described using appropriate transfer functions burns s transfer function eq 3 a facilitates the prediction of nitrate leaching by assuming a uniform initial distribution of nitrate quantity on a given soil profile burns 1974 1975 1976 this function is generally applied to describe vertical solute transfers in soils the latter has been implemented in the 1d lixim model mary et al 1999 to predict the nitrate mineralization in bare soils hence burns s equation has been applied for wet drained soils showing preferential flow moreover the pestdrain model branger et al 2009 considers the exponential transfer function eq 3 b described in magesan et al 1994 and derived by jury and roth 1990 in addition the exponential formulation is known as the most adapted transfer function for modeling the subsurface drained flow according to arlot 1999 the nit drain model considers both the burns and the magesan leaching functions illustrated by eq 3 a and b respectively to simulate the nitrate transfer from the three conceptual reservoirs to the drain outlet hence burns s function characterizes preferential nitrate transfers from the fc reservoir to the drain while the exponential function describes the lateral nitrate transfer in soil first from the ssc to the dsc reservoir and then from the dsc to the drain outlet 3 x l d d θ f c 100 z a x l θ l θ 0 1 e x p d z θ l b where x l represents the fraction of solute leached below the soil layer depth z θ fc θ l and θ 0 are respectively the volumetric water content at field capacity the leaching porosity and the initial volumetric water content in eq 3 d corresponds to the cumulative drained water volume expressed in the steady state regime given the small model time step hours days we suppose that flow rates q b t and q p t correspond to a succession of steady state flow that form the transient flow regime branger et al 2009 these two equations are then adapted to define the leaching functions f1 f2 and f3 eqs 4 5 and 6 the latter calculates the nitrate flux transferred from the ssc dsc and fc compartments respectively 4 f 1 t s 2 t p 1 1 exp q b t vl 1 5 f 2 t dn t p 2 1 exp q b t vl 2 6 f 3 t s 1 t q p t q p t θ p 3 in eqs 4 and 5 we introduce vl 1 z 1 θ l and vl 2 z 2 θ l as the part of soil porosity contributing to nitrate transfer

describe the soil depth related to reservoirs ssc dsc and fc respectively s 1 t s 2 t and d n t constitute the temporal evolution of the nitrate quantity stored in the fc ssc and dsc soil reservoirs

total nitrate flux f t by the total drainage discharge q t t 8 no 3 f t q t t nitrate mass balance is preserved by updating the quantity of nitrate at the time step t 1 for each soil reservoir eq 9 9

parameters to be calibrated and one input variable rnbw to be estimated 4 model evaluation strategy the validation of the new nit drain model is based on the assessment of the nitrate concentration simulations against the available observations 4 1 model calibration and validation three steps i ii and iii are considered in order to evaluate the model performance and the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations for each step the model parameters are calibrated using the grg gradient and iterative descent algorithm lasdon et al 1978 this algorithm searches for the optimal solution starting from arbitrary values of parameters we note the annual rnbw value estimations using the same iterative approach i based on nitrate concentration observations the model parameters and the rnbw values are optimized yearly in order to assess their stability and consistency each modeled hydrological period begins in september and ends in february of the next year in all six parameter sets are calibrated corresponding to the 6 years of data hence the variability of the parameters indicates the degree of robustness of the model ii the model evaluation is performed using the split sample test klemeš 1986 by dividing the whole of the observed data table 1 into two equivalent periods p1 and p2 the period p1 corresponds to the three 3 years of data 2014 2017 while p2 covers the years between 2017 and 2020 for each period the model is run in turns for both calibration and validation we note the calibration of the model parameters based on the whole period of interest 2014 2020 for comparison purposes in addition rnbw values are specific to each hydrological year their values should be estimated accordingly on september 1st of each simulated year for both calibration and validation periods iii the potential of the nit drain model to perform using drainage discharge simulations instead of observations is investigated hence the nitrate model will run under a daily time step to be in accordance with the daily drainage discharge outputs simulated by the selected agricultural drainage model in this study the simulated drainage discharges are derived from the sidra ru model henine et al 2022 jeantet et al 2021 as we plan to couple the two models i e nit drain and sidra ru in a future work this step is included in order to provide a more detailed overview of the impact of discharge simulation mismatches on the quality of the nitrate simulations 4 2 objective criteria all parameters were estimated simultaneously using the well known nse objective criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse values range from to 1 and require data on both simulated and observed nitrate concentrations eq 10 nse value close to 1 indicates that the simulations are strongly fitted to the observations in addition to nse used here as the principal performance criteria the following metrics are calculated in order to consolidate the performance results obtained the kling gupta efficiency kge criteria gupta et al 2009 ranging from to 1 eq 11 and the root mean square error rmse kenney and keeping 1962 ranging between 0 and eq 12 10 nse 1 t 1 t t x t x t ² t 1 t t x t x

respectively x t and x t are defined as the mean values of the observations and the simulations respectively throughout the whole period of interest t note that cov x t x t refers to the covariance between x t and x t while σ indicates the standard deviation note also the use of relative ξ rel and absolute ξ abs error formulas eq 13 in order to describe the discrepancy between observations x and simulations x of respectively nitrate concentrations and discharge 13 ξ abs x x ξ rel x x x lastly the coefficient of variation cv is calculated to assess the variability of the yearly calibrated parameters this statistical standardized index is obtained by dividing the standard deviation σ by the average value µ of the parameter of interest 14 cv σ µ 100 5 results this section reports the simulation performance results obtained by the nit drain model using three evaluation methods first the model calibration based on nitrate concentration observations is performed year per year over the entire dataset period in order to evaluate the annual variability of the model parameters then the model is evaluated over a wider time scale using the split sample test in order to check the efficiency and the robustness of the nitrate concentration simulations finally the model performance is assessed using drainage discharge simulations as input data instead of observations 5 1 model assessment based on annual calibration annual model calibration based on hourly observations of nitrate concentrations is performed over the six hydrological years ranging from september 1st 2014 to february 5th 2020 fig 5 shows the modeling behavior of nitrates for the 2017 2018 hydrological season in a we compare the observed nitrate concentrations with the simulated nitrate concentrations the flushing and dilution periods are separated by the vertical dashed line in b we highlight the linear correlation between observed and simulated nitrate concentrations showing a value of r² 0 83 based on fig 5 a and fig 5 b one can note the well simulation of nitrate concentrations in addition the corresponding metrics listed in table 3 e g nse 0 83 and kge 0 86 objectively confirm the high quality of the model simulations in c we illustrate the temporal nitrate exportations from the fc and dsc soil reservoirs while the temporal evolution of the nitrate storage in each of the three conceptual reservoirs i e fc ssc and dsc fig 3 is presented in d from fig 5a and d we observe that the nitrate transfer switches from a flushing to a dilution pattern i e separation by the dashed vertical lines when the nitrate quantity stored in the dsc reservoir overtakes the one available in the fc reservoir the change in the nitrate pattern may occur at the beginning of the intensive drainage season ids note that the ids is reached when the soil profile is fully saturated by water lesaffre 1988 thus the high quantity of nitrate which is initially stored in the surface layer of the soil i e corresponding to the fc reservoir in the model is in large part exported by the first flows of the season this pattern leads to the fast emptying of the fc conceptual soil reservoir giving way to the gradual introduction of nitrate dilution phenomena headed by the deep slow soil reservoir dsc this behavior can be confirmed by the data in fig 5c where the significant nitrate exportations from the fast soil reservoir fc decrease with time resulting in a gradual increase of nitrate exportations from the deep slow reservoir dsc this result stresses the importance of preferential flows occurring above the drains after the first winter rainfall the annual calibrated parameters and the corresponding estimated rnbw values are reported in table 3 along with their respective nse and kge metrics one can see that the p 3 and α parameters present the lowest values of cv i e 4 3 and 19 5 respectively this result means that these two parameters did not show a high variability between seasons thus the mean values of p 3 and α could be considered as references the coefficient of variation related to the other parameters remains lower than 100 however such a degree of variability requires further advanced analysis e g sensitivity analysis to identify the impact of each parameter on the model response we note that the wet and dry seasons e g 2019 2020 and 2016 2017 respectively table 1 tend generally to show a contrasted values of α i e high and low values for wet and dry seasons respectively the resulting performances indicated by means of nse and kge indices confirm the high quality of the nitrate concentration simulation in addition the calculated mismatches between simulated and observed cumulative nitrate exportations i e δf get closer to zero for the overall calibrated years the corresponding rmse value remains less than 0 06 kgn ha 1 year 1 which confirms the ability of the model to reproduce faithfully the observations 5 2 model assessment using the split sample test approach two model calibration tests were carried out the first test consists in calibrating the model parameters on the entire dataset period i e 2014 2020 while the second consists in using the split sample test sst to assess the robustness of simulations over the two equivalent subperiods p1 2014 2017 and p2 2017 2020 this second test enables the consideration of the disparity and heterogeneity coming from the temporal variation of the discharge and nitrate data in drained agricultural soils the two calibration tests are based on the hourly observations of nitrate concentrations at the drainage network outlet table 4 combines the parameter sets and metric values resulting from both the sst model calibration and validation a and the full sample test fst calibration b the good model performance obtained from the two tests is noteworthy the corresponding kge and nse values extend to 0 84 and 0 74 respectively in the calibration period and up to 0 70 and 0 66 respectively in the validation period however one can identify the relatively satisfactory kge and nse values for the p2 validation period this short drop in performance could be mainly assigned to the data variability of period p1 which is much drier as compared with p2 the kge and nse listed in table 4 refer to the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations in fact nitrate flux simulations show a systematically high performance e g nse and kge 0 9 thus the model calibration and validation could be considered as successfully completed a graphical comparison between simulated and observed nitrate concentrations in the periods p1 and p2 is presented in figure a 1 and figure a 2 see the supplemental material section the calibrated parameter values in p1 in p2 and in the total period remain robust and are comparable with those obtained by the annual calibration framework table 3 rnbw values are estimated under the three model evaluation strategies e g annual calibration sst and fst calibration see section 4 1 it is important to note that one value of rnbw is estimated per season by the model the bar graph presented in fig 6 indicates the six estimated rnbw values according to each calibration strategy carried out the rnbw surface weighted values ranging from 49 to 78 kgn ha 1 year 1 table 1 and fig 6 remain consistent with the estimated values by the nitrate model fig 6 except for the 2014 2015 season the rnbw measurements are close to the average of the estimations i e less than 5kgn ha 1 year 1 of mismatch the calculated rnbw values are of the same order regardless of the estimation approach some exceptions should be noted such as the marked difference between the estimated rnbw values using annual calibration and those estimated using sst or global calibrations i e underestimated for 2015 2016 and overestimated for the 2016 2017 dry season 5 3 model assessment using simulated drainage discharge this section shows the impact of the discharge input source on the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations we note the use of the nit drain parameters calibrated over the entire period of data see section 5 2 table 4 part b hence we focus on the quantification of the error in nitrate simulations resulting from the use of simulated discharges instead of observed discharges as input data the satisfactory performance obtained when simulating the drainage discharge using the sidra ru model is noteworthy indeed the rmse value corresponds to 1 16 mm per day when nse and kge are equal to 0 53 and 0 78 respectively the nit drain model performance i e rmse nse and kge corresponding to the use of drainage discharge simulations as input are presented in table 5 on the one hand a significant impact is observed on the performance e g δnse 1 31 when simulating nitrate concentrations using simulated discharges sidra ru model output instead of observed discharges on the other hand the performance of the nit drain is less impacted in the case of nitrate flux simulations e g δnse 0 41 fig 7 shows the monthly amplitude of the generated absolute errors on discharge purple boxplots and relative errors on nitrate concentration simulations green and orange boxplots in comparison with their respective observations green boxplots describe the relative errors of nitrate concentration simulations when using discharge observations as model input in this case the monthly distribution of the relative error does not exceed 30 conversely significant error up to 60 can be noted when using the drainage discharge simulations as input data in the nitrate model orange boxplots this experiment is conducted in order to have a more detailed view concerning the seasonal distribution of the error of both nitrate concentrations and drainage discharges errors obtained on low drainage discharge leading to small nitrate flux values i e observed at the beginning of the drainage season have a substantial impact on the quality of the nitrate concentration simulations the opposite is observed during the intensive drainage season from december to february where a relatively significant error in drainage discharge simulations has only a small impact on the quality of nitrate concentrations moreover fig 8 shows the hourly variation of the simulated a drainage discharge b nitrate flux and c nitrate concentrations against their respective observations blue lines for the 2017 2018 hydrological year nitrate flux and concentrations are systematically well simulated when using observed discharges as input for the nitrate model green lines otherwise the first months of the drainage season are marked by worse nitrate simulations when replacing the drainage discharge observations by simulations red lines in addition an overestimation of nitrate concentrations red lines is observed during the intensive drainage season i e december to february these results suggest that the low drainage discharge values may have a significant impact on nitrate concentration modeling but less so for flux simulation which is in agreement with the results presented in fig 7 this is particularly applicable at the beginning of the drainage season when the soil is highly loaded with nitrate 6 discussion the nit drain modeling approach has been designed to enable the simple description of the nitrate transfer in the soil profile toward the drain the model requires the rnbw data and the drainage discharge as inputs to simulate nitrate concentrations and flux at the agricultural drainage outlet the nit drain modeling approach is based on the decomposition of the subsurface soil profile into three interconnected and conceptual reservoirs hence two transfer functions were considered from the literature to allow for the nitrate movement between these three defined reservoirs this approach was tested and validated over the 6 years of hourly observation data collected from the experimental agricultural field of rampillon this study focused on the improvement of nitrate concentration modeling this variable remains much more challenging than nitrate flux modeling which has been addressed in a number of studies to date the originality of the model lies in the fact that no process other than nitrate lixiviation is considered hence we have assumed the nitrogen processes during the winter season to be negligible e g nitrate denitrification mineralization or assimilation by plants due to the low temperatures and the fast flow transfer velocities caused by the presence of tile drainage this led us to limit the simulation to the non growing season ranging between september and february thus the results confirm that only hydraulics are responsible for nitrate exportations during this period moreover the importance of the non growing season has been stressed by ren et al 2022 indeed this period has been identified as critical in terms of water and nutrient losses due to the low values of evapotranspiration and plant uptake according to ren et al 2022 this period of the year is responsible for the main water and nitrate exportations through the tile drain in addition the study conducted by liu et al 2020 showed that the top 27 of the drainage discharge generally occurring during the non growing season contributes to 75 of the total nitrate exportations the nit drain model makes it possible to consider both flushing and dilution patterns on the one hand the flushing episodes are observed when the superficial soil is loaded with a significant quantity of nitrate thus leading to the occurrence of the preferential nitrate transfer above the drain location on the other hand dilution episodes emphasize the low lateral nitrate transfer characterized by a significant residence time the data analysis indicates that the wet years tend to show significant dilution episodes while the dry years are usually characterized by frequent flushing episodes according to the nit drain model flushing patterns are due to the high nitrate exportations from the fast compartment fc typically observed during the first flow events of the drainage season fig 5c thus the fc compartment becomes almost completely empty when rainfall infiltrations leached most of the nitrate initially available at low soil depths in this period of the year the residual nitrate concentrations exported with water from the ssc and dsc low compartments are mixed with the lightly nitrate loaded water coming from the fc compartment this transfer mode promotes the occurrence of dilution patterns in general our modeling approach enables an accurate shifting between flushing and dilution patterns which involves preferential and matrix flow contributions respectively several studies have shown the significant contribution of preferential flow due to the presence of soil macropores above the tile drain location thus multiple conceptual models have been implemented while considering a dual permeability approach frey et al 2016 gerke and maximilian köhne 2004 in addition stone and wilson 2006 highlighted the role of preferential flow pathways through the consideration of a conservative mixing analysis and a hydrograph separation method according to their study the contribution rate of preferential flows ranges from 11 to 51 of the total flow as long as an agricultural drainage network is in place our results are in agreement with their finding thus indicating that on average 18 i e 1 α of the total available nitrate for leaching is exported from the model compartment fc responsible for preferential transfers in this paper rnbw values were estimated through different temporal calibration intervals and compared with the measurements in order to assess the model robustness and accuracy thus the rnbw values estimated on multiannual and global calibration periods are comparable to the measurements however the annual estimated values of rnbw show some exceptions fig 6 due mainly to a significant degree of freedom and data heterogeneity leading to equifinality issues table 3 in general less than 5 kgn ha year was recorded as the difference between rnbw measurements and estimations this difference is considered insignificant compared to the average imprecision calculated in the n surpluses in agricultural soils according to poisvert et al 2017 in fact the uncertainty in n surpluses considered in their study reached 45 kgn ha 1 year 1 despite the diversity of their dataset taking into account nitrogen balances over 70 years and based on agricultural soils distributed over more than 90 departments in france in addition the difference between the observations and the simulations of nitrate exportations n losses according to the nit drain model does not exceed 0 6 kgn ha 1 per year related to an rmse of 0 06 kgn ha 1 and 0 1 kgn ha 1 using drainage discharge observations and simulations as inputs respectively this result is considered encouraging when compared with other model outputs indeed malone et al 2010 obtained rmse values of 5 15 kgn ha 1 and 9 03 kgn ha 1 respectively when simulating nitrate losses from their two field experiments in addition one should take into consideration the existing difference between areas covering the rnbw measurements 5915 km² seine et marne department and estimations 3 55 km² rampillon the availability of rnbw measurements at a local scale may be useful to consolidate the accuracy of our results in all cases we recommend the use of multiannual calibration intervals including both dry and wet seasons in order to limit the solution possibilities and ensure the uniqueness of parameter and rnbw values an annual calibration framework was carried out to access the model performance and the inter annual variability of the inputs according to moriasi et al 2015 an nse value greater than 0 35 is considered as satisfactory in the case of nitrate concentration no3 modeling the model approach presented in this study shows nse values ranging from 0 52 to 0 91 which confirms the ability of the model to simulate faithfully nitrate concentrations by using rnbw and drainage discharge observations as input data the use of the rnbw variable can be viewed as a strong indicator that could provide a good estimation of the soil nitrate load in subsurface drained agricultural lands at the beginning of the winter season the annual model calibration shows different variability levels of the parameters indeed the sharing α and soil depth p3 coefficients show the lowest variability while the other parameters may require further investigations to limit their temporal variation in general the performance obtained with the annual calibration remains satisfactory and promising in regard to nitrate concentration simulations a sensitivity analysis sa can help to understand in depth the impact of these parameters on the model performance pianosi et al 2016 the nit drain parameter values were also estimated using the sst and global calibration methods the result is consistent with the one obtained using annual calibration and confirms the robustness of the model this positive performance should be further consolidated by testing the spatial robustness of the model jeantet et al 2021 lindström et al 2010 the model testing on additional data fields that involve variable spatial scales and soil proprieties could be useful for confirming the spatial robustness of the parameters such as those related to the soil proprieties e g vl i nitrate transfer velocities the nit drain was also tested on a daily time step using drainage discharge simulation as input data the measured data e g drainage discharge nitrate flux and concentrations were aggregated from hourly into daily time step in order to allow for the use of simulated discharge as model input instead of observed discharge the results show that simulations of nitrate concentrations are strongly dependent on the accuracy of the simulated drainage discharge values indeed fig 7 shows that the model outputs i e nitrate concentrations are highly sensitive to the error resulting from the low values of drainage discharge simulated at the beginning of the hydrological season in particular on the one hand the use of simulated drainage discharge increases the total mean relative error of nitrate concentration simulations versus observations by 10 e g 8 when using qobs up to 18 with the use of qsim on the other hand one can observe that nitrate flux is correctly simulated and less exposed to discharge discrepancies in comparison with nitrate concentrations table 5 this finding was expected since the error on drainage discharge has a direct impact on nitrate concentrations at the same time the discrepancy related to nitrate flux simulations is lower due to the combined and mitigated effect of discharge and nitrate concentration errors hence while several water quality models focus on nitrate flux simulations instead of concentrations ale et al 2013 gowda et al 2012 motarjemi et al 2021 santhi et al 2001 the nit drain model shows a significant ability to correctly simulate both flux and nitrate concentrations 7 conclusion this paper describes the new conceptual model called nit drain the model is able to simulate up to hourly nitrate exportations from agricultural drained lands using a limited number of inputs the nit drain model needs the calibration of seven parameters which manage the nitrate quantity and velocity transferred between the three defined conceptual reservoirs the adopted approach has been tested and validated using data obtained from the fully drained agricultural catchment of rampillon 355 ha the dataset covers 6 years of nitrate and drainage discharge observations at the hourly time step the model robustness was tested by calibrating the input parameters according to the available observations of nitrate concentrations through different time scales i e annual multiannual over the entire dataset period these tests showed an accurate model simulation of nitrate flux and concentrations at the drainage system outlet in addition high consistency between the parameter values was observed by using either multiannual or global calibration frameworks one of the key points of this modeling approach is the correct simulation of the nitrate flushing and dilution patterns through the consideration of both preferential and matrix flows indeed we focused on the best assessment of the preferential flow since several recent studies emphasized the significant role of macropores which supports the occurrence of this type of flow the derived approach allows the nit drain model to switch correctly between different nitrate transfer processes in addition the total residual quantity of nitrate in the three conceptual model reservoirs by the end of february constitutes a valuable indicator to farmers this information can help them to modulate the nitrate input depending on the available mineral nitrogen of the soil at this period otherwise the spring fertilization supply will be taken into consideration in a future work by estimating the nitrate quantity of the soil during the spring season using variational data assimilation approach chelil et al 2022 in some cases the temporal variability of the model parameters has been noted when using the annual calibration framework this issue is common to several conceptual models and can be resolved by improving the model structure or by applying further constraints to the model including high frequency observations and local rnbw measurements finally the spatial robustness of the model should be investigated through the implementation of validation tests using data from various agricultural catchment sizes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9398,water scarcity is a prevailing problem that constrains crop production in many regions worldwide the application of deficit irrigation strategy is a reliable approach which may contribute to some degree to overcome the problem of global water scarcity a two year study was conducted to assess the effects of timing and severity of the deficit irrigation on yield water productivity wp and yield response factor ky of potato in 2018 the treatments included 100 v100 of crop evapotranspiration et 50 v50 100 reduction of et until end of tuber initiation 50 v100 50 reduction of et during the middle of tuber bulking up to maturity stage and no irrigation following plant establishment v0 in 2019 the treatments included v100 and v0 as in the previous year deficit irrigation at 50 of et di50 partial root zone drying prd at 75 or 50 of et applied during the whole growing season deficit irrigation at a reduced rate of 50 of et crop during the first part of the crop cycle v50 100 strongly depressed total yield while limiting irrigation water for the last part of the crop cycle v100 50 did not induce significant losses in yield deficit irrigation positively affected water productivity especially with v100 50 suggesting that water efficiency was closely related to the growth stage than to the available water in the soil in 2019 reducing water to 75 of v100 with prd75 did not significantly affect tuber yield while the further reduction in the irrigation water with prd50 or di50 resulted in a substantial yield decrease although the same amount of water was applied to both treatments the reduction in yield was 41 with di50 compared to 28 with prd50 where the latter proved to be superior in maintaining yield however an appreciable increment in wp was observed with both prd treatments unless the water stress is too high to depress the yield the sensitivity of potato to water stress was more remarkable when water was applied at individual growth stages than at different severities in contrast potatoes have been tolerant to both stress timing and severity in total dry matter these results showed that using deficit irrigation late of the season or with prd can improve water saving minimize yield losses and consider optimal strategies for drip irrigated potatoes in the arid regions keywords water stress potato yield water productivity yield response factor 1 introduction potato is an economically important national and international crop and it s often heavily irrigated and fertilized to meet the quality standards demanded by the market the production of potatoes has increased dramatically in developing countries in the past two decades and it is now a part of daily food for almost all the world population birch et al 2012 for example in egypt potato is grown on 0 177 million hectares with 5 200 million tons of production resulting in 29 29 tons hectare of yield fao 2019 however it is a drought sensitive crop hence deficit irrigation may be difficult to be managed because reductions in tuber yield and quality can result from even brief periods of water stress following tuber set karam et al 2014 crosby and wang 2021 consequently before using deficit irrigation strategies it is crucial to obtain adequate information about the relationships between yield and the timing and severity of water deficit this information helps predict the crop yield and optimize irrigation water allocation during the whole growing season and more when the available water is insufficient to cover the crop water demand the growing competition for water resources between agriculture and other sectors may force the adoption of irrigation strategies in arid regions that can save irrigation water while maintaining satisfactory levels of yield production costa et al 2007 in many areas of the world irrigation has been practiced recently with disregard to basic principles of resource preservation soil and water management is most likely the best choice in most agricultural systems for increasing the efficiency of water use badr et al 2012 sun et al 2015 however agriculture is one of the largest water consuming sectors for several reasons including the lack of irrigation efficiency at the field level and the need for large amounts of water to irrigate crops throughout the year under the conditions of climatic changes and high temperatures since the beginning of 2018 egypt has been implementing a project to expand modern irrigation systems in all lands of the valley and delta and new lands suitable for modern irrigation systems which depends on replacing flood irrigation with modern irrigation systems in this context the egyptian ministry of water resources and irrigation hopes to cover 1 554 million hectares of plantations with modern less water consuming irrigation systems such as the drip and sprinkler irrigation system afrika 2021 the process of crop water use has two main components of water losses evaporation from the soil and the plant or evapotranspiration et and all the losses resulting from the distribution of water to the soil fereres and soriano 2007 thus water losses are unavoidable and must be minimized with efficient irrigation methods and appropriate management reducing crop et without a penalty in crop production is much more complex however because evaporation from crop canopies is tightly coupled with the assimilation of carbon du et al 2006 liu et al 2008 a recent positive approach to improving wp in agriculture is conventional deficit irrigation di however irrigation necessitates precise control over the timing and amount of water deficit so that water deficits can be applied when they have the most negligible impact on yield partial root zone drying prd is a special form of di where only half of the root zone is irrigated alternatively in scheduled irrigation events liu et al 2006 prd irrigation has been tested for field crops and fruit trees kang and zhang 2004 practical results showed that crops under prd yielded better than under di when the same amount of water was applied this contrasts with regular di where savings in irrigation application have often been at the expense of yield this resulted in higher water productivity and even better fruit quality kirda et al 2007 liu et al 2006 badr et al 2018 research into the physiological changes that occur under prd during water stress has led to improve understanding of plant response to stress in terms of chemical signals passing from roots to leaves in most cases prd irrigation has shown a potential to increase wp and maintain yield jovanovic et al 2010 the adoption of deficit irrigation requires knowledge on the response of the different crops to water stress applied at various growth stages and the whole growing season reduction in yield due to water stress can be expressed by the relation between the relative yield reduction and the relative et reduction doorenbos and kassam 1979 estimate that the average value of ky is 1 1 during the potato growing season ayas and korukcu 2010 found crop yield response factor ky of potatoes was 0 909 for the entire growth period while darwish et al 2006 found the ky values of processing potatoes were 0 80 for the same growth period ayas 2013 experimented on potato crops and found a ky of 1 13 for the total growing period he also found the ky of 0 00 0 94 1 16 1 19 and 1 11 for 100 75 50 25 and 0 pan coefficients respectively however yield response differed largely depending on the growth stage and the water stress severity according to vaux and pruitt 1983 ky may also be affected by other factors such as crop species soil conditions and prevailing climatic in the region the aims of the present study were to i test yield response of potatoes when they subjected to deficit irrigation ii calculate the yield response factor ky based on plant growth stages and during the growing season to show water stress tolerance changes in relation to different irrigation regimes and iii assess an irrigation strategy that ensures water savings in parallel with maintaining yield to select the better irrigation criteria for potato production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description the experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 at nubaria research station on the west side of nile valley of egypt latitude 30 30 n

along each row all treatments received the same amount of phosphorus 150 kg p ha 1 as single super phosphate in addition 250 kg k ha 1 as potassium sulphate was incorporated into the soil beds before transplanting nitrogen fertilizer was applied as a solution of ammonium nitrate in the water soluble form at seven days intervals corresponding to 340 kg ha 1 of n using a venturi tube injector the plants were arranged in plots 2 m wide 10 m long giving a total area of 20 m2 for each plot in 2018 the potato was planted in single rows 75 cm apart with plant spacing 30 cm within the rows to a density of about 40 000 plants ha 1 in 2019 the tubers were planted at the same row spacing and distance to create the same plant population in the two experiments in the prd treatments in which half of the root zone was irrigated while the other half was dried out the irrigation was alternated between the two sides of the rows at two weeks intervals 2 4 crop water balance meteorological data were calculated from the weather station of the central laboratory of agricultural climate for nubaria province located 500 m away from the experimental site the irrigation water was applied daily according to the soil water balance formula etc et0 kc proposed by allen et al 1998 the actual crop evapotranspiration rate etc was based on the product of et0 and crop coefficient kc for different

wetted of the crop root zone as a percentage of the total crop area cumulative et crops for the different irrigation treatments and the relative quantity of water saving during the growing period were presented in table 2 during the initial growth stage potatoes were irrigated daily to encourage the establishment but irrigation frequency ran at two day intervals the irrigation process was ceased at 120 dap 15 days before harvest to prevent secondary growth harvested of matured potato was done on the 14th of 2018 and 16 of january 2019 respectively 2 5 measurements of crop parameters maximum biomass production was determined by harvesting one representative plant per treatment replicate at 120 dap shoot and tuber tissues were separated and dried at 70 c in a forced air oven for dry weight determination plant growth components were determined from 15 randomly selected plants in each plot including total fresh tuber yield tuber number per plant and average tuber size per plant harvesting of the potato was made on the second week of jan in both years total fresh tuber yield was recorded on 20 plants in a row in each treatment and replications the data are presented as a ton per hectare 2 6 water productivity water productivity kg mm is an indicator related to the water consumed by crops as et to produce a certain yield and calculated for each irrigation treatment as follows wp yield t ha 1 applied water mm 2 7 yield response factor the functional relationship between crop yield and water use is called the water production function ratio of actual to maximum et that limits the crop yield assuming that all the other factors are at the optimum level seasonal values of the yield response factor ky were calculated for each experimental year as follows 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm 1 where ym kg ha 1 and ya kg ha 1 are maximum that obtained from fully irrigated treatment and actual yield respectively etm mm ha 1 and eta mm ha 1 are maximum that obtained from fully irrigated treatment and actual evapotranspiration respectively ky is the yield response factor that is defined as the decrease in yield per unit decrease in et stewart et al 1977 according to ky calculation kss was calculated by the equation 1 replacing ym with maximum total dry biomass ssm and ya with actual total dry biomass ssa as follows 1 ssa ssm kss 1 eta etm 2 where kss indicates the biomass response factor which is the correlation factor between relative total dry biomass loss and relative et reduction 2 8 statistical analysis all data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova appropriate to the experimental design to evaluate the effects of treatments on potato yield total dry biomass shoot dry weight average tuber weight and wp costat version 6 311 cohort usa 1998 2005 was used to conduct the analysis of variance treatment means were compared using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 probability level 3 results 3 1 climate trend and irrigation variables although most potato plants grow and produce in different seasons they can grow better in cooler weather particularly in the mediterranean during the growth season the climate parameters differed from september to december where the most significant differences were recorded in november and december for both temperature and relative humidity at this site nubaria the climatic conditions are ideal for potato production especially at this time of the year it is possible to point out a scarce rainfall without adequate amounts during the cropping cycle total rainfalls recorded during the cropping cycle were 15 and 23 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively the air temperature was higher during the first part of the cycle in september when the max temperatures were consistently over 33 c afterwards in october the daily min and max temperatures decreased and followed the same trend till the end of december though typical for this area the described climate parameter reduced crop water use due to low daily et0 from the planting to harvest it made a clear difference in the comparative irrigated regimes 3 2 tuber yield and total biomass potato yield varied significantly under different timing of deficit irrigation applied in 2018 table 3 full irrigation supply v100 resulted in the highest yield however there was a significant reduction in total yield when applying less water during the first part of the crop cycle v50 100 conversely no significant difference was observed between potato well irrigated and potato irrigated with the limitation of irrigation water for the last part of the crop cycle v100 50 although nearly the same amount of water was applied for both treatments the decreases in yield were 20 3 and 8 6 with irrigation water savings of 23 and 21 for v50 100 and v100 50 respectively as compared to v100 total tuber yield was proportional to total dry biomass production r 2 0 98 demonstrating that the crop regulates its tuber biomass to total biomass cumulated therefore total dry biomass was strongly depressed by the early soil water deficit v50 100 while deficit irrigation at the last part of the crop cycle v100 50 induced lower losses in dry biomass overall harvest index hi hi fruit dry weight total aboveground dry weight at harvest changes under different irrigation regimes hi declined significantly in response to v50 100 0 63 while it was 0 67 under v100 50 irrigation treatment the average tuber weight per plant decreased in v50 100 and the trend was similar to the tuber yield although a considerable variation in average tuber weight was observed the correlation analysis between tuber yield and average tuber weight showed a solid correlation r2 0 99 indicating that changes in the yield were mainly affected by tuber weight total yield and dry biomass were drastically depressed by soil water deficit under v0 when a very early cut of irrigation was applied since many tubers did not enlarge enough under drier conditions in the second year 2019 some higher rainfall was observed but did not modify the total water per treatment all deficit irrigation treatments used a constant irrigation water application rate throughout the season the deficit irrigation treatments di50 and prd50 significantly reduced tuber yield by 41 and 28 respectively relative to v100 although nearly the same level of water was applied for both treatments on the other hand prd75 did not significantly reduce tuber yield and total dry matter but irrigation water saving of 25 was achieved compared to v100 as shown in 2018 tdw was also proportional to total tuber yield r 2 0 97 in 2019 indicating that the severity of water stress influenced total dry matter the average tuber weight per plant for the prd75 was closer to that of the v100 however both values were significantly higher than those for di50 and prd50 treatments as shown in the previous year 2018 total yield and dry biomass were drastically depressed by soil water deficit under v0 which produced minimal tuber size however higher rainfall occurred in this year helped to some extent to produce a higher yield relative to the previous year the results also showed that compared to v100 deficit irrigation with prd75 increased tuber dry weight data not shown and maintained tdw content which improved hi than any other deficit irrigation treatments 3 3 water productivity and production function the values of water productivity calculated on a total fresh yield basis were positively affected by deficit irrigation treatments table 3 in 2018 wp increased with water shortage and its maximum value corresponded to irrigation treatment v100 50 which enhanced wp by 12 2 versus 3 4 for v50 100 treatment this result suggests that the crop can still benefit from the water when this last is supplied to fulfill crop water demand in 2019 when water was reduced by 25 and 50 during extended periods of both prd75 and prd50 wp was higher by 26 and 35 over the v100 in both treatments respectively although the di50 treatment had the same level of water input as prd50 the use later attained superior effect in maintaining crop yield as an effective strategy for water saving in potatoes the production function total amount of applied irrigation water vs fresh tuber yield through linear regression analysis a mathematical function showed a significant determination factor r 2 0 98 and 0 93 for 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 1 over the range of water inputs from 340 262 and 330 180 mm between planting and harvest potato yield increased by 145 and 150 kg ha 1 for each mm of water applied for 2018 and 2019 respectively 3 4 yield response factor the yield response factor ky quantifies the sensitivity of potato yield to the water deficit during the whole growing season for the year 2018 the higher ky factor 0 87 was found in v50 100 while the lower value 0 43 for the same parameter was found in v100 50 respectively table 4 the higher ky value for v50 100 close to one indicates to the sensitivity of potato to early soil water deficit in 2019 ky was 0 32 with a 25 irrigation deficit under prd75 treatment while further increase in deficit irrigation to 50 with di50 and prd50 the ky factor was appreciable higher 0 91 and 0 62 for both treatments respectively however calculate this coefficient for plant total dry matter rather than tuber yield the same behavior was observed in both years as the total dry matter decreased by increasing the water deficit the values of kss were markedly less than the values observed with tuber yield which indicates the emergence of drought tolerance on the other hand the relationships between 1 ya ym and 1 eta etm for the different irrigation treatments were well fitted using a linear regression forced to the origin with the regression coefficients of 0 97 and 0 93 for yield and tdw in 2018 and 0 89 and 0 81 in 2019 respectively fig 2 the test of significance of regression coefficients showed that the yield response factor was significant p 0 05 for both years however the sensitivity of potato to water stress was more significant when the latter was applied at different timing during 2018 ky 1 05 than at different severities during 2019 ky 0 92 while in terms of total dry matter kss the potato is less sensitive to both stress timing 0 98 and severity 0 82 for both years respectively 4 discussion 4 1 tuber yield and water saving strategy crops sensitive to water stress such as potatoes require a standard irrigation method to prevent the soil water deficit from falling below a certain threshold level under a specific crop and soil condition maximum productivity for potatoes occurs when the soil is kept consistently moist making it one of the most critical factors influencing production ferreira and goncalves 2007 during the time course of water stress evaluation in 2018 potatoes seemed to be more sensitive to the time of deficit irrigation imposed early than in the late part of the season the difference being significant in favor of the late deficit irrigation although both treatments almost received the same amount of water table 2 this might be due to the plants exposed to early water stress cannot restore the loss of growth in the following stages even when water is fully available once again the same severe depressive effects of early water stress upon yield are widely reported in the literature for potatoes as it substantially reduces tuber initiation bulking and tuber yield evers et al 2010 obidiegwu et al 2015 the tuber bulking stage is a critical period that determines a large part of tuber yield where sucrose at this phase moves from the leaves to the tubers and is converted to starch and the tubers accumulate water nutrients and carbohydrates king et al 2003 this finding was also similar to the previous studies that providing full irrigation through mid bulking followed by a slow reduction in irrigation amounts was the best scenario for reducing yield losses when water supply was limited stark et al 2013 harvest index hi also declined in response to v50 100 treatment 0 64 which was associated with decreased biomass partitioning to the tubers and yield reduction on the other hand hi was higher 0 67 under the v100 50 treatment which was related to favorable growth conditions enhanced by initial canopy development greater water use and crop dry biomass however when water resources are limited the timing of deficit irrigation prior to the ripping stage and once the plant had developed its vigorous vegetative growth would result in the least reductions in yield moreover such technology can make the difference in maintaining a high yield while saving more water to irrigate other crops in the second year 2019 with the prd technique reducing water by 25 of full irrigation under prd75 did not significantly affect tuber yield but an appreciable amount of water saving was achieved compared to full irrigation the water saving benefits of prd have been justified to consider this technique without reducing yield significantly this technique secured the absence or an only limited reduction in yield where it can be assumed that no water deficit was imposed on the growing plants further reduction in the volume of water applied through the di50 and prd50 increased the water stress to the plants with a concomitant yield reduction but the latter would cause less reduction therefore this appears to be a viable option for reducing the amount of water used while keeping adequate yields positive effects of partial root zone irrigation have been shown in many crop species previous studies have shown that under the condition of prd the roots in the dry soil compartment sense soil drying and generate continuous chemical signals mainly aba these signals reduce stomatal conductance and leaf expansion as found in wheat ali et al 1998 maize bahrun et al 2002 soybean liu et al 2003 potatoes liu et al 2006 and tomatoes holbrook et al 2002 moreover the prd technique may cause a better utilization of soil water reserves by promoting root growth although root growth was not measured in our study several studies have shown that prd increases root depth and root density mingo et al 2004 songsri et al 2008 in addition a higher root hydraulic conductivity was also found locally by restriction of water supply kang and zhang 2004 on the other hand differences in moisture distribution in the soil profile between prd and di50 have been reviewed by dodd 2009 and xie et al 2012 the possible mechanism responsible for the positive effects of prd may include inducing a compensatory effect of water uptake jarvis 2011 thus the roots in the wet side increase water uptake and compensate little uptake from the dry side upholding the plant s full transpiration rate improving uptake of mineral nutrients and enhancing nutrient recovery in plants kirda et al 2007 wang et al 2013 the wetting side of the plant has a plentiful supply of water and therefore the plant never became stressed as a deficit of conventional irrigation methods however the reduction of the irrigation water was partially compensated by more efficient exploitation of the available soil water indicating that the prd technique had a higher yield benefit than regulating di50 at the same water level knowing the link between yield and water use is critical for determining the economic value of crop production and sustaining crop profitability however when the level of under irrigation may cause lower yield relative to full irrigation the provision of irrigation water may offset this reduction and allow an expansion for the area under cultivation to grow more crops 4 2 deficit irrigation sustain wp the main goal of irrigation is to gain maximum production per unit of applied water which can be attained by adopting a suitable irrigation strategy potato is considered one of the higher water consumption crops alva et al 2012 badr et al 2010 as to the supplemental irrigation treatments both restricted irrigation regimes in 2018 produced higher wp values than the full irrigation treatment table 2 however v100 50 increased wp markedly compared to v50 100 as a discreet soil water deficit was late in the season in addition the plants underwent moderate stress mainly as they reached full ground cover which preserves the soil surface against evaporation similarly deficit irrigation under both prd treatments in 2019 induced significant increases in wp as soil water content remained well and alternative water applied was able to reduce the soil water deficit wang et al 2012 furthermore accumulated evidence has shown that prd could significantly improve the wp of potatoes liu et al 2006 and different crops kirda et al 2007 consistent with this in the present study wp was higher in both prd treatments than in di50 or any other treatment table 3 several possible reasons are responsible for the increase of wp for the plants under prd induced water stress however those plants under mild water deficit may be able to perform one or more of the following i partial stomatal closure may have reduced water use while maintaining crop net photosynthesis as stomatal resistance is the primary controlling resistance for transpiration topcu et al 2007 badr et al 2020 ii reduce luxury transpiration loss without or with a minimal impact on photosynthesis yang et al 2012 iii improve moisture distribution across the soil profile and reduce potential evaporation due to decreased evaporative surface areas exposed by the partial root zone irrigation approach xie et al 2012 4 3 potato is sensitive to deficit irrigation the crop yield response factor indicates how the plant can tolerate water stress the relationship between potato yield and et is helpful to assess the strength of the relationship between variables where relative yield increased linearly with relative seasonal et cantore et al 2014 camargo et al 2015 the yield response factor ky varies mainly depending on the growth stage growth season and severity of the water deficit the ky factor was proportionally less than the relative et deficit the value exceeds one when yield declines proportionally to et deficit the differential influence of the water deficit during various growth stages on potato yield indicated that ky was higher and close to one in v50 100 versus lower ky value of the water deficit in v100 50 indicating that potato yield was sensitive to water deficit at the early stage of growth table 4 however in deficit irrigation regimes the water stress of a particular growth stage may have a cumulative effect on the subsequent growth stages therefore the overall yield reduction of the crop may not be restored in the later stages many studies have shown that water deficit early in the season was the critical stage for potato cultivation doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported that ky for the early vegetative late vegetative yield formation and ripening stage was 0 45 0 80 0 70 and 0 20 respectively in this respect due to the definite nature of the potato crop tubers ripening occurred simultaneously irrigation during the second part of tuber bulking that comprises tuber ripening coincided with the least sensitive phenological stages to water stress as the water deficit would not strongly affect them jovanovic et al 2010 mila and ali 2016 other studies have shown that the seasonal crop yield factor ky of potato was 0 91 ayas and korukcu 2010 while darwish et al 2006 found the ky value of processing potato was 0 80 for the entire growth period on the other hand calculating this coefficient as referred to plant tdm rather than yield it could be notice that the values of kss were markedly lower than ky for both years this result indicates a different behavior of the total dry matter towards exposure to water deficit the water regime effect on assimilating distribution and on yield components may explain the difference concerns this behavior hi does not significantly change in the deficit irrigated treatments 0 62 0 67 compared to 0 68 in full irrigation from these data it emerges that water stresses significantly reduced the weight of tubers in this species while the other production components were not or little influenced moreover the effect of water stress on the production of total dry matter in the plant was relatively less than the effect on the tuber yield due to the high percentage of dry weight content about 20 in the plant compared to some other vegetable crops the linear model regression analysis best fitted the relationship of relative yield with relative seasonal et indicating that relative yield increased linearly with relative seasonal et fig 2 this linear model supports the trend of the previous equations in both years for different irrigation treatments however the results obtained in our experiment show that the ky and kss observed in 2018 were higher than those observed in 2019 indicating that stress timing has more detrimental effect on potatoes than stress severity for this reason it is advisable to use an irrigation strategy based on partial restoration of water demand during the entire growing season for potatoes finally although potato with a ky close to unity pointed out some sensitivity to water stress with appreciably yield decrement but higher substantial stability or increment of wp was observed thus this crop adapts well to deficit irrigation scheduling criteria and is concomitant with economic sustainability that can maintain crop yield under different irrigation regimes 5 conclusions to cope with scarcity of water supplies deficit irrigation scheduling based on plant growth stages and throughout the growing season was imposed on potato plants the limitation of irrigation water for the last part of the crop cycle showed water stress tolerance and contributed remarkable towards improving wp in contrast deficit irrigation early in the season resulted in a significant unsustainable decrease in potato yield the prd strategy imposed during the whole growing season allowed more efficient use of water coupled with the least yield reduction compared to full irrigation as a result prd could also guarantee relatively higher yield and improve wp compared to regular deficit irrigation a proper application of deficit irrigation may contribute to obtaining a good compromise between yield and water saving this aspect is essential where water scarcity and the continuously rising irrigation costs are growing concerns in arid regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9398,water scarcity is a prevailing problem that constrains crop production in many regions worldwide the application of deficit irrigation strategy is a reliable approach which may contribute to some degree to overcome the problem of global water scarcity a two year study was conducted to assess the effects of timing and severity of the deficit irrigation on yield water productivity wp and yield response factor ky of potato in 2018 the treatments included 100 v100 of crop evapotranspiration et 50 v50 100 reduction of et until end of tuber initiation 50 v100 50 reduction of et during the middle of tuber bulking up to maturity stage and no irrigation following plant establishment v0 in 2019 the treatments included v100 and v0 as in the previous year deficit irrigation at 50 of et di50 partial root zone drying prd at 75 or 50 of et applied during the whole growing season deficit irrigation at a reduced rate of 50 of et crop during the first part of the crop cycle v50 100 strongly depressed total yield while limiting irrigation water for the last part of the crop cycle v100 50 did not induce significant losses in yield deficit irrigation positively affected water productivity especially with v100 50 suggesting that water efficiency was closely related to the growth stage than to the available water in the soil in 2019 reducing water to 75 of v100 with prd75 did not significantly affect tuber yield while the further reduction in the irrigation water with prd50 or di50 resulted in a substantial yield decrease although the same amount of water was applied to both treatments the reduction in yield was 41 with di50 compared to 28 with prd50 where the latter proved to be superior in maintaining yield however an appreciable increment in wp was observed with both prd treatments unless the water stress is too high to depress the yield the sensitivity of potato to water stress was more remarkable when water was applied at individual growth stages than at different severities in contrast potatoes have been tolerant to both stress timing and severity in total dry matter these results showed that using deficit irrigation late of the season or with prd can improve water saving minimize yield losses and consider optimal strategies for drip irrigated potatoes in the arid regions keywords water stress potato yield water productivity yield response factor 1 introduction potato is an economically important national and international crop and it s often heavily irrigated and fertilized to meet the quality standards demanded by the market the production of potatoes has increased dramatically in developing countries in the past two decades and it is now a part of daily food for almost all the world population birch et al 2012 for example in egypt potato is grown on 0 177 million hectares with 5 200 million tons of production resulting in 29 29 tons hectare of yield fao 2019 however it is a drought sensitive crop hence deficit irrigation may be difficult to be managed because reductions in tuber yield and quality can result from even brief periods of water stress following tuber set karam et al 2014 crosby and wang 2021 consequently before using deficit irrigation strategies it is crucial to obtain adequate information about the relationships between yield and the timing and severity of water deficit this information helps predict the crop yield and optimize irrigation water allocation during the whole growing season and more when the available water is insufficient to cover the crop water demand the growing competition for water resources between agriculture and other sectors may force the adoption of irrigation strategies in arid regions that can save irrigation water while maintaining satisfactory levels of yield production costa et al 2007 in many areas of the world irrigation has been practiced recently with disregard to basic principles of resource preservation soil and water management is most likely the best choice in most agricultural systems for increasing the efficiency of water use badr et al 2012 sun et al 2015 however agriculture is one of the largest water consuming sectors for several reasons including the lack of irrigation efficiency at the field level and the need for large amounts of water to irrigate crops throughout the year under the conditions of climatic changes and high temperatures since the beginning of 2018 egypt has been implementing a project to expand modern irrigation systems in all lands of the valley and delta and new lands suitable for modern irrigation systems which depends on replacing flood irrigation with modern irrigation systems in this context the egyptian ministry of water resources and irrigation hopes to cover 1 554 million hectares of plantations with modern less water consuming irrigation systems such as the drip and sprinkler irrigation system afrika 2021 the process of crop water use has two main components of water losses evaporation from the soil and the plant or evapotranspiration et and all the losses resulting from the distribution of water to the soil fereres and soriano 2007 thus water losses are unavoidable and must be minimized with efficient irrigation methods and appropriate management reducing crop et without a penalty in crop production is much more complex however because evaporation from crop canopies is tightly coupled with the assimilation of carbon du et al 2006 liu et al 2008 a recent positive approach to improving wp in agriculture is conventional deficit irrigation di however irrigation necessitates precise control over the timing and amount of water deficit so that water deficits can be applied when they have the most negligible impact on yield partial root zone drying prd is a special form of di where only half of the root zone is irrigated alternatively in scheduled irrigation events liu et al 2006 prd irrigation has been tested for field crops and fruit trees kang and zhang 2004 practical results showed that crops under prd yielded better than under di when the same amount of water was applied this contrasts with regular di where savings in irrigation application have often been at the expense of yield this resulted in higher water productivity and even better fruit quality kirda et al 2007 liu et al 2006 badr et al 2018 research into the physiological changes that occur under prd during water stress has led to improve understanding of plant response to stress in terms of chemical signals passing from roots to leaves in most cases prd irrigation has shown a potential to increase wp and maintain yield jovanovic et al 2010 the adoption of deficit irrigation requires knowledge on the response of the different crops to water stress applied at various growth stages and the whole growing season reduction in yield due to water stress can be expressed by the relation between the relative yield reduction and the relative et reduction doorenbos and kassam 1979 estimate that the average value of ky is 1 1 during the potato growing season ayas and korukcu 2010 found crop yield response factor ky of potatoes was 0 909 for the entire growth period while darwish et al 2006 found the ky values of processing potatoes were 0 80 for the same growth period ayas 2013 experimented on potato crops and found a ky of 1 13 for the total growing period he also found the ky of 0 00 0 94 1 16 1 19 and 1 11 for 100 75 50 25 and 0 pan coefficients respectively however yield response differed largely depending on the growth stage and the water stress severity according to vaux and pruitt 1983 ky may also be affected by other factors such as crop species soil conditions and prevailing climatic in the region the aims of the present study were to i test yield response of potatoes when they subjected to deficit irrigation ii calculate the yield response factor ky based on plant growth stages and during the growing season to show water stress tolerance changes in relation to different irrigation regimes and iii assess an irrigation strategy that ensures water savings in parallel with maintaining yield to select the better irrigation criteria for potato production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description the experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 at nubaria research station on the west side of nile valley of egypt latitude 30 30 n

experiment 2 2 experimental design and treatments nine irrigation treatments were conducted over 2 years based on crop evapotranspiration et to evaluate deficit irrigation timing in 2018 and severity 2019 on yield performance of potato grown under field conditions table 2 in the first year four irrigation treatments included full irrigation received water demand at 100 of crop et through the whole

establishment in the second year five irrigation treatments included full irrigation v100 and v0 as in the previous year regulated deficit irrigation di and two partial root zone drying prd the di treatment received 50 of the full irrigation while prd treatments received 75 or 50 of full irrigation during the growing season the different irrigation treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates for each treatment in both years 2 3 cultural practices potato seed tubers solanum tuberosum l cultivar diamond was planted on 1st september each year before planting a drip irrigation system with a twin wall gr 15 mm inner diameter in line drippers at 40 cm distance delivering 2 5 litre h 1 at operating pressure 100 kpa was installed in the field along each row all treatments received the same amount of phosphorus 150 kg p ha 1 as single super phosphate in addition 250 kg k ha 1 as potassium sulphate was incorporated into the soil beds before transplanting nitrogen fertilizer was applied as a solution of ammonium nitrate in the water soluble form at seven days intervals corresponding to 340 kg ha 1 of n using a venturi tube injector the plants were arranged in plots 2 m wide 10 m long giving a total area of 20 m2 for each plot in 2018 the potato was planted in single rows 75 cm apart with plant spacing 30 cm within the rows to a density of about 40 000 plants ha 1 in 2019 the tubers were planted at the same row spacing and distance to create the same plant population in the two experiments in the prd treatments in which half of the root zone was irrigated while the other half was dried out the irrigation was alternated between the two sides of the rows at two weeks intervals 2 4 crop water balance meteorological data were calculated from the weather station of the central laboratory of agricultural climate for nubaria province located 500 m away from the experimental site the irrigation water was applied daily

wetted of the crop root zone as a percentage of the total crop area cumulative et crops for the different irrigation treatments and the relative quantity of water saving during the growing period were presented in table 2 during the initial growth stage potatoes were irrigated daily to encourage the establishment but irrigation frequency ran at two day intervals the irrigation process was ceased at 120 dap 15 days before harvest to prevent secondary growth harvested of matured potato was done on the 14th of 2018 and 16 of january 2019 respectively 2 5 measurements of crop parameters maximum biomass production was determined by harvesting one representative plant per treatment replicate at 120 dap shoot and tuber tissues were separated and dried at 70 c in a forced air oven for dry weight determination plant growth components were determined from 15 randomly selected plants in each plot including total fresh tuber yield tuber number per plant and average tuber size per plant harvesting of the potato was made on the second week of jan in both years total fresh tuber yield was recorded on 20 plants in a row in each treatment and replications the data are presented as a ton per hectare 2 6 water productivity water productivity kg mm is an indicator related to the water consumed by crops as et to produce a certain yield and calculated for each irrigation treatment as follows wp yield t ha 1 applied water mm 2 7 yield response factor the functional relationship between crop yield and water use is called the water production function ratio of actual to maximum et that limits the crop yield assuming that all the other factors are at the optimum level seasonal values of the yield response factor ky were calculated for each experimental year as follows 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm 1 where ym kg ha 1 and ya kg ha 1 are maximum that obtained from fully irrigated treatment and actual yield respectively etm mm ha 1 and eta mm ha 1 are maximum that obtained from fully irrigated treatment and actual evapotranspiration respectively ky is the yield response factor that is defined as the decrease in yield per unit decrease in et stewart et al 1977 according to ky calculation kss was calculated by the equation 1 replacing ym with maximum total dry biomass ssm and ya with actual total dry biomass ssa as follows 1 ssa ssm kss 1 eta etm 2 where kss indicates the biomass response factor which is the correlation factor between relative total dry biomass loss and relative et reduction 2 8 statistical analysis all data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova appropriate to the experimental design to evaluate the effects of treatments on potato yield total dry biomass shoot dry weight average tuber weight and wp costat version 6 311 cohort usa 1998 2005 was used to conduct the analysis of variance treatment means were compared using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 probability level 3 results 3 1 climate trend and irrigation variables although most potato plants grow and produce in different seasons they can grow better in cooler weather particularly in the mediterranean during the growth season the climate parameters differed from september to december where the most significant differences were recorded in november and december for both temperature and relative humidity at this site nubaria the climatic conditions are ideal for potato production especially at this time of the year it is possible to point out a scarce rainfall without adequate amounts during the cropping cycle total rainfalls recorded during the cropping cycle were 15 and 23 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively the air temperature was higher during the first part of the cycle in september when the max temperatures were consistently over 33 c afterwards in october the daily min and max temperatures decreased and followed the same trend till the end of december though typical for this area the described climate parameter reduced crop water use due to low daily et0 from the planting to harvest it made a clear difference in the comparative irrigated regimes 3 2 tuber yield and total biomass potato yield varied significantly under different timing of deficit irrigation applied in 2018 table 3 full irrigation supply v100 resulted in the highest yield however there was a significant reduction in total yield when applying less water during the first part of the crop cycle v50 100 conversely no significant difference was observed between potato well irrigated and potato irrigated with the limitation of irrigation water for the last part of the crop cycle v100 50 although nearly the same amount of water was applied for both treatments the decreases in yield were 20 3 and 8 6 with irrigation water savings of 23 and 21 for v50 100 and v100 50 respectively as compared to v100 total tuber yield was proportional to total dry biomass production r 2 0 98 demonstrating that the crop regulates its tuber biomass to total biomass cumulated therefore total dry biomass was strongly depressed by the early soil water deficit v50 100 while deficit irrigation at the last part of the crop cycle v100 50 induced lower losses in dry biomass overall harvest index hi hi fruit dry weight total aboveground dry weight at harvest changes under different irrigation regimes hi declined significantly in response to v50 100 0 63 while it was 0 67 under v100 50 irrigation treatment the average tuber weight per plant decreased in v50 100 and the trend was similar to the tuber yield although a considerable variation in average tuber weight was observed the correlation analysis between tuber yield and average tuber weight showed a solid correlation r2 0 99 indicating that changes in the yield were mainly affected by tuber weight total yield and dry biomass were drastically depressed by soil water deficit under v0 when a very early cut of irrigation was applied since many tubers did not enlarge enough under drier conditions in the second year 2019 some higher rainfall was observed but did not modify the total water per treatment all deficit irrigation treatments used a constant irrigation water application rate throughout the season the deficit irrigation treatments di50 and prd50 significantly reduced tuber yield by 41 and 28 respectively relative to v100 although nearly the same level of water was applied for both treatments on the other hand prd75 did not significantly reduce tuber yield and total dry matter but irrigation water saving of 25 was achieved compared to v100 as shown in 2018 tdw was also proportional to total tuber yield r 2 0 97 in 2019 indicating that the severity of water stress influenced total dry matter the average tuber weight per plant for the prd75 was closer to that of the v100 however both values were significantly higher than those for di50 and prd50 treatments as shown in the previous year 2018 total yield and dry biomass were drastically depressed by soil water deficit under v0 which produced minimal tuber size however higher rainfall occurred in this year helped to some extent to produce a higher yield relative to the previous year the results also showed that compared to v100 deficit irrigation with prd75 increased tuber dry weight data not shown and maintained tdw content which improved hi than any other deficit irrigation treatments 3 3 water productivity and production function the values of water productivity calculated on a total fresh yield basis were positively affected by deficit irrigation treatments table 3 in 2018 wp increased with water shortage and its maximum value corresponded to irrigation treatment v100 50 which enhanced wp by 12 2 versus 3 4 for v50 100 treatment this result suggests that the crop can still benefit from the water when this last is supplied to fulfill crop water demand in 2019 when water was reduced by 25 and 50 during extended periods of both prd75 and prd50 wp was higher by 26 and 35 over the v100 in both treatments respectively although the di50 treatment had the same level of water input as prd50 the use later attained superior effect in maintaining crop yield as an effective strategy for water saving in potatoes the production function total amount of applied irrigation water vs fresh tuber yield through linear regression analysis a mathematical function showed a significant determination factor r 2 0 98 and 0 93 for 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 1 over the range of water inputs from 340 262 and 330 180 mm between planting and harvest potato yield increased by 145 and 150 kg ha 1 for each mm of water applied for 2018 and 2019 respectively 3 4 yield response factor the yield response factor ky quantifies the sensitivity of potato yield to the water deficit during the whole growing season for the year 2018 the higher ky factor 0 87 was found in v50 100 while the lower value 0 43 for the same parameter was found in v100 50 respectively table 4 the higher ky value for v50 100 close to one indicates to the sensitivity of potato to early soil water deficit in 2019 ky was 0 32 with a 25 irrigation deficit under prd75 treatment while further increase in deficit irrigation to 50 with di50 and prd50 the ky factor was appreciable higher 0 91 and 0 62 for both treatments respectively however calculate this coefficient for plant total dry matter rather than tuber yield the same behavior was observed in both years as the total dry matter decreased by increasing the water deficit the values of kss were markedly less than the values observed with tuber yield which indicates the emergence of drought tolerance on the other hand the relationships between 1 ya ym and 1 eta etm for the different irrigation treatments were well fitted using a linear regression forced to the origin with the regression coefficients of 0 97 and 0 93 for yield and tdw in 2018 and 0 89 and 0 81 in 2019 respectively fig 2 the test of significance of regression coefficients showed that the yield response factor was significant p 0 05 for both years however the sensitivity of potato to water stress was more significant when the latter was applied at different timing during 2018 ky 1 05 than at different severities during 2019 ky 0 92 while in terms of total dry matter kss the potato is less sensitive to both stress timing 0 98 and severity 0 82 for both years respectively 4 discussion 4 1 tuber yield and water saving strategy crops sensitive to water stress such as potatoes require a standard irrigation method to prevent the soil water deficit from falling below a certain threshold level under a specific crop and soil condition maximum productivity for potatoes occurs when the soil is kept consistently moist making it one of the most critical factors influencing production ferreira and goncalves 2007 during the time course of water stress evaluation in 2018 potatoes seemed to be more sensitive to the time of deficit irrigation imposed early than in the late part of the season the difference being significant in favor of the late deficit irrigation although both treatments almost received the same amount of water table 2 this might be due to the plants exposed to early water stress cannot restore the loss of growth in the following stages even when water is fully available once again the same severe depressive effects of early water stress upon yield are widely reported in the literature for potatoes as it substantially reduces tuber initiation bulking and tuber yield evers et al 2010 obidiegwu et al 2015 the tuber bulking stage is a critical period that determines a large part of tuber yield where sucrose at this phase moves from the leaves to the tubers and is converted to starch and the tubers accumulate water nutrients and carbohydrates king et al 2003 this finding was also similar to the previous studies that providing full irrigation through mid bulking followed by a slow reduction in irrigation amounts was the best scenario for reducing yield losses when water supply was limited stark et al 2013 harvest index hi also declined in response to v50 100 treatment 0 64 which was associated with decreased biomass partitioning to the tubers and yield reduction on the other hand hi was higher 0 67 under the v100 50 treatment which was related to favorable growth conditions enhanced by initial canopy development greater water use and crop dry biomass however when water resources are limited the timing of deficit irrigation prior to the ripping stage and once the plant had developed its vigorous vegetative growth would result in the least reductions in yield moreover such technology can make the difference in maintaining a high yield while saving more water to irrigate other crops in the second year 2019 with the prd technique reducing water by 25 of full irrigation under prd75 did not significantly affect tuber yield but an appreciable amount of water saving was achieved compared to full irrigation the water saving benefits of prd have been justified to consider this technique without reducing yield significantly this technique secured the absence or an only limited reduction in yield where it can be assumed that no water deficit was imposed on the growing plants further reduction in the volume of water applied through the di50 and prd50 increased the water stress to the plants with a concomitant yield reduction but the latter would cause less reduction therefore this appears to be a viable option for reducing the amount of water used while keeping adequate yields positive effects of partial root zone irrigation have been shown in many crop species previous studies have shown that under the condition of prd the roots in the dry soil compartment sense soil drying and generate continuous chemical signals mainly aba these signals reduce stomatal conductance and leaf expansion as found in wheat ali et al 1998 maize bahrun et al 2002 soybean liu et al 2003 potatoes liu et al 2006 and tomatoes holbrook et al 2002 moreover the prd technique may cause a better utilization of soil water reserves by promoting root growth although root growth was not measured in our study several studies have shown that prd increases root depth and root density mingo et al 2004 songsri et al 2008 in addition a higher root hydraulic conductivity was also found locally by restriction of water supply kang and zhang 2004 on the other hand differences in moisture distribution in the soil profile between prd and di50 have been reviewed by dodd 2009 and xie et al 2012 the possible mechanism responsible for the positive effects of prd may include inducing a compensatory effect of water uptake jarvis 2011 thus the roots in the wet side increase water uptake and compensate little uptake from the dry side upholding the plant s full transpiration rate improving uptake of mineral nutrients and enhancing nutrient recovery in plants kirda et al 2007 wang et al 2013 the wetting side of the plant has a plentiful supply of water and therefore the plant never became stressed as a deficit of conventional irrigation methods however the reduction of the irrigation water was partially compensated by more efficient exploitation of the available soil water indicating that the prd technique had a higher yield benefit than regulating di50 at the same water level knowing the link between yield and water use is critical for determining the economic value of crop production and sustaining crop profitability however when the level of under irrigation may cause lower yield relative to full irrigation the provision of irrigation water may offset this reduction and allow an expansion for the area under cultivation to grow more crops 4 2 deficit irrigation sustain wp the main goal of irrigation is to gain maximum production per unit of applied water which can be attained by adopting a suitable irrigation strategy potato is considered one of the higher water consumption crops alva et al 2012 badr et al 2010 as to the supplemental irrigation treatments both restricted irrigation regimes in 2018 produced higher wp values than the full irrigation treatment table 2 however v100 50 increased wp markedly compared to v50 100 as a discreet soil water deficit was late in the season in addition the plants underwent moderate stress mainly as they reached full ground cover which preserves the soil surface against evaporation similarly deficit irrigation under both prd treatments in 2019 induced significant increases in wp as soil water content remained well and alternative water applied was able to reduce the soil water deficit wang et al 2012 furthermore accumulated evidence has shown that prd could significantly improve the wp of potatoes liu et al 2006 and different crops kirda et al 2007 consistent with this in the present study wp was higher in both prd treatments than in di50 or any other treatment table 3 several possible reasons are responsible for the increase of wp for the plants under prd induced water stress however those plants under mild water deficit may be able to perform one or more of the following i partial stomatal closure may have reduced water use while maintaining crop net photosynthesis as stomatal resistance is the primary controlling resistance for transpiration topcu et al 2007 badr et al 2020 ii reduce luxury transpiration loss without or with a minimal impact on photosynthesis yang et al 2012 iii improve moisture distribution across the soil profile and reduce potential evaporation due to decreased evaporative surface areas exposed by the partial root zone irrigation approach xie et al 2012 4 3 potato is sensitive to deficit irrigation the crop yield response factor indicates how the plant can tolerate water stress the relationship between potato yield and et is helpful to assess the strength of the relationship between variables where relative yield increased linearly with relative seasonal et cantore et al 2014 camargo et al 2015 the yield response factor ky varies mainly depending on the growth stage growth season and severity of the water deficit the ky factor was proportionally less than the relative et deficit the value exceeds one when yield declines proportionally to et deficit the differential influence of the water deficit during various growth stages on potato yield indicated that ky was higher and close to one in v50 100 versus lower ky value of the water deficit in v100 50 indicating that potato yield was sensitive to water deficit at the early stage of growth table 4 however in deficit irrigation regimes the water stress of a particular growth stage may have a cumulative effect on the subsequent growth stages therefore the overall yield reduction of the crop may not be restored in the later stages many studies have shown that water deficit early in the season was the critical stage for potato cultivation doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported that ky for the early vegetative late vegetative yield formation and ripening stage was 0 45 0 80 0 70 and 0 20 respectively in this respect due to the definite nature of the potato crop tubers ripening occurred simultaneously irrigation during the second part of tuber bulking that comprises tuber ripening coincided with the least sensitive phenological stages to water stress as the water deficit would not strongly affect them jovanovic et al 2010 mila and ali 2016 other studies have shown that the seasonal crop yield factor ky of potato was 0 91 ayas and korukcu 2010 while darwish et al 2006 found the ky value of processing potato was 0 80 for the entire growth period on the other hand calculating this coefficient as referred to plant tdm rather than yield it could be notice that the values of kss were markedly lower than ky for both years this result indicates a different behavior of the total dry matter towards exposure to water deficit the water regime effect on assimilating distribution and on yield components may explain the difference concerns this behavior hi does not significantly change in the deficit irrigated treatments 0 62 0 67 compared to 0 68 in full irrigation from these data it emerges that water stresses significantly reduced the weight of tubers in this species while the other production components were not or little influenced moreover the effect of water stress on the production of total dry matter in the plant was relatively less than the effect on the tuber yield due to the high percentage of dry weight content about 20 in the plant compared to some other vegetable crops the linear model regression analysis best fitted the relationship of relative yield with relative seasonal et indicating that relative yield increased linearly with relative seasonal et fig 2 this linear model supports the trend of the previous equations in both years for different irrigation treatments however the results obtained in our experiment show that the ky and kss observed in 2018 were higher than those observed in 2019 indicating that stress timing has more detrimental effect on potatoes than stress severity for this reason it is advisable to use an irrigation strategy based on partial restoration of water demand during the entire growing season for potatoes finally although potato with a ky close to unity pointed out some sensitivity to water stress with appreciably yield decrement but higher substantial stability or increment of wp was observed thus this crop adapts well to deficit irrigation scheduling criteria and is concomitant with economic sustainability that can maintain crop yield under different irrigation regimes 5 conclusions to cope with scarcity of water supplies deficit irrigation scheduling based on plant growth stages and throughout the growing season was imposed on potato plants the limitation of irrigation water for the last part of the crop cycle showed water stress tolerance and contributed remarkable towards improving wp in contrast deficit irrigation early in the season resulted in a significant unsustainable decrease in potato yield the prd strategy imposed during the whole growing season allowed more efficient use of water coupled with the least yield reduction compared to full irrigation as a result prd could also guarantee relatively higher yield and improve wp compared to regular deficit irrigation a proper application of deficit irrigation may contribute to obtaining a good compromise between yield and water saving this aspect is essential where water scarcity and the continuously rising irrigation costs are growing concerns in arid regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9399,owing to increasingly limited water resources evaluating large scale regional crop water footprints wfs within acceptable errors is the basis for efficiency and productivity improvements for sustainable agriculture however quantitative sensitivity analysis of outputs to inputs and parameters of advanced and widely used crop wf accounting models are still lacking in this study we evaluated the spatial and temporal sensitivity of the blue and green wfs of crops to key input variables based on year by year simulations for wheat rice maize and soybean production in china from 2010 to 2019 we employed one of the most widely used aquacrop models to test different water supply and irrigation scenarios nine input variables or model parameters were selected including reference evapotranspiration eto crop transpiration coefficient kctr soil evaporation coefficient ke maximum canopy cover mcc precipitation pr canopy decline coefficient cdc planting density of the crop dc reference harvest index hi0 and normalised water productivity wp the results showed that crop wfs are generally more sensitive to eto among the input variables and kctr and ke among the model parameters we also found that the blue wf was more sensitive than the green wf in most cases wfs in rainfed scenarios were more sensitive to changes in input variables compared to wfs of irrigated crops of the four studied crops the wfs of maize and wheat were more sensitive than the wfs of rice and soybean wheat maize and soybean also showed a visible spatial variation in the sensitivity of the wf to each input variable overall the wf sensitivity was influenced by crop type water supply irrigation method and regional climate features the current analysis provides a feasible approach to comprehensively identify the key inputs and parameters to be calibrated for accurate crop wf accounting graphical abstract ga1 abbreviations wf water footprint wfb blue water footprint wfg green water

crises are becoming critical jägermeyr et al 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 to ensure food security maintain human well being and achieve sustainable development goals such as zero hunger it is crucial to manage and utilize scarce water resources to achieve maximum crop per drop godfray et al 2010 grafton et al 2010 2018 tilman et al 2011 the water footprint wf of crop production has been widely determined as a comprehensive measure of the consumption of different types of water resources at different spatial and temporal scales as well as its impact on the environment hoekstra 2003 the wfs can be divided into blue green and grey blue wf is the consumption of surface water and groundwater irrigation water by crops while green wf is the consumption of precipitation water mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 grey wf is the quantity of water required to assimilate pollutants and as such are not relevant to this study mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in recent years an increasing number of studies have used a variety of models to conduct extensive studies on wf simulations in crop production at different spatiotemporal scales feng et al 2021 current computational models can record crop wfs at temporal scales of days months and years gao et al 2021 hoekstra 2017 tuninetti et al 2015 in addition advanced assessments based on a distributed hydrological model coupled with a water balance method have been conducted at spatial scales as small as an irrigation district gao et al 2021 luan et al 2018 and as large as a river basin albers et al 2021 xie et al 2020 grid based high spatial resolution crop wf evaluated at larger spatial scales is more common in crop water productivity or hydrological models the most used models include the environmental policy integrated climate epic siebert and doll 2010 the gis based epic gepic liu 2009 and cropwat likely soil water balance mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 models all of which are used at a global scale the aquacrop model is another commonly used model that can not only be used at global scales mialyk et al 2022 but also at national scales zhuo et al 2016a the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto 2009 has been the most widely applied in recent years because it seeks a balance between accuracy model complexity and stability furthermore the aquacrop model consists of various functions such as simulating crop growth and separating crop transpiration and soil evaporation it also optimises irrigation systems with limited data which is highly intuitive and has a wide range of applications the combined daily crop wf module chukalla et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016b enables the calculation of regional wfs of crop production at multiple spatial and temporal scales distinguishing the impacts of different irrigation methods mao et al 2021 mialyk et al 2021 wang et al 2019 considering that crop wf simulations rely on several modelling structures input parameters and assumptions about the datasets utilised using different input variables or parameters can result in significantly different wf quantification results for the same region from the same model tuninetti et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 therefore evaluation of the accuracy and reliability of the reported magnitude spatial and temporal heterogeneities in each component of the wfs of crop production is crucial for further usage of these simulation outputs chenoweth et al 2014 sensitivity analysis is an efficient way to quantitatively identify key input variables and model parameters that visibly impact the simulation outputs when there are minor biases in each of these inputs or parameters to date only two relatively comprehensive sensitivity analyses tuninetti et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 have been made on large scale crop wf estimation zhuo et al 2014 focused on the four major crops in the yellow river basin of china and used the cropwat likely soil water balance model to analyse the sensitivity of the crop wfs to seven parameters and input variables using the one at a time oat method daniel 1973 they found that the reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient were the most sensitive parameters however this was only valid at the river basin scale tuninetti et al 2015 later applied a normalised sensitivity index si at the global scale to test the sensitivity of crop wf estimates to input variables based on crop water requirement assessments they claimed that the crop yield cy defined the spatial patterns of crop wfs and revealed the sensitivity differences between crops and regions despite these studies there is still a lack of comprehensive quantitative sensitivity analysis of model outputs to input variables or parameters for the models mentioned above the oat method is more capable of expressing the overall sensitivity of the study area under different amplitudes while the si method is better at reflecting the spatial variation of sensitivity however there is no precedent for using both methods to combine their advantages in view of this in this study we applied the aquacrop model to calculate the blue and green wfs of wheat rice maize and soybean in china on a yearly basis from 2010 to 2019 the sensitivity of crop wf to key model parameters and input variables and their spatial and temporal heterogeneities were quantitatively evaluated by applying the oat and si methods currently china is amongst the world s leading producers and consumers of rice wheat maize and soybean with rice and wheat yields accounting for 30 and 18 of the global yield respectively maize production in china accounts for 23 of the global production which is second only to the united states while china s soybean yield is the fourth highest in the world the total harvested area of the crops in this study accounts for 89 of the harvested area of all food crops in china nbsc 2021 henan and heilongjiang provinces are the regions with the highest total cys while tibet and qinghai have the lowest fig 1 the aims of this study were to 1 test the suitability of the aquacrop model which so far has not been used to determine the sensitivity of wf of crop production 2 involve comprehensive model parameters in wf determination 3 distinguish the water supply and irrigation methods of various crops in detail and 4 study the amplitude and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the sensitivity of wf of crop production using both oat and si methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 sensitivity analysis 2 1 1 one at a time oat method the oat method is one of the quick and effective sensitivity analysis methods and it evaluates the effect of changes in input values by changing only one parameter or input variable at a time daniel 1973 hamby 1994 this method has been widely used because of its simplicity and practicality berezowski et al 2015 fersch et al 2020 goyal 2004 saltelli and annoni 2010 but it is rarely used in the field of wf assessment calculations zhuo et al 2014 in this study we used the oat method to analyse the effect of each input value on the output values of cy crop water use cwu and crop wf under different irrigation and water supply scenarios for each meteorological station unit each input variable or model parameter varied within a certain range and the response of each output to the change in the input variable or model parameter was recorded the sensitivity curves for each crop were then plotted using the station data combined with box line plots this allowed us to characterise the average annual response of the sensitivity of the four crops to changes in each input value as well as to evaluate the effect of those changes on the three output values for each input variable or model parameter sensitivity analyses were conducted with variations in amplitude of 5 and overall variations of 20 allen et al 1998 zhuo et al 2014 2 1 2 sensitivity index si a dimensionless relative si in conjunction with existing sensitivity analysis methods tuninetti et al 2015 was used to quantify to response of cwu cy and wf to variations in each input variable or model parameter this method was also used to analyse the spatial variations in the sensitivity to changes in the input variables or model parameters values were normalised to allow for sensitivity size comparisons between the parameters comparisons and spatial analyses were performed using the following equation 1 si 1 n i 1 n z x δ x i z x z x δ x i x where z is the output variable of the simulation x is the parameter or input variable value xi is the i th adjustment value of the variable and n is the number of adjustments the final si value was the arithmetic mean of n cases within the range of changes 20 in this study the sensitivities of cwu cy and wf to changes in the input variables or model parameters were divided into three categories if the si value was greater than 0 6 or less than 0 6 the input variable was classified as extremely sensitive if si was between 0 6 and 0 1 or 0 6 and 0 1 the input variable was classified as generally sensitive if si was between 0 1 and 0 1 the input variable was classified as insensitive 0 1 si 0 1 2 2 quantifying the water footprint of crop production the blue and green wfs m3 t were defined as the daily accumulation of blue and green evapotranspiration et m3 ha divided by cy t ha during the crop growing period mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in this analysis the wf was estimated based on site scale modelling by crop and year by distinguishing between rainfed and irrigated scenarios and different irrigation methods the site locations with rainfed or irrigated scenarios were identified according to the map of rainfed and irrigated croplands in the mirca2000 dataset portmann et al 2010 for each site daily et and cy under rainfed or different irrigation scenarios were simulated by the aquacrop model in the model for wheat maize and soybeans the corresponding surface soil wetness characterisation parameters were set for different irrigation methods furrow 80 sprinkler 100 and micro irrigation 40 chukalla et al 2015 wang et al 2019 two types of irrigation scenarios furrow and water demanding irrigation were used for rice which set the water depth and consumption parameters at different times dong et al 2020 pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 we calibrated the average levels of simulated cy values for the sites located within the same province to match the provincial cy statistics as per the methods of mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 mialyk et al 2022 and yang et al 2021 the average simulated cy was weighted by the areas of rainfed and irrigated croplands as well as the extent of different irrigation methods to the provincial irrigated area due to data limitation only provincial level statistics were available and the spatial differences in terms of contribution by different irrigation methods to irrigated area were not considered following the methods of wang et al 2019 after calibration the spatial variations in cy and et generated wf continually to show the impacts from diverse climate water stress and irrigation methods yang et al 2021 the provincial weighted average unit blue and green wf of each crop can be estimated by the following equations 2 wf b prov i 10 t 1 gp et b t i w i i cy i w i 3 wf g prov i 10 t 1 gp et g t i w i i cy i w i where wfb prov and wfg prov are the blue and green wfs m3 t of a crop at provincial level respectively i refers to cropping conditions in terms of rainfed land and the different types of irrigation methods

productivity driven crop model hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 which can simulate the growth process and cy of different crops in response to regional soil climate groundwater and field management conditions it can also better simulate the cy response mechanism at the micro level steduto et al 2009 it has been favoured by researchers in numerous countries because of its high accuracy low number of parameters and balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness steduto et al 2009 the soil water dynamic balance based on the root zone in the aquacrop model was calculated

following the method used by wang et al 2019 it was possible to break down the specific irrigation situation at the provincial scale for each of the four crops based on the proportion of different water saving irrigation techniques used in provincial total crop harvested area as reported in the statistical yearbooks nbsc 2021 combined with mirca2000 database portmann et al 2010 the irrigation methods for wheat maize and soybean included furrow irrigation micro irrigation sprinkler irrigation and rainfed as rice is a wet crop in paddy fields its irrigation methods were divided into furrow irrigation and water demanding irrigation de parameter values were obtained from raes et al 2017 except for maximum root depth zx and harvest index hi which were obtained from allen et al 1998 annual mean atmospheric co2 concentrations were obtained from the mauna loa observatory hawaii noaa 2018 the various sensitive factors involved in the calibration and wf evaluation of aquacrop models were

an increase in the national average yield of soybean maize wheat and rice which was accompanied by a significant decrease in the unit wf of each crop 6 9 6 8 9 8 and 0 2 respectively fig 2a the components of wf contributing to the decline varied among crops for wheat the wf decline was due to an 18 2 decrease in wfb each year while the wf decrease observed for maize and rice was dominated by wfg decreases of 9 4 and 6 1 respectively there were also differences in the wfb and wfg components depending on the crop and irrigation practice fig 2b f this was shown by a 6 2 decrease in wheat wfb under the furrow irrigation scenario as well as a 7 6 and 8 8 decrease in soybean wfb in the micro irrigation and sprinkler irrigation scenarios respectively furthermore there was a 14 3 decrease in maize wfg under the rainfed scenario and a 14 3 decrease in rice wfg in the furrow irrigation and de scenarios the decadal variation in wfb and wfg components was not significant however wfg in the de scenario was 42 5 higher on average than the furrow irrigation scenario there was a national increase of 84 49 gm³ y 15 4 in total wf between 2010 and 2019 the areas with high total wf values and the most significant increases were found in the northern and central regions while lower values and smaller increases were observed in the eastern and southern regions fig 3a b the results also showed that the main irrigation method was furrow irrigation fig 3c d areas with a high total wfb were mainly concentrated in the arid and semi arid regions in the west where there was low precipitation in xinjiang and tibet 81 6 and 86 5 of the water supply method in 2019 was irrigation water respectively in addition 59 8 of the irrigation in xinjiang in 2019 was through micro irrigation a 22 2 increase since 2010 however in tibet 85 5 of the irrigation in 2019 was using furrow irrigation which was a 14 3 decrease compared to 2010 the percentage of total wfb in individual northern regions was lower compared to that in other regions with the rainfed scenario accounting for over 50 of the total wf in inner mongolia liaoning jilin and heilongjiang these northern regions did however see an increase in the proportion of total wfb over the observed time period detailed information on the changes in irrigated crop area in different provinces over 10 years under different water supply and irrigation scenarios is presented in table s1 5 overall the area occupied by furrow irrigation decreased over the decade while the area occupied by micro irrigation sprinkler irrigation rainfed and de increased 3 2 crop wf sensitivity based on the oat method fig 4 shows the responses of cy cwug and cwub to changes in each of the higher sensitivity input variables or parameters these changes varied in magnitude depending on water supply irrigation scenario and crop type overall when eto and kctr were overestimated cy cwug and cwub were also overestimated by the irrigation scenario however cy was underestimated in the rainfed scenario the sensitivity of maize wheat and soybean cy to each input value was generally higher in the rainfed scenario than that in the irrigation scenario whereas rice cy was not sensitive to any of the parameters for example a 20 overestimation in eto and kctr resulted in an approximately 5 overestimation in cy for maize and soybeans in the irrigated scenario but a 5 10 underestimation in the rainfed scenario wheat was the most sensitive crop when eto and kctr were overestimated or underestimated by 20 respectively under the rainfed scenario the cy of wheat could be underestimated or overestimated by approximately 5 15 which reflected the large differences in the sensitivity of wheat cy to eto and kctr in different regions cwub was strongly affected by changes in the input values than that by cwug which was in turn more strongly affected when compared to cy changes in eto and kctr of 20 resulted in variations in cwub for each crop by approximately 15 and 25 respectively the same variation in eto and kctr resulted in variations in cwug for each crop by approximately 10 among them for changes in eto the cwub and cwug sensitivity responses of rice under the de scenario differed considerably for example when eto was overestimated by 20 the rice cwub and cwug in the de scenario were overestimated by approximately 5 and 15 respectively the results for mcc are notable as each crop showed a decrease in cwub in the micro irrigation scenario regardless of whether mcc increased or decreased the decrease was most sensitive for wheat where a 20 overestimation or underestimation in mcc resulted in an underestimation in cwub of approximately 5 for the other irrigation methods the cwub of each crop basically showed a negative correlation with the change in mcc soybean cy was also very sensitive to mcc as a 20 increase in mcc resulted in a 4 increase in soybean cy in the rainfed scenario and a 4 decrease in the irrigated scenario fig s1 cwug and cwub responded in opposite directions to changes in pr for each crop type under the same irrigation scenario and cy responded in opposite directions to changes in pr under rainfed and irrigated scenarios fig s1 when pr was overestimated cwug was also overestimated while cwub was underestimated this is consistent with the actual scenario that when precipitation was sufficient irrigation water use decreased and crop use of precipitation during growth increased when pr was overestimated by 20 crop cwug was roughly overestimated by 5 with rice showing the largest increased in the diffuse irrigation scenario with the cwug increment reaching approximately 10 as for cwub when the pr was overestimated by 20 cwub was roughly underestimated by 6 for each crop with rice showing the largest reduction in cwub of up to 10 under the water demanding irrigation scenario it is important to note that eto ke figs s2 3 and kctr will influence crop water demand soil evaporation and crop transpiration respectively as a result when these three inputs increase cwub and cwug will increase for each crop under the irrigation scenario however when pr decreased irrigation water use increased to maintain the basic water demand of the crop fig s3 meanwhile as the mcc increased crops with larger canopies tended to cause low soil water evaporation due to increased shading of the soil therefore the correlation of cwub to pr and mcc is the opposite of the correlation between cwub and eto kctr and ke fig 5 shows the responses of wfg wfb and wf to changes in each of the higher sensitivity input variables or parameters wf was determined by the combined effect of cwu and cy as a ratio as the sensitivities of cy and cwu to each input value are similar most of the changes in input variables affect wf and cwu in similar ways even though cy is much less sensitive than cwu the sensitivity of wfb to each input variable or model parameter was higher overall than that of wfg under the same irrigation method the wfg of each crop also had a significantly higher response to each input value under the rainfed scenario compared to that of the other irrigation scenarios in addition the wfg wfb and wf of each crop was positively correlated to eto kctr and ke but negatively correlated to mcc figs s4 6 when eto ke and kctr were overestimated by 20 the wf of each crop in the irrigation scenario was overestimated by approximately 10 20 3 6 and 10 15 respectively when corresponding to the above three input values wheat had the strongest sensitivity relative to the other crops in general as indicated by these results the sensitivity of wf to changes in ke was significantly lower for each crop under the micro irrigation scenario compared to that of the other irrigation methods when mcc was underestimated the wf of most crops remained unchanged under all the irrigation scenarios except for the wheat which was underestimated notably under the micro irrigation scenario when mcc was overestimated the change in the sensitivity curve for each crop was consistent under different irrigation methods an overestimation in mcc of 20 resulted in a wf underestimation of approximately 4 for most crops and a decrease in wf of approximately 6 for rice fig s6 since the sensitivities of wfb and wfg to pr were opposite to each other pr had the lowest effect on wf of all six input variables or model parameters the wfs of maize and soybeans were slightly more sensitive than those of wheat and rice with an overestimation of approximately 2 when pr was overestimated by 20 fig s6 when considered separately wfg and wfb were the most sensitive to eto under all types of irrigation scenarios wfb of rice was overestimated the most when eto was overestimated by 20 with approximately a 10 increment while wfg of rice was overestimated by approximately 20 and 30 under the furrow irrigation and de scenarios respectively for rainfed scenarios a 20 overestimation in eto resulted in the mean wfg values of maize and wheat reaching approximately 55 and 45 of the value added respectively and a nearly 20 overestimation of wfg in soybean as the box in the box line chart is away from the mean this indicated that the sensitivity of wfg to eto varied significantly for maize and wheat in different regions which affected the overall mean value distribution the sensitivity of wf to kctr was slightly lower than that of eto one of the most important features of the aquacrop model is that et can be split into crop transpiration and soil evaporation and therefore kctr and ke are crucial for this model when kctr was overestimated by 20 the variation of wfg and wfb for each crop in the irrigation scenario ranged from 5 to 10 and 15 25 respectively reaching nearly 30 incremental variation for the wfg of maize and wheat in the rainfed scenario and approximately 15 for soybean when ke was overestimated by 20 wf was overestimated for all crops but there were large differences between the irrigation scenarios the increment in wf was nearly doubled in the furrow and sprinkler scenario compared to the micro irrigation scenario 3 3 temporal and spatial crop wf sensitivity based on si analysis to further investigate the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of the sensitivity of each crop to different water supply and irrigation scenarios si analyses were conducted for the selected input variables or parameters in turn sensitivity analysis was conducted using the si method and box plots of the sensitivity of wf to each parameter were obtained for different water supply and irrigation methods fig 6 fig 6 shows that for most input variables the sensitivity of wf was significantly higher under the rainfed scenario than that under the irrigated scenario among the input variable category factors wf was extremely sensitive to eto and generally sensitive to pr among the model parameter category factors wf was extremely sensitive to kctr followed by ke mcc and pr which were classified as generally sensitive parameters the si values for each crop ke were generally positive and ranged from about 0 2 0 4 while si values for mcc and pr were both positive and negative for example the si values of mcc for maize and wheat were mostly positive under the rainfed scenario and the mean value was approximately 0 3 but mostly negative under the irrigated scenario as another example the si values of mcc in rice were negative but positive in soybean the remaining input variables cdc dc hi0 and wp were classified as insensitive in most cases there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of wf to each parameter under different irrigation methods for example for maize the sensitivity of wf to changes in eto and ke was only slightly lower under the micro irrigation scenario than that under the furrow irrigation and sprinkler irrigation scenarios similarly wf was only slightly more sensitive to changes in kctr under the micro irrigation scenario than that under the furrow irrigation and sprinkler irrigation scenarios only the wfs of wheat and maize were generally sensitive to changes in cdc and hi0 under the rainfed scenario the spatial variation in sensitivity of wf to each input variable was the lowest for rice as shown in fig 7 there were significant spatial differences in the sensitivity of wf to eto for all four crops there were also significant spatial differences between the wf of the same crop under irrigated and rainfed scenarios in general under the irrigation scenario the wfs to eto of maize and soybean had a low sensitivity in the northern temperate continental climate region which was also the main production area of maize and soybeans in china but a high sensitivity in the southern subtropical monsoon climate region however under the rainfed scenario the wfs were highly sensitive in the northern temperate continental climate region with a low sensitivity in the southern subtropical monsoon climate region the four northern provinces of inner mongolia liaoning jilin and heilongjiang are the largest rainfed maize and soybean producing regions accounting for 52 and 73 of the total maize and soybean production in 2019 respectively while crop wf has the highest sensitivity to eto in these regions an exception to this trend was observed for the wf of wheat which was extremely sensitive to changes eto in the northern and southern regions si 1 under the irrigation scenario and less sensitive in the central temperate monsoon climate regions si 0 7 the central temperate monsoon region was represented by the henan anhui and jiangsu provinces whose total wheat production accounted for nearly 40 of the national total in 2019 and the wf had a relatively low sensitivity to eto in these regions the wf of rice was the most sensitive to changes in eto among all four crops with si values greater than 0 8 however there were no significant differences in this sensitivity between regions as shown in fig 8 the sensitivity of the wfs of all four crops to changes in kctr was higher under the rainfed scenario than that under the irrigation scenario in addition under the three irrigation methods the sensitivity of the wfs of maize and soybean to changes in kctr was lowest in the northern temperate continental climate region which was the main production area for both the crops and highest in the southern subtropical monsoon region the lowest sensitivity was found in shanxi province si 0 2 whereas the highest sensitivity in guangdong fujian and zhejiang si 0 9 however under the rainfed scenario the spatial distribution of wf sensitivity for soybean was consistent the wf of wheat was highly sensitive to changes in kctr in northern and southern china but had low sensitivity in central china the wf of rice was highly sensitive to changes in kctr across all regions with no significant spatial variation as shown in fig 9 the sensitivity of wf to ke for each crop was the lowest in the micro scenario and there were large differences between different crops water supply and irrigation methods the sensitivity of maize wf to ke under the furrow and sprinkler scenarios was consistent overall 0 3 si 0 5 and the lowest sensitivity was found in shanxi province si 0 2 the sensitivity of maize wf to ke under the rainfed scenario was significantly higher in the northern temperate continental climate zone than in the southern subtropical monsoon climate zone while negative si values existed at some stations in inner mongolia and xinjiang in the northern region and wf was negatively correlated with ke the sensitivity of soybean wf to ke was overall lower than that of maize while the sensitivity to ke under the furrow and sprinkler scenarios was slightly higher in the northern temperate continental climate zone which is also the main soybean producing area in china than in the southern subtropical monsoon climate zone but the opposite was true under the micro and rainfed scenarios the sensitivity of wheat wf to ke in all three irrigation scenarios followed a higher distribution pattern in the south 0 4 si 0 6 than that in the north 0 si 0 2 this distribution pattern may be related to the wheat species since the southern subtropical monsoon climate zone of china is dominated by winter wheat while the northern temperate continental climate zone is dominated by spring wheat the wf of wheat under the rainfed scenario is not sensitive to ke overall except for southwest china especially yunnan province where some sites have si values as high as 0 6 and there are also sites with negative correlation sensitivity relationships for rice its wf was more sensitive to ke but there were no significant spatial differences 4 discussion in this study we presented the first detailed synergistic sensitivity analysis of the wf of crop production in china at the site scale based on the aquacrop model and by application of the oat and si methods with a careful delineation of water supply and irrigation methods the results of the study showed that although aquacrop is relatively complex in terms of parameter settings and model mechanisms we still found some common conclusions when compared with previous studies tuninetti et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 we found that eto is the most sensitive input value and wfb is more sensitive than wfg at the same time we focused on the impact of more input variables and parameters on wf and found some novel patterns notably eto kctr and ke had the same trend in sensitivity changes and eto and kctr were the most sensitive factors in the input variable categories and model parameter categories respectively this was because both kctr and ke are values directly related to et since aquacrop is a water driven model the crop yield is determined based on water consumption and et directly affects crop fertility the sensitivity of ke was significantly lower than that of kctr since crop transpiration directly affects crop growth and development while soil evaporation is often considered as ineffective evaporation which mainly affects crop fertility indirectly through the combined effect on soil moisture content and field microenvironment one of the significant advantages of the aquacrop model is that it can differentiate et into crop transpiration and soil evaporation to better simulate the actual water consumption of crops however in the current studies of aquacrop accounting for large scale regional crop wfs there is a tendency to use rough values for kctr and ke and little consideration has been given to the impact of regional differences and different water supply methods on wf accuracy under the effect of kctr and ke therefore it is necessary to determine the accuracy of kctr and ke for the wf sensitive areas and highly sensitive water supply methods mentioned in here mcc refers to the proportion of plant leaf cover at the soil surface in its maximum state which mainly affects photosynthesis and the transpiration of crops in general crops with greater canopy cover genotypes intercept more solar radiation during growth while shading more land to reduce inefficient soil evaporation and increase water use efficiency deery et al 2021 notably the increase in cy for mcc tended to decrease under the irrigated scenario while the opposite was true for the rainfed scenario this was probably due to the fact that there was no water stress in the fully irrigated scenario and if the mcc was very large resulting in mutual shading of crop canopies between rows it may have negative effects on crop photosynthesis which in turn may have negative feedback on crop fertility in contrast a larger mcc in the rainfed scenario will promote the full utilisation of water in the crop and soil compensating for the negative effect on crop fertility due to insufficient photosynthesis thus the cultivation of crops with larger mcc genotypes can further reduce wf and improve the crop water use efficiency while also increasing the crop yield to some extent in rainfed areas which is one of the parameters of great practical importance it should be particularly emphasised that spatial factors must be given sufficient attention in the process of wf accurate assessments and model calibration the sensitivity of crops in different regions to various input variables varies greatly due to a combination of factors such as temperature rainfall crop characteristics and the role of the environment thus their values are not consistent the focus should be on areas where wf has a strong sensitivity to different model parameters and input variables eliminating the influence of spatial factors in large regional wf accounting for the less sensitive or even insensitive areas generalised fixed values can be considered for the parameters involved to reduce time and opportunity costs in the process of accurate wf assessment and model calibration the strong sensitivity areas involved in this study can provide a reference for subsequent studies to consider the impact of spatial factors on wf errors the results of this study provide a set of feasible methods and ideas for accurate wf assessments and model calibration from the perspective of both model input variables and parameters as well as a preliminary understanding of the possible effects of climate variables such as eto and pr on crop wf the method can be applied not only to the aquacrop model based wf assessment but also extended to other models however there are still some limitations and shortcomings in the current analysis for example we had only focused on the sensitivity of the wf of crop production and have not discussed the uncertainty which is one of the sources of errors in wf simulation calculations in addition we evaluated the wfs for four food crops wheat rice maize and soybean and have not investigated other cash crops such as potatoes furthermore this was a site scale based study since parameter sensitivity is affected by scale simulations at different scales may produce different degrees of sensitivity zhuo et al 2014 at the same time there is still a lack of crop wf sensitivity analysis based on field trial measurements which is equally essential for model based work on large scale wf precision assessments further studies are required to determine if the same sensitivity variation exists in field watersheds or at other scales finally we determined values of wf using aquacrop which is a water driven model the impact of different models such as cropwat and gepic on wf sensitivity requires further evaluation 5 conclusions in this study the sensitivity of wf to different input variables and parameters was comprehensively assessed using the oat and si methods this has revealed the sensitivity characteristics of the wfs of different crops to different input variables or parameters under different irrigation methods we have also determined the spatial variation of sensitivity the results of this study showed that 1 the wf of each crop was extremely sensitive to changes in eto and kctr generally sensitive to changes in ke mcc and pr and insensitive to changes in cdc dc hi0 and wp 2 the sensitivity of crop wf changed depending on the irrigation method the wf was most sensitive to changes in input variable or model parameter under the rainfed scenario 3 the sensitivity of wfb was always higher than that of the wfg under the same irrigation method the wf of maize was the most sensitive compared to that of the other crops 4 there were significant spatial differences in the sensitivity of wf spatially maize was the crop most sensitive to eto and ke while wheat was most sensitive to kctr overall wf was sensitive in maize and soybean under the southern irrigation scenario however the opposite was true under the rainfed scenario there was no significant spatial variation in the sensitivity of rice wf this analysis

9399,owing to increasingly limited water resources evaluating large scale regional crop water footprints wfs within acceptable errors is the basis for efficiency and productivity improvements for sustainable agriculture however quantitative sensitivity analysis of outputs to inputs and parameters of advanced and widely used crop wf accounting models are still lacking in this study we evaluated the spatial and temporal sensitivity of the blue and green wfs of crops to key input variables based on year by year simulations for wheat rice maize and soybean production in china from 2010 to 2019 we employed one of the most widely used aquacrop models to test different water supply and irrigation scenarios nine input variables or model parameters were selected including reference evapotranspiration eto crop transpiration coefficient kctr soil evaporation coefficient ke maximum canopy cover mcc precipitation pr canopy decline coefficient cdc planting density of the crop dc reference harvest index hi0 and normalised water productivity wp the results showed that crop wfs are generally more sensitive to eto among the input variables and kctr and ke among the model parameters we also found that the blue wf was more sensitive than the green wf in most cases wfs in rainfed scenarios were more sensitive to changes in input variables compared to wfs of irrigated crops of the four studied crops the wfs of maize and wheat were more sensitive than the wfs of rice and soybean wheat maize and soybean also showed a visible spatial variation in the sensitivity of the wf to each input variable overall the wf sensitivity was influenced by crop type water supply irrigation method and regional climate features the current analysis provides a feasible approach to comprehensively identify the key inputs and parameters to be calibrated for accurate crop wf accounting graphical abstract ga1 abbreviations wf water footprint wfb blue water footprint wfg green water

crises are becoming critical jägermeyr et al 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 to ensure food security maintain human well being and achieve sustainable development goals such as zero hunger it is crucial to manage and utilize scarce water resources to achieve maximum crop per drop godfray et al 2010 grafton et al 2010 2018 tilman et al 2011 the water footprint wf of crop production has been widely determined as a comprehensive measure of the consumption of different types of water resources at different spatial and temporal scales as well as its impact on the environment hoekstra 2003 the wfs can be divided into blue green and grey blue wf is the consumption of surface water and groundwater irrigation water by crops while green wf is the consumption of precipitation water mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 grey wf is the quantity of water required to assimilate pollutants and as such are not relevant to this study mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in recent years an increasing number of studies have used a variety of models to conduct extensive studies on wf simulations in crop production at different spatiotemporal scales feng et al 2021 current computational models can record crop wfs at temporal scales of days months and years gao et al 2021 hoekstra 2017 tuninetti et al 2015 in addition advanced assessments based on a distributed hydrological model coupled with a water balance method have been conducted at spatial scales as small as an irrigation district gao et al 2021 luan et al 2018 and as large as a river basin albers et al 2021 xie et al 2020 grid based high spatial resolution crop wf evaluated at larger spatial scales is more common in crop water productivity or hydrological models the most used models include the environmental policy integrated climate epic siebert and doll 2010 the gis based epic gepic liu 2009 and cropwat likely soil water balance mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 models all of which are used at a global scale the aquacrop model is another commonly used model that can not only be used at global scales mialyk et al 2022 but also at national scales zhuo et al 2016a the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto 2009 has been the most widely applied in recent years because it seeks a balance between accuracy model complexity and stability furthermore the aquacrop model consists of various functions such as simulating crop growth and separating crop transpiration and soil evaporation it also optimises irrigation systems with limited data which is highly intuitive and has a wide range of applications the combined daily crop wf module chukalla et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016b enables the calculation of regional wfs of crop production at multiple spatial and temporal scales distinguishing the impacts of different irrigation methods mao et al 2021 mialyk et al 2021 wang et al 2019 considering that crop wf simulations rely on several modelling structures input parameters and assumptions about the datasets utilised using different input variables or parameters can result in significantly different wf quantification results for the same region from the same model tuninetti et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 therefore evaluation of the accuracy and reliability of the reported magnitude spatial and temporal heterogeneities in each component of the wfs of crop production is crucial for further usage of these simulation outputs chenoweth et al 2014 sensitivity analysis is an efficient way to quantitatively identify key input variables and model parameters that visibly impact the simulation outputs when there are minor biases in each of these inputs or parameters to date only two relatively comprehensive sensitivity analyses tuninetti et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 have been made on large scale crop wf estimation zhuo et al 2014 focused on the four major crops in the yellow river basin of china and used the cropwat likely soil water balance model to analyse the sensitivity of the crop wfs to seven parameters and input variables using the one at a time oat method daniel 1973 they found that the reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient were the most sensitive parameters however this was only valid at the river basin scale tuninetti et al 2015 later applied a normalised sensitivity index si at the global scale to test the sensitivity of crop wf estimates to input variables based on crop water requirement assessments they claimed that the crop yield cy defined the spatial patterns of crop wfs and revealed the sensitivity differences between crops and regions despite these studies there is still a lack of comprehensive quantitative sensitivity analysis of model outputs to input variables or parameters for the models mentioned above the oat method is more capable of expressing the overall sensitivity of the study area under different amplitudes while the si method is better at reflecting the spatial variation of sensitivity however there is no precedent for using both methods to combine their advantages in view of this in this study we applied the aquacrop model to calculate the blue and green wfs of wheat rice maize and soybean in china on a yearly basis from 2010 to 2019 the sensitivity of crop wf to key model parameters and input variables and their spatial and temporal heterogeneities were quantitatively evaluated by applying the oat and si methods currently china is amongst the world s leading producers and consumers of rice wheat maize and soybean with rice and wheat yields accounting for 30 and 18 of the global yield respectively maize production in china accounts for 23 of the global production which is second only to the united states while china s soybean yield is the fourth highest in the world the total harvested area of the crops in this study accounts for 89 of the harvested area of all food crops in china nbsc 2021 henan and heilongjiang provinces are the regions with the highest total cys while tibet and qinghai have the lowest fig 1 the aims of this study were to 1 test the suitability of the aquacrop model which so far has not been used to determine the sensitivity of wf of crop production 2 involve comprehensive model parameters in wf determination 3 distinguish the water supply and irrigation methods of various crops in detail and 4 study the amplitude and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the sensitivity of wf of crop production using both oat and si methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 sensitivity analysis 2 1 1 one at a time oat method the oat method is one of the quick and effective sensitivity analysis methods and it evaluates the effect of changes in input values by changing only one parameter or input variable at a time daniel 1973 hamby 1994 this method has been widely used because of its simplicity and practicality berezowski et al 2015 fersch et al 2020 goyal 2004 saltelli and annoni 2010 but it is rarely used in the field of wf assessment calculations zhuo et al 2014 in this study we used the oat method to analyse the effect of each input value on the output values of cy crop water use cwu and crop wf under different irrigation and water supply scenarios for each meteorological station unit each input variable or model parameter varied within a certain range and the response of each output to the change in the input variable or model parameter was recorded the sensitivity curves for each crop were then plotted using the station data combined with box line plots this allowed us to characterise the average annual response of the sensitivity of the four crops to changes in each input value as well as to evaluate the effect of those changes on the three output values for each input variable or model parameter sensitivity analyses were conducted with variations in amplitude of 5 and overall variations of 20 allen et al 1998 zhuo et al 2014 2 1 2 sensitivity index si a dimensionless relative si in conjunction with existing sensitivity analysis methods tuninetti et al 2015 was used to quantify to response of cwu cy and wf to variations in each input variable or model parameter this method was also used to analyse the spatial variations in the sensitivity to changes in the input variables or model parameters values were normalised to allow for sensitivity size comparisons between the parameters comparisons and spatial analyses were performed using the following equation 1 si 1 n i 1 n z x δ x i z x z x δ x i x where z is the output variable of the simulation x is the parameter or input variable value xi is the i th adjustment value of the variable and n is the number of adjustments the final si value was the arithmetic mean of n cases within the range of changes 20 in this study the sensitivities of cwu cy and wf to changes in the input variables or model parameters were divided into three categories if the si value was greater than 0 6 or less than 0 6 the input variable was classified as extremely sensitive if si was between 0 6 and 0 1 or 0 6 and 0 1 the input variable was classified as generally sensitive if si was between 0 1 and 0 1 the input variable was classified as insensitive 0 1 si 0 1 2 2 quantifying the water footprint of crop production the blue and green wfs m3 t were defined as the daily accumulation of blue and green evapotranspiration et m3 ha divided by cy t ha during the crop growing period mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in this analysis the wf was estimated based on site scale modelling by crop and year by distinguishing between rainfed and irrigated scenarios and different irrigation methods the site locations with rainfed or irrigated scenarios were identified according to the map of rainfed and irrigated croplands in the mirca2000 dataset portmann et al 2010 for each site daily et and cy under rainfed or different irrigation scenarios were simulated by the aquacrop model in the model for wheat maize and soybeans the corresponding surface soil wetness characterisation parameters were set for different irrigation methods furrow 80 sprinkler 100 and micro irrigation 40 chukalla et al 2015 wang et al 2019 two types of irrigation scenarios furrow and water demanding irrigation were used for rice which set the water depth and consumption parameters at different times dong et al 2020 pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 we calibrated the average levels of simulated cy values for the sites located within the same province to match the provincial cy statistics as per the methods of mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 mialyk et al 2022 and yang et al 2021 the average simulated cy was weighted by the areas of rainfed and irrigated croplands as well as the extent of different irrigation methods to the provincial irrigated area due to data limitation only provincial level statistics were available and the spatial differences in terms of contribution by different irrigation methods to irrigated area were not considered following the methods of wang et al 2019 after calibration the spatial variations in cy and et generated wf continually to show the impacts from diverse climate water stress and irrigation methods yang et al 2021 the provincial

productivity driven crop model hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 which can simulate the growth process and cy of different crops in response to regional soil climate groundwater and field management conditions it can also better simulate the cy response mechanism at the micro level steduto et al 2009 it has been favoured by researchers in numerous countries because of its high accuracy low number of parameters and balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness steduto et al 2009 the soil water dynamic balance based on the root zone in the aquacrop model was calculated

following the method used by wang et al 2019 it was possible to break down the specific irrigation situation at the provincial scale for each of the four crops based on the proportion of different water saving irrigation techniques used in provincial total crop harvested area as reported in the statistical yearbooks nbsc 2021 combined with mirca2000 database portmann et al 2010 the irrigation methods for wheat maize and soybean included furrow irrigation micro irrigation sprinkler irrigation and rainfed as rice is a wet crop in paddy fields its irrigation methods were divided into furrow irrigation and water demanding irrigation de parameter values were obtained from raes et al 2017 except for maximum root depth zx and harvest index hi which were obtained from allen et al 1998 annual mean atmospheric co2 concentrations were obtained from the mauna loa observatory hawaii noaa 2018 the various sensitive factors involved in the calibration and wf evaluation of aquacrop models were divided into two categories input variables and model parameters kersebaum et al 2016 martini 2018 mohammadi et al 2016 tuninetti et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 the input variables contained reference

an increase in the national average yield of soybean maize wheat and rice which was accompanied by a significant decrease in the unit wf of each crop 6 9 6 8 9 8 and 0 2 respectively fig 2a the components of wf contributing to the decline varied among crops for wheat the wf decline was due to an 18 2 decrease in wfb each year while the wf decrease observed for maize and rice was dominated by wfg decreases of 9 4 and 6 1 respectively there were also differences in the wfb and wfg components depending on the crop and irrigation practice fig 2b f this was shown by a 6 2 decrease in wheat wfb under the furrow irrigation scenario as well as a 7 6 and 8 8 decrease in soybean wfb in the micro irrigation and sprinkler irrigation scenarios respectively furthermore there was a 14 3 decrease in maize wfg under the rainfed scenario and a 14 3 decrease in rice wfg in the furrow irrigation and de scenarios the decadal variation in wfb and wfg components was not significant however wfg in the de scenario was 42 5 higher on average than the furrow irrigation scenario there was a national increase of 84 49 gm³ y 15 4 in total wf between 2010 and 2019 the areas with high total wf values and the most significant increases were found in the northern and central regions while lower values and smaller increases were observed in the eastern and southern regions fig 3a b the results also showed that the main irrigation method was furrow irrigation fig 3c d areas with a high total wfb were mainly concentrated in the arid and semi arid regions in the west where there was low precipitation in xinjiang and tibet 81 6 and 86 5 of the water supply method in 2019 was irrigation water respectively in addition 59 8 of the irrigation in xinjiang in 2019 was through micro irrigation a 22 2 increase since 2010 however in tibet 85 5 of the irrigation in 2019 was using furrow irrigation which was a 14 3 decrease compared to 2010 the percentage of total wfb in individual northern regions was lower compared to that in other regions with the rainfed scenario accounting for over 50 of the total wf in inner mongolia liaoning jilin and heilongjiang these northern regions did however see an increase in the proportion of total wfb over the observed time period detailed information on the changes in irrigated crop area in different provinces over 10 years under different water supply and irrigation scenarios is presented in table s1 5 overall the area occupied by furrow irrigation decreased over the decade while the area occupied by micro irrigation sprinkler irrigation rainfed and de increased 3 2 crop wf sensitivity based on the oat method fig 4 shows the responses of cy cwug and cwub to changes in each of the higher sensitivity input variables or parameters these changes varied in magnitude depending on water supply irrigation scenario and crop type overall when eto and kctr were overestimated cy cwug and cwub were also overestimated by the irrigation scenario however cy was underestimated in the rainfed scenario the sensitivity of maize wheat and soybean cy to each input value was generally higher in the rainfed scenario than that in the irrigation scenario whereas rice cy was not sensitive to any of the parameters for example a 20 overestimation in eto and kctr resulted in an approximately 5 overestimation in cy for maize and soybeans in the irrigated scenario but a 5 10 underestimation in the rainfed scenario wheat was the most sensitive crop when eto and kctr were overestimated or underestimated by 20 respectively under the rainfed scenario the cy of wheat could be underestimated or overestimated by approximately 5 15 which reflected the large differences in the sensitivity of wheat cy to eto and kctr in different regions cwub was strongly affected by changes in the input values than that by cwug which was in turn more strongly affected when compared to cy changes in eto and kctr of 20 resulted in variations in cwub for each crop by approximately 15 and 25 respectively the same variation in eto and kctr resulted in variations in cwug for each crop by approximately 10 among them for changes in eto the cwub and cwug sensitivity responses of rice under the de scenario differed considerably for example when eto was overestimated by 20 the rice cwub and cwug in the de scenario were overestimated by approximately 5 and 15 respectively the results for mcc are notable as each crop showed a decrease in cwub in the micro irrigation scenario regardless of whether mcc increased or decreased the decrease was most sensitive for wheat where a 20 overestimation or underestimation in mcc resulted in an underestimation in cwub of approximately 5 for the other irrigation methods the cwub of each crop basically showed a negative correlation with the change in mcc soybean cy was also very sensitive to mcc as a 20 increase in mcc resulted in a 4 increase in soybean cy in the rainfed scenario and a 4 decrease in the irrigated scenario fig s1 cwug and cwub responded in opposite directions to changes in pr for each crop type under the same irrigation scenario and cy responded in opposite directions to changes in pr under rainfed and irrigated scenarios fig s1 when pr was overestimated cwug was also overestimated while cwub was underestimated this is consistent with the actual scenario that when precipitation was sufficient irrigation water use decreased and crop use of precipitation during growth increased when pr was overestimated by 20 crop cwug was roughly overestimated by 5 with rice showing the largest increased in the diffuse irrigation scenario with the cwug increment reaching approximately 10 as for cwub when the pr was overestimated by 20 cwub was roughly underestimated by 6 for each crop with rice showing the largest reduction in cwub of up to 10 under the water demanding irrigation scenario it is important to note that eto ke figs s2 3 and kctr will influence crop water demand soil evaporation and crop transpiration respectively as a result when these three inputs increase cwub and cwug will increase for each crop under the irrigation scenario however when pr decreased irrigation water use increased to maintain the basic water demand of the crop fig s3 meanwhile as the mcc increased crops with larger canopies tended to cause low soil water evaporation due to increased shading of the soil therefore the correlation of cwub to pr and mcc is the opposite of the correlation between cwub and eto kctr and ke fig 5 shows the responses of wfg wfb and wf to changes in each of the higher sensitivity input variables or parameters wf was determined by the combined effect of cwu and cy as a ratio as the sensitivities of cy and cwu to each input value are similar most of the changes in input variables affect wf and cwu in similar ways even though cy is much less sensitive than cwu the sensitivity of wfb to each input variable or model parameter was higher overall than that of wfg under the same irrigation method the wfg of each crop also had a significantly higher response to each input value under the rainfed scenario compared to that of the other irrigation scenarios in addition the wfg wfb and wf of each crop was positively correlated to eto kctr and ke but negatively correlated to mcc figs s4 6 when eto ke and kctr were overestimated by 20 the wf of each crop in the irrigation scenario was overestimated by approximately 10 20 3 6 and 10 15 respectively when corresponding to the above three input values wheat had the strongest sensitivity relative to the other crops in general as indicated by these results the sensitivity of wf to changes in ke was significantly lower for each crop under the micro irrigation scenario compared to that of the other irrigation methods when mcc was underestimated the wf of most crops remained unchanged under all the irrigation scenarios except for the wheat which was underestimated notably under the micro irrigation scenario when mcc was overestimated the change in the sensitivity curve for each crop was consistent under different irrigation methods an overestimation in mcc of 20 resulted in a wf underestimation of approximately 4 for most crops and a decrease in wf of approximately 6 for rice fig s6 since the sensitivities of wfb and wfg to pr were opposite to each other pr had the lowest effect on wf of all six input variables or model parameters the wfs of maize and soybeans were slightly more sensitive than those of wheat and rice with an overestimation of approximately 2 when pr was overestimated by 20 fig s6 when considered separately wfg and wfb were the most sensitive to eto under all types of irrigation scenarios wfb of rice was overestimated the most when eto was overestimated by 20 with approximately a 10 increment while wfg of rice was overestimated by approximately 20 and 30 under the furrow irrigation and de scenarios respectively for rainfed scenarios a 20 overestimation in eto resulted in the mean wfg values of maize and wheat reaching approximately 55 and 45 of the value added respectively and a nearly 20 overestimation of wfg in soybean as the box in the box line chart is away from the mean this indicated that the sensitivity of wfg to eto varied significantly for maize and wheat in different regions which affected the overall mean value distribution the sensitivity of wf to kctr was slightly lower than that of eto one of the most important features of the aquacrop model is that et can be split into crop transpiration and soil evaporation and therefore kctr and ke are crucial for this model when kctr was overestimated by 20 the variation of wfg and wfb for each crop in the irrigation scenario ranged from 5 to 10 and 15 25 respectively reaching nearly 30 incremental variation for the wfg of maize and wheat in the rainfed scenario and approximately 15 for soybean when ke was overestimated by 20 wf was overestimated for all crops but there were large differences between the irrigation scenarios the increment in wf was nearly doubled in the furrow and sprinkler scenario compared to the micro irrigation scenario 3 3 temporal and spatial crop wf sensitivity based on si analysis to further investigate the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of the sensitivity of each crop to different water supply and irrigation scenarios si analyses were conducted for the selected input variables or parameters in turn sensitivity analysis was conducted using the si method and box plots of the sensitivity of wf to each parameter were obtained for different water supply and irrigation methods fig 6 fig 6 shows that for most input variables the sensitivity of wf was significantly higher under the rainfed scenario than that under the irrigated scenario among the input variable category factors wf was extremely sensitive to eto and generally sensitive to pr among the model parameter category factors wf was extremely sensitive to kctr followed by ke mcc and pr which were classified as generally sensitive parameters the si values for each crop ke were generally positive and ranged from about 0 2 0 4 while si values for mcc and pr were both positive and negative for example the si values of mcc for maize and wheat were mostly positive under the rainfed scenario and the mean value was approximately 0 3 but mostly negative under the irrigated scenario as another example the si values of mcc in rice were negative but positive in soybean the remaining input variables cdc dc hi0 and wp were classified as insensitive in most cases there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of wf to each parameter under different irrigation methods for example for maize the sensitivity of wf to changes in eto and ke was only slightly lower under the micro irrigation scenario than that under the furrow irrigation and sprinkler irrigation scenarios similarly wf was only slightly more sensitive to changes in kctr under the micro irrigation scenario than that under the furrow irrigation and sprinkler irrigation scenarios only the wfs of wheat and maize were generally sensitive to changes in cdc and hi0 under the rainfed scenario the spatial variation in sensitivity of wf to each input variable was the lowest for rice as shown in fig 7 there were significant spatial differences in the sensitivity of wf to eto for all four crops there were also significant spatial differences between the wf of the same crop under irrigated and rainfed scenarios in general under the irrigation scenario the wfs to eto of maize and soybean had a low sensitivity in the northern temperate continental climate region which was also the main production area of maize and soybeans in china but a high sensitivity in the southern subtropical monsoon climate region however under the rainfed scenario the wfs were highly sensitive in the northern temperate continental climate region with a low sensitivity in the southern subtropical monsoon climate region the four northern provinces of inner mongolia liaoning jilin and heilongjiang are the largest rainfed maize and soybean producing regions accounting for 52 and 73 of the total maize and soybean production in 2019 respectively while crop wf has the highest sensitivity to eto in these regions an exception to this trend was observed for the wf of wheat which was extremely sensitive to changes eto in the northern and southern regions si 1 under the irrigation scenario and less sensitive in the central temperate monsoon climate regions si 0 7 the central temperate monsoon region was represented by the henan anhui and jiangsu provinces whose total wheat production accounted for nearly 40 of the national total in 2019 and the wf had a relatively low sensitivity to eto in these regions the wf of rice was the most sensitive to changes in eto among all four crops with si values greater than 0 8 however there were no significant differences in this sensitivity between regions as shown in fig 8 the sensitivity of the wfs of all four crops to changes in kctr was higher under the rainfed scenario than that under the irrigation scenario in addition under the three irrigation methods the sensitivity of the wfs of maize and soybean to changes in kctr was lowest in the northern temperate continental climate region which was the main production area for both the crops and highest in the southern subtropical monsoon region the lowest sensitivity was found in shanxi province si 0 2 whereas the highest sensitivity in guangdong fujian and zhejiang si 0 9 however under the rainfed scenario the spatial distribution of wf sensitivity for soybean was consistent the wf of wheat was highly sensitive to changes in kctr in northern and southern china but had low sensitivity in central china the wf of rice was highly sensitive to changes in kctr across all regions with no significant spatial variation as shown in fig 9 the sensitivity of wf to ke for each crop was the lowest in the micro scenario and there were large differences between different crops water supply and irrigation methods the sensitivity of maize wf to ke under the furrow and sprinkler scenarios was consistent overall 0 3 si 0 5 and the lowest sensitivity was found in shanxi province si 0 2 the sensitivity of maize wf to ke under the rainfed scenario was significantly higher in the northern temperate continental climate zone than in the southern subtropical monsoon climate zone while negative si values existed at some stations in inner mongolia and xinjiang in the northern region and wf was negatively correlated with ke the sensitivity of soybean wf to ke was overall lower than that of maize while the sensitivity to ke under the furrow and sprinkler scenarios was slightly higher in the northern temperate continental climate zone which is also the main soybean producing area in china than in the southern subtropical monsoon climate zone but the opposite was true under the micro and rainfed scenarios the sensitivity of wheat wf to ke in all three irrigation scenarios followed a higher distribution pattern in the south 0 4 si 0 6 than that in the north 0 si 0 2 this distribution pattern may be related to the wheat species since the southern subtropical monsoon climate zone of china is dominated by winter wheat while the northern temperate continental climate zone is dominated by spring wheat the wf of wheat under the rainfed scenario is not sensitive to ke overall except for southwest china especially yunnan province where some sites have si values as high as 0 6 and there are also sites with negative correlation sensitivity relationships for rice its wf was more sensitive to ke but there were no significant spatial differences 4 discussion in this study we presented the first detailed synergistic sensitivity analysis of the wf of crop production in china at the site scale based on the aquacrop model and by application of the oat and si methods with a careful delineation of water supply and irrigation methods the results of the study showed that although aquacrop is relatively complex in terms of parameter settings and model mechanisms we still found some common conclusions when compared with previous studies tuninetti et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 we found that eto is the most sensitive input value and wfb is more sensitive than wfg at the same time we focused on the impact of more input variables and parameters on wf and found some novel patterns notably eto kctr and ke had the same trend in sensitivity changes and eto and kctr were the most sensitive factors in the input variable categories and model parameter categories respectively this was because both kctr and ke are values directly related to et since aquacrop is a water driven model the crop yield is determined based on water consumption and et directly affects crop fertility the sensitivity of ke was significantly lower than that of kctr since crop transpiration directly affects crop growth and development while soil evaporation is often considered as ineffective evaporation which mainly affects crop fertility indirectly through the combined effect on soil moisture content and field microenvironment one of the significant advantages of the aquacrop model is that it can differentiate et into crop transpiration and soil evaporation to better simulate the actual water consumption of crops however in the current studies of aquacrop accounting for large scale regional crop wfs there is a tendency to use rough values for kctr and ke and little consideration has been given to the impact of regional differences and different water supply methods on wf accuracy under the effect of kctr and ke therefore it is necessary to determine the accuracy of kctr and ke for the wf sensitive areas and highly sensitive water supply methods mentioned in here mcc refers to the proportion of plant leaf cover at the soil surface in its maximum state which mainly affects photosynthesis and the transpiration of crops in general crops with greater canopy cover genotypes intercept more solar radiation during growth while shading more land to reduce inefficient soil evaporation and increase water use efficiency deery et al 2021 notably the increase in cy for mcc tended to decrease under the irrigated scenario while the opposite was true for the rainfed scenario this was probably due to the fact that there was no water stress in the fully irrigated scenario and if the mcc was very large resulting in mutual shading of crop canopies between rows it may have negative effects on crop photosynthesis which in turn may have negative feedback on crop fertility in contrast a larger mcc in the rainfed scenario will promote the full utilisation of water in the crop and soil compensating for the negative effect on crop fertility due to insufficient photosynthesis thus the cultivation of crops with larger mcc genotypes can further reduce wf and improve the crop water use efficiency while also increasing the crop yield to some extent in rainfed areas which is one of the parameters of great practical importance it should be particularly emphasised that spatial factors must be given sufficient attention in the process of wf accurate assessments and model calibration the sensitivity of crops in different regions to various input variables varies greatly due to a combination of factors such as temperature rainfall crop characteristics and the role of the environment thus their values are not consistent the focus should be on areas where wf has a strong sensitivity to different model parameters and input variables eliminating the influence of spatial factors in large regional wf accounting for the less sensitive or even insensitive areas generalised fixed values can be considered for the parameters involved to reduce time and opportunity costs in the process of accurate wf assessment and model calibration the strong sensitivity areas involved in this study can provide a reference for subsequent studies to consider the impact of spatial factors on wf errors the results of this study provide a set of feasible methods and ideas for accurate wf assessments and model calibration from the perspective of both model input variables and parameters as well as a preliminary understanding of the possible effects of climate variables such as eto and pr on crop wf the method can be applied not only to the aquacrop model based wf assessment but also extended to other models however there are still some limitations and shortcomings in the current analysis for example we had only focused on the sensitivity of the wf of crop production and have not discussed the uncertainty which is one of the sources of errors in wf simulation calculations in addition we evaluated the wfs for four food crops wheat rice maize and soybean and have not investigated other cash crops such as potatoes furthermore this was a site scale based study since parameter sensitivity is affected by scale simulations at different scales may produce different degrees of sensitivity zhuo et al 2014 at the same time there is still a lack of crop wf sensitivity analysis based on field trial measurements which is equally essential for model based work on large scale wf precision assessments further studies are required to determine if the same sensitivity variation exists in field watersheds or at other scales finally we determined values of wf using aquacrop which is a water driven model the impact of different models such as cropwat and gepic on wf sensitivity requires further evaluation 5 conclusions in this study the sensitivity of wf to different input variables and parameters was comprehensively assessed using the oat and si methods this has revealed the sensitivity characteristics of the wfs of different crops to different input variables or parameters under different irrigation methods we have also determined the spatial variation of sensitivity the results of this study showed that 1 the wf of each crop was extremely sensitive to changes in eto and kctr generally sensitive to changes in ke mcc and pr and insensitive to changes in cdc dc hi0 and wp 2 the sensitivity of crop wf changed depending on the irrigation method the wf was most sensitive to changes in input variable or model parameter under the rainfed scenario 3 the sensitivity of wfb was always higher than that of the wfg under the same irrigation method the wf of maize was the most sensitive compared to that of the other crops 4 there were significant spatial differences in the sensitivity of wf spatially maize was the crop most sensitive to eto and ke while wheat was most sensitive to kctr overall wf was sensitive in maize and soybean under the southern irrigation scenario however the opposite was true under the rainfed scenario there was no significant spatial variation in the sensitivity of rice wf this analysis
