16425,eukaryotic pathogens including fungi and enteroparasites infect humans animals and plants as integrators of landscape catchment lakes can reflect and record biological and geochemical events or anthropogenic changes and provide useful knowledge to formulate public health food security and water policies to manage and prevent diseases in this context potentially pathogenic fungi and parasites were sampled using 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in 382 lakes displaying a broad range of sizes and human impact on the watershed in 10 ecozones across canada based on pathogen classifications from the epathogen database published by the public health agency of canada we identified 23 health relevant genera for human and animal hosts including cryptococcus and cryptosporidium our study investigated the potential of remote sensing and geomatics to predict microbial contamination in a tele epidemiological approach we used boosted regression tree modeling to evaluate the probability of occurrence of the most common genera found in our dataset based on 10 satellite derivable geomatics and field survey variables which could be potential sources or transport mechanisms through the watershed or survival factors in the water we found that southern ecozones that possess the highest agricultural and pasture activities tend to contain lakes with the largest number of potential pathogens including several fungi associated with plant diseases bio optical factors such as colored dissolved organic matter were highly related to the occurrence of the genera potentially by protecting against damage from ultraviolet light our results demonstrate the capability of tele epidemiology to provide useful information to develop government policies for recreational and drinking

integrators and receptors of watersheds lakes contain bacterial composition profiles which to some degree reflect the specific anthropogenic activities within the watershed kraemer et al 2020 the presence of pathogenic species in sentinel lakes could reveal a source of contamination leaking into the water ecosystem and signal the possible presence of diseases associated with various hosts i e human animal or plant water quality monitoring for waterborne diseases currently relies on the detection of fecal indicators e g escherichia coli enterococcus for public health decisions regarding the potability of water and the opening of beaches for recreational water activities ashbolt et al 2001 health canada 2012 for example enteroparasites such as giardia or cryptosporidium are responsible for many worldwide waterborne diseases outbreaks in human and animal populations efstratiou et al 2017 across canada such outbreaks have occurred several times cryptosporidium 7 recorded outbreaks giardia 42 schistosoma 1 and toxoplasma gondii 1 between 1980 and 2000 krewski et al 2002 yet these pathogens responsible for waterborne diseases are not always linked to fecal indicators korajkic et al 2018 and other water associated diseases can be found in recreational waters pathogenic fungi can infect multiple hosts through different transmission routes e g cutaneous respiratory ingestive and can be highly resilient in the environment fisher et al 2012 however in canada fungi are generally reported as plant diseases dukstra et al 2018 but not as waterborne diseases krewski et al 2002 even though they can also infect animals and humans for example cryptococcus gatti is responsible for cryptococcosis in southwestern canada kidd et al 2007 where it has the highest reported incidence of infection globally in general fungi even those that are not specifically pathogenic are neglected in aquatic research grossart et al 2019 while health relevant enteroparasites are extensively covered by the literature geospatial and remote sensing methodologies applied to epidemiology i e tele epidemiology have been increasingly developed in the last few years for water quality monitoring brazeau et al 2016 kotchi et al 2014 tele epidemiology was implemented in canada for waterborne diseases mainly e coli and microbial resistance and vector borne diseases e g lyme disease west nile virus and could benefit from expansion to other health relevant fields remote sensing enables the measurement of various biological and physical properties with higher time frequency wider spatial scale and reduced cost compared to field sampling in canada land use products are available at the continental scale north american land change monitoring system 2020 and though the remote sensing approaches are more complex than on land or in the open ocean recent studies have developed algorithms to estimate secchi depth in lakes deutsch et al 2021 and other bio optical components such as chlorophyll or colored dissolved organic matter cdom brezonik et al 2005 cardille et al 2013 koll egyed et al 2021 olmanson et al 2016 2008 sayers et al 2015 thus predictive models of microbial contamination in lakes can be enhanced by the inclusion of satellite resolved variables such an approach may be particularly relevant for remote communities with limited access to water quality monitoring and assessment this study provides distributions of potentially pathogenic eukaryotic genera ppg i e fungi and protists identified in 382 diverse lakes spanning the longitudinal extent of canada using 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing we then prepare for tele epidemiological approaches by using a boosted regression tree model brt to assess the potential of variables that could be derived from remote sensing products i e bio optical components and public geomatics data with wide spatial coverage to predict the occurrences of ppg our aim was to investigate the potential of tele epidemiology with in situ and geospatial data to provide information on threats associated with contamination sources and mechanisms within the watersheds we suggest upscaling the predictions to new lakes using either in situ data or direct satellite measurements to generate nationwide maps 2 materials and method 2 1 sampling area as part of the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc canadian lake pulse network huot et al 2019 we collected epilimnion water for molecular genetic analysis in 382 canadian lakes for three summers june september from 2017 to 2019 fig 1 each lake was sampled once within the three year period the study area extended over 10 ecozones in canada lakes were selected using a stratified random method according to their ecozone size and a human impact index as described in huot et al 2019 bio optical measurements and variables potentially relevant to explaining the presence of microorganisms were also collected on site and are provided in table 1 2

sequencing of 250 bp paired end reads as three separate sequencing runs on an illumina miseq platform 2 2 4 sequence inference and taxonomic assignment primer sequences were trimmed from raw sequence

database v 4 12 0 guillou et al 2013 potentially spurious asvs were removed by visually inspecting a multiple sequence alignment performed in mafft katoh et al 2019 raw sequence data are available from the european nucleotide archive under study accession prjeb42538 2 2 5 potentially pathogenic eukaryotic genera ppg of interest were extracted from the amplicon dataset according to the epathogen risk group database public health agency of canada 2021 we used a partial matching function in r 4 0 2 between pathogenic genera names considered at least in the risk group 2 table 2 by the public health agency of canada phac 2018 and the taxonomic classifications from pr2 thereby we examined the sequences classified to the genus level 2 3 geomatics and remote sensing derived variables herein we both test hypotheses related to specific relationships such as links between fecal pathogens and potential sources i e manure animal density population density and carry out exploratory research to better understand the relationships between the distributions of ppg and variables that have been poorly explored in the literature i e bio optical measurements we avoided multicollinearity by ensuring that the final selected set would have 1 a pearson correlation of less than 0 7 fig s1 and 2 a variance inflation factor vif below 10 as evaluated using generalized linear models dormann et al 2013 we considered key independent variables potentially involved in the cycle of lake contamination as 1 sources of contamination 2 transport factors in the watershed or 3 survival factors in the watershed or in the lake the selected variables are summarised in table 1 bio optical variables used in this study were not direct satellite measurements and were instead in situ variables sampled during the lake pulse campaign which could be used for which algorithms have been or are being developed 2 4 statistical analysis and map predictions brt were used to model the distributions of ppg explained by the environmental variables a brt combines regression trees and boosting to improve predictive performance elith et al 2008 boost enables the growth of several trees that use the independent variables to split the observations into two groups those weak classifiers i e individual trees are then merged into a strong classifier that is regulated by a learning rate and tuning parameters the strength of relationships between dependent and independent variables are estimated as relative influence ri ri corresponds to the number of times a variable is selected for splitting averaged over all weak learners and weighted by the squared improvement to the model at each split the score is rescaled so that the combined influence of all independent variables adds up to 100 for each model a brt was trained on the occurrence probabilities of each ppg found in the lakes using a bernoulli distribution and the ppg richness present at each lake pp g all using a poisson distribution we used the gbm step function from the dismo r package elith et al 2008 to fit the models calc deviance to calculate the residual deviance from the final predictions and plot gbm from gbm ridgeway 2020 to obtain the ri tables first we find the highest learning rate lr 0 05 which reaches a minimal deviance for most of the ppg as we needed to reduce the processing time as occurrences and responses to independent variables varied greatly between the ppg we tuned parameters i e tree complexity tc bag fraction bf and step size ss through a hyper grid search table s1 for each combination we trained 5 successive 10 fold cross validated brt models and averaged the lowest root mean squared error rmse finally for each ppg we selected the combination with the lowest averaged rmse secondly we used the best combination of parameters for each ppg in a 1000 bootstrap resampling we extracted the medians for the predictions for the ri of each independent variable and for the model performance indicators over the bootstraps as final results for each ppg confidence intervals cis 2 5 97 5 were calculated for mapping and for ri partial plots model performances indicators were provided for the training data i e observed data and cross validation data cv i e cross validated predictions made on observed data to evaluate model classification between 0 and 1 we calculated the area under the curve of precision recall auc pr fig s2 using rocr sing et al 2005 auc pr is preferable for imbalanced datasets i e negative class 0 outnumbers the positive class 1 and emphasizes the positive class estimation saito and rehmsmeier 2015 which is preferable for public health application the baseline for auc pr is the ratio of positives p and negatives n as y p p n we calculated the difference between the baseline and the auc pr criterion in percentages maps to display observations predictions and cis for some ppg with higher public health interest as well as for all ppg pp g all were created using qgis 3 10 10 qgis development team 2020 probability of occurrence based on bernoulli distributions were classified into 4 categories absence probable absence probable presence and presence the auc pr value was used to separate presence from absence predictions and the range of cis was used to establish the categories the absence and presence categories are the ranges median prediction averaged cis median prediction averaged cis the probable presence category is the range median prediction median prediction averaged cis and the probable absence category is the range median prediction averaged cis median prediction table s2 3 results 3 1 occurrences of microorganisms in sampled canadian lakes of the 15 756 077 18s rrna gene sequences recovered from the 382 sampled lakes 23 ppg were identified across 104 asvs encompassing 63 464 sequences fig 2 number of asvs found per genus are shown in table s3 the richness of pp g all ranged from 0 to 13 ppg per lake the most relevant public health genus detected was the enteroparasite cryptosporidium n 70 18 3 of lakes genera detected within risk group 3 table 2 were cryptococcus n 232 60 7 of lakes and cladophialophora with very low occurrences n 9 2 4 of lakes and thus might be of lower health interest the rest of the ppg were ubiquitous fungi and yeasts found in the environment which can provoke opportunistic infections and they were classified in risk group 2 the most widely occurring genera were rhodotorula n 269 70 4 of lakes pythium n 235 61 5 of lakes and bipolaris n 204 53 4 of lakes the most rarely occurring ppg was leptosphaeria identified only once for brt statistical analysis we excluded microorganisms with 30 occurrences which left 15 genera 3 2 model performances and relative influence of geomatics and satellite derived data for each ppg the final predictive values had cv deviance explained ranging from 11 3 aspergillus to 46 5 alternaria table 3 with 41 6 for pp g all 42 9 for cryptococcus and 31 3 for cryptosporidium median model performances from 1000 bootstrap samples were better using training data than cv data table s4 auc pr criterion ranged from 22 8 aspergillus to 66 geotrichum trichosporon and sporobolomyces required lower lr and more processing time and were not analysed variables for predicting the presence of ppg were separated into two groups regarding their influence on the prediction using the method müller et al 2013 the first group above 10 had much greater influence on ppg distributions whereas the group below the threshold are not relevant for interpretation fig 3 a bio optical measurements and components a c d o m 280 tss z s e c c h i c h l a were key predictors for most of the ppg fig 3b increases in a c d o m 280 tended to be associated with higher occurrences of cryptosporidium ri 17 9 cryptococcus ri 12 7 pp g all ri 13 7 and the decline of rhodotorula ri 14 1 fig 4 tss was associated with more restricted occurrences of exophiala ri 24 4 candida and torula appeared to have an affinity for clearer water where the z s e c c h i was deeper ri 20 1 and 14 respectively while pythium and secchi depth link seem weaker ri 16 6 the presence of livestock in the watershed can also have significant effects on the occurrences of ppg ρ a n i m showed positive relationships with bipolaris ri 20 2 and probably alternaria ri 17 6 meteorological climatic and geographical variables were selected as the most important factors for three genera t a i r was positively related to aspergillus ri 18 4 and pichia ri 15 3 and a l a k e was also linked to ulocladium occurrences ri 16 7 the least influential on the ppg occurrences appeared to be f m a n u r e ρ p o p and σ p r e c i p 7 d 3 3 prediction maps based on observed data predictions were made for the spatial distribution of pp g all which presents the general trend of the ppg as well as the most relevant public health genera cryptococcus and cryptosporidium fig 5 pp g all showed an overall higher richness of ppg in the southern ecozones than in the north lakes with no ppg detected were in the boreal cordillera two lakes and one lake in each of the following ecozones mixedwood plains prairies atlantic maritimes pacific maritime and taiga cordillera only three lakes sampled hotspots of ppg were detected in the prairies as well as the eastern boreal shield and montane cordillera the brt correctly determined higher richness in the southern ecozones and the highest ppg richness were found in the three identified hotspots cis ranges indicate the degree of uncertainty in predicting distributions across new lakes the ci maximum range was 10 genera but most of the lakes contained cis between 1 and 6 genera a handful of lakes had higher uncertainties 6 cryptococcus was detected in all the sampled ecozones with hotspots in the pacific maritimes montane cordillera and eastern boreal shield cryptosporidium was less detected but was present in most of the ecozones except the taiga cordillera and occurred more frequently in the eastern atlantic regions predictions for cryptococcus below 0 8 ci range were accurately attributed to 205 lakes 53 7 of the full 382 observations table 4 out of 232 occurrences 166 71 6 were classified as presence 7 8 or probable presence 63 8 while out of the 150 absences 39 26 were classified in absence 0 07 or probable absence 25 3 cryptosporidium predictions were correct for 302 lakes 79 1 out of 382 and entirely correct for absences 96 8 with 45 2 absences and 51 6 probable absences the model did not provide accurate results for cis above 0 8 those included 70 occurrences cryptococcus cis showed high variability with most of the lakes above a 0 4 range the lowest error was associated with lakes in the pacific maritime and montane cordillera for cryptosporidium degrees of uncertainty were less than 0 2 in the boreal cordillera pacific maritime southern montane cordillera and northern atlantic maritimes uncertainties above 0 6 were found in a few lakes spread across the ecozones 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this study represents the first nationwide assessment of eukaryotic pathogens in canadian lakes to leverage geomatics and remote sensing techniques several governmental policies could benefit from using predictive maps produced from data with large space coverage to this end our work intended to show which variables could be used but it did not use satellite estimations with the ppg models for public health security that approach could be complementary to routine preventive sampling of microbial indicators such as e coli for recreational beach management ppg associated with specific sources of contaminations such as ρ a n i m and f m a n u r e could also inform public policies of possible leakages and lead to preventive actions 4 1 health relevance of the pathogens found in canadian lakes most of the ppg we found could be related to diseases that have been detected on canadian territory and thus they might pose a potential threat with the short fragment of the v7 region of the 18s rrna gene used in this study we cannot confidently resolve ppg to the species level nor perhaps more importantly identify virulence genes which are crucial indicators of pathogenicity nevertheless we assumed health relevance of the whole genus as this is how the phac classifies threats cryptosporidium and cryptococcus are of high interest for the public health security because of their association with zoonotic and anthroponotic disease transmission cryptosporidium is a well known enteroparasite present in wildlife livestock and human reservoirs zahedi and ryan 2020 and its prevalence has been studied regionally e g coklin et al 2007 heitman et al 2002 in different reservoirs c hominis and c parvum are the main species infecting humans and they are responsible for most waterborne outbreaks c hominis is specifically related to outbreaks in recreational waters with its major hosts being humans and domestics animals c parvum is most commonly found in cattle provoking high morbidity and mortality in canadian herds olson et al 2004 moreover many host adapted cryptosporidium in animals are probably limiting transmission to humans xiao and ryan 2004 and have more impact on young populations than juveniles and adults we examined the links between specific animal sub categories i e cattle calves and sheep see fig s4 with cryptosporidium but we did not find relationships remote locations where cryptosporidium was spotted could be associated either with wildlife or remote communities lacking adequate wastewater systems cryptococcus has high incidence of infection in western canada mainly on vancouver island where it can cause pulmonary and or central nervous system infections especially with c gattii kidd et al 2007 and some species could originate from bird feces nielsen et al 2007 it can also be found in southern québec associated with the species c fagisuga responsible for beech bark disease boyce 2009 which could explain its presence over eastern ecozones fig 5a cryptosporidium occurrence might be indicative of potential waterborne diseases directly linked to contaminated lakes whereas cryptococcus might not be always related to fecal pollution although present in many of the sampled lakes the risk of exposure likely remains small due to the remoteness or lack of recreational activities in these lakes while the most important public health pathogens are dispersed through the territory the highest ppg richness is localised in the southern ecozones which are more populated and possess most of the recreational activities and land use conversions fig 5c most of the other ppg are naturally occurring in the environment including probably most of the cryptococcus species thus their associated diseases might not specifically occur in the lake since lakes act as sentinels by integrating and reflecting watershed changes the presence of environmental ppg could inform potential disease threats within the catchments from the spatial distribution of the occurrences fig s5 we can observe that many ppg have restricted geographical areas especially in the agricultural regions of the prairies and boreal plains e g alternaria bipolaris metharhizium scytalidium ulocladium which suggest that they might be related to plant diseases pythium is mostly regarded as a plant parasite that causes root rot in soybean in alberta and manitoba li et al 2019 bipolaris is a well known fungus colonizing plants and crops especially with b sorokiniana in the prairies ecozone ghazvini and tekauz 2007 pichia p fermentans was investigated as a disease microbe in pome and stone fruits in canada giobbe et al 2007 alternaria is known for plant disease blackspot in rapeseed and mustard in central alberta meena et al 2010 mucor is associated with fruit tree diseases including peaches and pears in british columbia wallace et al 2018 scytalidium is well known for the plant disease gall rust in western parts of north america including alberta tsuneda et al 1980 it is harder to find specific studies for ulocladium and sordaria in canada but they might be considered potential plant disease agents according to the study of clear and patrick 1993 as for leptosphaeria that was found only once in the dataset they have been of concern in western canada for brassica i e cruciferous vegetable cultures kutcher et al 2007 metharizhium was isolated from plant roots in ontario and contains entomopathogenic species wyrebek et al 2011 these findings show that our approach could also benefit food security policies in agriculture and animal husbandry nosocomial infections are associated with a few ubiquitous ppg rhodotorula are common in any type of environment including human microbiomes and are emerging pathogens in hospital settings in canada rusthoven et al 1984 candida can cause various nosocomial infections the last identified emergent species of the genus in canada is c auris eckbo et al 2021 aspergillus provokes invasive pulmonary aspergillosis especially in nosocomial settings and was found in alberta schwartz et al 2020 there is less literature on the canadian relevance of the rarer ppg torula seems to be very rare through the literature as we only noticed the study of berger and langeron 1949 where a chromomycosis i e infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue was associated with the species t bergeri in canada trichosporon is present in soils and the human body where it can cause bloodstream infections it was reported in ontario herrera et al 2018 geotrichum is common in the environment in dairy production and beach sand and some of the species can infect humans such as g capitatum trabelsi et al 2015 sporobolomyces can cause cutaneous infections as in the case in ontario damji et al 2019 cyphellophora is a superficial colonizer that can provoke skin infections and it has been detected in human samples in canada feng et al 2013 cladophialophora is found in rotten plants and soil and caused brain abscess in humans and liver abscess in dogs in alberta badali et al 2010 acremonium is isolated from food and can cause diseases in multiple hosts summerbell et al 2018 exophiala is well known as an ectotherm species disease agent but can also infect humans de hoog et al 2011 4 2 links between environmental variables and ppg occurrences results from brt simulations indicate high variability in model performances between the ppg as most of the ppg detected are ubiquitous and can contain a wide spectrum of ecological diversity they are not specifically related to anthropic activities interpretations are based on independent variables with 10 ri fig s3 pp g all provides overall the most important factors associated with pathogen richness a higher richness seems to be associated with higher a c d o m 280 which potentially shields microbes from ultraviolet radiation in the water column williamson et al 2017 suggests that climate change is rapidly increasing the release of dissolved organic matter dom in inland waters through an increase in precipitations permafrost thaw and modification of the vegetation the growing release of dom can potentially reduce the inactivation of pathogens by sunlight some pathogens might be directly integrated from watershed contamination sources to the lake such as enteric pollution from manure or livestock by precipitations runoff or by wind dispersal just like pp g all fecal cryptosporidium occurrences are mainly associated with higher a c d o m 280 and not with a potential animal or human sources sunlight inactivation is well documented as sensitivity to ultraviolets and it has different survival outcomes between species king et al 2008 studies such as dungan 2010 identified many of the ppg as microorganisms commonly found in livestock operations such as swine barns cattle feedlots and or cattle sheds alternaria aspergillus bipolaris leptosphaeria mucor candida geotrichum torula and ulocladium alternaria and bipolaris are positively related to ρ a n i m where animals could potentially be fed with barley and other cereals affected by this type of plant pathogen torula is positively related to f m a n u r e which is its second most influential factor fig s3 in hurst 2016 we find additional fungi associated with mammalian livestock diseases cladophialophora cryptococcus cyphellophora exophiala pythium rhodotorula sporobolomyces and trichosporon these findings suggest that several species from the above genera might be plant or animal disease agents related to agricultural and pastural settings which are mainly located in southern ecozones fig s5 pp g all relationships with both f m a n u r e and ρ a n i m are positive which also supports this idea fig s3 the remaining ppg seem ubiquitous in the environment with their occurrences more dependent on transport e g precipitations or survival factors e g bio optical measures although some species of cryptococcus might originate from enteric contamination as well it is more likely that they are naturally present in the watershed if we observe the uncertainty associated with ρ a n i m 6th predictor with the highest ri fig s3 cryptococcus shows the same trend for a c d o m 280 as cryptosporidium with different degrees of sensitivity to ultraviolet light between species schiave et al 2009 some relationships are harder to find in the literature or are to the best of our knowledge unknown the responses of the ppg to sunlight might show different trends depending on whether the microorganisms contain pigment or melanin or nothing to protect them from specific wavelengths for example rhodotorula usually possesses various pigments such as beta carotene torulene and torularhodin moliné et al 2012 and components such as cdom c h l a or tss vary the amount of light present in the water this could explain the negative trend with those three variables and the positive relationship with z s e c c h i as the rhodotorula pigments provide light protection moliné et al 2012 similarly we can observe the same trends for exophiala which contains carotenoids and also melanin for light protection kirchhoff et al 2019 and c h l a and tss however those relationships might be more complicated for other ppg which could contain less or no pigments and are sensitive to specific wavelengths the positive relationships of alternaria candida and pichia with a c d o m 280 suggest that the genera require cdom to be shielded against ultraviolets ppg harboring negative relationships with tss are usually observing the same trends for c h l a when it is above 10 ri e g cryptococcus exophiala rhodotorula torula this link could be interpreted as a potential dissolution of ppg in favor of photosynthetic microeukaryotes in more productive water the negative trend with tss could also be the sinking and export of particle attached ppg from surface waters finally precipitations typically have low to moderate impact on the models surprisingly geotrichum and pichia are both negatively related to σ p r e c i p 7 d larger lakes are associated with increased occurrences of some genera e g ulocladium which could be linked to longer water residence times 4 3 method considerations the lake pulse sampling protocol was designed using smaller volumes 500 ml than typical requirements 10 1000 l for giardia or cryptosporidium intact cells u s environmental protection agency 2005 however our study is premised on analyzing the taxonomic composition of environmental dna which can exist both within intact cells or extracellularly thus dna from these organisms present at higher concentrations can still be captured moreover our primers were not a perfect match with giardia species that are usually more occurrent than cryptosporidium therefore we cannot conclusively chart the distributions of this group using our amplicon dataset as this study is part of a wider exploration of microeukaryotic diversity in canadian lakes with a specific focus on paleolimnology we selected primers that are widespread in this field e g capo et al 2016 elith et al 2008 suggested as a rule of thumb to use at least 1000 fitted trees in brt models however our main goal was to reduce the processing time as much as possible for many ppg with the bootstrap procedure we conducted the same analysis using a slower lr of 0 01 which did not reach 1000 trees for most of the species table s5 however it did not seem to markedly improve performances table s5 the most influential variables selected were usually the same selected than with the current 0 05 model fig s6 since we limited the exploration of the modeling space for some variables to keep the computing time reasonable to achieve our study it is possible that more accurate brt models could be developed for operational purposes since our goal was not to develop such operational models but instead to evaluate their potential the current results are sufficient 5 conclusion the lake pulse dataset displaying a large diversity of environmental characteristics and lakes at a continental scale helped us to design highly comprehensive models capturing the wide diversity of lakes and microbiomes with geospatial and satellite derivable variables in the sampled lakes we found important public health pathogens such as the parasite cryptosporidium and cryptococcus along with other opportunistic ppg brt provided insights on the main environmental drivers of occurrences of the ppg bio optical measurements and components potentially shield the pathogens from ultraviolets while several ppg associated with plant diseases were mainly detected in the southern ecozones where agricultural and pastural activities are highly present these findings highlight that tele epidemiology analysis can offer relevant knowledge to management policies for both public health and food security by providing global information on the type of pathogens found in lakes and their related ecological drivers future research in tele epidemiology could be directed toward assessing virulence gene diversity identified from shotgun metagenomics or pcr directed approaches and or direct application with satellite estimations of bio

16425,eukaryotic pathogens including fungi and enteroparasites infect humans animals and plants as integrators of landscape catchment lakes can reflect and record biological and geochemical events or anthropogenic changes and provide useful knowledge to formulate public health food security and water policies to manage and prevent diseases in this context potentially pathogenic fungi and parasites were sampled using 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in 382 lakes displaying a broad range of sizes and human impact on the watershed in 10 ecozones across canada based on pathogen classifications from the epathogen database published by the public health agency of canada we identified 23 health relevant genera for human and animal hosts including cryptococcus and cryptosporidium our study investigated the potential of remote sensing and geomatics to predict microbial contamination in a tele epidemiological approach we used boosted regression tree modeling to evaluate the probability of occurrence of the most common genera found in our dataset based on 10 satellite derivable geomatics and field survey variables which could be potential sources or transport mechanisms through the watershed or survival factors in the water we found that southern ecozones that possess the highest agricultural and pasture activities tend to contain lakes with the largest number of potential pathogens including several fungi associated with plant diseases bio optical factors such as colored dissolved organic matter were highly related to the occurrence of the genera potentially by protecting against damage from ultraviolet light our results demonstrate the capability of tele epidemiology to provide useful information to develop government policies for recreational and drinking

integrators and receptors of watersheds lakes contain bacterial composition profiles which to some degree reflect the specific anthropogenic activities within the watershed kraemer et al 2020 the presence of pathogenic species in sentinel lakes could reveal a source of contamination leaking into the water ecosystem and signal the possible presence of diseases associated with various hosts i e human animal or plant water quality monitoring for waterborne diseases currently relies on the detection of fecal indicators e g escherichia coli enterococcus for public health decisions regarding the potability of water and the opening of beaches for recreational water activities ashbolt et al 2001 health canada 2012 for example enteroparasites such as giardia or cryptosporidium are responsible for many worldwide waterborne diseases outbreaks in human and animal populations efstratiou et al 2017 across canada such outbreaks have occurred several times cryptosporidium 7 recorded outbreaks giardia 42 schistosoma 1 and toxoplasma gondii 1 between 1980 and 2000 krewski et al 2002 yet these pathogens responsible for waterborne diseases are not always linked to fecal indicators korajkic et al 2018 and other water associated diseases can be found in recreational waters pathogenic fungi can infect multiple hosts through different transmission routes e g cutaneous respiratory ingestive and can be highly resilient in the environment fisher et al 2012 however in canada fungi are generally reported as plant diseases dukstra et al 2018 but not as waterborne diseases krewski et al 2002 even though they can also infect animals and humans for example cryptococcus gatti is responsible for cryptococcosis in southwestern canada kidd et al 2007 where it has the highest reported incidence of infection globally in general fungi even those that are not specifically pathogenic are neglected in aquatic research grossart et al 2019 while health relevant enteroparasites are extensively covered by the literature geospatial and remote sensing methodologies applied to epidemiology i e tele epidemiology have been increasingly developed in the last few years for water quality monitoring brazeau et al 2016 kotchi et al 2014 tele epidemiology was implemented in canada for waterborne diseases mainly e coli and microbial resistance and vector borne diseases e g lyme disease west nile virus and could benefit from expansion to other health relevant fields remote sensing enables the measurement of various biological and physical properties with higher time frequency wider spatial scale and reduced cost compared to field sampling in canada land use products are available at the continental scale north american land change monitoring system 2020 and though the remote sensing approaches are more complex than on land or in the open ocean recent studies have developed algorithms to estimate secchi depth in lakes deutsch et al 2021 and other bio optical components such as chlorophyll or colored dissolved organic matter cdom brezonik et al 2005 cardille et al 2013 koll egyed et al 2021 olmanson et al 2016 2008 sayers et al 2015 thus predictive models of microbial contamination in lakes can be enhanced by the inclusion of satellite resolved variables such an approach may be particularly relevant for remote communities with limited access to water quality monitoring and assessment this study provides distributions of potentially pathogenic eukaryotic genera ppg i e fungi and protists identified in 382 diverse lakes spanning the longitudinal extent of canada using 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing we then prepare for tele epidemiological approaches by using a boosted regression tree model brt to assess the potential of variables that could be derived from remote sensing products i e bio optical components and public geomatics data with wide spatial coverage to predict the occurrences of ppg our aim was to investigate the potential of tele epidemiology with in situ and geospatial data to provide information on threats associated with contamination sources and mechanisms within the watersheds we suggest upscaling the predictions to new lakes using either in situ data or direct satellite measurements to generate nationwide maps 2 materials and method 2 1 sampling area as part of the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc canadian lake pulse network huot et al 2019 we collected epilimnion water for molecular genetic analysis in 382 canadian lakes for three summers june september from 2017 to 2019 fig 1 each lake was sampled once within the three year period the study area extended over 10 ecozones in canada lakes were selected using a stratified random method according to their ecozone size and a human impact index as described in huot et al 2019 bio optical measurements and variables potentially relevant to explaining the presence of microorganisms were also collected on site and are provided in table 1 2

sequencing of 250 bp paired end reads as three separate sequencing runs on an illumina miseq platform 2 2 4 sequence inference and taxonomic assignment primer sequences were trimmed from raw sequence

database v 4 12 0 guillou et al 2013 potentially spurious asvs were removed by visually inspecting a multiple sequence alignment performed in mafft katoh et al 2019 raw sequence data are available from the european nucleotide archive under study accession prjeb42538 2 2 5 potentially pathogenic eukaryotic genera ppg of interest were extracted from the amplicon dataset according to the epathogen risk group database public health agency of canada 2021 we used a partial matching function in r 4 0 2 between pathogenic genera names considered at least in the risk group 2 table 2 by the public health agency of canada phac 2018 and the taxonomic classifications from pr2 thereby we examined the sequences classified to the genus level 2 3 geomatics and remote sensing derived variables herein we both test hypotheses related to specific relationships such as links between fecal pathogens and potential sources i e manure animal density population density and carry out exploratory research to better understand the relationships between the distributions of ppg and variables that have been poorly explored in the literature i e bio optical measurements we avoided multicollinearity by ensuring that the final selected set would have 1 a pearson correlation of less than 0 7 fig s1 and 2 a variance inflation factor vif below 10 as evaluated using generalized linear models dormann et al 2013 we considered key independent variables potentially involved in the cycle of lake contamination as 1 sources of contamination 2 transport factors in the watershed or 3 survival factors in the watershed or in the lake the selected variables are summarised in table 1 bio optical variables used in this study were not direct satellite measurements and were instead in situ variables sampled during the lake pulse campaign which could be used for which algorithms have been or are being developed 2 4 statistical analysis and map predictions brt were used to model the distributions of ppg explained by the environmental variables a brt combines regression trees and boosting to improve predictive performance elith et al 2008 boost enables the growth of several trees that use the independent variables to split the observations into two groups those weak classifiers i e individual trees are then merged into a strong classifier that is regulated by a learning rate and tuning parameters the strength of relationships between dependent and independent variables are estimated as relative influence ri ri corresponds to the number of times a variable is selected for splitting averaged over all weak learners and weighted by the squared improvement to the model at each split the score is rescaled so that the combined influence of all independent variables adds up to 100 for each model a brt was trained on the occurrence probabilities of each ppg found in the lakes using a bernoulli distribution and the ppg richness present at each lake pp g all using a poisson distribution we used the gbm step function from the dismo r package elith et al 2008 to fit the models calc deviance to calculate the residual deviance from the final predictions and plot gbm from gbm ridgeway 2020 to obtain the ri tables first we find the highest learning rate lr 0 05 which reaches a minimal deviance for most of the ppg as we needed to reduce the processing time as occurrences and responses to independent variables varied greatly between the ppg we tuned parameters i e tree complexity tc bag fraction bf and step size ss through a hyper grid search table s1 for each combination we trained 5 successive 10 fold cross validated brt models and averaged the lowest root mean squared error rmse finally for each ppg we selected the combination with the lowest averaged rmse secondly we used the best combination of parameters for each ppg in a 1000 bootstrap resampling we extracted the medians for the predictions for the ri of each independent variable and for the model performance indicators over the bootstraps as final results for each ppg confidence intervals cis 2 5 97 5 were calculated for mapping and for ri partial plots model performances indicators were provided for the training data i e observed data and cross validation data cv i e cross validated predictions made on observed data to evaluate model classification between 0 and 1 we calculated the area under the curve of precision recall auc pr fig s2 using rocr sing et al 2005 auc pr is preferable for imbalanced datasets i e negative class 0 outnumbers the positive class 1 and emphasizes the positive class estimation saito and rehmsmeier 2015 which is preferable for public health application the baseline for auc pr is the ratio of positives p and negatives n as y p p n we calculated the difference between the baseline and the auc pr criterion in percentages maps to display observations predictions and cis for some ppg with higher public health interest as well as for all ppg pp g all were created using qgis 3 10 10 qgis development team 2020 probability of occurrence based on bernoulli distributions were classified into 4 categories absence probable absence probable presence and presence the auc pr value was used to separate presence from absence predictions and the range of cis was used to establish the categories the absence and presence categories are the ranges median prediction averaged cis median prediction averaged cis the probable presence category is the range median prediction median prediction averaged cis and the probable absence category is the range median prediction averaged cis median prediction table s2 3 results 3 1 occurrences of microorganisms in sampled canadian lakes of the 15 756 077 18s rrna gene sequences recovered from the 382 sampled lakes 23 ppg were identified across 104 asvs encompassing 63 464 sequences fig 2 number of asvs found per genus are shown in table s3 the richness of pp g all ranged from 0 to 13 ppg per lake the most relevant public health genus detected was the enteroparasite cryptosporidium n 70 18 3 of lakes genera detected within risk group 3 table 2 were cryptococcus n 232 60 7 of lakes and cladophialophora with very low occurrences n 9 2 4 of lakes and thus might be of lower health interest the rest of the ppg were ubiquitous fungi and yeasts found in the environment which can provoke opportunistic infections and they were classified in risk group 2 the most widely occurring genera were rhodotorula n 269 70 4 of lakes pythium n 235 61 5 of lakes and bipolaris n 204 53 4 of lakes the most rarely occurring ppg was leptosphaeria identified only once for brt statistical analysis we excluded microorganisms with 30 occurrences which left 15 genera 3 2 model performances and relative influence of geomatics and satellite derived data for each ppg the final predictive values had cv deviance explained ranging from 11 3 aspergillus to 46 5 alternaria table 3 with 41 6 for pp g all 42 9 for cryptococcus and 31 3 for cryptosporidium median model performances from 1000 bootstrap samples were better using training data than cv data table s4 auc pr criterion ranged from 22 8 aspergillus to 66 geotrichum trichosporon and sporobolomyces required lower lr and more processing time and were not analysed variables for predicting the presence of ppg were separated into two groups regarding their influence on the prediction using the method müller et al 2013 the first group above 10 had much greater influence on ppg distributions whereas the group below the threshold are not relevant for interpretation fig 3 a bio optical measurements and components a c d o m 280 tss z s e c c h i c h l a were key predictors for most of the ppg fig 3b increases in a c d o m 280 tended to be associated with higher occurrences of cryptosporidium ri 17 9 cryptococcus ri 12 7 pp g all ri 13 7 and the decline of rhodotorula ri 14 1 fig 4 tss was associated with more restricted occurrences of exophiala ri 24 4 candida and torula appeared to have an affinity for clearer water where the z s e c c h i was deeper ri 20 1 and 14 respectively while pythium and secchi depth link seem weaker ri 16 6 the presence of livestock in the watershed can also have significant effects on the occurrences of ppg ρ a n i m showed positive relationships with bipolaris ri 20 2 and probably alternaria ri 17 6 meteorological climatic and geographical variables were selected as the most important factors for three genera t a i r was positively related to aspergillus ri 18 4 and pichia ri 15 3 and a l a k e was also linked to ulocladium occurrences ri 16 7 the least influential on the ppg occurrences appeared to be f m a n u r e ρ p o p and σ p r e c i p 7 d 3 3 prediction maps based on observed data predictions were made for the spatial distribution of pp g all which presents the general trend of the ppg as well as the most relevant public health genera cryptococcus and cryptosporidium fig 5 pp g all showed an overall higher richness of ppg in the southern ecozones than in the north lakes with no ppg detected were in the boreal cordillera two lakes and one lake in each of the following ecozones mixedwood plains prairies atlantic maritimes pacific maritime and taiga cordillera only three lakes sampled hotspots of ppg were detected in the prairies as well as the eastern boreal shield and montane cordillera the brt correctly determined higher richness in the southern ecozones and the highest ppg richness were found in the three identified hotspots cis ranges indicate the degree of uncertainty in predicting distributions across new lakes the ci maximum range was 10 genera but most of the lakes contained cis between 1 and 6 genera a handful of lakes had higher uncertainties 6 cryptococcus was detected in all the sampled ecozones with hotspots in the pacific maritimes montane cordillera and eastern boreal shield cryptosporidium was less detected but was present in most of the ecozones except the taiga cordillera and occurred more frequently in the eastern atlantic regions predictions for cryptococcus below 0 8 ci range were accurately attributed to 205 lakes 53 7 of the full 382 observations table 4 out of 232 occurrences 166 71 6 were classified as presence 7 8 or probable presence 63 8 while out of the 150 absences 39 26 were classified in absence 0 07 or probable absence 25 3 cryptosporidium predictions were correct for 302 lakes 79 1 out of 382 and entirely correct for absences 96 8 with 45 2 absences and 51 6 probable absences the model did not provide accurate results for cis above 0 8 those included 70 occurrences cryptococcus cis showed high variability with most of the lakes above a 0 4 range the lowest error was associated with lakes in the pacific maritime and montane cordillera for cryptosporidium degrees of uncertainty were less than 0 2 in the boreal cordillera pacific maritime southern montane cordillera and northern atlantic maritimes uncertainties above 0 6 were found in a few lakes spread across the ecozones 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this study represents the first nationwide assessment of eukaryotic pathogens in canadian lakes to leverage geomatics and remote sensing techniques several governmental policies could benefit from using predictive maps produced from data with large space coverage to this end our work intended to show which variables could be used but it did not use satellite estimations with the ppg models for public health security that approach could be complementary to routine preventive sampling of microbial indicators such as e coli for recreational beach management ppg associated with specific sources of contaminations such as ρ a n i m and f m a n u r e could also inform public policies of possible leakages and lead to preventive actions 4 1 health relevance of the pathogens found in canadian lakes most of the ppg we found could be related to diseases that have been detected on canadian territory and thus they might pose a potential threat with the short fragment of the v7 region of the 18s rrna gene used in this study we cannot confidently resolve ppg to the species level nor perhaps more importantly identify virulence genes which are crucial indicators of pathogenicity nevertheless we assumed health relevance of the whole genus as this is how the phac classifies threats cryptosporidium and cryptococcus are of high interest for the public health security because of their association with zoonotic and anthroponotic disease transmission cryptosporidium is a well known enteroparasite present in wildlife livestock and human reservoirs zahedi and ryan 2020 and its prevalence has been studied regionally e g coklin et al 2007 heitman et al 2002 in different reservoirs c hominis and c parvum are the main species infecting humans and they are responsible for most waterborne outbreaks c hominis is specifically related to outbreaks in recreational waters with its major hosts being humans and domestics animals c parvum is most commonly found in cattle provoking high morbidity and mortality in canadian herds olson et al 2004 moreover many host adapted cryptosporidium in animals are probably limiting transmission to humans xiao and ryan 2004 and have more impact on young populations than juveniles and adults we examined the links between specific animal sub categories i e cattle calves and sheep see fig s4 with cryptosporidium but we did not find relationships remote locations where cryptosporidium was spotted could be associated either with wildlife or remote communities lacking adequate wastewater systems cryptococcus has high incidence of infection in western canada mainly on vancouver island where it can cause pulmonary and or central nervous system infections especially with c gattii kidd et al 2007 and some species could originate from bird feces nielsen et al 2007 it can also be found in southern québec associated with the species c fagisuga responsible for beech bark disease boyce 2009 which could explain its presence over eastern ecozones fig 5a cryptosporidium occurrence might be indicative of potential waterborne diseases directly linked to contaminated lakes whereas cryptococcus might not be always related to fecal pollution although present in many of the sampled lakes the risk of exposure likely remains small due to the remoteness or lack of recreational activities in these lakes while the most important public health pathogens are dispersed through the territory the highest ppg richness is localised in the southern ecozones which are more populated and possess most of the recreational activities and land use conversions fig 5c most of the other ppg are naturally occurring in the environment including probably most of the cryptococcus species thus their associated diseases might not specifically occur in the lake since lakes act as sentinels by integrating and reflecting watershed changes the presence of environmental ppg could inform potential disease threats within the catchments from the spatial distribution of the occurrences fig s5 we can observe that many ppg have restricted geographical areas especially in the agricultural regions of the prairies and boreal plains e g alternaria bipolaris metharhizium scytalidium ulocladium which suggest that they might be related to plant diseases pythium is mostly regarded as a plant parasite that causes root rot in soybean in alberta and manitoba li et al 2019 bipolaris is a well known fungus colonizing plants and crops especially with b sorokiniana in the prairies ecozone ghazvini and tekauz 2007 pichia p fermentans was investigated as a disease microbe in pome and stone fruits in canada giobbe et al 2007 alternaria is known for plant disease blackspot in rapeseed and mustard in central alberta meena et al 2010 mucor is associated with fruit tree diseases including peaches and pears in british columbia wallace et al 2018 scytalidium is well known for the plant disease gall rust in western parts of north america including alberta tsuneda et al 1980 it is harder to find specific studies for ulocladium and sordaria in canada but they might be considered potential plant disease agents according to the study of clear and patrick 1993 as for leptosphaeria that was found only once in the dataset they have been of concern in western canada for brassica i e cruciferous vegetable cultures kutcher et al 2007 metharizhium was isolated from plant roots in ontario and contains entomopathogenic species wyrebek et al 2011 these findings show that our approach could also benefit food security policies in agriculture and animal husbandry nosocomial infections are associated with a few ubiquitous ppg rhodotorula are common in any type of environment including human microbiomes and are emerging pathogens in hospital settings in canada rusthoven et al 1984 candida can cause various nosocomial infections the last identified emergent species of the genus in canada is c auris eckbo et al 2021 aspergillus provokes invasive pulmonary aspergillosis especially in nosocomial settings and was found in alberta schwartz et al 2020 there is less literature on the canadian relevance of the rarer ppg torula seems to be very rare through the literature as we only noticed the study of berger and langeron 1949 where a chromomycosis i e infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue was associated with the species t bergeri in canada trichosporon is present in soils and the human body where it can cause bloodstream infections it was reported in ontario herrera et al 2018 geotrichum is common in the environment in dairy production and beach sand and some of the species can infect humans such as g capitatum trabelsi et al 2015 sporobolomyces can cause cutaneous infections as in the case in ontario damji et al 2019 cyphellophora is a superficial colonizer that can provoke skin infections and it has been detected in human samples in canada feng et al 2013 cladophialophora is found in rotten plants and soil and caused brain abscess in humans and liver abscess in dogs in alberta badali et al 2010 acremonium is isolated from food and can cause diseases in multiple hosts summerbell et al 2018 exophiala is well known as an ectotherm species disease agent but can also infect humans de hoog et al 2011 4 2 links between environmental variables and ppg occurrences results from brt simulations indicate high variability in model performances between the ppg as most of the ppg detected are ubiquitous and can contain a wide spectrum of ecological diversity they are not specifically related to anthropic activities interpretations are based on independent variables with 10 ri fig s3 pp g all provides overall the most important factors associated with pathogen richness a higher richness seems to be associated with higher a c d o m 280 which potentially shields microbes from ultraviolet radiation in the water column williamson et al 2017 suggests that climate change is rapidly increasing the release of dissolved organic matter dom in inland waters through an increase in precipitations permafrost thaw and modification of the vegetation the growing release of dom can potentially reduce the inactivation of pathogens by sunlight some pathogens might be directly integrated from watershed contamination sources to the lake such as enteric pollution from manure or livestock by precipitations runoff or by wind dispersal just like pp g all fecal cryptosporidium occurrences are mainly associated with higher a c d o m 280 and not with a potential animal or human sources sunlight inactivation is well documented as sensitivity to ultraviolets and it has different survival outcomes between species king et al 2008 studies such as dungan 2010 identified many of the ppg as microorganisms commonly found in livestock operations such as swine barns cattle feedlots and or cattle sheds alternaria aspergillus bipolaris leptosphaeria mucor candida geotrichum torula and ulocladium alternaria and bipolaris are positively related to ρ a n i m where animals could potentially be fed with barley and other cereals affected by this type of plant pathogen torula is positively related to f m a n u r e which is its second most influential factor fig s3 in hurst 2016 we find additional fungi associated with mammalian livestock diseases cladophialophora cryptococcus cyphellophora exophiala pythium rhodotorula sporobolomyces and trichosporon these findings suggest that several species from the above genera might be plant or animal disease agents related to agricultural and pastural settings which are mainly located in southern ecozones fig s5 pp g all relationships with both f m a n u r e and ρ a n i m are positive which also supports this idea fig s3 the remaining ppg seem ubiquitous in the environment with their occurrences more dependent on transport e g precipitations or survival factors e g bio optical measures although some species of cryptococcus might originate from enteric contamination as well it is more likely that they are naturally present in the watershed if we observe the uncertainty associated with ρ a n i m 6th predictor with the highest ri fig s3 cryptococcus shows the same trend for a c d o m 280 as cryptosporidium with different degrees of sensitivity to ultraviolet light between species schiave et al 2009 some relationships are harder to find in the literature or are to the best of our knowledge unknown the responses of the ppg to sunlight might show different trends depending on whether the microorganisms contain pigment or melanin or nothing to protect them from specific wavelengths for example rhodotorula usually possesses various pigments such as beta carotene torulene and torularhodin moliné et al 2012 and components such as cdom c h l a or tss vary the amount of light present in the water this could explain the negative trend with those three variables and the positive relationship with z s e c c h i as the rhodotorula pigments provide light protection moliné et al 2012 similarly we can observe the same trends for exophiala which contains carotenoids and also melanin for light protection kirchhoff et al 2019 and c h l a and tss however those relationships might be more complicated for other ppg which could contain less or no pigments and are sensitive to specific wavelengths the positive relationships of alternaria candida and pichia with a c d o m 280 suggest that the genera require cdom to be shielded against ultraviolets ppg harboring negative relationships with tss are usually observing the same trends for c h l a when it is above 10 ri e g cryptococcus exophiala rhodotorula torula this link could be interpreted as a potential dissolution of ppg in favor of photosynthetic microeukaryotes in more productive water the negative trend with tss could also be the sinking and export of particle attached ppg from surface waters finally precipitations typically have low to moderate impact on the models surprisingly geotrichum and pichia are both negatively related to σ p r e c i p 7 d larger lakes are associated with increased occurrences of some genera e g ulocladium which could be linked to longer water residence times 4 3 method considerations the lake pulse sampling protocol was designed using smaller volumes 500 ml than typical requirements 10 1000 l for giardia or cryptosporidium intact cells u s environmental protection agency 2005 however our study is premised on analyzing the taxonomic composition of environmental dna which can exist both within intact cells or extracellularly thus dna from these organisms present at higher concentrations can still be captured moreover our primers were not a perfect match with giardia species that are usually more occurrent than cryptosporidium therefore we cannot conclusively chart the distributions of this group using our amplicon dataset as this study is part of a wider exploration of microeukaryotic diversity in canadian lakes with a specific focus on paleolimnology we selected primers that are widespread in this field e g capo et al 2016 elith et al 2008 suggested as a rule of thumb to use at least 1000 fitted trees in brt models however our main goal was to reduce the processing time as much as possible for many ppg with the bootstrap procedure we conducted the same analysis using a slower lr of 0 01 which did not reach 1000 trees for most of the species table s5 however it did not seem to markedly improve performances table s5 the most influential variables selected were usually the same selected than with the current 0 05 model fig s6 since we limited the exploration of the modeling space for some variables to keep the computing time reasonable to achieve our study it is possible that more accurate brt models could be developed for operational purposes since our goal was not to develop such operational models but instead to evaluate their potential the current results are sufficient 5 conclusion the lake pulse dataset displaying a large diversity of environmental characteristics and lakes at a continental scale helped us to design highly comprehensive models capturing the wide diversity of lakes and microbiomes with geospatial and satellite derivable variables in the sampled lakes we found important public health pathogens such as the parasite cryptosporidium and cryptococcus along with other opportunistic ppg brt provided insights on the main environmental drivers of occurrences of the ppg bio optical measurements and components potentially shield the pathogens from ultraviolets while several ppg associated with plant diseases were mainly detected in the southern ecozones where agricultural and pastural activities are highly present these findings highlight that tele epidemiology analysis can offer relevant knowledge to management policies for both public health and food security by providing global information on the type of pathogens found in lakes and their related ecological drivers future research in tele epidemiology could be directed toward assessing virulence gene diversity identified from shotgun metagenomics or pcr directed approaches and or direct application with satellite estimations of bio

16426,early detection of emerging and life threatening pathogens circulating in complex environments is urgently required to combat infectious diseases this study proposed a public health risk assessment workflow with three stages pathogen screening pathogen genotyping and risk assessment in stage one pathogens were screened with metagenomic sequencing microfluidic chip and qpcr in stage two pathogens were isolated and genotyped with multi locus sequence typing mlst or conventional pcr finally virulence genes from metagenomic data were assessed for pathogenicity two regions donggang and zhanjiang with potential public health concerns were selected for evaluation each of which comprised of one urban and one farming wastewater sampling location overall metagenomic sequencing reflected the variation in the relative abundance of medically important bacteria over 90 bacterial pathogens were monitored in the metagenomic dataset of which 56 species harbored virulence genes in donggang a pathogenic acinetobacter sp reached high abundances in 2018 and 2020 whereas all pathogenic vibrio spp peaked in october 2019 in zhanjiang a baumanni and other enterobacteriaceae species were abundantly present in 2019 and 2020 whereas aeromonas and vibrio spp peaked in november 2017 forty species were subsequently isolated and subtyped by mlst half of which were prevalent genotypes in clinical data additionally we identified the african swine fever virus asfv in water samples collected in 2017 ahead of the first reported asfv outbreak in 2018 in china rna viruses like hepatitis a virus hav and enterovirus 71 ev71 were also detected with concentrations peaking in april 2020 and april 2018 respectively the dynamics of hav and ev71 were consistent with local epidemic trends finally based on the virulence gene profiles our study identified the risk level in wastewater of two cities this workflow illustrates the potential for an early warning of local epidemics which helps to prioritize the preparedness for specific pathogens locally graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metagenomic sequencing wastewater surveillance mlst virulence public health risk pathogen genotyping 1 introduction water dwelling pathogens can cause severe diseases such as cholera leptospirosis typhoid or diarrhea bartram et al 2005 given the unpredictable and high diversity of these emerging diseases one of the critical challenges for waterborne pathogen surveillance is the prioritization of preparedness for local outbreaks the greatest and most acute public health risks result from urban and farming wastewater discharge given their elevated and diverse urban and rural contaminants osiemo et al 2019 gastrointestinal illnesses resulting from drinking contaminated water are commonly correlated with concentrations of enteric pathogens yet traditional microbiological quality assessment of water is only based on the presence of a few fecal indicator bacteria e g escherichia coli and enterococci van lieverloo et al 2007 nevertheless the current framework only tracks the microbial pollution from feces whereas the microbial risk from non fecal pathogens e g vibrio cholerae is severely underestimated zhao et al 2019 in the united states alone 507 cases of waterborne illness involving the enteric viruses e colio157 h7 campylobacter jejuni legionella spp salmonella typhimurium v cholerae and pseudomonas aeruginosa that resulted in acute gastrointestinal and respiratory illness were reported between 1996 and 2006 craun et al 2006 recently these limitations have been reassessed with the prospect of environmental metagenomics metagenomic next generation sequencing mngs is a promising candidate approach for the identification of a broad spectrum of pathogens in environmental samples as theoretically almost all potential pathogens can be detected by identifying unique dna and or rna sequences urban et al 2021 ma et al 2019 besides mngs has illustrated the relationship between microbial communities and their disease and antimicrobial resistance in both clinical and environmental samples kim et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 metagenomic sequencing has also been utilized as a public health risk assessment tool by identifying potential microbial risks suttner et al 2020 furthermore a recent study also demonstrated the potential of using metagenomic sequencing for comprehensive microbial risk assessment yasir 2020 for wastewater this catch all approach could provide unbiased insights into the dynamics of pathogens present in a region however the current application of mngs has three main limitations firstly the majority of analyses sequence only a single time point of the bacterial or viral community without continuous sampling zhou et al 2021 gulino et al 2020 this results in an inability to conduct longitudinal analyses of pathogen dynamics furthermore these studies were also constrained by solely focusing on bacteria dna or rna viruses bibby et al 2019 gulino et al 2020 hampering a complete evaluation of regional health secondly many studies have focused on microbial diversity and the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args in wastewater in contrast complete pathogen profiling including viruses bacteria fungi and parasites is scarce thus metagenomic surveillance identifying all pathogens is essential for outbreak management and early warnings allowing for origin determination and monitoring of bacterial and viral transmission patterns lastly resolving the pathogens at the strain level and distinguishing the pathogenic genotype from the metagenomic data remains challenging for instance leonard et al 2015 found that a large proportion of non pathogenic e coli present in water samples reinforcing the urgency of assessing the potential virulence of any e coli strain thus in order to avoid wasting resources due to false positive or negative results careful validation of metagenomic data is critical for the accurate microbial risk assessment of wastewater to address these challenges in the present study public health risk assessment was conducted in three steps screening the potential pathogens confirmation of the pathogenic genotypes and comparison with local clinical data in each stage various techniques were employed fig 1 in step one metagenomic sequencing and microfluidic chip were used to screen bacterial and viral pathogens respectively in step two conventional pcr for viral pathogen and multi locus sequence typing mlst whole genome sequencing wgs for bacterial pathogens was used to validate the presence and genotype of pathogens meanwhile qpcr was used to quantify the abundance of the pathogens with special focus in step three virulence gene of pathogens were analyzed to assess the health risk level donggang city with a population of 650 000 and potou district in zhanjiang city with a population of 390 000 were selected for performing our proposed workflow fig 1 both sites lack wastewater treatment facilities in urban and farming regions and have experienced a rapid deterioration of water quality in the estuary since 2017 table s1 raising in public concern the above scenarios provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of our workflow for local risk assessment from 2017 to 2020 one urban and one farming wastewater discharging point with the largest volume was selected to assess the public health risk in each city 2 results 2 1 screening of potential bacterial pathogens in donggang water samples in donggang samples were collected from farming dy and urban wastewater dg biannually in the period 2017 2020 fig s1a in the metagenomic data 89 3 of reads were assigned into the bacteria at the phylum level the sequenced reads from all dy samples were assigned to 11 different phyla fig 2 a and differed markedly in their patterns of bacterial composition as shown by principal coordinate analysis pcoa fig s2 we further examined the potential pathogens in the metagenomic dataset of water samples metaphlan2 was employed for taxonomy assignment of each sample a total of 100 bacterial pathogens included in the virulence factors database vfdb liu et al 2019 were selected for screening table s2 of these 40 pathogens were abundantly detected in the metagenomic dataset of dy including both waterborne e g aeromonas hydrophila vibrio parahaemolyticus and v cholerae and respiratory pathogens such as klebsiella pneumoniae neisseria meningitidis and legionella pneumophila after 2019 the relative abundance of several detected pathogens increased e g acinetobacter baumannii v parahaemolyticus v cholerae v alginolyticus v vulnificus k pneumoniae salmonella enterica mycobacterium tuberculosis and campylobacter jejuni in contrast other species decreased in the period 2017 to 2020 e g aeromonas veronii l pneumophila and salmonella bongori fig 2b among them thirty two species were detected in the subsequent culture assays in urban site dg bacterial composition in urban wastewater remained stable between 2017 and 2018 fig 2c afterwards the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased in april 2019 to 17 3 before becoming a dominant group in september 2020 among them 76 bacterial pathogens were detected in the metagenomic dataset of which 32 were included for visualization fig 2d pathogenic acinetobacter sp reached high relative abundance in 2018 and 2020 whereas all pathogenic vibrio spp peaked in october 2019 in contrast the relative abundance of other pathogens did not fluctuate significantly seventeen species among the 32 selected bacterial pathogens were obtained in culture assays at various sampling times fig 2d the relative abundance of m tuberculosis treponema pallidum and s enterica responsible for clinical cases of tuberculosis syphilis and typhoid paratyphoid respectively was constant during the period of study fig s3 2 2 bacterial pathogen genotyping in donggang next further genotyping by mlst was performed for individual species to confirm whether it belonged to pathogenic genotype we selected 16 isolated bacterial species isolated from urban or farming wastewater for mlst this list included enteric pathogens such as s enterica v cholerae and v parahaemolyticus as well as opportunistic pathogens like k pneumoniae pseudomonas aeruginosa and a baumannii for v cholerae and v parahaemolyticus three and five sequence types sts were identified in donggang respectively table s3 of which only v parahaemolyticus st3 was identified in local clinical data fig s4 seven sts of k pneumoniae were identified in both sites including st11 and st23 and were predominant in local hospital related infections five l pneumophila sts were detected in donggang none of which were detected in clinical cases m tuberculosis belonging to the beijing clade st4 was presented both in clinical and environmental samples in donggang while environmental st34 and st19 of s enterica were also identified in local patients for other pathogens up to six sts were detected for each species except for enterobacter cloacae and at least one st of each species was presented in clinical samples fig s4 nevertheless while some pathogenic genotypes were not identified in local clinical samples they were widespread such as staphylococcus aureus st7 and therefore still require further investigation 2 3 screening of pathogenic viruses in donggang water samples next we screened the presence of 60 pathogenic viruses associated with public health risk table s2 most of which have been previously reported in wastewater and poses a significant health risk for humans and animals van rossum et al 2015 among these 20 dna viruses were confirmed by mapping metagenomic reads against the 20 reference genomes meanwhile 40 rna viruses were screened by microfluidic chip afterwards positive results of any dna or rna virus were confirmed by qpcr assays we first screened 20 pathogenic dna viruses in the metagenomic dataset in dy a few viral pathogens were identified such as african swine fever virus asfv and swinepox virus it is interesting that asfv was detected in the october 2017 and peaked in 2018 fig 5a subsequent qpcr assay confirmed these observations asfv was detected in the apr 2018 by qpcr with a viral load of 3 0 103 copy l and continuously detected in the following samples this is before the first asf case in a swine farm in liaoning reported on 3 august 2018 ge et al 2018 neither asfv nor swinepox virus was detected in site dg no other zoonosis dna virus was detected in either site we then tested the presence of 40 pathogenic rna viruses by high throughput microfluidic chip detection table s2 in dy norovirus mumps virus rhinovirus and human herpesvirus 6 virus were detected only in 2019 samples and then confirmed by qpcr in dg human enterovirus 71 ev71 was detected in samples from 2017 to 2019 whereas coxsackievirus 16 ca16 was only detected in april 2020 2 4 virus genotyping in donggang water samples next we further conducted virus genotyping for positive samples we used concentrated dna samples to conduct pcr for the asfv b646l gene amplified from dy 2017 and 2018 water samples a phylogenetic analysis of b646l detected in dy and 32 asfv b646l sequence data from other countries revealed that the former was genetically identical to the first asfv isolate cn201801 2018 obtained from dead swine in liaoning and other east european countries ge et al 2018 afterwards qpcr was conducted to quantify ev71 concentration which peaked in april 2019 5 8 102 copy l fig 3 b at the time of the hand foot and mouth disease epidemic in donggang city fig 3b pcr of the vp1 gene of ev71 in rna extracts collected from 2019 were positive subsequent phylogenetic analysis confirmed that ev71 from donggang belonged to the c4a type prevalent in liaoning province however no gene fragment of ca16 was amplified by pcr in urban site dg hepatitis a virus hav was detected by qpcr from october 2018 to october 2020 peaking in april 2020 4 7 103 copy l fig 5c this coincides with a significant increase of hav cases reported from november 2019 to april 2020 we further obtained the vp3 p2a region of hav by pcr amplification phylogenetic analysis of this region retrieved from 100 publicly available hav genomes revealed that the hav identified in wastewater samples was genetically related to the dalian isolates dl3 fig 5c for the remaining positively detected virus no gene from both viruses was amplified by conventional pcr probably because of low abundance 2 5 screening of potential bacterial pathogens in zhanjiang water samples in the period 2017 2020 we also conducted semiannual surveillance in zhanjiang located in south china this is the largest shrimp farming region in china and has historically been affected by plague epidemics one typical urban da and farming db wastewater discharging point was selected fig s1b metagenomic analysis revealed that about 90 of reads corresponded to bacteria at the urban site da proteobacteria was the most abundant followed by verrucomicrobia and actinobacteria 35 and 58 respectively fig 4 a at the farming site db proteobacteria was also predominant at the phylum level and its abundance increased from 50 1 in 2017 to 84 7 in 2020 fig 3a pcoa analysis show that microbial composition at the two sites diverges after november 2018 fig s2 the top 20 most abundant genera represented from 35 to 57 of the microbial community at each sampling time fig 4b next we investigated the relative abundance of pathogens in the metagenomic dataset by metaphlan2 species of the genus arcobacter were found in the samples collected in 2019 5 8 and 2020 4 8 whereas genus aeromonas and vibrio spp peaked in samples taken after november 2017 0 43 and 4 1 respectively apart from arcobacter sp several bacterial pathogens were detected at the da site fig 4c yersinia pseudotuberculosis was detected at all sampling times peaking in may 2018 0 00013 interestingly other species also peaked at that time like acinetobacter sp k pneumoniae n meningitidis s enterica shigella flexneri shigella sonnei staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus suis a subsequent culture based assay later confirmed the presence of 22 and 18 pathogenic species in sites da and db respectively fig 4c d we also conducted direct binning of the metagenomic dataset for both cities the number of metagenome assembled genomes mags in each dataset ranged from 7 to 23 table s4 and the relative abundance of each mag ranged from 0 215 to 1 325 however the annotation of each mags revealed that none of them harbored virulence factors this suggests that this method can only detect highly abundant pathogens 2 6 bacterial pathogen genotyping of zhanjiang water sample for v parahaemolyticus 4 and 13 sts were identified in urban and farming wastewater respectively table s5 st1740 and st1799 were repeatedly isolated in 3 out of 10 zhanjiang samples four v cholerae sts st69 st1170 st1171 and a novel st were identified in zhanjiang of which st69 belongs to the pandemic o1 serogroup and was found in urban samples meanwhile st23 st35 and st86 k pneumoniae isolates were found in urban and farming wastewaters additionally st11 st34 and st13 s enterica isolates were detected in urban samples most of them were epidemic genotypes and were also detected in clinical samples in guangdong provinces according to the pubmlst database https pubmlst org table s5 2 7 virus detection and genotyping in zhanjiang water samples in the zhanjiang metagenomic dataset 3 2 of reads were assigned to dna viruses of which 97 8 corresponded to bacterial phages four human pathogens were also detected in 2017 and 2019 including tanapox virus associated with child diarrhea monkeypox virus and human herpesvirus 6 were also detected in zhanjiang since may 2018 and was present in all samples with low abundance 0 00008 swinepox virus was detected in may 2019 with very low abundance 0 001 however subsequent qpcr assay did not detect above viruses probably due to low abundance for rna viruses microfluidic chip and subsequent qpcr both gave positive results for norovirus in zhanjiang bay in november 2018 may and november 2019 with a virus load of 3 4 104 1 78 103 and 2 9 103 copy l respectively whereas sapovirus was detected in november 2018 with 3 2 103 copy l however no dna fragment of these viruses was amplified by conventional pcr 2 8 quantification of the abundance of opportunistic pathogens and wgs in the metagenomic data from both sites we observed significant increases in the relative abundance of a given pathogen across multiple points for instance relative to the baseline over 100 fold increase of a baumannii acinetobacter lwoffi and acinetobacter junii were observed in the dg sample in apr 2018 while an over ten fold increase of aeromonas media was identified in the dy sample in oct 2018 fig 2 to better understand the risk posed by these opportunistic pathogens we performed species specific qpcr for quantification of a media a baumannii a lwoffi a junii and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the water sample of donggang respectively likewise qpcr was also conducted for aeromonas caviae a baumannii acinetobacter hemolyticus shewanella algae and v alginolyticus for zhanjiang water samples afterward we compared the abundance of each pathogen results revealed that pathogen abundance in wastewater ranged from 7 1 104 to 1 33 109 copy l table s5 relative to the 50 lethal dose ld50 reported in a previous study rusin et al 1997 hara kudo and takatori 2012 the abundance of a junii a baumannii and a lowffii in dg in apr 2018 and apr 2020 exceed the ld50 level four potential pathogens without an mlst scheme from zhanjiang were selected for wgs including a junii isolates from donggang v alginolyticus s algae and a hemolyticus to elucidate further the epidemiological relationships between these environmental isolates and clinical strains one environmental v alginolyticus isolate from zhanjiang was genomically related to previous strains obtained from aquaculture farms in zhanjiang indicating they were endemic clones in this region fig 5 a likewise phylogenetic analysis of s algae genomes showed that one environmental isolate zj61 was genetically related to four s algae clinical strains from shandong in china in contrast another isolate zj sh was located on an independent branch fig 5b together with 75 public genomes phylogenomic analysis of a junii divided them into five clusters donggang isolate jz20 from 2018 water sample was clustered with 2020 isolate jz102 fig 5c phylogenomic analysis of 57 a hemolyticus genomes revealed that one zhanjiang isolate zj54 was genomically related to sz3452 which was isolated from a hospital in a nearby city in the same province fig 5d likewise zhanjiang isolate hk30 was clustered with a hospital acquired strain xh900 in zhejiang province 2 9 public health risk assessment of wastewater samples based on these results we propose a risk assessment framework for rapidly evaluating public health risk in wastewater samples for bacteria if pathogens were detectable in the metagenomic dataset but were unculturable we suggest that this scenario only poses a low risk to public health however if both the pathogen and its key virulence genes were retrieved in the metagenomic dataset but no pathogenic genotype was isolated this would result in a medium health risk classification furthermore in instances where pathogenic genotypes were confirmed by subsequent isolation and mlst this suggests a high public health risk and would call for public health intervention we adopted similar criteria to evaluate the public health risk posed by viruses viruses detected by qpcr microfluidic chip metagenomic data suggested a medium risk if it was further amplified by traditional pcr then we considered this a high health risk according to these criteria we assessed the public health risk of sampled water in both cities metagenomic data was mapped against the vfdb database for 95 reference pathogens key virulence factors including 1 toxins 2 flagella and pilus 3 lipopolysaccharides and antigens and 4 pathogenicity islands were selected supplementary text overall 24 species harbored the key virulence factors which were variably presented in different water samples table s7 we identified that urban and farming water samples exhibited distinct health risk profiles urban wastewater collected in april 2020 in donggang had the highest overall health risk fig 6 a with one viral and six bacterial pathogens posing a high risk level identified the reported hav cases rose from 2019 to 2020 accordingly the high concentration of hav was also documented in april 2019 october 2019 and april 2020 interestingly the number of cases roughly doubled from 2017 183 cases to 2020 622 cases but the detected amount of hav has increased by more than ten fold a potential explanation is that in a small city clinical surveillance is possibly not well established therefore many asymptomatic or unrecognized hav patients may not be reported which further highlights the importance of environmental surveillance additionally farming wastewater revealed a high health risk for asfv b cereus and s enterica which requires extra interventions to guarantee food safety similarly the public health risks in zhanjiang water samples were also evaluated we first analyzed the virulence genes in the metagenomic data which showed that a baumanni b cereus c jejuni e coli k pneumoniae s enterica s sonii s pneumoniae and v cholerae posed high health risks in the urban region fig 6b among them wastewater collected in may 2018 contained seven pathogens with high health risk level in contrast aeromonas sp b cereus and v parahaemolyticus were the main concerns with the farming region for viruses no high level health risk was identified in urban and farming wastewaters in zhanjiang during 2017 2020 2 10 the shift of args profiles metagenomic surveillance also detected the shift of args profiles in different time scales supplementary text table s8 s9 several emerging args such as mcr 1 were detected posing a potential risk for clinical treatment 3 discussion the robustness of metagenomic sequencing for the detection of emerging pathogens the recent outbreaks of ebola zika and yellow fever viruses have shown that these pathogens circulated for extended periods of time before being recognized this led to costly delays in public health responses glennon et al 2019 koopmans et al 2019 peeling et al 2019 from the perspective of public health the major pathogens of concern in the wastewater are campylobacter spp pathogenic e coli salmonella spp shigella spp v cholerae hepatitis a norovirus and rotavirus iaconelli et al 2017 the untreated wastewater as a reservoir of pathogens as well as multidrug resistance may pose a health hazard for humans and animals when released to the natural environment by drinking consumption of seafood irrigation and other recreation activities chigor et al 2020 these health hazards potentially increased the local disease burden such as cholera typhoid or diarrhea although numerous studies have assembled pathogen genomes directly from metagenomic data with some success kang et al 2019 the quality of these genomes is often poor if pathogens are present in low abundance our study shows that only a few bacterial species with over 0 215 relative abundance can be recovered table s4 thus these low abundance pathogens are undetected and prevent proper health risk assessment metagenomic surveillance robustly detects emerging and underestimated pathogens from complex environmental samples the time point for the emergence of these pathogens correlates with local epidemics for instance the presence of ev71 and hav in donggang correlated with local epidemiological patterns additionally routine metagenomic surveillance can also enable early warnings of an epidemic first asf outbreak was reported in aug 2018 in liaoning ge et al 2018 whereas in this study a pcr assay confirmed the presence of asfv in the farming wastewater before 2018 asfv was first described in kenya in 1921 and was introduced into russia and the republic of georgia in 2007 after that it spread into other eastern european countries such as ukraine 2012 estonia 2014 romania 2017 and hungary 2018 asf outbreaks in pigs were continuously epidemic in liaoning china from august to october in 2018 ge et al 2018 subsequent analyses revealed that the chinese isolates such as china 2018 anhuixcgq cn201801 2018 and asfv pig china cas19 01 2019 were phylogenetically related to the estonia 2014 isolate our results confirm these observations phylogenetic analysis of the p72 gene sequence from water samples taken in oct 2017 and oct 2018 clustered with those from swine isolates indicating that asfv was introduced in china before 2018 thus it is clear that implementation of routine metagenomic surveillance is an effective biosecurity measure and could possibly prevent large scale epidemics this is the first study that provides comprehensive validation of metagenomic data that can be used as a microbiological risk assessment establishing a threshold based on correlations between pathogen levels in water with observed clinical cases can pave the way for early interventions in the future this would be especially helpful to trace underestimated pathogens and is ideally suited to describe the spatial and temporal trends in disease incidence for urban centers and local farms before outbreaks take place 3 1 the advantage and limitation of the application of public health risk assessment tool in wastewater surveillance the advantage of using wastewater surveillance is that it represents the entire population of the catchment area sample collection is straightforward and the anonymization by default makes it less challenging to use than patient based surveillance with respect to privacy laws currently a number of wastewater pathogen surveillance initiatives have been reported for instance kitajima et al 2020 suggested that wastewater epidemiology of sars cov 2 reflected the circulation of covid 19 within the communities likewise hendriksen et al 2019a b reported a descriptive analysis of the weekly metagenomic data obtained from urban sewage in ten weeks however those studies only reported the presence of pathogens rather than the microbial risks in wastewater an inherent limitation of metagenomic sequencing is that a substantial number of detected species are not necessarily to be human pathogens or pathogenic types for example whereas almost all s enterica strains are pathogenic higher typing solution is needed to distinguish pathogenic v cholerae from non pathogenic species urban et al 2021 to overcome these limitations in this study longitudinal wastewater surveillance was performed with three steps pathogen screening pathogen genotyping and risk assessment metagenomic surveillance was used as a screening tool to identify bacterial pathogens and dna virus while microfluidic chips and multiplexed qpcr were employed to screen rna virus in addition fine resolution epidemiological typing based on mlst or wgs were applied for understanding the presence and epidemiology of a given bacterial pathogen and compared with the clinical isolates overall half of pathogen genotypes were identified both in wastewater and clinical samples suggesting the potential role of wastewater surveillance as public health risk assessment tool in addition to the utility of this approach for detecting pathogen at low abundance this study illustrates the potential of metagenomics for assessing health risk associated with water uses the implementation of public health risk assessment tools has four main limitations firstly the full implementation of three steps provided in this assessment would require a significant investment of time in this study we obtained metagenomic sequencing data and virus detection within three days of sampling and finished the metagenomic analysis within a week for viral pathogens pathogen detection and genotyping were completed in a few days however additional steps including the bacterial isolation mlst or pcr were conducted for pathogens of particular concern took an extra couple of months for genotyping further studies were required to speed up the bacterial genotyping thus only eight samples were tested for each site which potentially limited the generalizability of the approach culturomics is a promising high throughput approach that makes it possible to obtain living bacteria rapidly chang et al 2019 to reduce the workload and realize a streamlined surveillance we suggested that local public health department could use metagenomic sequencing for initial screening of bacterial pathogens culture assays then can be performed to obtain the pure culture of bacterial pathogens for genotyping meanwhile for those opportunistic pathogens with over 10 fold increase relative to the base line in the metagenomic dataset qpcr can be employed to detect the actual abundance likewise for viral pathogens after the initial screening by microfluidic chip qpcr and conventional pcr can be respectively used for viral quantification and genotyping in this way local resources can be better prepared for specific pathogens the second limitation is how to deal with the overabundance of bacteriophages insect and plant viruses in the low input samples took up over 90 of dna virus which hinders the discovery of pathogenic viruses nieuwenhuijse et al 2020 besides previous studies also showed that many factors including rainfall and insufficient sampling could affect the detection of pathogens as the pathogens could either be drain away or missed in the non sampling sites which might affect the accurate assessment of the local epidemic these factors along with the distinct procedure of sewage sampling and stability of rna virus in wastewater lead to the vulnerability of surveillance strategy to stochastic events instead we collected samples in the wastewater outlet directly which is not significantly affected by the rainfall and sampling biases subsequent molecular typing further enables us to understand the local molecular epidemiology of each pathogen the approach presented here is well suited to scatter small towns or rural farms such as those monitored in this study since the presence of public health staff and veterinarians in these regions is scarce wastewater surveillance is a good strategy to curb potential pandemics and for early prevention of pathogen transmission the third limitation is that there is no prior information regarding baseline pathogen abundance values exist from these sites nieuwenhuijse et al 2020 thus it was still difficult to set a threshold to realize early warning of the viral outbreaks besides due to the low rna concentration we only conducted qpcr and microfluidic chip for 60 types of viruses unknown viral pathogens might be missed however our study provided important information on using metagenomics and subsequent validation including what sampling volumes to use what depth of sequencing to be applied and what bioinformatics analyses to be performed on the resulting data direct virome sequencing of water samples would be conducted in the future study the last limitation although metagenomic surveillance system of wastewater provides a powerful tool to evaluate disease incidence at the community level it is clear that they also need to be developed into a self reporting system and integrated into other public health information including clinical case reporting and mobile based contact tracing however these obstacles can be overcome by the improvement of self reporting system and development of a new bioinformatic pipeline with improvements in sample preparation and sequencing and standardization of pipelines for epidemiological typing metagenomic surveillance is expected to be a routine practice for real time monitoring of infectious diseases and ultimately to monitor early signals of the next pandemic in no time 4 conclusions in summary this study proposed a public health risk assessment framework for wastewater with significant potential for pathogen environmental surveillance applications given simultaneous detection of multiple and virulence genes with this outlined workflow wastewater surveillance is a powerful platform to visualize pathogen dynamics and provide critical insights into the relationships between pathogens and diseases additionally this risk assessment tool can monitor the epidemiology of pathogens in rural areas where clinical surveillance or reporting systems are not adequate 5 materials and methods 5 1 sampling sites and water sample collection two regions were selected for pathogen surveillance the first region was the donggang city with many aquaculture ponds on the landward side zhang et al 2018 shellfish farming is the most important industry in this region from 2017 to 2020 one farming site from dayang river dy and one urban site dongdong gou dg were selected respectively and sampled in april and october fig s1a these corresponded to the start and harvest season of local shellfish farm respectively an additional sampling site was located in zhanjiang in the southwest of guangdong province fig s1b which is the largest shrimp farming region in china direct discharge of shrimp wastewater has caused severe water pollution and raised public concern in 2020 one sampling site from the urban da and farming regions db were selected respectively and sampled in may and november from 2017 to 2020 fig s1b these also corresponded to the start and harvest season of local shrimp farms respectively for each sampling site three untreated wastewater outlets within a 3 km radius were selected which represented the major discharge drain for each urban or farming region for each outlet 2 l wastewater samples were respectively collected from surface 0 5 m and bottom 2 3 m afterwards waters from three outlets were mixed with total volume of 12 l for further processing the salinity of four sampling sites ranged from 5 to 10 varying depending on the season and currents which was potentially contributing to the complexity of the microbiome all water samples were sent to lab within 24 h via cold chain transportation 5 2 nutrient analyses of the wastewater water samples were filtered whatman gf f uk under laboratory conditions physicochemical

16426,early detection of emerging and life threatening pathogens circulating in complex environments is urgently required to combat infectious diseases this study proposed a public health risk assessment workflow with three stages pathogen screening pathogen genotyping and risk assessment in stage one pathogens were screened with metagenomic sequencing microfluidic chip and qpcr in stage two pathogens were isolated and genotyped with multi locus sequence typing mlst or conventional pcr finally virulence genes from metagenomic data were assessed for pathogenicity two regions donggang and zhanjiang with potential public health concerns were selected for evaluation each of which comprised of one urban and one farming wastewater sampling location overall metagenomic sequencing reflected the variation in the relative abundance of medically important bacteria over 90 bacterial pathogens were monitored in the metagenomic dataset of which 56 species harbored virulence genes in donggang a pathogenic acinetobacter sp reached high abundances in 2018 and 2020 whereas all pathogenic vibrio spp peaked in october 2019 in zhanjiang a baumanni and other enterobacteriaceae species were abundantly present in 2019 and 2020 whereas aeromonas and vibrio spp peaked in november 2017 forty species were subsequently isolated and subtyped by mlst half of which were prevalent genotypes in clinical data additionally we identified the african swine fever virus asfv in water samples collected in 2017 ahead of the first reported asfv outbreak in 2018 in china rna viruses like hepatitis a virus hav and enterovirus 71 ev71 were also detected with concentrations peaking in april 2020 and april 2018 respectively the dynamics of hav and ev71 were consistent with local epidemic trends finally based on the virulence gene profiles our study identified the risk level in wastewater of two cities this workflow illustrates the potential for an early warning of local epidemics which helps to prioritize the preparedness for specific pathogens locally graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metagenomic sequencing wastewater surveillance mlst virulence public health risk pathogen genotyping 1 introduction water dwelling pathogens can cause severe diseases such as cholera leptospirosis typhoid or diarrhea bartram et al 2005 given the unpredictable and high diversity of these emerging diseases one of the critical challenges for waterborne pathogen surveillance is the prioritization of preparedness for local outbreaks the greatest and most acute public health risks result from urban and farming wastewater discharge given their elevated and diverse urban and rural contaminants osiemo et al 2019 gastrointestinal illnesses resulting from drinking contaminated water are commonly correlated with concentrations of enteric pathogens yet traditional microbiological quality assessment of water is only based on the presence of a few fecal indicator bacteria e g escherichia coli and enterococci van lieverloo et al 2007 nevertheless the current framework only tracks the microbial pollution from feces whereas the microbial risk from non fecal pathogens e g vibrio cholerae is severely underestimated zhao et al 2019 in the united states alone 507 cases of waterborne illness involving the enteric viruses e colio157 h7 campylobacter jejuni legionella spp salmonella typhimurium v cholerae and pseudomonas aeruginosa that resulted in acute gastrointestinal and respiratory illness were reported between 1996 and 2006 craun et al 2006 recently these limitations have been reassessed with the prospect of environmental metagenomics metagenomic next generation sequencing mngs is a promising candidate approach for the identification of a broad spectrum of pathogens in environmental samples as theoretically almost all potential pathogens can be detected by identifying unique dna and or rna sequences urban et al 2021 ma et al 2019 besides mngs has illustrated the relationship between microbial communities and their disease and antimicrobial resistance in both clinical and environmental samples kim et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 metagenomic sequencing has also been utilized as a public health risk assessment tool by identifying potential microbial risks suttner et al 2020 furthermore a recent study also demonstrated the potential of using metagenomic sequencing for comprehensive microbial risk assessment yasir 2020 for wastewater this catch all approach could provide unbiased insights into the dynamics of pathogens present in a region however the current application of mngs has three main limitations firstly the majority of analyses sequence only a single time point of the bacterial or viral community without continuous sampling zhou et al 2021 gulino et al 2020 this results in an inability to conduct longitudinal analyses of pathogen dynamics furthermore these studies were also constrained by solely focusing on bacteria dna or rna viruses bibby et al 2019 gulino et al 2020 hampering a complete evaluation of regional health secondly many studies have focused on microbial diversity and the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args in wastewater in contrast complete pathogen profiling including viruses bacteria fungi and parasites is scarce thus metagenomic surveillance identifying all pathogens is essential for outbreak management and early warnings allowing for origin determination and monitoring of bacterial and viral transmission patterns lastly resolving the pathogens at the strain level and distinguishing the pathogenic genotype from the metagenomic data remains challenging for instance leonard et al 2015 found that a large proportion of non pathogenic e coli present in water samples reinforcing the urgency of assessing the potential virulence of any e coli strain thus in order to avoid wasting resources due to false positive or negative results careful validation of metagenomic data is critical for the accurate microbial risk assessment of wastewater to address these challenges in the present study public health risk assessment was conducted in three steps screening the potential pathogens confirmation of the pathogenic genotypes and comparison with local clinical data in each stage various techniques were employed fig 1 in step one metagenomic sequencing and microfluidic chip were used to screen bacterial and viral pathogens respectively in step two conventional pcr for viral pathogen and multi locus sequence typing mlst whole genome sequencing wgs for bacterial pathogens was used to validate the presence and genotype of pathogens meanwhile qpcr was used to quantify the abundance of the pathogens with special focus in step three virulence gene of pathogens were analyzed to assess the health risk level donggang city with a population of 650 000 and potou district in zhanjiang city with a population of 390 000 were selected for performing our proposed workflow fig 1 both sites lack wastewater treatment facilities in urban and farming regions and have experienced a rapid deterioration of water quality in the estuary since 2017 table s1 raising in public concern the above scenarios provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of our workflow for local risk assessment from 2017 to 2020 one urban and one farming wastewater discharging point with the largest volume was selected to assess the public health risk in each city 2 results 2 1 screening of potential bacterial pathogens in donggang water samples in donggang samples were collected from farming dy and urban wastewater dg biannually in the period 2017 2020 fig s1a in the metagenomic data 89 3 of reads were assigned into the bacteria at the phylum level the sequenced reads from all dy samples were assigned to 11 different phyla fig 2 a and differed markedly in their patterns of bacterial composition as shown by principal coordinate analysis pcoa fig s2 we further examined the potential pathogens in the metagenomic dataset of water samples metaphlan2 was employed for taxonomy assignment of each sample a total of 100 bacterial pathogens included in the virulence factors database vfdb liu et al 2019 were selected for screening table s2 of these 40 pathogens were abundantly detected in the metagenomic dataset of dy including both waterborne e g aeromonas hydrophila vibrio parahaemolyticus and v cholerae and respiratory pathogens such as klebsiella pneumoniae neisseria meningitidis and legionella pneumophila after 2019 the relative abundance of several detected pathogens increased e g acinetobacter baumannii v parahaemolyticus v cholerae v alginolyticus v vulnificus k pneumoniae salmonella enterica mycobacterium tuberculosis and campylobacter jejuni in contrast other species decreased in the period 2017 to 2020 e g aeromonas veronii l pneumophila and salmonella bongori fig 2b among them thirty two species were detected in the subsequent culture assays in urban site dg bacterial composition in urban wastewater remained stable between 2017 and 2018 fig 2c afterwards the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased in april 2019 to 17 3 before becoming a dominant group in september 2020 among them 76 bacterial pathogens were detected in the metagenomic dataset of which 32 were included for visualization fig 2d pathogenic acinetobacter sp reached high relative abundance in 2018 and 2020 whereas all pathogenic vibrio spp peaked in october 2019 in contrast the relative abundance of other pathogens did not fluctuate significantly seventeen species among the 32 selected bacterial pathogens were obtained in culture assays at various sampling times fig 2d the relative abundance of m tuberculosis treponema pallidum and s enterica responsible for clinical cases of tuberculosis syphilis and typhoid paratyphoid respectively was constant during the period of study fig s3 2 2 bacterial pathogen genotyping in donggang next further genotyping by mlst was performed for individual species to confirm whether it belonged to pathogenic genotype we selected 16 isolated bacterial species isolated from urban or farming wastewater for mlst this list included enteric pathogens such as s enterica v cholerae and v parahaemolyticus as well as opportunistic pathogens like k pneumoniae pseudomonas aeruginosa and a baumannii for v cholerae and v parahaemolyticus three and five sequence types sts were identified in donggang respectively table s3 of which only v parahaemolyticus st3 was identified in local clinical data fig s4 seven sts of k pneumoniae were identified in both sites including st11 and st23 and were predominant in local hospital related infections five l pneumophila sts were detected in donggang none of which were detected in clinical cases m tuberculosis belonging to the beijing clade st4 was presented both in clinical and environmental samples in donggang while environmental st34 and st19 of s enterica were also identified in local patients for other pathogens up to six sts were detected for each species except for enterobacter cloacae and at least one st of each species was presented in clinical samples fig s4 nevertheless while some pathogenic genotypes were not identified in local clinical samples they were widespread such as staphylococcus aureus st7 and therefore still require further investigation 2 3 screening of pathogenic viruses in donggang water samples next we screened the presence of 60 pathogenic viruses associated with public health risk table s2 most of which have been previously reported in wastewater and poses a significant health risk for humans and animals van rossum et al 2015 among these 20 dna viruses were confirmed by mapping metagenomic reads against the 20 reference genomes meanwhile 40 rna viruses were screened by microfluidic chip afterwards positive results of any dna or rna virus were confirmed by qpcr assays we first screened 20 pathogenic dna viruses in the metagenomic dataset in dy a few viral pathogens were identified such as african swine fever virus asfv and swinepox virus it is interesting that asfv was detected in the october 2017 and peaked in 2018 fig 5a subsequent qpcr assay confirmed these observations asfv was detected in the apr 2018 by qpcr with a viral load of 3 0 103 copy l and continuously detected in the following samples this is before the first asf case in a swine farm in liaoning reported on 3 august 2018 ge et al 2018 neither asfv nor swinepox virus was detected in site dg no other zoonosis dna virus was detected in either site we then tested the presence of 40 pathogenic rna viruses by high throughput microfluidic chip detection table s2 in dy norovirus mumps virus rhinovirus and human herpesvirus 6 virus were detected only in 2019 samples and then confirmed by qpcr in dg human enterovirus 71 ev71 was detected in samples from 2017 to 2019 whereas coxsackievirus 16 ca16 was only detected in april 2020 2 4 virus genotyping in donggang water samples next we further conducted virus genotyping for positive samples we used concentrated dna samples to conduct pcr for the asfv b646l gene amplified from dy 2017 and 2018 water samples a phylogenetic analysis of b646l detected in dy and 32 asfv b646l sequence data from other countries revealed that the former was genetically identical to the first asfv isolate cn201801 2018 obtained from dead swine in liaoning and other east european countries ge et al 2018 afterwards qpcr was conducted to quantify ev71 concentration which peaked in april 2019 5 8 102 copy l fig 3 b at the time of the hand foot and mouth disease epidemic in donggang city fig 3b pcr of the vp1 gene of ev71 in rna extracts collected from 2019 were positive subsequent phylogenetic analysis confirmed that ev71 from donggang belonged to the c4a type prevalent in liaoning province however no gene fragment of ca16 was amplified by pcr in urban site dg hepatitis a virus hav was detected by qpcr from october 2018 to october 2020 peaking in april 2020 4 7 103 copy l fig 5c this coincides with a significant increase of hav cases reported from november 2019 to april 2020 we further obtained the vp3 p2a region of hav by pcr amplification phylogenetic analysis of this region retrieved from 100 publicly available hav genomes revealed that the hav identified in wastewater samples was genetically related to the dalian isolates dl3 fig 5c for the remaining positively detected virus no gene from both viruses was amplified by conventional pcr probably because of low abundance 2 5 screening of potential bacterial pathogens in zhanjiang water samples in the period 2017 2020 we also conducted semiannual surveillance in zhanjiang located in south china this is the largest shrimp farming region in china and has historically been affected by plague epidemics one typical urban da and farming db wastewater discharging point was selected fig s1b metagenomic analysis revealed that about 90 of reads corresponded to bacteria at the urban site da proteobacteria was the most abundant followed by verrucomicrobia and actinobacteria 35 and 58 respectively fig 4 a at the farming site db proteobacteria was also predominant at the phylum level and its abundance increased from 50 1 in 2017 to 84 7 in 2020 fig 3a pcoa analysis show that microbial composition at the two sites diverges after november 2018 fig s2 the top 20 most abundant genera represented from 35 to 57 of the microbial community at each sampling time fig 4b next we investigated the relative abundance of pathogens in the metagenomic dataset by metaphlan2 species of the genus arcobacter were found in the samples collected in 2019 5 8 and 2020 4 8 whereas genus aeromonas and vibrio spp peaked in samples taken after november 2017 0 43 and 4 1 respectively apart from arcobacter sp several bacterial pathogens were detected at the da site fig 4c yersinia pseudotuberculosis was detected at all sampling times peaking in may 2018 0 00013 interestingly other species also peaked at that time like acinetobacter sp k pneumoniae n meningitidis s enterica shigella flexneri shigella sonnei staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus suis a subsequent culture based assay later confirmed the presence of 22 and 18 pathogenic species in sites da and db respectively fig 4c d we also conducted direct binning of the metagenomic dataset for both cities the number of metagenome assembled genomes mags in each dataset ranged from 7 to 23 table s4 and the relative abundance of each mag ranged from 0 215 to 1 325 however the annotation of each mags revealed that none of them harbored virulence factors this suggests that this method can only detect highly abundant pathogens 2 6 bacterial pathogen genotyping of zhanjiang water sample for v parahaemolyticus 4 and 13 sts were identified in urban and farming wastewater respectively table s5 st1740 and st1799 were repeatedly isolated in 3 out of 10 zhanjiang samples four v cholerae sts st69 st1170 st1171 and a novel st were identified in zhanjiang of which st69 belongs to the pandemic o1 serogroup and was found in urban samples meanwhile st23 st35 and st86 k pneumoniae isolates were found in urban and farming wastewaters additionally st11 st34 and st13 s enterica isolates were detected in urban samples most of them were epidemic genotypes and were also detected in clinical samples in guangdong provinces according to the pubmlst database https pubmlst org table s5 2 7 virus detection and genotyping in zhanjiang water samples in the zhanjiang metagenomic dataset 3 2 of reads were assigned to dna viruses of which 97 8 corresponded to bacterial phages four human pathogens were also detected in 2017 and 2019 including tanapox virus associated with child diarrhea monkeypox virus and human herpesvirus 6 were also detected in zhanjiang since may 2018 and was present in all samples with low abundance 0 00008 swinepox virus was detected in may 2019 with very low abundance 0 001 however subsequent qpcr assay did not detect above viruses probably due to low abundance for rna viruses microfluidic chip and subsequent qpcr both gave positive results for norovirus in zhanjiang bay in november 2018 may and november 2019 with a virus load of 3 4 104 1 78 103 and 2 9 103 copy l respectively whereas sapovirus was detected in november 2018 with 3 2 103 copy l however no dna fragment of these viruses was amplified by conventional pcr 2 8 quantification of the abundance of opportunistic pathogens and wgs in the metagenomic data from both sites we observed significant increases in the relative abundance of a given pathogen across multiple points for instance relative to the baseline over 100 fold increase of a baumannii acinetobacter lwoffi and acinetobacter junii were observed in the dg sample in apr 2018 while an over ten fold increase of aeromonas media was identified in the dy sample in oct 2018 fig 2 to better understand the risk posed by these opportunistic pathogens we performed species specific qpcr for quantification of a media a baumannii a lwoffi a junii and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the water sample of donggang respectively likewise qpcr was also conducted for aeromonas caviae a baumannii acinetobacter hemolyticus shewanella algae and v alginolyticus for zhanjiang water samples afterward we compared the abundance of each pathogen results revealed that pathogen abundance in wastewater ranged from 7 1 104 to 1 33 109 copy l table s5 relative to the 50 lethal dose ld50 reported in a previous study rusin et al 1997 hara kudo and takatori 2012 the abundance of a junii a baumannii and a lowffii in dg in apr 2018 and apr 2020 exceed the ld50 level four potential pathogens without an mlst scheme from zhanjiang were selected for wgs including a junii isolates from donggang v alginolyticus s algae and a hemolyticus to elucidate further the epidemiological relationships between these environmental isolates and clinical strains one environmental v alginolyticus isolate from zhanjiang was genomically related to previous strains obtained from aquaculture farms in zhanjiang indicating they were endemic clones in this region fig 5 a likewise phylogenetic analysis of s algae genomes showed that one environmental isolate zj61 was genetically related to four s algae clinical strains from shandong in china in contrast another isolate zj sh was located on an independent branch fig 5b together with 75 public genomes phylogenomic analysis of a junii divided them into five clusters donggang isolate jz20 from 2018 water sample was clustered with 2020 isolate jz102 fig 5c phylogenomic analysis of 57 a hemolyticus genomes revealed that one zhanjiang isolate zj54 was genomically related to sz3452 which was isolated from a hospital in a nearby city in the same province fig 5d likewise zhanjiang isolate hk30 was clustered with a hospital acquired strain xh900 in zhejiang province 2 9 public health risk assessment of wastewater samples based on these results we propose a risk assessment framework for rapidly evaluating public health risk in wastewater samples for bacteria if pathogens were detectable in the metagenomic dataset but were unculturable we suggest that this scenario only poses a low risk to public health however if both the pathogen and its key virulence genes were retrieved in the metagenomic dataset but no pathogenic genotype was isolated this would result in a medium health risk classification furthermore in instances where pathogenic genotypes were confirmed by subsequent isolation and mlst this suggests a high public health risk and would call for public health intervention we adopted similar criteria to evaluate the public health risk posed by viruses viruses detected by qpcr microfluidic chip metagenomic data suggested a medium risk if it was further amplified by traditional pcr then we considered this a high health risk according to these criteria we assessed the public health risk of sampled water in both cities metagenomic data was mapped against the vfdb database for 95 reference pathogens key virulence factors including 1 toxins 2 flagella and pilus 3 lipopolysaccharides and antigens and 4 pathogenicity islands were selected supplementary text overall 24 species harbored the key virulence factors which were variably presented in different water samples table s7 we identified that urban and farming water samples exhibited distinct health risk profiles urban wastewater collected in april 2020 in donggang had the highest overall health risk fig 6 a with one viral and six bacterial pathogens posing a high risk level identified the reported hav cases rose from 2019 to 2020 accordingly the high concentration of hav was also documented in april 2019 october 2019 and april 2020 interestingly the number of cases roughly doubled from 2017 183 cases to 2020 622 cases but the detected amount of hav has increased by more than ten fold a potential explanation is that in a small city clinical surveillance is possibly not well established therefore many asymptomatic or unrecognized hav patients may not be reported which further highlights the importance of environmental surveillance additionally farming wastewater revealed a high health risk for asfv b cereus and s enterica which requires extra interventions to guarantee food safety similarly the public health risks in zhanjiang water samples were also evaluated we first analyzed the virulence genes in the metagenomic data which showed that a baumanni b cereus c jejuni e coli k pneumoniae s enterica s sonii s pneumoniae and v cholerae posed high health risks in the urban region fig 6b among them wastewater collected in may 2018 contained seven pathogens with high health risk level in contrast aeromonas sp b cereus and v parahaemolyticus were the main concerns with the farming region for viruses no high level health risk was identified in urban and farming wastewaters in zhanjiang during 2017 2020 2 10 the shift of args profiles metagenomic surveillance also detected the shift of args profiles in different time scales supplementary text table s8 s9 several emerging args such as mcr 1 were detected posing a potential risk for clinical treatment 3 discussion the robustness of metagenomic sequencing for the detection of emerging pathogens the recent outbreaks of ebola zika and yellow fever viruses have shown that these pathogens circulated for extended periods of time before being recognized this led to costly delays in public health responses glennon et al 2019 koopmans et al 2019 peeling et al 2019 from the perspective of public health the major pathogens of concern in the wastewater are campylobacter spp pathogenic e coli salmonella spp shigella spp v cholerae hepatitis a norovirus and rotavirus iaconelli et al 2017 the untreated wastewater as a reservoir of pathogens as well as multidrug resistance may pose a health hazard for humans and animals when released to the natural environment by drinking consumption of seafood irrigation and other recreation activities chigor et al 2020 these health hazards potentially increased the local disease burden such as cholera typhoid or diarrhea although numerous studies have assembled pathogen genomes directly from metagenomic data with some success kang et al 2019 the quality of these genomes is often poor if pathogens are present in low abundance our study shows that only a few bacterial species with over 0 215 relative abundance can be recovered table s4 thus these low abundance pathogens are undetected and prevent proper health risk assessment metagenomic surveillance robustly detects emerging and underestimated pathogens from complex environmental samples the time point for the emergence of these pathogens correlates with local epidemics for instance the presence of ev71 and hav in donggang correlated with local epidemiological patterns additionally routine metagenomic surveillance can also enable early warnings of an epidemic first asf outbreak was reported in aug 2018 in liaoning ge et al 2018 whereas in this study a pcr assay confirmed the presence of asfv in the farming wastewater before 2018 asfv was first described in kenya in 1921 and was introduced into russia and the republic of georgia in 2007 after that it spread into other eastern european countries such as ukraine 2012 estonia 2014 romania 2017 and hungary 2018 asf outbreaks in pigs were continuously epidemic in liaoning china from august to october in 2018 ge et al 2018 subsequent analyses revealed that the chinese isolates such as china 2018 anhuixcgq cn201801 2018 and asfv pig china cas19 01 2019 were phylogenetically related to the estonia 2014 isolate our results confirm these observations phylogenetic analysis of the p72 gene sequence from water samples taken in oct 2017 and oct 2018 clustered with those from swine isolates indicating that asfv was introduced in china before 2018 thus it is clear that implementation of routine metagenomic surveillance is an effective biosecurity measure and could possibly prevent large scale epidemics this is the first study that provides comprehensive validation of metagenomic data that can be used as a microbiological risk assessment establishing a threshold based on correlations between pathogen levels in water with observed clinical cases can pave the way for early interventions in the future this would be especially helpful to trace underestimated pathogens and is ideally suited to describe the spatial and temporal trends in disease incidence for urban centers and local farms before outbreaks take place 3 1 the advantage and limitation of the application of public health risk assessment tool in wastewater surveillance the advantage of using wastewater surveillance is that it represents the entire population of the catchment area sample collection is straightforward and the anonymization by default makes it less challenging to use than patient based surveillance with respect to privacy laws currently a number of wastewater pathogen surveillance initiatives have been reported for instance kitajima et al 2020 suggested that wastewater epidemiology of sars cov 2 reflected the circulation of covid 19 within the communities likewise hendriksen et al 2019a b reported a descriptive analysis of the weekly metagenomic data obtained from urban sewage in ten weeks however those studies only reported the presence of pathogens rather than the microbial risks in wastewater an inherent limitation of metagenomic sequencing is that a substantial number of detected species are not necessarily to be human pathogens or pathogenic types for example whereas almost all s enterica strains are pathogenic higher typing solution is needed to distinguish pathogenic v cholerae from non pathogenic species urban et al 2021 to overcome these limitations in this study longitudinal wastewater surveillance was performed with three steps pathogen screening pathogen genotyping and risk assessment metagenomic surveillance was used as a screening tool to identify bacterial pathogens and dna virus while microfluidic chips and multiplexed qpcr were employed to screen rna virus in addition fine resolution epidemiological typing based on mlst or wgs were applied for understanding the presence and epidemiology of a given bacterial pathogen and compared with the clinical isolates overall half of pathogen genotypes were identified both in wastewater and clinical samples suggesting the potential role of wastewater surveillance as public health risk assessment tool in addition to the utility of this approach for detecting pathogen at low abundance this study illustrates the potential of metagenomics for assessing health risk associated with water uses the implementation of public health risk assessment tools has four main limitations firstly the full implementation of three steps provided in this assessment would require a significant investment of time in this study we obtained metagenomic sequencing data and virus detection within three days of sampling and finished the metagenomic analysis within a week for viral pathogens pathogen detection and genotyping were completed in a few days however additional steps including the bacterial isolation mlst or pcr were conducted for pathogens of particular concern took an extra couple of months for genotyping further studies were required to speed up the bacterial genotyping thus only eight samples were tested for each site which potentially limited the generalizability of the approach culturomics is a promising high throughput approach that makes it possible to obtain living bacteria rapidly chang et al 2019 to reduce the workload and realize a streamlined surveillance we suggested that local public health department could use metagenomic sequencing for initial screening of bacterial pathogens culture assays then can be performed to obtain the pure culture of bacterial pathogens for genotyping meanwhile for those opportunistic pathogens with over 10 fold increase relative to the base line in the metagenomic dataset qpcr can be employed to detect the actual abundance likewise for viral pathogens after the initial screening by microfluidic chip qpcr and conventional pcr can be respectively used for viral quantification and genotyping in this way local resources can be better prepared for specific pathogens the second limitation is how to deal with the overabundance of bacteriophages insect and plant viruses in the low input samples took up over 90 of dna virus which hinders the discovery of pathogenic viruses nieuwenhuijse et al 2020 besides previous studies also showed that many factors including rainfall and insufficient sampling could affect the detection of pathogens as the pathogens could either be drain away or missed in the non sampling sites which might affect the accurate assessment of the local epidemic these factors along with the distinct procedure of sewage sampling and stability of rna virus in wastewater lead to the vulnerability of surveillance strategy to stochastic events instead we collected samples in the wastewater outlet directly which is not significantly affected by the rainfall and sampling biases subsequent molecular typing further enables us to understand the local molecular epidemiology of each pathogen the approach presented here is well suited to scatter small towns or rural farms such as those monitored in this study since the presence of public health staff and veterinarians in these regions is scarce wastewater surveillance is a good strategy to curb potential pandemics and for early prevention of pathogen transmission the third limitation is that there is no prior information regarding baseline pathogen abundance values exist from these sites nieuwenhuijse et al 2020 thus it was still difficult to set a threshold to realize early warning of the viral outbreaks besides due to the low rna concentration we only conducted qpcr and microfluidic chip for 60 types of viruses unknown viral pathogens might be missed however our study provided important information on using metagenomics and subsequent validation including what sampling volumes to use what depth of sequencing to be applied and what bioinformatics analyses to be performed on the resulting data direct virome sequencing of water samples would be conducted in the future study the last limitation although metagenomic surveillance system of wastewater provides a powerful tool to evaluate disease incidence at the community level it is clear that they also need to be developed into a self reporting system and integrated into other public health information including clinical case reporting and mobile based contact tracing however these obstacles can be overcome by the improvement of self reporting system and development of a new bioinformatic pipeline with improvements in sample preparation and sequencing and standardization of pipelines for epidemiological typing metagenomic surveillance is expected to be a routine practice for real time monitoring of infectious diseases and ultimately to monitor early signals of the next pandemic in no time 4 conclusions in summary this study proposed a public health risk assessment framework for wastewater with significant potential for pathogen environmental surveillance applications given simultaneous detection of multiple and virulence genes with this outlined workflow wastewater surveillance is a powerful platform to visualize pathogen dynamics and provide critical insights into the relationships between pathogens and diseases additionally this risk assessment tool can monitor the epidemiology of pathogens in rural areas where clinical surveillance or reporting systems are not adequate 5 materials and methods 5 1 sampling sites and water sample collection two regions were selected for pathogen surveillance the first region was the donggang city with many aquaculture ponds on the landward side zhang et al 2018 shellfish farming is the most important industry in this region from 2017 to 2020 one farming site from dayang river dy and one urban site dongdong gou dg were

zhanjiang in the southwest of guangdong province fig s1b which is the largest shrimp farming region in china direct discharge of shrimp wastewater has caused severe water pollution and raised public concern in 2020 one sampling site from the urban da and farming regions db were selected respectively and sampled in may and november from 2017 to 2020 fig s1b these also corresponded to the start and harvest season of local shrimp farms respectively for each sampling site three untreated wastewater outlets within a 3 km radius were selected which represented the major discharge drain for each urban or farming region for each outlet 2 l wastewater samples were respectively collected from surface 0 5 m and bottom 2 3 m afterwards waters from three outlets were mixed with total volume of 12 l

16427,while zero liquid discharge zld wetlands have been successfully used for domestic wastewater treatment adapting this technology to treat other wastewaters such as leachate could be very attractive for some industries concerned with meeting increasingly stringent environmental regulations leachate treatment typically implies large volume of water that are entirely dependent on rainfall and therefore highly variable both throughout the year and between years current design guidelines for zero discharge willow systems limit system flexibility because they are based on rough theoretical estimates of evapotranspiration this discuss the applicability of zld treatment through a willow bed evapotranspiration et applied to the treatment of industrial leachate that has high and variable hydraulic loading rate and low contaminant and salt concentration we propose a base design and through detailed and long term hydrological modeling of such a treatment system investigate how various design and management decisions can affect sizing efficiency and overall feasibility of the technology we showed that considering et optimization factors e g fertilization and organic substrate was essential for zld to be achieved over a 20 year period in northern continental humid climate and that the ratio between cumulative annual et of the willow bed and cumulative annual rainfall should be at least 1 5 when varying the leachate collection area it was found that a ratio of willow bed area to collection area between 0 5 and 0 7 should be expected for an optimized design in this specific climate were land area and storage volume remain the most limiting factors regarding storage volume several management options can be applied to reduce the volume of storage required we also highlight that a risk attenuation strategy should always be included in the design of a zld wetland system our study suggests that zld wetlands constitute a green technology that represents a serious alternative treatment method for pretreated leachate while offering many benefits such as low maintenance and energy costs valorization of contaminants such as nitrogen or phosphorus through biomass production and most importantly zero contaminant discharge to the environment finally we propose future research opportunities and other possible applications for further development of the technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords evapotranspiration wetland salix contaminated leachate humid continental northern climate design optimization hydrological modeling 1 introduction every year industries must treat a large variable volume of water due to rainfall leaching through various wastes or products e g landfills mine wastes stored treated wood poles among the available solutions used for industrial wastewater treatment some aim to reduce the volume of water released into the environment to zero and are referred to as zero liquid discharge zld systems such systems were first developed to allow different industrial sectors to reduce both water consumption and treatment costs koppol et al 2004 this type of approach can also allow industries to avoid having to obtain a discharge permit for their contaminated effluent the concept of zld is used increasingly to address a number of the different constraints and difficulties associated with wastewater treatment tong and elimelech 2016 typical zld systems can take various forms the simplest being evaporation ponds where wastewater is stored until it passively evaporates not only does this type of system fail to enable reuse of the water it also requires a very large area and is feasible in very few contexts such as arid and semi arid climates in contrast some highly sophisticated systems combine physical e g water purification through energy fueled evaporators and chemical e g adding chemicals to precipitate a specific compound steps to both purify water and raw materials that can be reused these latter systems can be very efficient but are typically energy demanding with high installation and operation costs phytotechnology based zld systems were introduced in the 1990s in the form of constructed wetlands planted with willows they were used to treat domestic wastewater in denmark and designed to generate zero effluent gregersen and brix 2001 brix and arias 2005 2011 since then this technology has also been used in ireland o hogain et al 2011 curneen and gill 2016 and feasibility studies were successfully carried out in mongolia khurelbaatar et al 2017 such constructed wetlands are now referred to as willow wetlands willow systems willow beds or zero discharge wetlands kadlec and wallace 2008 dotro et al 2017 the targeted mechanism for reducing the volume of the effluent is evapotranspiration et in which the system loses water by evaporation and plant transpiration this natural process is sometimes utilized in environmental engineering especially to treat contaminated landfill leachate białowiec et al 2011 using this form of green technology in industrial wastewater treatment offers a number of advantages over conventional approaches including low maintenance and energy costs concentration of the contaminants or by products in a confined compartment i e the wetland substrate valorization of contaminants such as nitrogen or phosphorus through biomass production and zero discharge to the environment willow systems for domestic wastewater treatment are typically sized according to hydraulic and surface loading rates for population equivalent values dotro et al 2017 and current design guidelines for willow systems are often based on rough estimations of et e g mean annual crop coefficient of 2 5 times a reference et brix and arias 2005 furthermore domestic wastewater represents a relatively constant and predictable hydraulic loading and low phytotoxic potential to our knowledge no design recommendations or criteria have been proposed for the treatment of other types of wastewater or for more complex treatment systems industrial leachates typically have very high and variable hydraulic loading rate and may have high contaminant and or salt concentrations which would require specific consideration in the design process or even compromise reduce zld feasibility if used in their raw form e g leachates from young landfill cells or acid mining drainage brennan et al 2016 simate and ndlovu 2014 furthermore the discharge regulations are not the same for all types of leachates which would also influence the decision of using a zld approach and the system management in this study we focus on the treatment of industrial leachate that 1 has high and variable hydraulic loading rate 2 is either pre treated or that contain low contaminant and salt concentration and 3 for which discharge regulations are problematic and justify the interest in a zld solution our objective is to propose a design for a flexible and durable zld system incorporating an evapotranspiration willow wetland that is hydraulically limited but could also be applied to related leachate characteristics through hydrological modeling of such a treatment system we also investigate how various design aspects could be used to significantly optimize management practices our modeling approach was based on a detailed analysis of et temporal variation and water flow management 2 materials and method 2 1 model description 2 1 1 model development the design of a zld for treating leachates is highly dependent on climatic regime the surface required for zero discharge of a given leachate collection area would be minimal under a tropical drier climate with highly predictable precipitation our model was developed and tested under the more stringent conditions of the humid temperate continental climate of southeastern canada québec this region has long freezing winters and warm humid summers precipitation levels are relatively high annual average around 1 m 20 falling as snow and occurring all year round with occasional dry spells especially in summer high evapotranspiration only occurs during the relatively short growing season temporary leachate storage may thus be necessary for winter precipitation and extreme rainfall events and to provide sufficient irrigation to plants during dry summer periods zld evaporative efficiency also depends on the water composition of the leachate as mentioned in the introduction pretreatment would be recommended for highly contaminated leachate to prevent willow toxicity and rapid accumulation of contaminants and salts in the zld bed and to expand its overall lifespan furthermore since willow biomass production is strongly correlated to et martin and stephens 2006 and generally increase with nutrient availability particularly nitrogen fabio and smart 2018 fertilization may be necessary to maximize the willow bed et when treating nutrient deficient leachate the system design modelled here comprises an open tank or pond hereafter referred to as an open collection tank that stores wastewater or collects leachate seeping out from contaminated materials being open the collection tank receives rainfall as well fig 1 a pre treatment step is included here in the form of a treatment wetland physical chemical and biological removal processes to ensure that the outflow of this compartment and that is used to irrigate the evapotranspiration willow bed has a low contaminant charge fig 1 we assume that gross filtration and settling of large particles occur prior to the pre treatment step finally two equalization tanks equalizing tank 1 and equalizing tank 2 are connected to the collection tank and the willow bed respectively to manage water flowrate variability in the system although the two equalization tanks could have been combined into one their separation ensures that only pre treated water enters the willow bed thus increasing its life span and allows treated water to be separated from partially treated or raw wastewater as illustrated in fig 1 the only water input in the system is the rainfall occurring over the collection tank the treatment wetland and the willow bed and the output occurs through evaporation e from the collection tank and evapotranspiration et from the treatment wetland and the willow bed the input water not lost through evapotranspiration moves from one compartment to the other and the closed circuit enables operation of the system with zld the model was developed to produce a daily computation of the value of every water flux and the volume of water contained in each component of the system after all water exchanges have occurred based on the classical hydrological balance equations see supplementary material for detailed equations used to maintain the general water flow described above a set of management rules was implemented in the model see supplementary material globally these rules ensure that 1 water is always available for e and et in both the collection tank and the willow bed and that sufficient water is available in the collection tank for irrigating the treatment wetland at all times 2 overflow of the collection tank the treatment wetland and the willow bed are conveyed to the designated compartments see fig 1 3 the water level in the collection tank the treatment wetland and the willow bed is lowered before winter to prevent root and pipe damage in the treatment wetland and the willow bed due to water freezing and to prevent spring overflow in the collection tank and 4 if as a last resort remedy water must be pumped out of the system or discharged to the environment the effluent will have gone through both primary treatment in the regular treatment wetland and secondary treatment in the willow bed and therefore contain the lowest concentration of contaminants possible 2 1 2 model parameterization and calibration based on the model design presented in section 2 1 1 we can determine five categories of parameters that are needed for the model to operate component design water flux management plant parameters evapotranspiration and meteorology see supplementary material some of the parameters such as meteorological data are external and cannot be controlled while auxiliary parameters like component design are determined by the user other parameters such as evapotranspiration are external but can be modulated through management decisions see design optimization opportunities section 2 3 et calculations are based on a previous study conducted on a willow bed planted with salix miyabeana sx67 frédette et al 2019a see supplementary material and leaf area index lai calculated on site fig 2 evaporation e from the collection tank is estimated to be about 80 of the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 treatment wetland evapotranspiration ettw is estimated to be equal to et0 crop coefficient or ket of 1 2 1 3 model validation this modeling study uses data collected from a demonstration scale leachate treatment system set up and operating in québec canada since 2012 as a reference this system was built to evaluate the performance of different wetland processes for treating leachate collected on a storage site for treated wood poles it was not designed as a zld and its effluent is discharged into a municipal sewer a general description of the system and its design parameters is provided in the supplementary materials for the purposes of this study the following parameters were monitored on the reference site during the 2016 2017 and 2018 operation seasons the volume of water pumped into the treatment wetlands intw m3 the volume of both willow bed affluent and effluent inwb and outwb m3 and willow bed evapotranspiration etwb m3 to validate our model we slightly modified the conceptual model presented in section 2 1 1 so that the overflow of the willow bed would flow out of the treatment system instead and both equalization tanks were removed since there is currently no such tank on site we simulated only the operating seasons which were from may 9 to november 30 in 2016 206 days from may 15 to november 9 in 2017 179 days and from may 10 to october 31 in 2018 175 days following the simulations we were able to calculate intw inwb outwb etwb we then plotted observed values against predicted values and calculated the data determination coefficient r2 compared to a prefect correlation model output x y r2 1 to assess the model prediction capacity piniero et al 2008 2 2 evapotranspiration optimization although evapotranspiration is mainly driven by climate and plant physiological traits providing favorable growing conditions can enhance plant transpiration for willows in particular a first way of promoting et is to provide a constant water supply frédette et al 2019b in this model we fixed a threshold water level 15 cm below ground under which additional irrigation is provided to the willow bed to ensure that water availability to willows is always maximal 2 2 1 wetland aspect ratio varying the aspect ratio l w length over width of the willow bed for a given surface area could also represent an opportunity for optimization by increasing et per unit surface the higher the aspect ratio the longer the perimeter of the willow bed with willows growing on the perimeter of the bed having a significantly higher lai up to 300 more than those growing in the center fig 2 which is directly correlated with et frédette et al 2019a to test the effect of the l w variation on sizing criteria we simulated the operation of the treatment system using a regular shape l w 1 5 and then an elongated shape l w 10 the lai was adjusted directly in the model according to the number of willows growing on the border wborder and in the center of the bed wcenter the methods used to calculate lai wborder and wcenter are described in supplementary material 2 2 2 fertilization another way of enhancing willow et is to increase the supply of nutrients available for plant growth i e fertilization in two studies where only the fertilization amount varied between treatments it was demonstrated that fertilized willows s alba lost 96 more water through evapotranspiration than unfertilized ones and that increasing the level of fertilization could increase et by another 51 guidi et al 2008 pistocchi et al 2009 considering that the et model used was calibrated using slightly fertilized willows frédette et al 2019a we applied an et increase coefficient αf of 1 51 to simulate the effect of high fertilization on the sizing criteria 2 2 3 substrate characteristics finally we wanted to simulate the effect of different substrates 1 a sand substrate that provides good drainage and 2 an organic substrate that provides increased organic matter and water retention in the root zone but is more susceptible to compaction and clogging in a mesocosm study we reported that et of willows grown in sand achieved about 77 of the et of those grown in a coconut fiber substrate and about 65 of the et of those grown in a highly organic potting substrate frédette et al 2019c the et equations used in our model were calibrated for willows grown in a peat and sand substrate frédette et al 2019a although peat and coconut fiber substrates are comparable because they share similar physical properties bañón et al 2009 reported a 23 increase of et in peat versus coconut fiber therefore in our model et calculated according to the method described by frédette et al 2019a is considered optimized in terms of substrate and an et decrease coefficient αs of 0 65 was used to simulate the effect of using a sand substrate 2 2 4 coppicing cycle using a willow planted wetland implies that the woody biomass must be coppiced on a 2 to 4 year coppicing cycle as is often suggested for willow plantations designed for biomass production bullard et al 2002 coppicing is also essential to maintain a high level of plant activity which is correlated to a high evapotranspiration rate dotro et al 2017 however recently coppiced willows have less leaf area available for transpiration compared to mature trees based on the data collected at the reference site we found that average la typically increased with the age of a stool root or stump of the shrub from which shoots spring after coppicing and that inversely average ḡs decreased with stool age average value being maximal for stools of one year and significantly lower for stools of three years fig 2 to minimize the effect of coppicing on evapotranspiration alternately coppicing different sections of the willow bed has been suggested gregersen and brix 2001 e g one half of the bed coppiced one year and the other half coppiced the following year for a 2 year cycle for the purpose of this modeling study it was assumed that a 2 year coppicing cycle was used so that every year half of the willow stools were 1 year old and the other half were 2 years old 2 3 simulation scenarios 2 3 1 simulation plan and design optimization we simulated a time frame of 20 years of operation which we considered appropriate to represent a wide range of meteorological variations particularly rainfall the first objective of the simulations was to determine how the general design proposed in section 2 1 1 performed in managing the varying volumes of leachate generated from rainfall at the reference site then various combinations of optimization options see section 2 2 and fig 3 a allowed us to assess the impact of management decisions on system performance we thus simulated each design parameter combination by setting the willow bed area to 2000 m2 to compare performance in terms of storage volume required et volume and overflow frequency a meteorological database covering 20 years 1996 to 2015 and including all the necessary parameters to calculate et0 and etwb was created with data from environment and climate change canada eccc 2019 2 3 2 determination of sizing criteria the relationships obtained were then implemented in the model so that when changing the collection tank or the willow bed area the corresponding equalization tank volume required was automatically adjusted once the best design parameter combination was identified see section 2 3 1 the willow bed was sized by increasing its area until the simulation results made it possible to achieve a zld over a 20 year period of simulation we also simulated the operation of the system with different areas of the leachate collection tank to determine a numerical relationship between the collection tank area the willow bed and the equalization tank sizing criteria fig 3b such a relationship could be helpful for future use of zld wetlands for example in assessing the feasibility of accommodating the technology in the available space 3 results 3 1 model validation based on meteorological data from 2016 2017 and 2018 and the design parameters of the reference site we were able to model several components of the hydrological balance of the reference site treatment system with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 68 fig 4 both the influent and the effluent of the willow bed tend to be overestimated by the model 25 and 37 respectively which can be the result of underestimating ettw and etwb etwb appeared to be underestimated by the model 20 fig 4 we therefore concluded that the model is conservative which could slightly increase the risk of over dimensioning the system compartments because the treatment system modelled is intended to reduce the risk of discharge by overflow we consider a conservative model to be appropriate and the validation results satisfactory 3 2 design optimization and sizing criteria when performing the 20 year simulation with a fixed the willow bed area of 2000 m2 only the designs optimized in terms of substrate and fertilization 1 3orhf 10orhf led to zld table 1 this result coupled with the calculated ratios between cumulative annual et of the willow bed and cumulative annual rainfall suggests that cumulative annual et need to be at least 1 5 times higher than annual rainfall for zld to be achieved over a 20 year period in northern continental humid climate conversely designs with low fertilization and sand substrate 1 3salf 10salf were the least preforming with overflow occurring at least once per year 19 of the 20 years simulated and showing the highest mean yearly cumulative of 1480 to 1540 m3 a when at least one optimization option was added to the design 1 3sahf 1 3orlf 10sahf 10orlf in comparison with the actual design of 1 3orlf yearly cumulative of was reduced 830 to 990 m3 a but overflow frequency remained high from 17 to 18 years out of 20 years overall designs with a 10 1 aspect ratio required less storage volume 15 to 25 and generated less yearly cumulative of 4 to 14 than their homologous designs with a 1 3 1 ratio except for the best performing design 1 3orhf and 10orhf where the 10 1 aspect ratio required 360 m3 more storage volume furthermore mean yearly cumulative et was 7 lower with the 10orhf design than with 1 3orhf when looking at the fate of water in the system over the course of the 20 years with the design including all the optimization options 10orhf we found that for 13 of the 20 years the willow bed was completely emptied no et possible at least once during the summer months a situation that occurred only 3 years out of 20 when using the 1 3orhf design water storage needs increase when et is increased because as the maximum et increases so does the gap between minimal and maximal cumulative net inflow which is used for storage tank sizing for the first simulations in which the collection tank area was set at 2240 m2 actual size at the reference site we found that a volume of 1910 m³ was required for equalization tanks 1 for each willow bed design tested we were able to establish a linear relationship between the area of the willow bed and the volume of equalization tanks 2 needed table 1 in the end when using the 1 3orhf design we found that 1750 m2 of willow bed and 2170 m3 of second equalization tanks were required for zld to be attained within a 20 year time frame compared to 1590 m2 of willow bed and 2280 m3 of second equalization tank when using the 10orhf design choosing which of the two would be the best performing design therefore depends on user preferences and limitations our results showed a linear relationship between the willow bed area required and the collection tank area fig 5 with ratio awb act of about 0 7 for the 1 3orhf design and 0 5 for the 10orhf design 3 3 global system performance several observations can be made based on tracking water as it circulates through the system compartments of the best designs over the period of 20 years simulated fig 6 regarding the willow bed we can see that the minimal level could not be maintained in some years particularly 1996 2001 2002 and 2003 for 1 3orhf and 2002 and 2003 for 10orhf because both equalizing tanks had been emptied during the preceding years wetland irrigation might have been necessary during those years from summer 2004 to autumn 2014 there was a continuous increase in the use of equalizing tank 2 which reached its maximal capacity in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 for 1 3orhf and in 2013 and 2014 for 10orhf by the end of the simulation the volume of water in equalizing tanks 2 was lowered but the trend suggests that it might be necessary to discharge a certain volume from this compartment to continue to operate the system beyond 20 years this type of exceptional discharge should then be managed according to applicable regulations since contaminants could accumulate in the willow bed substrate and lead to an effluent concentration requiring transport to a conventional or special wastewater treatment facility the collection tank was systematically filled up during winter and emptied during the following summer much like equalizing tank 2 equalizing tank 1 was used continuously after several years of operation from winter 2006 to the end of the simulation however while equalizing tank 1 maximal value was reached once in 2014 for 1 3orhf it never reached more than about 65 of its volume for 10orhf the methodology used for equalizing tank 1 sizing considers only water coming in from the overflow of the collection tank which is predictable and not the water going out of equalizing tank 1 to irrigate the treatment wetlands when water levels in the willow bed and equalizing tank 2 are too low less predictable which could explain oversizing of equalizing tank 1 4 discussion variable flows and evapotranspiration potentials represent the most challenging aspects in using zld willow beds to treat industrial leachates our model was able to predict water flows in a reference treatment system with satisfactory results we were able to establish a numerical relationship between the area of an open collection tank and the surface area of willow bed required for a system to attain zld which could help guide design process in the future analysis of et related plant parameters ḡs and lai at the reference site highlighted their temporal variation and lead to suggest that a two year coppicing cycle should be preferred over a 3 year cycle to maintain maximal et modeling the daily operation of a complete system over a 20 year period showed that attaining a zld is feasible in a humid continental northern climate presuming that sufficient land area and storage volume are available it also highlighted several aspects to consider in design and management decisions for example modulating et through substrate selection and fertilization can significantly reduce the storage volume and willow bed area needed sizing the willow bed with a high aspect ratio can further optimize the system but to a lesser extent 4 1 feasibility of the technology in this study the feasibility was assessed only for the hydraulic perspective by iteratively increasing compartments size until zero liquid discharge was achieved however the only design scenarios where zld could be systematically achieved over a 20 year period were those including at least two et optimization option and those in which the ratio between annual et and rainfall was equal or greater to 1 5 theoretically speaking et equal to rainfall ratio of 1 should be sufficient to achieve zld confirming that managing high hydraulic loading variability over a long period requires a substantial buffer 50 in this case although not related to technical feasibility per se other considerations could influence the suitability of the technology for a given case scenario such as available land area and financial and or human resources leachate composition available risk tolerance etc as mentioned this article refers to a treatment system that is limited by its hydraulic capacity rather than its pollutant loading capacity either because of pre treatment or a low contaminant concentration of the leachate meaning that salts and or contaminant accumulation in the substrate or system clogging are not major issues table 2 presents several factors to consider when assessing the willow bed approach compared to other technologies that lead to zero contaminant discharge potential for increasing technical feasibility adapting the approach to other climates or wastewaters and other limitations will be discussed in the following sections 4 2 evapotranspiration optimization our results along with those of previously published studies confirm the relevance of using willows in phytotechnology based zld systems salix species have shown a general tendency to increase et when water supply is not a limiting factor frédette et al 2019b and their suitability for coppicing ensures that plant growth and et rates are maximized while the effect of willow stools and root age on its productivity and biomass production has been studied mola yudego and aronsson 2008 volk et al 2011 little attention has been given to its effects on et the few studies comparing et of willows of different ages generally compared the establishment year to subsequent years gregersen and brix 2001 białowiec et al 2011 guidi et al 2008 however et through the establishment year is expected to be lower and such information does not provide information on how et is affected by coppicing when the root system is well established our method and results are an important step forward in assessing how stool age affects the volume of et produced by a well established fast growing willow shrub however our results might be species specific and would benefit from further field validation while it is well known that fertilization can increase et by increasing general plant growth and activity determining an increase coefficient that can be used in an et predictive model is complex since many factors are susceptible to influencing this coefficient like species nutrient needs species maximal potential et rate composition of the fertilizer used concentration applied and water availability deriving an et increase coefficient from a study testing both fertilized and unfertilized willows in otherwise exact growing conditions still allowed us to highlight that fertilization may be the most important factor to optimize an evapotranspiration system the study used for reference frédette et al 2019c had the advantage of using the same species as the reference site but also the limitation of being a lysimeter and green house experiment the results of which could not translate perfectly to field conditions therefore although we strongly recommend considering the soil type and fertilization influence on et when designing an evapotranspiration willow bed determining more precise coefficients for these two factors for example by conducting a pot experiment with the species considering the nutrient sources and substrates to be used could be necessary before implementing a full scale system 4 3 management practices and other design considerations it seems that even if the collection tank was completely emptied during the summer months the volume of this compartment was not sufficient to accommodate the cumulative rainfall of late autumn winter and spring increasing the depth of the collection tank without expanding its surface area could help prevent off season overflow of the collection tank and further reduce the volume of equalizing tank 1 required while this highlights the importance of considering et and rainfall variability over time some nuances should be pointed out first in our study equalizing tank 1 was sized based on the actual dimensions of the collection tank on the reference site 2240 m2 543 m3 constructing a collection tank or pond with a greater volume i e increasing the depth would substantially reduce the volume of storage needed to equalize this compartment while also preventing spring overflow as discussed in section 2 1 1 the two equalizing tanks could also be combined into a single tank for the whole system which would also significantly reduce the volume of storage required however this would mean that potential discharge of the system e g for system maintenance or following an extreme weather event would release a mix of treated and raw wastewater that would generate further treatment costs treated wastewater alone from equalizing tank 2 in the two equalizing tanks scenario could potentially be discharged in compliance with environmental regulations it is also important to keep in mind that the storage volumes in this study were sized to minimize at the most the discharge from the system while some user might have more discharge flexibility in practice we also saw that the suggested total storage volume was oversized particularly for the first 10 years or so in practice it would be possible to reduce the storage volume by sizing the equalizing tanks according to average net inflow and occasionally discharge a certain volume as needed e g during extremely wet years such a sizing approach minimizing the total storage volume would still lead to a significant reduction in off site treatment needs and could even be more attractive for industries with limited storage space alternatively under climate with large interannual precipitation zld beds sized to minimize discharge during wet years may result in the systems often lacking water during dryer spells plant species chosen for zld system should be able to sustain short periods of drought but a reliable source of water for occasional irrigation of the planted bed may be necessary to maintain long term plant growth and health finally biomass valorization is an important consideration if willows or other woody species are to be used in a zld system an option for valorization of the biomass produced e g using fragmented stems as mulch in other locations biofuel production should be available for example shredded willow stems make excellent mulch that has multiple uses lemieux et al 2000 dried stems can be used as a material in different types of walls barriers and screens lachapelle et al 2019 and in some locations the combustion of woody biomass can serve as an energy source langholtz et al 2019 although translocation of contaminants to aerial parts of the willows is expected to be low or null if water is pretreated samples of stems could be analyzed prior to biomass valorization depending on the projected use 4 4 adaption to other climates and wastewaters willows are not adapted to every region of the world they are naturally distributed mainly in the northern hemisphere argus 1986 and are considered an invasive species in some southern locations like australia south africa and argentina stokes 2008 henderson 1991 serra et al 2013 a recent study concluded that salix humboldtiana would be a good candidate for zld wetlands in colombia moreno et al 2019 it would be interesting to expand future research to alternative species with a high et potential adapted to other climates such as bamboo bambusa sp or giant reed arundo donax keeping in mind that annual et needs to exceed annual rainfall per surface area for the technology to be technically feasible again a minimal ratio of 1 5 willow bed et versus rainfall per m2 seemed necessary in this study although this value might vary in a different climate regarding the applicability of the general technology to other geographic regions climate is probably the factor that will dictate the end result of the design process our study has confirmed the feasibility of using a willow wetland to achieve zld in relatively unfavorable conditions short growing season and high precipitations occurring mainly during low et period which suggests that most climate could sustain this technology as a general reference we can presume that drier climate or were annual temperature and or rainfall variation low and or the vegetation growing period is longer land area and storage volume needs would be significantly reduced because of greater overall et and therefore et rainfall ratio and or less variable hydraulic loading however other considerations could emerge in particularly arid climates such as water scarcity preference for technologies allowing water reuse and the lack of a constant and sufficient water supply for plant optimal growth the use of a willow bed zld treatment system and therefore the design considerations pointed out in this study is not limited leachate management other industrial wastewaters having sometimes low concentration of problematic contaminants e g dyes in the textile industries or tannin and lignin in winery effluent vymazal 2014 or stormwater and agricultural runoffs that have highly variable volumes and represents a major concern in many parts of the world walsh et al 2012 daniels et al 2018 represent other potential applications of the technology 4 5 study and technology limitations the hydrological model presented here shows that in the climate tested the water storage volume required might be the most limiting aspect of this technology most of the annual rainfall occur during cold months were et is low typically autumn and spring and therefore leachate most be stored to be used during the few summer months inversely most of the et occur during the three hottest summer months and water demand is so high at this point that leachate accumulated in the storage unit during the cold months is not always sufficient to maintain a minimal water level in the willow bed another aspect of any zld treatment system that was not tested in our model but that should be investigated to better assess the potential of the technology is the expected lifespan of the evapotranspiration wetland even if concentration of contaminants and or salts in the leachate are low an accumulation might occur after several years raising questions about the fate of any such those contaminants and their effect on plant health brix and arias 2011 in the specific case of the reference site presented here the treatment efficiency of the pre treatment step was generally high levesque et al 2017 and after seven years of operation the trees in the willow bed showed no phytotoxic symptoms and no contaminant accumulation could be detected in the substrate frédette et al 2019a furthermore the cultivar used in this willow bed s miyabeana sx67 appears to be tolerant to the raw leachate produced on site frédette et al 2019c we could therefore estimate that the expected life span of the willow bed in this case exceeds 10 years in a zld system with willow bed the et wetland is sized based on water volume and not contaminant loadings as is the case for a treatment wetland kadlec and wallace 2008 therefore the et wetland will likely be well over sized in terms of contaminant treatment capacity and the life span of the wetland should then exceed or at least equal the typical life span of treatment wetlands 40 50 years kadlec and wallace 2008 exceptionally it is possible to pump out the contaminated or high salinity water out of the willow bed to increase its life span ultimately when a willow bed attains its maximal life span the substrate should be removed and treated as recommended depending on the local regulations and contaminant concentration another consideration that is also a limitation of our study is the weather particularly rainfall time frame used for sizing the compartments of the system using meteorological data from a shorter or longer period could have led to significantly different sizing furthermore past rainfall data are not predictive of future conditions considering the expected effects of climate change on local precipitation for instance for the region of the reference site of this study annual rainfall increased by 130 mm about 15 increase from 1960 to 2013 mddelcc 2017 and climate change scenarios predict a continuous increase in the future ouranos 2015 one way of dealing with such factors would be to run simulations with predicted future data sets for longer periods e g 50 years however this also enhances the need for flexibility in the design of a zld system where inflow comes from precipitation consequently it is crucial to include a risk reduction strategy in the design based on options such as irrigation or discharge while reserving space for future expansion of the wetland or storage tanks 5 conclusion our results suggest that treating leachate with an zld system using an evapotranspiration willow bed is feasible even in a climate with great seasonal temperature variations a short growing season and relatively high annual precipitation southeastern canada although it requires a considerable land area and water storage volume our results suggest that design and management decisions can significantly reduce those requirements all those aspects e g willow bed design acceptable discharge frequency collection tank volume combined or separated storage tanks etc need to be considered to ensure proper sizing of the system compartment and to increase the overall efficiency we showed that an organic substrate with a high fertilization rate makes is possible to reduce the size of willow bed required a 2 year coppicing cycle meaning that every year one half of the willows are cut back should be used to maintain maximal et rate simulating the operation of a system over a 20 year period highlighted the importance of designing a flexible system when treating leachate or other wastewater generated by rainfall modeling the temporal variation of both climate and et is essential to achieve a flexible design although the operation of a willow bed is relatively simple compared to other zld technologies water flux in the system must be monitored and managed to ensure maximal et and minimize overflows zld systems using a willow bed constitute a solution to some of the current limitations of typical zld treatment systems such as high operational and energy costs and the difficulty of treating recalcitrant organic molecules and our study constitutes a first step in extending this technology beyond domestic wastewater treatment future research on zld wetlands could focus on 1 quantifying the effect of fertilization on et for several species used in zld wetlands 2 determining the quantitative relationship between et and substrate physical properties 3 including a model of the fate of contaminants in the design system 4 producing a life cycle analysis 5 investigating alternative species

16427,while zero liquid discharge zld wetlands have been successfully used for domestic wastewater treatment adapting this technology to treat other wastewaters such as leachate could be very attractive for some industries concerned with meeting increasingly stringent environmental regulations leachate treatment typically implies large volume of water that are entirely dependent on rainfall and therefore highly variable both throughout the year and between years current design guidelines for zero discharge willow systems limit system flexibility because they are based on rough theoretical estimates of evapotranspiration this discuss the applicability of zld treatment through a willow bed evapotranspiration et applied to the treatment of industrial leachate that has high and variable hydraulic loading rate and low contaminant and salt concentration we propose a base design and through detailed and long term hydrological modeling of such a treatment system investigate how various design and management decisions can affect sizing efficiency and overall feasibility of the technology we showed that considering et optimization factors e g fertilization and organic substrate was essential for zld to be achieved over a 20 year period in northern continental humid climate and that the ratio between cumulative annual et of the willow bed and cumulative annual rainfall should be at least 1 5 when varying the leachate collection area it was found that a ratio of willow bed area to collection area between 0 5 and 0 7 should be expected for an optimized design in this specific climate were land area and storage volume remain the most limiting factors regarding storage volume several management options can be applied to reduce the volume of storage required we also highlight that a risk attenuation strategy should always be included in the design of a zld wetland system our study suggests that zld wetlands constitute a green technology that represents a serious alternative treatment method for pretreated leachate while offering many benefits such as low maintenance and energy costs valorization of contaminants such as nitrogen or phosphorus through biomass production and most importantly zero contaminant discharge to the environment finally we propose future research opportunities and other possible applications for further development of the technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords evapotranspiration wetland salix contaminated leachate humid continental northern climate design optimization hydrological modeling 1 introduction every year industries must treat a large variable volume of water due to rainfall leaching through various wastes or products e g landfills mine wastes stored treated wood poles among the available solutions used for industrial wastewater treatment some aim to reduce the volume of water released into the environment to zero and are referred to as zero liquid discharge zld systems such systems were first developed to allow different industrial sectors to reduce both water consumption and treatment costs koppol et al 2004 this type of approach can also allow industries to avoid having to obtain a discharge permit for their contaminated effluent the concept of zld is used increasingly to address a number of the different constraints and difficulties associated with wastewater treatment tong and elimelech 2016 typical zld systems can take various forms the simplest being evaporation ponds where wastewater is stored until it passively evaporates not only does this type of system fail to enable reuse of the water it also requires a very large area and is feasible in very few contexts such as arid and semi arid climates in contrast some highly sophisticated systems combine physical e g water purification through energy fueled evaporators and chemical e g adding chemicals to precipitate a specific compound steps to both purify water and raw materials that can be reused these latter systems can be very efficient but are typically energy demanding with high installation and operation costs phytotechnology based zld systems were introduced in the 1990s in the form of constructed wetlands planted with willows they were used to treat domestic wastewater in denmark and designed to generate zero effluent gregersen and brix 2001 brix and arias 2005 2011 since then this technology has also been used in ireland o hogain et al 2011 curneen and gill 2016 and feasibility studies were successfully carried out in mongolia khurelbaatar et al 2017 such constructed wetlands are now referred to as willow wetlands willow systems willow beds or zero discharge wetlands kadlec and wallace 2008 dotro et al 2017 the targeted mechanism for reducing the volume of the effluent is evapotranspiration et in which the system loses water by evaporation and plant transpiration this natural process is sometimes utilized in environmental engineering especially to treat contaminated landfill leachate białowiec et al 2011 using this form of green technology in industrial wastewater treatment offers a number of advantages over conventional approaches including low maintenance and energy costs concentration of the contaminants or by products in a confined compartment i e the wetland substrate valorization of contaminants such as nitrogen or phosphorus through biomass production and zero discharge to the environment willow systems for domestic wastewater treatment are typically sized according to hydraulic and surface loading rates for population equivalent values dotro et al 2017 and current design guidelines for willow systems are often based on rough estimations of et e g mean annual crop coefficient of 2 5 times a reference et brix and arias 2005 furthermore domestic wastewater represents a relatively constant and predictable hydraulic loading and low phytotoxic potential to our knowledge no design recommendations or criteria have been proposed for the treatment of other types of wastewater or for more complex treatment systems industrial leachates typically have very high and variable hydraulic loading rate and may have high contaminant and or salt concentrations which would require specific consideration in the design process or even compromise reduce zld feasibility if used in their raw form e g leachates from young landfill cells or acid mining drainage brennan et al 2016 simate and ndlovu 2014 furthermore the discharge regulations are not the same for all types of leachates which would also influence the decision of using a zld approach and the system management in this study we focus on the treatment of industrial leachate that 1 has high and variable hydraulic loading rate 2 is either pre treated or that contain low contaminant and salt concentration and 3 for which discharge regulations are problematic and justify the interest in a zld solution our objective is to propose a design for a flexible and durable zld system incorporating an evapotranspiration willow wetland that is hydraulically limited but could also be applied to related leachate characteristics through hydrological modeling of such a treatment system we also investigate how various design aspects could be used to significantly optimize management practices our modeling approach was based on a detailed analysis of et temporal variation and water flow management 2 materials and method 2 1 model description 2 1 1 model development the design of a zld for treating leachates is highly dependent on climatic regime the surface required for zero discharge of a given leachate collection area would be minimal under a tropical drier climate with highly predictable precipitation our model was developed and tested under the more stringent conditions of the humid temperate continental climate of southeastern canada québec this region has long freezing winters and warm humid summers precipitation levels are relatively high annual average around 1 m 20 falling as snow and occurring all year round with occasional dry spells especially in summer high evapotranspiration only occurs during the relatively short growing season temporary leachate storage may thus be necessary for winter precipitation and extreme rainfall events and to provide sufficient irrigation to plants during dry summer periods zld evaporative efficiency also depends on the water composition of the leachate as mentioned in the introduction pretreatment would be recommended for highly contaminated leachate to prevent willow toxicity and rapid accumulation of contaminants and salts in the zld bed and to expand its overall lifespan furthermore since willow biomass production is strongly correlated to et martin and stephens 2006 and generally increase with nutrient availability particularly nitrogen fabio and smart 2018 fertilization may be necessary to maximize the willow bed et when treating nutrient deficient leachate the system design modelled here comprises an open tank or pond hereafter referred to as an open collection tank that stores wastewater or collects leachate seeping out from contaminated materials being open the collection tank receives rainfall as well fig 1 a pre treatment step is included here in the form of a treatment wetland physical chemical and biological removal processes to ensure that the outflow of this compartment and that is used to irrigate the evapotranspiration willow bed has a low contaminant charge fig 1 we assume that gross filtration and settling of large particles occur prior to the pre treatment step finally two equalization tanks equalizing tank 1 and equalizing tank 2 are connected to the collection tank and the willow bed respectively to manage water flowrate variability in the system although the two equalization tanks could have been combined into one their separation ensures that only pre treated water enters the willow bed thus increasing its life span and allows treated water to be separated from partially treated or raw wastewater as illustrated in fig 1 the only water input in the system is the rainfall occurring over the collection tank the treatment wetland and the willow bed and the output occurs through evaporation e from the collection tank and evapotranspiration et from the treatment wetland and the willow bed the input water not lost through evapotranspiration moves from one compartment to the other and the closed circuit enables operation of the system with zld the model was developed to produce a daily computation of the value of every water flux and the volume of water contained in each component of the system after all water exchanges have occurred based on the classical hydrological balance equations see supplementary material for detailed equations used to maintain the general water flow described above a set of management rules was implemented in the model see supplementary material globally these rules ensure that 1 water is always available for e and et in both the collection tank and the willow bed and that sufficient water is available in the collection tank for irrigating the treatment wetland at all times 2 overflow of the collection tank the treatment wetland and the willow bed are conveyed to the designated compartments see fig 1 3 the water level in the collection tank the treatment wetland and the willow bed is lowered before winter to prevent root and pipe damage in the treatment wetland and the willow bed due to water freezing and to prevent spring overflow in the collection tank and 4 if as a last resort remedy water must be pumped out of the system or discharged to the environment the effluent will have gone through both primary treatment in the regular treatment wetland and secondary treatment in the willow bed and therefore contain the lowest concentration of contaminants possible 2 1 2 model parameterization and calibration based on the model design presented in section 2 1 1 we can determine five categories of parameters that are needed for the model to operate component design water flux management plant parameters evapotranspiration and meteorology see supplementary material some of the parameters such as meteorological data are external and cannot be controlled while auxiliary parameters like component design are determined by the user other parameters such as evapotranspiration are external but can be modulated through management decisions see design optimization opportunities section 2 3 et calculations are based on a previous study conducted on a willow bed planted with salix miyabeana sx67 frédette et al 2019a see supplementary material and leaf area index lai calculated on site fig 2 evaporation e from the collection tank is estimated to be about 80 of the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 treatment wetland evapotranspiration ettw is estimated to be equal to et0 crop coefficient or ket of 1 2 1 3 model validation this modeling study uses data collected from a demonstration scale leachate treatment system set up and operating in québec canada since 2012 as a reference this system was built to evaluate the performance of different wetland processes for treating leachate collected on a storage site for treated wood poles it was not designed as a zld and its effluent is discharged into a municipal sewer a general description of the system and its design parameters is provided in the supplementary materials for the purposes of this study the following parameters were monitored on the reference site during the 2016 2017 and 2018 operation seasons the volume of water pumped into the treatment wetlands intw m3 the volume of both willow bed affluent and effluent inwb and outwb m3 and willow bed evapotranspiration etwb m3 to validate our model we slightly modified the conceptual model presented in section 2 1 1 so that the overflow of the willow bed would flow out of the treatment system instead and both equalization tanks were removed since there is currently no such tank on site we simulated only the operating seasons which were from may 9 to november 30 in 2016 206 days from may 15 to november 9 in 2017 179 days and from may 10 to october 31 in 2018 175 days following the simulations we were able to calculate intw inwb outwb etwb we then plotted observed values against predicted values and calculated the data determination coefficient r2 compared to a prefect correlation model output x y r2 1 to assess the model prediction capacity piniero et al 2008 2 2 evapotranspiration optimization although evapotranspiration is mainly driven by climate and plant physiological traits providing favorable growing conditions can enhance plant transpiration for willows in particular a first way of promoting et is to provide a constant water supply frédette et al 2019b in this model we fixed a threshold water level 15 cm below ground under which additional irrigation is provided to the willow bed to ensure that water availability to willows is always maximal 2 2 1 wetland aspect ratio varying the aspect ratio l w length over width of the willow bed for a given surface area could also represent an opportunity for optimization by increasing et per unit surface the higher the aspect ratio the longer the perimeter of the willow bed with willows growing on the perimeter of the bed having a significantly higher lai up to 300 more than those growing in the center fig 2 which is directly correlated with et frédette et al 2019a to test the effect of the l w variation on sizing criteria we simulated the operation of the treatment system using a regular shape l w 1 5 and then an elongated shape l w 10 the lai was adjusted directly in the model according to the number of willows growing on the border wborder and in the center of the bed wcenter the methods used to calculate lai wborder and wcenter are described in supplementary material 2 2 2 fertilization another way of enhancing willow et is to increase the supply of nutrients available for plant growth i e fertilization in two studies where only the fertilization amount varied between treatments it was demonstrated that fertilized willows s alba lost 96 more water through evapotranspiration than unfertilized ones and that increasing the level of fertilization could increase et by another 51 guidi et al 2008 pistocchi et al 2009 considering that the et model used was calibrated using slightly fertilized willows frédette et al 2019a we applied an et increase coefficient αf of 1 51 to simulate the effect of high fertilization on the sizing criteria 2 2 3 substrate characteristics finally we wanted to simulate the effect of different substrates 1 a sand substrate that provides good drainage and 2 an organic substrate that provides increased organic matter and water retention in the root zone but is more susceptible to compaction and clogging in a mesocosm study we reported that et of willows grown in sand achieved about 77 of the et of those grown in a coconut fiber substrate and about 65 of the et of those grown in a highly organic potting substrate frédette et al 2019c the et equations used in our model were calibrated for willows grown in a peat and sand substrate frédette et al 2019a although peat and coconut fiber substrates are comparable because they share similar physical properties bañón et al 2009 reported a 23 increase of et in peat versus coconut fiber therefore in our model et calculated according to the method described by frédette et al 2019a is considered optimized in terms of substrate and an et decrease coefficient αs of 0 65 was used to simulate the effect of using a sand substrate 2 2 4 coppicing cycle using a willow planted wetland implies that the woody biomass must be coppiced on a 2 to 4 year coppicing cycle as is often suggested for willow plantations designed for biomass production bullard et al 2002 coppicing is also essential to maintain a high level of plant activity which is correlated to a high evapotranspiration rate dotro et al 2017 however recently coppiced willows have less leaf area available for transpiration compared to mature trees based on the data collected at the reference site we found that average la typically increased with the age of a stool root or stump of the shrub from which shoots spring after coppicing and that inversely average ḡs decreased with stool age average value being maximal for stools of one year and significantly lower for stools of three years fig 2 to minimize the effect of coppicing on evapotranspiration alternately coppicing different sections of the willow bed has been suggested gregersen and brix 2001 e g one half of the bed coppiced one year and the other half coppiced the following year for a 2 year cycle for the purpose of this modeling study it was assumed that a 2 year coppicing cycle was used so that every year half of the willow stools were 1 year old and the other half were 2 years old 2 3 simulation scenarios 2 3 1 simulation plan and design optimization we simulated a time frame of 20 years of operation which we considered appropriate to represent a wide range of meteorological variations particularly rainfall the first objective of the simulations was to determine how the general design proposed in section 2 1 1 performed in managing the varying volumes of leachate generated from rainfall at the reference site then various combinations of optimization options see section 2 2 and fig 3 a allowed us to assess the impact of management decisions on system performance we thus simulated each design parameter combination by setting the willow bed area to 2000 m2 to compare performance in terms of storage volume required et volume and overflow frequency a meteorological database covering 20 years 1996 to 2015 and including all the necessary parameters to calculate et0 and etwb was created with data from environment and climate change canada eccc 2019 2 3 2 determination of sizing criteria the relationships obtained were then implemented in the model so that when changing the collection tank or the willow bed area the corresponding equalization tank volume required was automatically adjusted once the best design parameter combination was identified see section 2 3 1 the willow bed was sized by increasing its area until the simulation results made it possible to achieve a zld over a 20 year period of simulation we also simulated the operation of the system with different areas of the leachate collection tank to determine a numerical relationship between the collection tank area the willow bed and the equalization tank sizing criteria fig 3b such a relationship could be helpful for future use of zld wetlands for example in assessing the feasibility of accommodating the technology in the available space 3 results 3 1 model validation based on meteorological data from 2016 2017 and 2018 and the design parameters of the reference site we were able to model several components of the hydrological balance of the reference site treatment system with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 68 fig 4 both the influent and the effluent of the willow bed tend to be overestimated by the model 25 and 37 respectively which can be the result of underestimating ettw and etwb etwb appeared to be underestimated by the model 20 fig 4 we therefore concluded that the model is conservative which could slightly increase the risk of over dimensioning the system compartments because the treatment system modelled is intended to reduce the risk of discharge by overflow we consider a conservative model to be appropriate and the validation results satisfactory 3 2 design optimization and sizing criteria when performing the 20 year simulation with a fixed the willow bed area of 2000 m2 only the designs optimized in terms of substrate and fertilization 1 3orhf 10orhf led to zld table 1 this result coupled with the calculated ratios between cumulative annual et of the willow bed and cumulative annual rainfall suggests that cumulative annual et need to be at least 1 5 times higher than annual rainfall for zld to be achieved over a 20 year period in northern continental humid climate conversely designs with low fertilization and sand substrate 1 3salf 10salf were the least preforming with overflow occurring at least once per year 19 of the 20 years simulated and showing the highest mean yearly cumulative of 1480 to 1540 m3 a when at least one optimization option was added to the design 1 3sahf 1 3orlf 10sahf 10orlf in comparison with the actual design of 1 3orlf yearly cumulative of was reduced 830 to 990 m3 a but overflow frequency remained high from 17 to 18 years out of 20 years overall designs with a 10 1 aspect ratio required less storage volume 15 to 25 and generated less yearly cumulative of 4 to 14 than their homologous designs with a 1 3 1 ratio except for the best performing design 1 3orhf and 10orhf where the 10 1 aspect ratio required 360 m3 more storage volume furthermore mean yearly cumulative et was 7 lower with the 10orhf design than with 1 3orhf when looking at the fate of water in the system over the course of the 20 years with the design including all the optimization options 10orhf we found that for 13 of the 20 years the willow bed was completely emptied no et possible at least once during the summer months a situation that occurred only 3 years out of 20 when using the 1 3orhf design water storage needs increase when et is increased because as the maximum et increases so does the gap between minimal and maximal cumulative net inflow which is used for storage tank sizing for the first simulations in which the collection tank area was set at 2240 m2 actual size at the reference site we found that a volume of 1910 m³ was required for equalization tanks 1 for each willow bed design tested we were able to establish a linear relationship between the area of the willow bed and the volume of equalization tanks 2 needed table 1 in the end when using the 1 3orhf design we found that 1750 m2 of willow bed and 2170 m3 of second equalization tanks were required for zld to be attained within a 20 year time frame compared to 1590 m2 of willow bed and 2280 m3 of second equalization tank when using the 10orhf design choosing which of the two would be the best performing design therefore depends on user preferences and limitations our results showed a linear relationship between the willow bed area required and the collection tank area fig 5 with ratio awb act of about 0 7 for the 1 3orhf design and 0 5 for the 10orhf design 3 3 global system performance several observations can be made based on tracking water as it circulates through the system compartments of the best designs over the period of 20 years simulated fig 6 regarding the willow bed we can see that the minimal level could not be maintained in some years particularly 1996 2001 2002 and 2003 for 1 3orhf and 2002 and 2003 for 10orhf because both equalizing tanks had been emptied during the preceding years wetland irrigation might have been necessary during those years from summer 2004 to autumn 2014 there was a continuous increase in the use of equalizing tank 2 which reached its maximal capacity in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 for 1 3orhf and in 2013 and 2014 for 10orhf by the end of the simulation the volume of water in equalizing tanks 2 was lowered but the trend suggests that it might be necessary to discharge a certain volume from this compartment to continue to operate the system beyond 20 years this type of exceptional discharge should then be managed according to applicable regulations since contaminants could accumulate in the willow bed substrate and lead to an effluent concentration requiring transport to a conventional or special wastewater treatment facility the collection tank was systematically filled up during winter and emptied during the following summer much like equalizing tank 2 equalizing tank 1 was used continuously after several years of operation from winter 2006 to the end of the simulation however while equalizing tank 1 maximal value was reached once in 2014 for 1 3orhf it never reached more than about 65 of its volume for 10orhf the methodology used for equalizing tank 1 sizing considers only water coming in from the overflow of the collection tank which is predictable and not the water going out of equalizing tank 1 to irrigate the treatment wetlands when water levels in the willow bed and equalizing tank 2 are too low less predictable which could explain oversizing of equalizing tank 1 4 discussion variable flows and evapotranspiration potentials represent the most challenging aspects in using zld willow beds to treat industrial leachates our model was able to predict water flows in a reference treatment system with satisfactory results we were able to establish a numerical relationship between the area of an open collection tank and the surface area of willow bed required for a system to attain zld which could help guide design process in the future analysis of et related plant parameters ḡs and lai at the reference site highlighted their temporal variation and lead to suggest that a two year coppicing cycle should be preferred over a 3 year cycle to maintain maximal et modeling the daily operation of a complete system over a 20 year period showed that attaining a zld is feasible in a humid continental northern climate presuming that sufficient land area and storage volume are available it also highlighted several aspects to consider in design and management decisions for example modulating et through substrate selection and fertilization can significantly reduce the storage volume and willow bed area needed sizing the willow bed with a high aspect ratio can further optimize the system but to a lesser extent 4 1 feasibility of the technology in this study the feasibility was assessed only for the hydraulic perspective by iteratively increasing compartments size until zero liquid discharge was achieved however the only design scenarios where zld could be systematically achieved over a 20 year period were those including at least two et optimization option and those in which the ratio between annual et and rainfall was equal or greater to 1 5 theoretically speaking et equal to rainfall ratio of 1 should be sufficient to achieve zld confirming that managing high hydraulic loading variability over a long period requires a substantial buffer 50 in this case although not related to technical feasibility per se other considerations could influence the suitability of the technology for a given case scenario such as available land area and financial and or human resources leachate composition available risk tolerance etc as mentioned this article refers to a treatment system that is limited by its hydraulic capacity rather than its pollutant loading capacity either because of pre treatment or a low contaminant concentration of the leachate meaning that salts and or contaminant accumulation in the substrate or system clogging are not major issues table 2 presents several factors to consider when assessing the willow bed approach compared to other technologies that lead to zero contaminant discharge potential for increasing technical feasibility adapting the approach to other climates or wastewaters and other limitations will be discussed in the following sections 4 2 evapotranspiration optimization our results along with those of previously published studies confirm the relevance of using willows in phytotechnology based zld systems salix species have shown a general tendency to increase et when water supply is not a limiting factor frédette et al 2019b and their suitability for coppicing ensures that plant growth and et rates are maximized while the effect of willow stools and root age on its productivity and biomass production has been studied mola yudego and aronsson 2008 volk et al 2011 little attention has been given to its effects on et the few studies comparing et of willows of different ages generally compared the establishment year to subsequent years gregersen and brix 2001 białowiec et al 2011 guidi et al 2008 however et through the establishment year is expected to be lower and such information does not provide information on how et is affected by coppicing when the root system is well established our method and results are an important step forward in assessing how stool age affects the volume of et produced by a well established fast growing willow shrub however our results might be species specific and would benefit from further field validation while it is well known that fertilization can increase et by increasing general plant growth and activity determining an increase coefficient that can be used in an et predictive model is complex since many factors are susceptible to influencing this coefficient like species nutrient needs species maximal potential et rate composition of the fertilizer used concentration applied and water availability deriving an et increase coefficient from a study testing both fertilized and unfertilized willows in otherwise exact growing conditions still allowed us to highlight that fertilization may be the most important factor to optimize an evapotranspiration system the study used for reference frédette et al 2019c had the advantage of using the same species as the reference site but also the limitation of being a lysimeter and green house experiment the results of which could not translate perfectly to field conditions therefore although we strongly recommend considering the soil type and fertilization influence on et when designing an evapotranspiration willow bed determining more precise coefficients for these two factors for example by conducting a pot experiment with the species considering the nutrient sources and substrates to be used could be necessary before implementing a full scale system 4 3 management practices and other design considerations it seems that even if the collection tank was completely emptied during the summer months the volume of this compartment was not sufficient to accommodate the cumulative rainfall of late autumn winter and spring increasing the depth of the collection tank without expanding its surface area could help prevent off season overflow of the collection tank and further reduce the volume of equalizing tank 1 required while this highlights the importance of considering et and rainfall variability over time some nuances should be pointed out first in our study equalizing tank 1 was sized based on the actual dimensions of the collection tank on the reference site 2240 m2 543 m3 constructing a collection tank or pond with a greater volume i e increasing the depth would substantially reduce the volume of storage needed to equalize this compartment while also preventing spring overflow as discussed in section 2 1 1 the two equalizing tanks could also be combined into a single tank for the whole system which would also significantly reduce the volume of storage required however this would mean that potential discharge of the system e g for system maintenance or following an extreme weather event would release a mix of treated and raw wastewater that would generate further treatment costs treated wastewater alone from equalizing tank 2 in the two equalizing tanks scenario could potentially be discharged in compliance with environmental regulations it is also important to keep in mind that the storage volumes in this study were sized to minimize at the most the discharge from the system while some user might have more discharge flexibility in practice we also saw that the suggested total storage volume was oversized particularly for the first 10 years or so in practice it would be possible to reduce the storage volume by sizing the equalizing tanks according to average net inflow and occasionally discharge a certain volume as needed e g during extremely wet years such a sizing approach minimizing the total storage volume would still lead to a significant reduction in off site treatment needs and could even be more attractive for industries with limited storage space alternatively under climate with large interannual precipitation zld beds sized to minimize discharge during wet years may result in the systems often lacking water during dryer spells plant species chosen for zld system should be able to sustain short periods of drought but a reliable source of water for occasional irrigation of the planted bed may be necessary to maintain long term plant growth and health finally biomass valorization is an important consideration if willows or other woody species are to be used in a zld system an option for valorization of the biomass produced e g using fragmented stems as mulch in other locations biofuel production should be available for example shredded willow stems make excellent mulch that has multiple uses lemieux et al 2000 dried stems can be used as a material in different types of walls barriers and screens lachapelle et al 2019 and in some locations the combustion of woody biomass can serve as an energy source langholtz et al 2019 although translocation of contaminants to aerial parts of the willows is expected to be low or null if water is pretreated samples of stems could be analyzed prior to biomass valorization depending on the projected use 4 4 adaption to other climates and wastewaters willows are not adapted to every region of the world they are naturally distributed mainly in the northern hemisphere argus 1986 and are considered an invasive species in some southern locations like australia south africa and argentina stokes 2008 henderson 1991 serra et al 2013 a recent study concluded that salix humboldtiana would be a good candidate for zld wetlands in colombia moreno et al 2019 it would be interesting to expand future research to alternative species with a high et potential adapted to other climates such as bamboo bambusa sp or giant reed arundo donax keeping in mind that annual et needs to exceed annual rainfall per surface area for the technology to be technically feasible again a minimal ratio of 1 5 willow bed et versus rainfall per m2 seemed necessary in this study although this value might vary in a different climate regarding the applicability of the general technology to other geographic regions climate is probably the factor that will dictate the end result of the design process our study has confirmed the feasibility of using a willow wetland to achieve zld in relatively unfavorable conditions short growing season and high precipitations occurring mainly during low et period which suggests that most climate could sustain this technology as a general reference we can presume that drier climate or were annual temperature and or rainfall variation low and or the vegetation growing period is longer land area and storage volume needs would be significantly reduced because of greater overall et and therefore et rainfall ratio and or less variable hydraulic loading however other considerations could emerge in particularly arid climates such as water scarcity preference for technologies allowing water reuse and the lack of a constant and sufficient water supply for plant optimal growth the use of a willow bed zld treatment system and therefore the design considerations pointed out in this study is not limited leachate management other industrial wastewaters having sometimes low concentration of problematic contaminants e g dyes in the textile industries or tannin and lignin in winery effluent vymazal 2014 or stormwater and agricultural runoffs that have highly variable volumes and represents a major concern in many parts of the world walsh et al 2012 daniels et al 2018 represent other potential applications of the technology 4 5 study and technology limitations the hydrological model presented here shows that in the climate tested the water storage volume required might be the most limiting aspect of this technology most of the annual rainfall occur during cold months were et is low typically autumn and spring and therefore leachate most be stored to be used during the few summer months inversely most of the et occur during the three hottest summer months and water demand is so high at this point that leachate accumulated in the storage unit during the cold months is not always sufficient to maintain a minimal water level in the willow bed another aspect of any zld treatment system that was not tested in our model but that should be investigated to better assess the potential of the technology is the expected lifespan of the evapotranspiration wetland even if concentration of contaminants and or salts in the leachate are low an accumulation might occur after several years raising questions about the fate of any such those contaminants and their effect on plant health brix and arias 2011 in the specific case of the reference site presented here the treatment efficiency of the pre treatment step was generally high levesque et al 2017 and after seven years of operation the trees in the willow bed showed no phytotoxic symptoms and no contaminant accumulation could be detected in the substrate frédette et al 2019a furthermore the cultivar used in this willow bed s miyabeana sx67 appears to be tolerant to the raw leachate produced on site frédette et al 2019c we could therefore estimate that the expected life span of the willow bed in this case exceeds 10 years in a zld system with willow bed the et wetland is sized based on water volume and not contaminant loadings as is the case for a treatment wetland kadlec and wallace 2008 therefore the et wetland will likely be well over sized in terms of contaminant treatment capacity and the life span of the wetland should then exceed or at least equal the typical life span of treatment wetlands 40 50 years kadlec and wallace 2008 exceptionally it is possible to pump out the contaminated or high salinity water out of the willow bed to increase its life span ultimately when a willow bed attains its maximal life span the substrate should be removed and treated as recommended depending on the local regulations and contaminant concentration another consideration that is also a limitation of our study is the weather particularly rainfall time frame used for sizing the compartments of the system using meteorological data from a shorter or longer period could have led to significantly different sizing furthermore past rainfall data are not predictive of future conditions considering the expected effects of climate change on local precipitation for instance for the region of the reference site of this study annual rainfall increased by 130 mm about 15 increase from 1960 to 2013 mddelcc 2017 and climate change scenarios predict a continuous increase in the future ouranos 2015 one way of dealing with such factors would be to run simulations with predicted future data sets for longer periods e g 50 years however this also enhances the need for flexibility in the design of a zld system where inflow comes from precipitation consequently it is crucial to include a risk reduction strategy in the design based on options such as irrigation or discharge while reserving space for future expansion of the wetland or storage tanks 5 conclusion our results suggest that treating leachate with an zld system using an evapotranspiration willow bed is feasible even in a climate with great seasonal temperature variations a short growing season and relatively high annual precipitation southeastern canada although it requires a considerable land area and water storage volume our results suggest that design and management decisions can significantly reduce those requirements all those aspects e g willow bed design acceptable discharge frequency collection tank volume combined or separated storage tanks etc need to be considered to ensure proper sizing of the system compartment and to increase the overall efficiency we showed that an organic substrate with a high fertilization rate makes is possible to reduce the size of willow bed required a 2 year coppicing cycle meaning that every year one half of the willows are cut back should be used to maintain maximal et rate simulating the operation of a system over a 20 year period highlighted the importance of designing a flexible system when treating leachate or other wastewater generated by rainfall modeling the temporal variation of both climate and et is essential to achieve a flexible design although the operation of a willow bed is relatively simple compared to other zld technologies water flux in the system must be monitored and managed to ensure maximal et and minimize overflows zld systems using a willow bed constitute a solution to some of the current limitations of typical zld treatment systems such as high operational and energy costs and the difficulty of treating recalcitrant organic molecules and our study constitutes a first step in extending this technology beyond domestic wastewater treatment future research on zld wetlands could focus on 1 quantifying the effect of fertilization on et for several species used in zld wetlands 2 determining the quantitative relationship between et and substrate physical properties 3 including a model of the fate of contaminants in the design system 4 producing a life cycle analysis 5 investigating alternative species options and 6 testing the full scale application of such a system based on the general design presented here declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16428,harnessing nitrous oxide n2o reducing bacteria is a promising strategy to reduce the n2o footprint of engineered systems applying a preferred organic carbon source as an electron donor accelerates n2o consumption by these bacteria however their n2o consumption potential and activity when fed different organic carbon species remain unclear here we systematically compared the effects of various organic carbon sources on the activity of n2o reducing bacteria via investigation of their biokinetic properties and genomic potentials five organic carbon sources acetate succinate glycerol ethanol and methanol were fed to four n2o reducing bacteria harboring either clade i or clade ii nosz gene respirometric analyses were performed with four n2o reducing bacterial strains identifying distinct shifts in do and n2o consumption biokinetics in response to the different feeding schemes regardless of the n2o reducing bacteria higher n2o consumption rates accompanied by higher biomass yields were obtained with acetate and succinate the biomass yield 15 45 1 07 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 of azospira sp strain i13 clade ii nosz observed under acetate fed condition was significantly higher than those of paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas stutzeri exhibiting greater metabolic efficiency however the spectrum of the organic carbon species utilizable to azospira sp strain i13 was limited as demonstrated by the highly variable n2o consumption rates observed with different substrates the potential to metabolize the supplemented carbon sources was investigated by genomic analysis the results of which corroborated the n2o consumption biokinetics results moreover electron donor selection had a substantial impact on how n2o consumption activities were recovered after oxygen exposure collectively our findings highlight the importance of choosing appropriate electron donor additives for increasing the n2o sink capability of biological nitrogen removal systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide reductase carbon sources nosz gene biokinetics genomic analysis 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an important ozone depleting substance and powerful greenhouse gas that is approximately 265 times more potent than co2 ravishankara et al 2009 ipcc 2014 the atmospheric n2o concentration has gradually increased by 0 73 ppb per year over the last three decades tian et al 2020 although n2o emissions are mainly derived from agricultural activities reay et al 2012 the contribution from wastewater treatment plants wwtps should be closely monitored the necessity for this is indicated by recent reports claiming that the amount of n2o emitted during biological nitrogen removal in wwtps accounts for 0 14 6 of a total nitrogen load and is more substantial than initially expected law et al 2012 yoon et al 2017 n2o is produced during biological nitrogen removal in wwtps e g from ammonia oxidation nitrifier denitrification and incomplete heterotrophic denitrification kampschreur et al 2009 therefore recent studies have investigated strategies for n2o emission mitigation e g upgrading the process design

activated sludge chen et al 2020 duan et al 2021 biological mitigation of n2o emissions is attributed to heterotrophic bacteria harboring nosz gene which encodes n2o reductase n2or this enzyme catalyzes n2o reduction to n2 sanford et al 2012 thomson et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 the nosz gene phylogeny has been distinctively divided into two clades owing to differences in the amino acid sequences in addition to the canonical clade i nosz a new lineage of nosz gene the atypical clade ii nosz gene has been proposed and is found in diverse microbes with unique n2o metabolism sanford et al 2012 jones et al 2013 a recent survey indicates that the clade ii nosz gene is more abundant and widespread in engineered systems kim et al 2020a and clade ii type bacteria likely contribute to n2o consumption due to their higher affinities for n2o zhao et al 2019 according to enrichment and isolation works conthe et al 2018 suenaga et al 2019 clade ii type n2o reducing bacteria e g dechloromonas and azospira are promising as a n2o sink in engineered systems these clade ii n2o reducing bacteria likely have a higher growth yield yoon et al 2016 higher affinities for n2o suenaga et al 2019 yoon et al 2016 and n2or that is more resilient to oxygen exposure suenaga et al 2018b thus identifying factors that enhance the activities of these effective n2o reducing bacteria could lead to effective strategies to curb n2o emissions carbon sources externally added as electron donors e g ethanol methanol and acetate govern denitrification performances adouani et al 2010 song et al 2015 carlson et al 2020 and the amount of n2o emissions in a denitrifying bioreactor baytshtok et al 2009 song et al 2015 although methanol has been widely used for denitrification because it is a cost effective electron donor hallin et al 2006 pan et al 2013 alternatives can be potentially applied based on availability and accessibility glycerol a byproduct of biodiesel production exhibits promise to replace methanol and ethanol as an electron donor for mixed culture biomass bodík et al 2009 schroeder et al 2020 despite the practical implementation of an external carbon supply for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria their n2o consumption kinetics and performances fed with different carbon sources have not been systematically investigated therefore further exploration of various carbon sources on the biokinetics of n2o consumption as the final step of denitrification is necessary the long term continuous supply of an external carbon source as an electron donor shapes denitrifying community compositions baytshtok et al 2009 carlson et al 2020 for instance paracoccus methylophilus and methyloversatilis spp thrive in methanol fed conditions hallin et al 2006 kim et al 2020b while acidovorax comamonas and thauera spp thrive in acetate fed conditions osaka et al 2006 lu et al 2014 such distinct community compositions suggest that the organic carbon source to improve denitrification including n2o consumption should be carefully selected because attaining energy from a supplemented carbon source primarily depends on the genotypes of the denitrifying bacteria ribera guardia et al 2014 the presence or absence of genes necessary for metabolizing particular carbon sources will determine the predominant and active denitrifying bacteria and may determine the amount of n2o emissions genome centric investigations have been performed on a pure culture of denitrifier silva et al 2020 and denitrifying consortia orschler et al 2021 providing profound insights into the organic carbon metabolic potentials in denitrifiers nevertheless no experimental validation has been reported regarding organic carbon effects on n2o consumption activity and the knowledge gap between genomic information and the physiological data pertaining to coupling of n2o reduction and oxidation of organic electron donors remains to be bridged filling this gap is of significant importance because wwtps receive highly mixed organic carbon sources with varying flow rates and concentrations kim et al 2020b song et al 2014 therefore as the first step forward determining the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria when fed with various organic carbon species can improve our understanding of n2o emissions from wwtps supplemented with organic feed this study investigated the effects of different organic carbon sources on n2o consumption biokinetics of canonical denitrifying clade i and clade ii type n2o reducing bacteria given that availability of organic carbon sources is one of the factors that primarily determine n2o consumption potentials this study deciphered revisited and compared the genomes of the nosz possessing denitrifying bacteria to acquire insights into their metabolic potentials organic carbon sources that are frequently used as an external electron donor for heterotrophic denitrification acetate succinate glycerol ethanol and methanol were added to bacterial cell suspensions we hypothesized that the organic electron donor may be one of the factors that govern 1 the n2o associated biokinetics e g maximum specific growth rate and half saturation coefficient and 2 the resilience of n2o consumption activity to oxygen exposure in a differential manner in different n2o reducers depending on the energy metabolism associated gene set they harbor to verify these hypotheses we performed online monitoring of n2o and dissolved oxygen do concentrations in microbial cultures incubated under anoxia with and without oxic intervals using a micro respiration system furthermore we queried the genomic libraries of the examined bacteria for genes with possible association with the observed biokinetic data the findings of this study can contribute to the development of effective mitigation strategies for n2o produced and emitted from heterotrophic denitrification in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and cultivation conditions

gene had been enriched and isolated from n2o fed bioreactors suenaga et al 2019 the rationale of the selection lies in that i both clade i and clade ii n2o reducers were represented each with two

encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthology numbers using ghostkoala v 2 1 kanehisa et al 2000 2016 which were subsequently used for prediction of metabolic potentials of the four organisms to utilize the organic species provided as electron donors 2 3 micro respiration system setup and operation a micro respirometry system for simultaneous monitoring of do and n2o was set up to examine the effect of different organic carbon sources on the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria fig 1 the cell cultures were incubated in a h shaped vial with an effective volume of 10 ml that can accommodate two microelectrodes and a stir bar unisense aarhuis denmark five batch tests were performed per bacterium each with a different carbon source i e acetate succinate glycerol methanol or ethanol at the beginning of each batch test 10 ml cell suspension was pipetted into the h shaped vial to which do and n2o microelectrodes unisense aarhus denmark were inserted leaving no headspace in the vial subsequently 20 μl of concentrated n2o solution 24 mm at 25 c was injected into the vial to achieve an initial n2o concentration of approximately 50 μmol l 1 the carbon and electron source was added as follows acetate 320 μmol l 1 methanol 420 μmol l 1 ethanol 210 μmol l 1 glycerol 180 μmol l 1 or succinate 180 μmol l 1 the organic compounds were added in excess to ensure that n2o reduction activity was not limited by electron donor shortage table s1 the micro respiration system was operated in a water bath maintained at 30 0 2 c to allow for comparison with the previous results performed at the same temperature and stirred at 500 rpm yoon et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 n2o and do measurements were processed using the sensor trace suite software unisense do concentration was monitored alongside n2o concentration as it is a crucial factor affecting n2o consumption activity massara et al 2017 after each batch experiment the cell suspension was fixed by adding 2 glutaraldehyde solution and the cell count was determined using a microscope bz 8100 keyence japan the details of this procedure are described elsewhere lunau et al 2005 all batch tests were conducted in triplicate 2 4 net growth yield measurements the net biomass yields of the bacterial strains on n2o were determined for each carbon substrate as previously described sanford et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 a 120 ml glass serum vial was filled with 50 ml of the minimal salts medium ph 7 5 and the medium was then flushed with 99 99 helium gas for 10 min at 0 1 l min 1 to ensure anaerobic incubation condition each vial was immediately capped with a rubber plug and sealed with an aluminum crimp subsequently 70 ml of mixed gas 5 95 of n2o n2 replaced the helium gas in the vial after sterilization 2 ml of the preculture suspension and 1 ml of carbon source stock solution were injected into the vial the carbon source was added in 25 fold excess of n2o in terms of electron equivalents the cultures were incubated at 30 c with shaking at 120 rpm after the n2o was completely consumed 40 ml of the cell suspension was filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size polyvinylidene fluoride membrane merk millipore burlington ma the membrane was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and then dried in a desiccator until no further decrease in the filter weight was observed the weight of the salts on the membranes was measured after treating the membrane at 500 c for 8 h as previously described by sanford et al 2012 the net growth yields were calculated with the following equation sanford et al 2012 1 y x s m 2 m 1 m 3 m 1 m 2 m 1 m 3 m 1 n n 2 o where yx s is the net growth yield mg biomass mmol n2o 1 m and m are the weights of the membrane filters measured with the fully grown bacterial culture

retentate respectively nn2o is the amount of n2o consumed during the incubation mmol the measurement was performed in triplicate 2 5 biokinetic parameter calculations whole cell kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting do and n2o concentration profiles to the whole cell michaelis menten equation martens habbena et al 2009 as our previous work confirmed that the presence of n2o had no significant effects on biokinetic parameters associated with do zhou et al 2021 the possibility of n2o interference on do biokinetics was not considered 2 v v max s k m s where v is either the consumption rate measurement interval δ being 15 s normalized by the number of cells fmol cell h 1 v max is the maximum consumption rate fmol cell h 1 s is the concentration μmol l 1 and k m is the whole cell half saturation constant μmol l 1 nonlinear regression was performed in origin 9 0 using the least square method the specific affinity as an indicator of effectiveness of n2o consumption at a low concentration range was obtained from the n2o kinetic parameters using eq 3 3 a n 2 o v max n 2 o k m n 2 o 10 9 where a n2o is the specific affinity l cell h 1 v max n2o is the maximum n2o consumption rate fmol cell h 1 and k m n2o is the whole cell half saturation constant for n2o μmol l 1 2 6 recovery of n2o consumption activity after do exposure the initial presence of do in the microrespiration experiments enabled observation of n2o consumption activation or recovery following an oxic to anoxic transition as activated sludge in a wwtp e g a modified ludzak ettinger mle process is constantly subjected to oxic to anoxic transitions and vice versa such transitional behavior has significant implications to n2o dynamics in wwtps pomowski et al 2011 zhou et al 2021 after depletion of initially present do and n2o a cycle of adding 20 µl of 25 mmol l 1 n2o solution followed by monitoring n2o consumption to depletion was repeated until the time series n2o concentration profiles were stabilized the relative n2o consumption activity during the recovery was estimated by eq 4 4 e v n 2 o v max n 2 o where e is the relative n2o consumption activity dimensionless and v n2o is the maximum n2o consumption rate observed during a cycle of n2o consumption in the course of recovery fmol cell h 1 the slope from linear regression of the t vs e plot was defined as the reactivation rate of n2or v nos h 1 serving as a measure of how rapidly n2o consumption is recovered following oxic to anoxic transition under the given condition 2 7 analytical and statistical methods the gaseous n2o concentration measurements for the determination of net growth yields were taken using a gas chromatography system equipped with an electron capture detector as described previously gc 14b shimadzu japan terada et al 2013 in accordance with a previous study suenaga et al 2018b do and n2o concentrations were measured using do and n2o microelectrodes unisense with detection limits below 0 5 μm and a response time shorter than 0 3 s the data analysis was performed with origin 9 0 statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics version 19 0 the p values lower than 0 05 or 0 01 were considered statistically significant in anova tests 3 results 3 1 genotypes of the tested bacteria regarding organic carbon metabolism the genome of azospira sp strain i09 consists of two contigs with 3 77 and 0 397 mbp lengths and the completeness is 100 by busco ver 1 simão et al 2015 the gc content is 64 4 and 3910 cdss were detected interrogation of the genomes of the four examined n2o reducers predicted genomic potentials of these bacteria to utilize various organic electron donors fig 2 all four bacteria possess the genes necessary for metabolizing acetate and succinate to carbon dioxide azospira sp strain i13 lacks the gene encoding nad dependent alcohol dehydrogenase which transforms ethanol to acetaldehyde and thus is essential for utilization of ethanol via the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle the other three strains possess a full suite of functional genes for metabolizing ethanol to co2 the two azospira sp strains lack the genes encoding enzymes that metabolize glycerol while the genomes of pa denitrificans and ps stutzeri harbor the gene necessary for glycerol degradation into dihydroxyacetone phosphate via glycerol 3 phosphate but not via dihydroxyacetone the genes encoding glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase ec 2 3 1 15 and acyl phosphate glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase ec 2 3 1 275 are found in the ps stutzeri genome but only the latter is found in the pa denitrificans genome of the four bacteria only pa denitrificans harbors a functional gene for methanol conversion into formaldehyde ec 1 1 1 244 3 2 growth characteristics of the n2o reducing bacteria the net biomass yields of the bacteria fed different organic substrates as organic electron donors and n2o as the sole electron acceptor evaluated the metabolic efficiency of coupling n2o reduction with oxidation of varying electron donors consistent with the findings from the genome analyses fig 2 azospira sp strains i09 i13 and ps stutzeri did not consume a significant amount of either methanol or n2o fig s1 the biomass yield of azospira sp strain i13 was the highest when fed acetate 5 37 0 48 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 and this value was 2 87 times higher than the yield observed with ethanol as the electron donor fig 3 table 1 acetate generated the largest variance in biomass yields across the organisms the clade ii type azospira strains favored acetate their net biomass yields on acetate 15 45 1 07 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 for azospira sp strain i13 and 11 56 0 62 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 for azospira sp strain i09 were significantly higher than those of pa denitrificans 7 88 0 95 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 and ps stutzeri 9 13 0 53 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 p 0 05 the same trend was obtained with succinate among the glycerol fed cultures ps stutzeri exhibited a significantly higher net growth yield than the other three organisms p 0 05 net yields were statistically indistinct across the four organisms when ethanol was supplied as the electron donor p 0 05 3 3 do and n2o respiration dynamics the choice of organic electron donor significantly affected do and n2o respiration dynamics in the four bacterial strains examined no significant decrease in do and n2o concentrations was observed without external organic carbon addition pa denitrificans data shown in fig s2 indicating that do and n2o consumption was coupled with organic carbon oxidation and that the endogenous decay with n2o was marginal regardless of the supplemented organic matter all four bacterial strains depleted do prior to n2o fig 4 the replicates are shown in figs s3 and s4 the repeated injections of n2o vertical black arrows in fig 4 accelerated n2o consumption the highest n2o consumption rate after each n2o injection differed and depended on the bacteria type and the supplemented organic carbon summarized in section 3 4 for azospira sp strain i09 fed with acetate panel a in fig 4 the maximum n2o consumption rates after the second and third n2o injections obtained from the linear approximation of the experiment data were 143 7 n 3 and 201 18 n 3 of the rate after the first injection respectively 3 4 biokinetic parameters of n2o reducing bacteria biokinetic parameters v max and k m of the tested bacteria were estimated by fitting the do and n2o concentration profiles fig 4 to the whole cell michaelis menten equation eq 2 the v max and k m values of each bacterium were largely dependent on the added carbon source table 1 higher v max do and v max n2o were obtained when acetate and succinate were added compared with the values obtained with ethanol or methanol as the electron donor table 1 figs 5 and 6 azospira sp strain i13 has the largest standard deviation 6 11 fmol cell h 1 among the v max do values determined with five different organic electron donors table 1 for comparison the standard deviations of pa denitrificans and ps stutzeri were 2 66 and 5 06 fmol cell h 1 respectively the highest n2o consumption rates v max n2o were markedly different across the tested bacteria when different carbon sources were injected pa denitrificans exhibited substantially lower v max n2o than the other bacterial strains the v max n2o v max do values for pa denitrificans were 0 05 acetate 0 07 succinate 0 04 glycerol 0 03 ethanol and 0 06 methanol even considering that the number of electrons required to reduce a mole of n2o is half of the number of electrons required for reducing a mole of oxygen these values indicate a preference for oxygen as the electron acceptor table 1 the corresponding v max n2o v max do values for azospira sp strain i13 were 1 41 acetate 1 46 succinate 0 35 glycerol 0 91 ethanol and 0 38 methanol showcasing a preference for n2o as an electron acceptor table 1 the variance of v max n2o values measured with azospira sp strain i13 using different organic carbon species was at least 157 fold higher than that of any other bacterial strain examined despite being phylogenetically closely affiliated with azospira sp strain i13 distinct v max n2o values were obtained from microrespirometry experiments with azospira sp strain i09 with different organic electron donors table 1 interestingly only ps stutzeri exhibited a preference for glycerol as the electron donor this bacterium exhibited 4 41fold higher v max do 13 9 0 70 fmol cell h 1 and 4 17 fold higher v max n2o 2 03 0 11 fmol cell h 1 than the other three bacteria when fed glycerol the whole cell half saturation constants k m and specific affinities a do and a n2o of the tested bacteria also varied substantially depending on the organic carbon source table 1 the minimum and maximum k m do values ranged from 0 84 0 07 μmol l 1 methanol to 10 91 2 81 μmol l 1 glycerol for ps stutzeri clade i nosz and 0 25 0 06 μmol l 1 ethanol to 5 57 0 50 μmol l 1 acetate for azospira sp strain i13 clade ii nosz even with the same carbon source the k m was significantly different across the tested bacteria for acetate addition the k m do ranged from 0 64 0 05 μmol l 1 for azospira sp strain i09 the lowest to 9 55 1 81 μmol l 1 for ps stutzeri the highest the specific affinities for do a do of pa denitrificans were higher than those of the other tested bacteria while those for n2o a n2o were much lower suggesting once again that pa denitrificans favors do over n2o table 1 acetate fed azospira sp strain i13 exhibited the highest a n2o value 8 88 10 9 l cell h 1 which was 19 times higher than the a n2o value of acetate fed pa denitrificans 3 5 recovery of n2o consumption after

activity following the oxic to anoxic transition in the four bacterial strains regardless of the bacterium examined or the electron donor added n2or activity increased linearly with time fig 7 the four bacterial strains exhibited noticeably varied e values table s2 intriguingly the two azospira strains had substantially differing e and v nos values fig 7 with acetate as the electron donor the time required for complete recovery of n2o consumption activity i e e 1 0 was 5 46 h 4 34 h 2 73 h and 1 37 h for pa denitrificans ps stutzeri azospira sp strain i09 and strain i13 respectively table s2 the recovery time differed depending on the supplemented organic carbon source also notable were the consistently high reactivation rates observed under the acetate fed condition in all four bacteria the v nos values measured with acetate as the electron donor were 0 11 0 01 0 23 0 02 0 24 0 01 and 0 35 0 03 h 1 for pa denitrificans ps stutzeri azospira sp strain i09 and strain i13 respectively all significantly higher p 0 05 than the v nos values measured with any other electron donors for the respective bacteria these results also demonstrated that azospira sp strain i13 was the most resilient bacterium against do exposure among the four bacterial strains examined under the acetate feeding scheme fig 7 it should be noted that the n2o reducers invariably exhibited the highest v max n2o and v nos values when fed acetate 4 discussion 4 1 electron donor preference regulates physiological traits of n2o consumption despite the significance of denitrification reducing reactive nitrogen oxides in wastewaters to nitrogen gas one of the challenges lies in the accumulation and emission of a highly potent greenhouse gas n2o to limit n2o emission harnessing n2o reducing bacteria can contribute to n2o mitigation during denitrification in engineered systems suenaga et al 2019 however more exploratory research on novel n2o reducing bacteria and ecophysiological characterizations is required hallin et al 2018 although the operating conditions e g ph do level co existing no2 and temperature that facilitate n2o consumption by these bacteria have been thoroughly investigated pan et al 2012 suenaga et al 2018b wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 2022 their n2o consumption associated with various organic carbon species is poorly understood given the context our hypotheses regarded an organic carbon species as a vital factor in 1 n2o consumption activity in an anoxia environment and 2 n2or recovery after do exposure the physiological assays carried out using a micro respiration system as well as genomic insights indicated that the organic carbon preference of n2o reducing bacteria determines the n2o consumption rates n2o affinity and activity recovery after do exposure verifying the raised hypotheses as shown in figs 5 6 and table 1 the application of a micro respiration system fig 1 illuminated the noticeable differences in their do and n2o respiration biokinetics of clade i and clade ii nosz canonical denitrifying bacteria and the dependencies upon the type of supplemented organic matter table 1 the different do and n2o biokinetics with the different electron donors likely provide significant implications for n2o emissions from denitrification in anoxic tanks of wwtps when external organic carbon source is switched for example from ethanol to methanol baytshtok et al 2009 given that the external organic carbon source determines the microbial community composition and its resultant denitrification performances baytshtok et al 2009 lu et al 2011 2014 carlson et al 2020 our results underscore that the differences in n2o consumption activity of the indigenous microbial consortium harboring n2o reducing bacteria are potentially caused by external organic carbon source which plausibly determines a n2o footprint of a wwtp 4 2 metabolic genotype affects the n2o related biokinetics of azospira sp strain i13 the genotype and phenotype investigation of azospira sp strain i13 elaborated its distinctive and unique n2o consumption performance the biokinetic analysis conducted with a micro respiration system identified the advantage of this strain as a n2o sink when acetate and succinate were supplied fig 6 and table 1 the far lower n2o consumption activities with glycerol ethanol and methanol fig 5 were contextualized by the absence of the key genes enabling their metabolisms fig 2 these trends show why azospira sp strain i13 had the largest variance of v max n2o among the four tested bacteria when fed the five organic carbon sources table 1 the absence of certain genes may force n2o reducing bacteria to utilize alternative pathways to utilize electrons for n2o consumption likely lowering the consumption rates carlson et al 2020 our follow up experiment found that methanol consumption with n2o respiration was not observed for azospira sp strain i13 or ps stutzeri this is because they lack the methanol dehydrogenase gene figs s1 and 2 either endogenous respiration or residual carbon from preculture media led to n2o consumption by bacteria that lack the genes necessary for metabolizing the supplemented organic carbon our result shed light on the significance of electron donor selection and expanded our understanding of n2o reducing bacterial physiology this knowledge can support n2o mitigation in natural and engineered ecosystems the limited substrate range may be the general character of the genus azospira mining of the azospira genomes in the database revealed azospira genotypes that are analogous to that of a oryzae ps which lacks genes essential for glycerol metabolism hitherto no azospira species has been found that harbors a complete set of genes needed for methanol metabolism although such genotypes may not be shared among all azospira species genomic information is indeed limited it is plausible that azospira may not effectively function as an effective n2o sink when fed with alcohol and polyol which are cost effective electron donors ribera guardia et al 2014 table s1 therefore effective strategies to control n2o emissions require further investigation on the physiologies pertinent to specific electron donors 4 3 genomic insights into the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria for suitable external carbon selection our experimental study demonstrated that the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria are largely dependent on the carbon source figs 5 and 6 the acetate and succinate addition resulted in higher v max do and v max n2o values compared with ethanol and methanol addition figs 5 and 6 these results are consistent with the electron donor preferences of the n2o reducing bacteria ribera guardia et al 2014 that possess the complete set of genes necessary for the corresponding metabolic pathways fig 2 acetate and succinate are immediately metabolized in the tca cycle while ethanol degradation requires nad dependent alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase to consecutively convert ethanol to acetate before entering the tca cycle via acetyl coa adouani et al 2010 methanol degradation requires methanol dehydrogenase utilizing a distinct pathway to fully oxidize it to co2 ribera guardia et al 2014 therefore among the tested bacteria the acetate and succinate additions led to higher do and n2o consumption rates compared with the methanol and ethanol additions table 1 interestingly when glycerol was fed the v max do and v max n2o for ps stutzeri were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of the other n2o reducing bacteria figs 5 and 6 this observation was especially interesting as it is to our knowledge the first report of n2o reduction biokinetics data with glycerol as the electron donor this remarkable capability of ps stutzeri to utilize glycerol as the electron acceptor for n2o reduction is likely because glycerol based denitrification involves acyltransferase converting glycerol 3 phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate fig 2 although ps stuzeri and pa denitrificans possess genes for glycerol metabolism only ps stutzeri harbors the glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase genes for both ec 2 3 1 15 and ec 2 3 1 275 fig 2 which require acyl coa and acyl phosphate as substrates respectively pa denitrificans possesses only the latter enzyme but it may not be able to acquire sufficient acyl phosphate substrate further investigation is necessary to elucidate why ps stutzeri can achieve high do and n2o consumption rates when fed glycerol 4 4 effect of organic carbon source on n2or recovery after do exposure the presence or absence of do drastically alters the n2o respiration capacity of bacteria lu and chandran 2010 suenaga et al 2018b because do exposure can alter gene and protein expressions n2or is reportedly vulnerable to do exposure pomowski et al 2011 a better understanding of n2or activity recovery with different carbon sources is essential for mitigating n2o emissions in wwtps where dynamic changes in redox conditions occur our investigation of n2o activity resilience in n2o reducing bacteria found that the different organic carbon species caused different lag times in the recovery of n2o consumption fig 7 at the same organic carbon source the n2or resilience differed among the tested bacteria when acetate and succinate were applied azospira sp strain i13 showed higher n2o consumption and faster n2or recovery than pa denitrificans and ps stutzeri whereas with glycerol ethanol and methanol the n2or recoveries were markedly impaired table s2 the recovery times are congruent with the presence or absence of the genes for the different carbon metabolisms fig 2 a delayed n2or recovery may boost n2o emissions in the transiently changing redox conditions often found in wwtps in stark contrast p stutzeri displayed relatively consistent n2or resilience regardless of the supplemented carbon source which may alleviate abrupt n2o emissions the contrasting result implies that possessing diverse energy metabolisms genes could be an advantage for mitigating n2o emissions in engineered systems and agricultural croplands jonnasen et al 2021 as the organic carbon constituents are varied more n2o mitigation research is needed to identify and augment highly efficient bacteria amenable to various carbon sources as electron donors in a mle process one of the mostly widely implemented biological nitrogen removal bnr processes activated sludge is recycled from an aeration tank to an anoxic tank our experimental setup mirrors a realistic condition where the redox condition is shifted from aerobic to anoxic conditions as the aerobic activated sludge is recycled to the anoxic tank to which an organic electron donor is added therefore our biokinetic results regarding the retardation of n2or activity recovery after oxygen exposure would prove crucial for enhancing the understanding of n2o dynamics in bnr systems 4 5 carbon sources likely shape different microbial community structures implications according to the whole cell michaelis menten profiles with n2o as an electron acceptor fig s5 azospira sp strain i13 could dominate in a denitrifying reactor fed with acetate and succinate whereas the others tested bacteria with glycerol ethanol and methanol the distinct n2o biokinetic data suggest that a carbon source likely shapes different predominant species as a n2o reducer microbial community compositions receiving different carbon sources e g methanol or acetate have been reported lu et al 2014 song et al 2015 carlson et al 2020 and have shown the predominance of different genera as denitrifiers baytshtok et al 2009 osaka et al 2006 ma et al 2015 acetate fed biomass reportedly emits less n2o than methanol fed biomass song et al 2015 as shown in the current study given the unique metabolic genotypes and phenotypes of each n2o reducing bacterium a microbial community will have a distinct n2o consumption activity this notion is supported by previous work in which an acetate fed biomass consisting of rubrivivax and dechloromonas n2o reducers exhibited greater n2o consumption than a methanol fed biomass that mainly consisted of methylotenera song et al 2015 this is likely because from the biokinetic point of view highly efficient n2o reducing bacteria e g dechloromonas and azospira can be dominant in a biomass song et al 2014 suenaga et al 2019 kim et al 2020 further studies should investigate the link between the organic carbon source and the n2o emission in wastewater bioreactors given the efficiency and cost effectiveness of nitrogen removal in wwtps it is imperative to select an appropriate carbon source for n2o reduction ribera guardia et al 2014 song et al 2015 it is perceived that a growth yield is a measure of the effectiveness of energy transfer from catabolism to anabolism russel and cook 1995 the high net growth yield found for the azospira spp is in keeping with the high metabolic efficiency of azospira when fed acetate and succinate by contrast this trend was not observed with glycerol and ethanol fig 3 from a practical point of view acetate may not be a suitable external organic electron donor for denitrification because it costs seven times more than methanol mokhayeri et al 2009 glycerol is a good alternate due to its relatively higher n2o reduction efficiency and lower cost when crude glycerol is used than the other carbon sources song et al 2015 table s1 when glycerol was applied ps stutzeri exhibited the highest v max do and v max n2o which were nearly one order of magnitude higher than those of the other tested bacteria figs 5 and 6 the v nos of ps stutzeri with glycerol addition was also high indicating its fast recovery of n2o consumption activity when transitioning from aerobic to anoxic conditions table s2 based on this short recovery time biomass harboring ps stutzeri in a biological nitrogen removal system would rapidly adapt to glycerol when applied as an alternative carbon source however not all strains of ps stutzeri necessarily possess the complete gene set for glycerol metabolism and more research is needed to clarify this additionally further studies are required to verify a suitable external organic carbon source that is inexpensive and will result in a high n2o consumption rate in wwtps 5 conclusion this study systematically compared the n2o consumption and n2or recovery of four n2o reducing bacteria harboring either clade i or clade ii nosz when fed five different carbon sources the conclusions are as follows organic carbon source remarkably affected the performance biokinetics and biomass yield of heterotrophic n2o reducing bacteria when n2o served as the sole electron acceptor of the tested carbon sources acetate and succinate resulted in the highest do and n2o consumption rates and clade ii type azospira sp strain i13 had a higher consumption rate than clade i type ps stuzeri and pa denitrificans the n2or resilience after transitioning from aerobic to anoxic conditions heavily depended on the type of n2o reducing bacteria and the supplemented carbon source when acetate and succinate were added the clade ii nosz bacteria had higher biomass yields than the clade i nosz bacteria collectively the performances and biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria are closely associated with their physiological traits and the metabolic potential of the electron donor identifying highly efficient n2o reducers and supplementing them with their preferable organic carbon source would improve n2o mitigation in wwtps credit authorship contribution statement chuang qi investigation data curation writing review editing software yiwen zhou investigation data curation

16428,harnessing nitrous oxide n2o reducing bacteria is a promising strategy to reduce the n2o footprint of engineered systems applying a preferred organic carbon source as an electron donor accelerates n2o consumption by these bacteria however their n2o consumption potential and activity when fed different organic carbon species remain unclear here we systematically compared the effects of various organic carbon sources on the activity of n2o reducing bacteria via investigation of their biokinetic properties and genomic potentials five organic carbon sources acetate succinate glycerol ethanol and methanol were fed to four n2o reducing bacteria harboring either clade i or clade ii nosz gene respirometric analyses were performed with four n2o reducing bacterial strains identifying distinct shifts in do and n2o consumption biokinetics in response to the different feeding schemes regardless of the n2o reducing bacteria higher n2o consumption rates accompanied by higher biomass yields were obtained with acetate and succinate the biomass yield 15 45 1 07 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 of azospira sp strain i13 clade ii nosz observed under acetate fed condition was significantly higher than those of paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas stutzeri exhibiting greater metabolic efficiency however the spectrum of the organic carbon species utilizable to azospira sp strain i13 was limited as demonstrated by the highly variable n2o consumption rates observed with different substrates the potential to metabolize the supplemented carbon sources was investigated by genomic analysis the results of which corroborated the n2o consumption biokinetics results moreover electron donor selection had a substantial impact on how n2o consumption activities were recovered after oxygen exposure collectively our findings highlight the importance of choosing appropriate electron donor additives for increasing the n2o sink capability of biological nitrogen removal systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide reductase carbon sources nosz gene biokinetics genomic analysis 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an important ozone depleting substance and powerful greenhouse gas that is approximately 265 times more potent than co2 ravishankara et al 2009 ipcc 2014 the atmospheric n2o concentration has gradually increased by 0 73 ppb per year over the last three decades tian et al 2020 although n2o emissions are mainly derived from agricultural activities reay et al 2012 the contribution from wastewater treatment plants wwtps should be closely monitored the necessity for this is indicated by recent reports claiming that the amount of n2o emitted during biological nitrogen removal in wwtps accounts for 0 14 6 of a total nitrogen load and is more substantial than initially expected law et al 2012 yoon et al 2017 n2o is produced during biological nitrogen removal in wwtps e g from ammonia oxidation nitrifier denitrification and incomplete heterotrophic denitrification kampschreur et al 2009 therefore recent studies have investigated strategies for n2o emission mitigation e g upgrading the process design to actively remove n2o in the waste gas stream yoon et al 2017 implementing a refined n2o monitoring campaign gruber et al 2019 and adjusting operating conditions of wwtps to reduce n2o production by activated sludge chen et al 2020 duan et al 2021 biological mitigation of n2o emissions is attributed to heterotrophic bacteria harboring nosz gene which encodes n2o reductase n2or this enzyme catalyzes n2o reduction to n2 sanford et al 2012 thomson et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 the nosz gene phylogeny has been distinctively divided into two clades owing to differences in the amino acid sequences in addition to the canonical clade i nosz a new lineage of nosz gene the atypical clade ii nosz gene has been proposed and is found in diverse microbes with unique n2o metabolism sanford et al 2012 jones et al 2013 a recent survey indicates that the clade ii nosz gene is more abundant and widespread in engineered systems kim et al 2020a and clade ii type bacteria likely contribute to n2o consumption due to their higher affinities for n2o zhao et al 2019 according to enrichment and isolation works conthe et al 2018 suenaga et al 2019 clade ii type n2o reducing bacteria e g dechloromonas and azospira are promising as a n2o sink in engineered systems these clade ii n2o reducing bacteria likely have a higher growth yield yoon et al 2016 higher affinities for n2o suenaga et al 2019 yoon et al 2016 and n2or that is more resilient to oxygen exposure suenaga et al 2018b thus identifying factors that enhance the activities of these effective n2o reducing bacteria could lead to effective strategies to curb n2o emissions carbon sources externally added as electron donors e g ethanol methanol and acetate govern denitrification performances adouani et al 2010 song et al 2015 carlson et al 2020 and the amount of n2o emissions in a denitrifying bioreactor baytshtok et al 2009 song et al 2015 although methanol has been widely used for denitrification because it is a cost effective electron donor hallin et al 2006 pan et al 2013 alternatives can be potentially applied based on availability and accessibility glycerol a byproduct of biodiesel production exhibits promise to replace methanol and ethanol as an electron donor for mixed culture biomass bodík et al 2009 schroeder et al 2020 despite the practical implementation of an external carbon supply for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria their n2o consumption kinetics and performances fed with different carbon sources have not been systematically investigated therefore further exploration of various carbon sources on the biokinetics of n2o consumption as the final step of denitrification is necessary the long term continuous supply of an external carbon source as an electron donor shapes denitrifying community compositions baytshtok et al 2009 carlson et al 2020 for instance paracoccus methylophilus and methyloversatilis spp thrive in methanol fed conditions hallin et al 2006 kim et al 2020b while acidovorax comamonas and thauera spp thrive in acetate fed conditions osaka et al 2006 lu et al 2014 such distinct community compositions suggest that the organic carbon source to improve denitrification including n2o consumption should be carefully selected because attaining energy from a supplemented carbon source primarily depends on the genotypes of the denitrifying bacteria ribera guardia et al 2014 the presence or absence of genes necessary for metabolizing particular carbon sources will determine the predominant and active denitrifying bacteria and may determine the amount of n2o emissions genome centric investigations have been performed on a pure culture of denitrifier silva et al 2020 and denitrifying consortia orschler et al 2021 providing profound insights into the organic carbon metabolic potentials in denitrifiers nevertheless no experimental validation has been reported regarding organic carbon effects on n2o consumption activity and the knowledge gap between genomic information and the physiological data pertaining to coupling of n2o reduction and oxidation of organic electron donors remains to be bridged filling this gap is of significant importance because wwtps receive highly mixed organic carbon sources with varying flow rates and concentrations kim et al 2020b song et al 2014 therefore as the first step forward determining the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria when fed with various organic carbon species can improve our understanding of n2o emissions from wwtps supplemented with organic feed this study investigated the effects of different organic carbon sources on n2o consumption biokinetics of canonical denitrifying clade i and clade ii type n2o reducing bacteria given that availability of organic carbon sources is one of the factors that primarily determine n2o consumption potentials this study deciphered revisited and compared the genomes of the nosz possessing denitrifying bacteria to acquire insights into their metabolic potentials organic carbon sources that are frequently used as an external electron donor for heterotrophic denitrification acetate succinate glycerol ethanol and methanol were added to bacterial cell suspensions we hypothesized that the organic electron donor may be one of the factors that govern 1 the n2o associated biokinetics e g maximum specific growth rate and half saturation coefficient and 2 the resilience of n2o consumption activity to oxygen exposure in a differential manner in different n2o reducers depending on the energy metabolism associated gene set they harbor to verify these hypotheses we performed online monitoring of n2o and dissolved oxygen do concentrations in microbial cultures incubated under anoxia with and without oxic intervals using a micro respiration system furthermore we queried the genomic libraries of the examined bacteria for genes with possible association with the observed biokinetic data the findings of this study can contribute to the development of effective mitigation strategies for n2o produced and emitted from heterotrophic denitrification in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and cultivation conditions the two canonical denitrifiers paracoccus denitrificans nbrc102528 and pseudomonas stutzeri jcm5965 harboring the clade i nosz gene were acquired from biological resource center at national institute

gene had been enriched and isolated from n2o fed bioreactors suenaga et al 2019 the rationale of the selection lies in that i both clade i and clade ii n2o reducers were represented each with two strains and that ii these bacteria are confirmed canonical denitrifying bacteria capable of converting no3 to n2 via nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and n2o yoon et al 2016 suenaga et al 2018b the complex

encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthology numbers using ghostkoala v 2 1 kanehisa et al 2000 2016 which were subsequently used for prediction of metabolic potentials of the four organisms to utilize the organic species provided as electron donors 2 3 micro respiration system setup and operation a micro respirometry system for simultaneous monitoring of do and n2o was set up to examine the effect of different organic carbon sources on the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria fig 1 the cell cultures were incubated in a h shaped vial with an effective volume of 10 ml that can accommodate two microelectrodes and a stir bar unisense aarhuis denmark five batch tests were performed per bacterium each with a different carbon source i e acetate succinate glycerol methanol or ethanol at the beginning of each batch test 10 ml cell suspension was pipetted into the h shaped vial to which do and n2o microelectrodes unisense aarhus denmark were inserted leaving no headspace in the vial subsequently 20 μl of concentrated n2o solution 24 mm at 25 c was injected into the vial to achieve an initial n2o concentration of approximately 50 μmol l 1 the carbon and electron source was added as follows acetate 320 μmol l 1 methanol 420 μmol l 1 ethanol 210 μmol l 1 glycerol 180 μmol l 1 or succinate 180 μmol l 1 the organic compounds were added in excess to ensure that n2o reduction activity was not limited by electron donor shortage table s1 the micro respiration system was operated in a water bath maintained at 30 0 2 c to allow for comparison with the previous results performed at the same temperature and stirred at 500 rpm yoon et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 n2o and do measurements were processed using the sensor trace suite software unisense do concentration was monitored alongside n2o concentration as it is a crucial factor affecting n2o consumption activity massara et al 2017 after each batch experiment the cell suspension was fixed by adding 2 glutaraldehyde solution and the cell count was determined using a microscope bz 8100 keyence japan the details of this procedure are described elsewhere lunau et al 2005 all batch tests were conducted in triplicate 2 4 net growth yield measurements the net biomass yields of the bacterial strains on n2o were determined for each carbon substrate as previously described sanford et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 a 120 ml glass serum vial was filled with 50 ml of the minimal salts medium ph 7 5 and the medium was then flushed with 99 99 helium gas for 10 min at 0 1 l min 1 to ensure anaerobic incubation condition each vial was immediately capped with a rubber plug and sealed with an aluminum crimp subsequently 70 ml of mixed gas 5 95 of n2o n2 replaced the helium gas in the vial after sterilization 2 ml of the preculture suspension and 1 ml of carbon source stock solution were injected into the vial the carbon source was added in 25 fold excess of n2o in terms of electron equivalents the cultures were incubated at 30 c with shaking at 120 rpm after the n2o was completely consumed 40 ml of the cell suspension was filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size polyvinylidene fluoride membrane merk millipore burlington ma the membrane was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and then dried in a desiccator until no further decrease in the filter weight was observed the weight of the salts on the membranes was measured after treating the membrane at 500 c for 8 h as previously described by sanford et al 2012 the net growth yields were calculated with the following equation sanford et al 2012 1 y x s m 2 m 1 m 3 m 1 m 2 m 1 m 3 m 1 n n 2 o where yx s is the net growth yield mg biomass mmol n2o 1 m and m are the weights of the membrane filters measured with the fully grown bacterial culture and the initial bacterial culture respectively mg the subscripts 1 2 and 3 denote the pristine membrane mg the membrane with retentate after oven drying 105 c and heat treated 500 c membrane with retentate respectively nn2o is the amount of n2o consumed during the incubation mmol the measurement was performed in triplicate 2 5 biokinetic parameter calculations whole cell kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting do and n2o concentration profiles to the whole cell michaelis menten equation martens habbena et al 2009 as our previous work confirmed that the presence of n2o had no significant effects on biokinetic parameters associated with do zhou et al 2021 the possibility of n2o interference on do biokinetics was not considered 2 v v max s k m s where v is either the consumption rate measurement interval δ being 15 s normalized by the number of cells fmol cell h 1 v max is the maximum consumption rate fmol cell h 1 s is the concentration μmol l 1 and k m is the whole cell half saturation constant μmol l 1 nonlinear regression was performed in origin 9 0 using the least square method the specific affinity as an indicator of effectiveness of n2o consumption at a low concentration range was obtained from the n2o kinetic parameters using eq 3 3 a n 2 o v max n 2 o k m n 2 o 10 9 where a n2o is the specific affinity l cell h 1 v max n2o is the maximum n2o consumption rate fmol cell h 1 and k m n2o is the whole cell half saturation constant for n2o μmol l 1 2 6 recovery of n2o consumption activity after do exposure the initial presence of do in the microrespiration experiments enabled observation of n2o consumption activation or recovery following an oxic to anoxic transition as activated sludge in a wwtp e g a modified ludzak ettinger mle process is constantly subjected to oxic to anoxic transitions and vice versa such transitional behavior has significant implications to n2o dynamics in wwtps pomowski et al 2011 zhou et al 2021 after depletion of initially present do and n2o a cycle of adding 20 µl of 25 mmol l 1 n2o solution followed by monitoring n2o consumption to depletion was repeated until the time series n2o concentration profiles were stabilized the relative n2o consumption activity during the recovery was estimated by eq 4 4 e v n 2 o v max n 2 o where e is the relative n2o consumption activity dimensionless and v n2o is the maximum n2o consumption rate observed during a cycle of n2o consumption in the course of recovery fmol cell h 1 the slope from linear regression of the t vs e plot was defined as the reactivation rate of n2or v nos h 1 serving as a measure of how rapidly n2o consumption is recovered following oxic to anoxic transition under the given condition 2 7 analytical and statistical methods the gaseous n2o concentration measurements for the determination of net growth yields were taken using a gas chromatography system equipped with an electron capture detector as described previously gc 14b shimadzu japan terada et al 2013 in accordance with a previous study suenaga et al 2018b do and n2o concentrations were measured using do and n2o microelectrodes unisense with detection limits below 0 5 μm and a response time shorter than 0 3 s the data analysis was performed with origin 9 0 statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics version 19 0 the p values lower than 0 05 or 0 01 were considered statistically significant in anova tests 3 results 3 1 genotypes of the tested bacteria regarding organic carbon metabolism the genome of azospira sp strain i09 consists of two contigs with 3 77 and 0 397 mbp lengths and the completeness is 100 by busco ver 1 simão et al 2015 the gc content is 64 4 and 3910 cdss were detected interrogation of the genomes of the four examined n2o reducers predicted genomic potentials of these bacteria to utilize various organic electron donors fig 2 all four bacteria possess the genes necessary for metabolizing acetate and succinate to carbon dioxide azospira sp strain i13 lacks the gene encoding nad dependent alcohol dehydrogenase which transforms ethanol to acetaldehyde and thus is essential for utilization of ethanol via the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle the other three strains possess a full suite of functional genes for metabolizing ethanol to co2 the two azospira sp strains lack the genes encoding enzymes that metabolize glycerol while the genomes of pa denitrificans and ps stutzeri harbor the gene necessary for glycerol degradation into dihydroxyacetone phosphate via glycerol 3 phosphate but not via dihydroxyacetone the genes encoding glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase ec 2 3 1 15 and acyl phosphate glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase ec 2 3 1 275 are found in the ps stutzeri genome but only the latter is found in the pa denitrificans genome of the four bacteria only pa denitrificans harbors a functional gene for methanol conversion into formaldehyde ec 1 1 1 244 3 2 growth characteristics of the n2o reducing bacteria the net biomass yields of the bacteria fed different organic substrates as organic electron donors and n2o as the sole electron acceptor evaluated the metabolic efficiency of coupling n2o reduction with oxidation of varying electron donors consistent with the findings from the genome analyses fig 2 azospira sp strains i09 i13 and ps stutzeri did not consume a significant amount of either methanol or n2o fig s1 the biomass yield of azospira sp strain i13 was the highest when fed acetate 5 37 0 48 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 and this value was 2 87 times higher than the yield observed with ethanol as the electron donor fig 3 table 1 acetate generated the largest variance in biomass yields across the organisms the clade ii type azospira strains favored acetate their net biomass yields on acetate 15 45 1 07 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 for azospira sp strain i13 and 11 56 0 62 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 for azospira sp strain i09 were significantly higher than those of pa denitrificans 7 88 0 95 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 and ps stutzeri 9 13 0 53 mg biomass mmol n2o 1 p 0 05 the same trend was obtained with succinate among the glycerol fed cultures ps stutzeri exhibited a significantly higher net growth yield than the other three organisms p 0 05 net yields were statistically indistinct across the four organisms when ethanol was supplied as the electron donor p 0 05 3 3 do and n2o respiration dynamics the choice of organic electron donor significantly affected do and n2o respiration dynamics in the four bacterial strains examined no significant decrease in do and n2o concentrations was observed without external organic carbon addition pa denitrificans data shown in fig s2 indicating that do and n2o consumption was coupled with organic carbon oxidation and that the endogenous decay with n2o was marginal regardless of the supplemented organic matter all four bacterial strains depleted do prior to n2o fig 4 the replicates are shown in figs s3 and s4 the repeated injections of n2o vertical black arrows in fig 4 accelerated n2o consumption the highest n2o consumption rate after each n2o injection differed and depended on the bacteria type and the supplemented organic carbon summarized in section 3 4 for azospira sp strain i09 fed with acetate panel a in fig 4 the maximum n2o consumption rates after the second and third n2o injections obtained from the linear approximation of the experiment data were 143 7 n 3 and 201 18 n 3 of the rate after the first injection respectively 3 4 biokinetic parameters of n2o reducing bacteria biokinetic parameters v max and k m of the tested bacteria were estimated by fitting the do and n2o concentration profiles fig 4 to the whole cell michaelis menten equation eq 2 the v max and k m values of each bacterium were largely dependent on the added carbon source table 1 higher v max do and v max n2o were obtained when acetate and succinate were added compared with the values obtained with ethanol or methanol as the electron donor table 1 figs 5 and 6 azospira sp strain i13 has the largest standard deviation 6 11 fmol cell h 1 among the v max do values determined with five different organic electron donors table 1 for comparison the standard deviations of pa denitrificans and ps stutzeri were 2 66 and 5 06 fmol cell h 1 respectively the highest n2o consumption rates v max n2o were markedly different across the tested bacteria when different carbon sources were injected pa denitrificans exhibited substantially lower v max n2o than the other bacterial strains the v max n2o v max do values for pa denitrificans were 0 05 acetate 0 07 succinate 0 04 glycerol 0 03 ethanol and 0 06 methanol even considering that the number of electrons required to reduce a mole of n2o is half of the number of electrons required for reducing a mole of oxygen these values indicate a preference for oxygen as the electron acceptor table 1 the corresponding v max n2o v max do values for azospira sp strain i13 were 1 41 acetate 1 46 succinate 0 35 glycerol 0 91 ethanol and 0 38 methanol showcasing a preference for n2o as an electron acceptor table 1 the variance of v max n2o values measured with azospira sp strain i13 using different organic carbon species was at least 157 fold higher than that of any other bacterial strain examined despite being phylogenetically closely affiliated with azospira sp strain i13 distinct v max n2o values were obtained from microrespirometry experiments with azospira sp strain i09 with different organic electron donors table 1 interestingly only ps stutzeri exhibited a preference for glycerol as the electron donor this bacterium exhibited 4 41fold higher v max do 13 9 0 70 fmol cell h 1 and 4 17 fold higher v max n2o 2 03 0 11 fmol cell h 1 than the other three bacteria when fed glycerol the whole cell half saturation constants k m and specific affinities a do and a n2o of the tested bacteria also varied substantially depending on the organic carbon source table 1 the minimum and maximum k m do values ranged from 0 84 0 07 μmol l 1 methanol to 10 91 2 81 μmol l 1 glycerol for ps stutzeri clade i nosz and 0 25 0 06 μmol l 1 ethanol to 5 57 0 50 μmol l 1 acetate for azospira sp strain i13 clade ii nosz even with the same carbon source the k m was significantly different across the tested bacteria for acetate addition the k m do ranged from 0 64 0 05 μmol l 1 for azospira sp strain i09 the lowest to 9 55 1 81 μmol l 1 for ps stutzeri the highest the specific affinities for do a do of pa denitrificans were higher than those of the other tested bacteria while those for n2o a n2o were much lower suggesting once again that pa denitrificans favors do over n2o table 1 acetate fed azospira sp strain i13 exhibited the highest a n2o value 8 88 10 9 l cell h 1 which was 19 times higher than the a n2o value of acetate fed pa denitrificans 3 5 recovery of n2o consumption after

activity following the oxic to anoxic transition in the four bacterial strains regardless of the bacterium examined or the electron donor added n2or activity increased linearly with time fig 7 the four bacterial strains exhibited noticeably varied e values table s2 intriguingly the two azospira strains had substantially differing e and v nos values fig 7 with acetate as the electron donor the time required for complete recovery of n2o consumption activity i e e 1 0 was 5 46 h 4 34 h 2 73 h and 1 37 h for pa denitrificans ps stutzeri azospira sp strain i09 and strain i13 respectively table s2 the recovery time differed depending on the supplemented organic carbon source also notable were the consistently high reactivation rates observed under the acetate fed condition in all four bacteria the v nos values measured with acetate as the electron donor were 0 11 0 01 0 23 0 02 0 24 0 01 and 0 35 0 03 h 1 for pa denitrificans ps stutzeri azospira sp strain i09 and strain i13 respectively all significantly higher p 0 05 than the v nos values measured with any other electron donors for the respective bacteria these results also demonstrated that azospira sp strain i13 was the most resilient bacterium against do exposure among the four bacterial strains examined under the acetate feeding scheme fig 7 it should be noted that the n2o reducers invariably exhibited the highest v max n2o and v nos values when fed acetate 4 discussion 4 1 electron donor preference regulates physiological traits of n2o consumption despite the significance of denitrification reducing reactive nitrogen oxides in wastewaters to nitrogen gas one of the challenges lies in the accumulation and emission of a highly potent greenhouse gas n2o to limit n2o emission harnessing n2o reducing bacteria can contribute to n2o mitigation during denitrification in engineered systems suenaga et al 2019 however more exploratory research on novel n2o reducing bacteria and ecophysiological characterizations is required hallin et al 2018 although the operating conditions e g ph do level co existing no2 and temperature that facilitate n2o consumption by these bacteria have been thoroughly investigated pan et al 2012 suenaga et al 2018b wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 2022 their n2o consumption associated with various organic carbon species is poorly understood given the context our hypotheses regarded an organic carbon species as a vital factor in 1 n2o consumption activity in an anoxia environment and 2 n2or recovery after do exposure the physiological assays carried out using a micro respiration system as well as genomic insights indicated that the organic carbon preference of n2o reducing bacteria determines the n2o consumption rates n2o affinity and activity recovery after do exposure verifying the raised hypotheses as shown in figs 5 6 and table 1 the application of a micro respiration system fig 1 illuminated the noticeable differences in their do and n2o respiration biokinetics of clade i and clade ii nosz canonical denitrifying bacteria and the dependencies upon the type of supplemented organic matter table 1 the different do and n2o biokinetics with the different electron donors likely provide significant implications for n2o emissions from denitrification in anoxic tanks of wwtps when external organic carbon source is switched for example from ethanol to methanol baytshtok et al 2009 given that the external organic carbon source determines the microbial community composition and its resultant denitrification performances baytshtok et al 2009 lu et al 2011 2014 carlson et al 2020 our results underscore that the differences in n2o consumption activity of the indigenous microbial consortium harboring n2o reducing bacteria are potentially caused by external organic carbon source which plausibly determines a n2o footprint of a wwtp 4 2 metabolic genotype affects the n2o related biokinetics of azospira sp strain i13 the genotype and phenotype investigation of azospira sp strain i13 elaborated its distinctive and unique n2o consumption performance the biokinetic analysis conducted with a micro respiration system identified the advantage of this strain as a n2o sink when acetate and succinate were supplied fig 6 and table 1 the far lower n2o consumption activities with glycerol ethanol and methanol fig 5 were contextualized by the absence of the key genes enabling their metabolisms fig 2 these trends show why azospira sp strain i13 had the largest variance of v max n2o among the four tested bacteria when fed the five organic carbon sources table 1 the absence of certain genes may force n2o reducing bacteria to utilize alternative pathways to utilize electrons for n2o consumption likely lowering the consumption rates carlson et al 2020 our follow up experiment found that methanol consumption with n2o respiration was not observed for azospira sp strain i13 or ps stutzeri this is because they lack the methanol dehydrogenase gene figs s1 and 2 either endogenous respiration or residual carbon from preculture media led to n2o consumption by bacteria that lack the genes necessary for metabolizing the supplemented organic carbon our result shed light on the significance of electron donor selection and expanded our understanding of n2o reducing bacterial physiology this knowledge can support n2o mitigation in natural and engineered ecosystems the limited substrate range may be the general character of the genus azospira mining of the azospira genomes in the database revealed azospira genotypes that are analogous to that of a oryzae ps which lacks genes essential for glycerol metabolism hitherto no azospira species has been found that harbors a complete set of genes needed for methanol metabolism although such genotypes may not be shared among all azospira species genomic information is indeed limited it is plausible that azospira may not effectively function as an effective n2o sink when fed with alcohol and polyol which are cost effective electron donors ribera guardia et al 2014 table s1 therefore effective strategies to control n2o emissions require further investigation on the physiologies pertinent to specific electron donors 4 3 genomic insights into the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria for suitable external carbon selection our experimental study demonstrated that the biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria are largely dependent on the carbon source figs 5 and 6 the acetate and succinate addition resulted in higher v max do and v max n2o values compared with ethanol and methanol addition figs 5 and 6 these results are consistent with the electron donor preferences of the n2o reducing bacteria ribera guardia et al 2014 that possess the complete set of genes necessary for the corresponding metabolic pathways fig 2 acetate and succinate are immediately metabolized in the tca cycle while ethanol degradation requires nad dependent alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase to consecutively convert ethanol to acetate before entering the tca cycle via acetyl coa adouani et al 2010 methanol degradation requires methanol dehydrogenase utilizing a distinct pathway to fully oxidize it to co2 ribera guardia et al 2014 therefore among the tested bacteria the acetate and succinate additions led to higher do and n2o consumption rates compared with the methanol and ethanol additions table 1 interestingly when glycerol was fed the v max do and v max n2o for ps stutzeri were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of the other n2o reducing bacteria figs 5 and 6 this observation was especially interesting as it is to our knowledge the first report of n2o reduction biokinetics data with glycerol as the electron donor this remarkable capability of ps stutzeri to utilize glycerol as the electron acceptor for n2o reduction is likely because glycerol based denitrification involves acyltransferase converting glycerol 3 phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate fig 2 although ps stuzeri and pa denitrificans possess genes for glycerol metabolism only ps stutzeri harbors the glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase genes for both ec 2 3 1 15 and ec 2 3 1 275 fig 2 which require acyl coa and acyl phosphate as substrates respectively pa denitrificans possesses only the latter enzyme but it may not be able to acquire sufficient acyl phosphate substrate further investigation is necessary to elucidate why ps stutzeri can achieve high do and n2o consumption rates when fed glycerol 4 4 effect of organic carbon source on n2or recovery after do exposure the presence or absence of do drastically alters the n2o respiration capacity of bacteria lu and chandran 2010 suenaga et al 2018b because do exposure can alter gene and protein expressions n2or is reportedly vulnerable to do exposure pomowski et al 2011 a better understanding of n2or activity recovery with different carbon sources is essential for mitigating n2o emissions in wwtps where dynamic changes in redox conditions occur our investigation of n2o activity resilience in n2o reducing bacteria found that the different organic carbon species caused different lag times in the recovery of n2o consumption fig 7 at the same organic carbon source the n2or resilience differed among the tested bacteria when acetate and succinate were applied azospira sp strain i13 showed higher n2o consumption and faster n2or recovery than pa denitrificans and ps stutzeri whereas with glycerol ethanol and methanol the n2or recoveries were markedly impaired table s2 the recovery times are congruent with the presence or absence of the genes for the different carbon metabolisms fig 2 a delayed n2or recovery may boost n2o emissions in the transiently changing redox conditions often found in wwtps in stark contrast p stutzeri displayed relatively consistent n2or resilience regardless of the supplemented carbon source which may alleviate abrupt n2o emissions the contrasting result implies that possessing diverse energy metabolisms genes could be an advantage for mitigating n2o emissions in engineered systems and agricultural croplands jonnasen et al 2021 as the organic carbon constituents are varied more n2o mitigation research is needed to identify and augment highly efficient bacteria amenable to various carbon sources as electron donors in a mle process one of the mostly widely implemented biological nitrogen removal bnr processes activated sludge is recycled from an aeration tank to an anoxic tank our experimental setup mirrors a realistic condition where the redox condition is shifted from aerobic to anoxic conditions as the aerobic activated sludge is recycled to the anoxic tank to which an organic electron donor is added therefore our biokinetic results regarding the retardation of n2or activity recovery after oxygen exposure would prove crucial for enhancing the understanding of n2o dynamics in bnr systems 4 5 carbon sources likely shape different microbial community structures implications according to the whole cell michaelis menten profiles with n2o as an electron acceptor fig s5 azospira sp strain i13 could dominate in a denitrifying reactor fed with acetate and succinate whereas the others tested bacteria with glycerol ethanol and methanol the distinct n2o biokinetic data suggest that a carbon source likely shapes different predominant species as a n2o reducer microbial community compositions receiving different carbon sources e g methanol or acetate have been reported lu et al 2014 song et al 2015 carlson et al 2020 and have shown the predominance of different genera as denitrifiers baytshtok et al 2009 osaka et al 2006 ma et al 2015 acetate fed biomass reportedly emits less n2o than methanol fed biomass song et al 2015 as shown in the current study given the unique metabolic genotypes and phenotypes of each n2o reducing bacterium a microbial community will have a distinct n2o consumption activity this notion is supported by previous work in which an acetate fed biomass consisting of rubrivivax and dechloromonas n2o reducers exhibited greater n2o consumption than a methanol fed biomass that mainly consisted of methylotenera song et al 2015 this is likely because from the biokinetic point of view highly efficient n2o reducing bacteria e g dechloromonas and azospira can be dominant in a biomass song et al 2014 suenaga et al 2019 kim et al 2020 further studies should investigate the link between the organic carbon source and the n2o emission in wastewater bioreactors given the efficiency and cost effectiveness of nitrogen removal in wwtps it is imperative to select an appropriate carbon source for n2o reduction ribera guardia et al 2014 song et al 2015 it is perceived that a growth yield is a measure of the effectiveness of energy transfer from catabolism to anabolism russel and cook 1995 the high net growth yield found for the azospira spp is in keeping with the high metabolic efficiency of azospira when fed acetate and succinate by contrast this trend was not observed with glycerol and ethanol fig 3 from a practical point of view acetate may not be a suitable external organic electron donor for denitrification because it costs seven times more than methanol mokhayeri et al 2009 glycerol is a good alternate due to its relatively higher n2o reduction efficiency and lower cost when crude glycerol is used than the other carbon sources song et al 2015 table s1 when glycerol was applied ps stutzeri exhibited the highest v max do and v max n2o which were nearly one order of magnitude higher than those of the other tested bacteria figs 5 and 6 the v nos of ps stutzeri with glycerol addition was also high indicating its fast recovery of n2o consumption activity when transitioning from aerobic to anoxic conditions table s2 based on this short recovery time biomass harboring ps stutzeri in a biological nitrogen removal system would rapidly adapt to glycerol when applied as an alternative carbon source however not all strains of ps stutzeri necessarily possess the complete gene set for glycerol metabolism and more research is needed to clarify this additionally further studies are required to verify a suitable external organic carbon source that is inexpensive and will result in a high n2o consumption rate in wwtps 5 conclusion this study systematically compared the n2o consumption and n2or recovery of four n2o reducing bacteria harboring either clade i or clade ii nosz when fed five different carbon sources the conclusions are as follows organic carbon source remarkably affected the performance biokinetics and biomass yield of heterotrophic n2o reducing bacteria when n2o served as the sole electron acceptor of the tested carbon sources acetate and succinate resulted in the highest do and n2o consumption rates and clade ii type azospira sp strain i13 had a higher consumption rate than clade i type ps stuzeri and pa denitrificans the n2or resilience after transitioning from aerobic to anoxic conditions heavily depended on the type of n2o reducing bacteria and the supplemented carbon source when acetate and succinate were added the clade ii nosz bacteria had higher biomass yields than the clade i nosz bacteria collectively the performances and biokinetics of n2o reducing bacteria are closely associated with their physiological traits and the metabolic potential of the electron donor identifying highly efficient n2o reducers and supplementing them with their preferable organic carbon source would improve n2o mitigation in wwtps credit authorship contribution statement chuang qi investigation data curation writing review editing software yiwen zhou investigation data curation

16429,in this study we report the use of nanobubbles nbs as a simple and facile approach to effectively delay scaling in membrane distillation md during the treatment of highly saline feed 100 g l 1 unlike conventional gas bubbling in md for improving the hydrodynamic flow conditions in the feed channel here we generated air nbs with an average size of 128 81 nm in the feed stream and examined their impact on membrane scaling inhibition during md operation due to their small size neutral buoyancy and negative surface charge nbs remain in suspension for a longer time 14 days providing homogenous mixing throughout the entire feed water the md performance results revealed that severe membrane scaling happened during the dcmd treatment of high salinity brine in the absence of nanobubbles which dramatically reduced the distillate flux to zero after 13 h a one time addition of air nbs in the saline feed significantly reduced salt precipitation and crystal deposition on the pvdf membrane surface delayed the occurrence of flux decline prevented membrane wetting thereby prolonging the effective md operating time with similar feed concentration and operating conditions only 63 flux decline after 98 h operation was recorded in nanobubble assisted md two key explanations were suggested for the delayed membrane scaling upon addition of air nbs in the md feed 1 nb induced turbulent flow in the feed channel that increases the surface shear forces at the membrane surface alleviating both temperature and concentration polarization effect 2 electrostatic attractions of the counterions to the negatively charged nbs which reduces the availability of these ions in the bulk feed for scale formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation nanobubbles scaling brine treatment hydrodynamic disturbance charge 1 introduction rapid urbanization unprecedented population growth and the increasing rate and magnitude of climate change have triggered severe freshwater crises particularly in coastal and inland regions deshmukh et al 2018 thermally driven desalination technologies capable of treating high salinity waters using low grade heat sources such as waste solar and geothermal heat are vital in using the water energy nexus to address these crises deshmukh et al 2018 membrane distillation md a membrane thermal hybrid process has emerged as the treatment method of choice for desalinating high salinity waters such as sea and brackish water saline wastewaters and brines drioli et al 2015 kharraz et al 2020 pangarkar et al 2016 md possesses notable advantages over conventional thermal distillation and membrane separation processes namely 1 its relative insensitivity to feed salinity 2 its lack of specialized high pressure requirements unlike reverse osmosis 3 its potential for 100 rejection of ions and macromolecules and 4 its relatively low operation temperature requirement increasing the feasibility of using renewable heating sources as the thermal driving force alkhudhiri et al 2012 deshmukh et al 2018 ullah et al 2018 however despite its many advantages large scale practical applications of md for treating high salinity water remain limited a major bottleneck in their widespread adoption is the inevitable scaling i e inorganic fouling of the md membranes due to the precipitation of sparsely soluble salts present in the feed stream horseman et al 2021 rezaei et al 2020 tijing et al 2015 scaling in md is particularly crucial as this phenomenon increases heat and mass transfer resistance escalates membrane wetting and aggravates temperature and concentration polarization at the membrane surface all of which deteriorate overall md performance horseman et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 various techniques such as feed water pretreatment e g filtration coagulation antiscalant use chemical cleaning e g use of acids or bases and membrane surface modification e g altering the surface roughness hydrophobicity and surface charges have been developed to control scaling in md deka et al 2019 gryta 2008a kamranvand et al 2020 kharraz et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 however these techniques prevent scaling only to a certain extent and their use entails other environmental economic and operational concerns for instance most antiscalant chemicals are organics and may reduce the surface tension of the water thereby promoting membrane wetting he et al 2009 in addition some antiscalant chemicals e g polyacrylate based antiscalants when added to the feed serve as a nutritional source for bacteria and thus promote biofouling on the membrane surface he et al 2009 sweity et al 2013 furthermore the use of these chemicals can be an environmental concern because most antiscalants do not readily degrade in natural environments moreover studies have reported contradictory results regarding superhydrophobic and omniphobic surface modification effects on anti scaling performance liu et al 2021 hydrophobic surfaces are also known to preferentially adsorb organic compounds present in natural feed water which may modify the membrane surface and thus facilitate scaling and membrane wetting eykens et al 2017 servi et al 2016 finally pretreatment and md process parameter optimization which incur additional costs have failed to eliminate scaling in md ultimately considering the severity of scaling in md and the limitations of current technologies in addressing this problem it is essential to seek a chemical free approach that effectively prevents scaling and avoids environmental or operational damage one practical physical approach to prevent scaling in md during the treatment of high salinity water is to create better fluid dynamics and increase the surface shear rate near the membrane surface conventionally flow turbulence in the feed channel is stimulated by either increasing the feed flow velocity or using spacers however chen et al 2013 found that the use of spacers eventually leads to more scaling than in a configuration without spacers because spacers facilitate the local trapping of salts close to the membrane surface another practical approach to increase shear stress near the membrane surface for membrane scaling control is the introduction of a gas liquid two phase flow via gas bubbling chen et al 2013 ding et al 2011 ye et al 2019 various studies have reported that bubbling induced secondary flows significantly increase the maximum shear stress near the membrane surface thus hindering local scale formation chen et al 2013 cui et al 2003 ye et al 2019 furthermore when correctly used bubble technology carries no risk of membrane damage and causes no harm to the environment studies have shown that the efficacy of bubble technology for fouling control in membrane based systems is mainly dependent on the size and distribution of the produced bubbles with uniformly distributed fine bubbles being more efficient in delaying membrane fouling than coarse bubbles under similar operation conditions chen et al 2014 cui et al 2003 the use of nanobubbles nbs tiny bubbles with a diameter of 200 nm is an alternative to the conventional bubbling technique with great potential for scaling control in md nbs are incredibly small 500 times smaller than a microbubble and stable cavities of gas in liquid and have unique physical characteristics such as a large interfacial area low or neutral buoyancy long residence time negative surface charge and high internal pressure agarwal et al 2011 lugli et al 2005 compared with macro and micro bubbles the neutral buoyancy and negative surface charge of nbs allow them to remain in the feed stream for relatively more extended periods bui et al 2019 ushikubo et al 2010 for instance microbubbles tend to gradually decrease in size and eventually collapse due to long stagnation and the dissolution of interior gases into the surrounding water whereas nbs persist for months lugli et al 2005 ushikubo et al 2010 moreover given their strong negative charge nbs repel each other and thus thoroughly saturate the feed bui et al 2019 the use of extremely small and uniformly distributed nbs in the md feed stream is anticipated to increase the surface shear forces at the membrane surface significantly these shear forces will disturb the boundary layer and reduce the chances of concentration polarization and scaling layer formation on the membrane surface moreover the strong negative charge of nbs in the saline feed will effectively reduce salt precipitation possibly by attracting counterions to the gas water interface in this study we investigated the influence of nb aeration as a chemical free scale inhibition technique for the md treatment of high salinity brine during md operation nanosized air bubbles were added to the feed stream and their effects on mass transfer solute rejection and membrane wetting were systematically examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals a commercially available polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 22 μm gvhp durapore was purchased from merck millipore ltd usa and used as a standard hydrophobic md membrane hereafter referred to as c pvdf in each md test the membranes were used as obtained without any modifications sodium chloride nacl magnesium sulfate mgso4 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o were used to prepare synthetic high salinity feed solutions in either pristine or nb deionized di water nahco3 and cacl2 2h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich corporation and mgso4 and nacl were purchased from dieckmann hong kong chemical industry co ltd phenolphthalein was purchased from sigma aldrich corporation and used as an indicator during samples titration for the calculation of dissolved co2 concentrations di water with a resistivity of 18 3 mω was produced using a milli q water purification system merck millipore and used in all experiments all salts used were of acs reagent grade and were used as received 2 2 nanobubble generation and characterization nbs of natural air were generated for 15 min in 50 l acrylic tanks containing 20 l di water using an nb generator aqua 075mo aquapro solutions pte ltd singapore the pressure of the nb generator internal pump was controlled between 3 8 and 4 0 bar following the nb operation the water in the tank was left undisturbed for 15 min the physiochemical characteristics of nbs namely size i e diameter distribution concentration decay time and zeta potential zp in di water were characterized based on light scattering methods using nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanosight lm10 and nanosight ns300 systems malvern panalytical ltd uk and dynamic light scattering dls zen3600 zetasizer nanozs malvern instruments the nta s nanosight lm10 was used to measure the size and concentration of nbs over 30 min to 14 days while the nanosight ns300 was used to measure the concentration of nbs over a temperature range of 20 50 c the systems utilize the properties of both light scattering and brownian motion to obtain the size distribution and concentration measurement of particles in liquid suspension a laser beam blue laser with wave length λ 405 nm is passed through the sample chamber and the nbs in suspension in the path of this beam scatter light in such a manner that they are easily visualized via a 20x magnification microscope onto which is mounted a high speed camera the camera operates at 30 frames per second fps capturing a video file of the particles moving under brownian motion the software tracks many particles individually and calculates their hydrodynamic diameters using the stokes einstein equation malvern panalytical ltd 2021 after nbs generation and resting for 15 min as described above six samples each containing 50 ml of bubbled water were collected from the tank at different time intervals t0 initial t1 30 min t2 1 h t3 6 h t4 24 h t5 7 days and t6 14 days and the characteristics of the nbs in the samples were analyzed with three replicate measurements for each sample di water sampled before nb generation was used as the baseline standard the effect of temperature variation on the concentration of nbs was also measured in these temperature dependence tests the camera was operated at 25 fps with level 10 gain 73 and viscosity for water at 25 c 0 9 cp 1 ml of the nbs water was placed inside the testing chamber the measuring temperature was automatically controlled at an accuracy of 0 2 c by setting the desired value in the instrument s software before starting each test the same sample was used during the testing temperature range 20 50 c and was first stabilized at room temperature afterward the temperature was set to 20 c to perform the first measurement followed by increasing the temperature by steps of 10 c for the remaining tests after the instrument reached the set temperature for each test the sample was given 3 min to stabilize and reach thermal equilibrium before the test started the dls s zetasizer nanozs was used to measure the size and size distribution of nbs over a temperature range of 20 70 c the instrument uses non invasive back scatter technology and has a detection range for diameters between 0 3 nm and 10 µm the scattering angle was set to 173 while the dispersant s di water and material s air nbs refractive index ri was set to 1 33 and 1 0 respectively precautions were taken during the preparation and handling of samples to ensure no bubbles were formed during sample filling 1 ml of the nbs water was filled in a disposable glass sizing cuvette and placed inside the testing chamber the measuring temperature was automatically controlled at an accuracy of 0 3 c by setting the desired value in the instrument s software before starting each test the same sample was used during the testing temperature range 20 70 c and was first stabilized at room temperature for 15 min afterward the temperature was reduced to 20 c to perform the first measurement followed by increasing the temperature by steps of 10 c for the remaining tests after the instrument reached the set temperature for each test the sample was given 10 15 min to stabilize before the test started three replicate measurements were performed for each test with at least 13 runs each and the mean value was reported electrophoretic light scattering technology was used to measure the zp of nbs water over a temperature range of 20 70 c using the same zetasizer nanozs described above an electric field is applied to the nbs dispersion leading the nbs to move the velocity of the nbs is related to their zp which is measured using the laser interferometric technique phase analysis light scattering m3 pals technology this enables the calculation of electrophoretic mobility which is used to calculate the zeta potential based on the smoluchowski equation 1 ml of the nbs water was filled in a disposable folded capillary cell using the manufacturer suggested procedure to ensure no air bubbles form in the cell the same value and method for the refractive index and temperature control were applied respectively as mentioned in the size measurement section above three replicate measurements were performed for each test and the mean value was reported for both size and zp and before the analysis of nbs a transfer standard of latex nanospheres aqueous suspension was used to verify the correct operation of the zetasizer nanozs instrument the ph and conductivity of the di water and nbs water were measured at room temperature using pre calibrated ph and conductivity sensors connected to a digital meter multi 3420 wtw gmbh germany the concentration of dissolved co2 in two water samples a control di water and nbs di water was measured by a titration reaction briefly 10 ml of each sample was placed in a conical flask and 2 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator 0 25 solution in 60 ethyl alcohol were added after which the samples remained colorless indicating to be acidic with the possible presence of free co2 this was followed by titrating the samples with 0 05 n naoh solution until a pink color appeared indicating the reaction s completion this is due to the reaction of co2 with naoh forming sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and turning the sample to become basic at around ph 8 3 at this completion point based on the sample volume and normality and volume of naoh used the concentration of co2 was calculated 2 3 membrane characterization the surface morphology of both pristine and fouled membrane samples was evaluated using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem quanta feg 450 fei sem samples were initially gold coated for 120 s btt iv denton vacuum llc moorestown nj us elemental analysis of post md membranes i e scaled samples was performed via energy dispersive spectroscopy eds to identify the salt deposits the water contact angle wca of the pristine and post md membranes was measured using a drop shape analyzer dsa25 kruss germany and the double sessile drop measurement method with a 1 µl water droplet at least two samples with five readings each were measured for each membrane the membrane surface s zeta potential zp was measured according to the streaming current technique by using a streaming potential analyzer surpass anton paar austria equipped with an adjustable gap cell the bubble point bp i e maximum pore size mean flow pore size mps minimum pore size and average pore size distribution psd were measured using a gas liquid displacement porometer porolux 1000 porometer belgium and the wet dry curve procedure the membrane samples were pre wetted using porefill 16 mn m surface tension and placed in the porometer chamber where precise step wise n2 gas pressure was applied the same porometer was operated under the hydro head mode to measure all samples water liquid entry pressure lep lep was recorded as the point at which a pressure increase was automatically detected corresponding to the wetting of the largest pore through the water passage the porosity of the membranes was measured as the difference between the dry and wetted sample weights eq 1 using a gravimetric method with butanol 0 81 g ml as the wetting liquid 1 ε w w e t w d r y ρ b u t a n o l v s where w w e t and w d r y are the wet and dry sample weights respectively ρ b u t a n o l is the density of butanol and vs is the sample volume a precision micrometer was used to measure the sample thickness the zeta potential of the membrane was measured using the same zetasizer nanozs instrument with an additional accessory i e the surface zeta potential measurement cell that enables the measurement of the zp of surfaces approximately 1 1 cm membrane sample was attached to the cell at the designated sample plate and submerged in a medium containing tracer particle negatively charged the surface zp of the membrane is then determined by detecting the movement of tracer particles dispersed in the electrolyte in which the sample is immersed an electric field is applied via the cell electrodes leading to a subsequent motion of tracer particle due to a combination of electrophoresis and electro osmosis such movement is measured as a function of displacement away from the surface the surface zp is then calculated through a model that describes the electro osmosis flow contribution from the sample surface 2 4 nanobubble membrane distillation setup and experiments a lab scale direct contact dc md setup was used to evaluate the md performance of all membranes fig 1 the setup consists of a 10 6 4 cm membrane module designed for an active flat sheet membrane area of 6 2 1 5 cm whose opposite sides are connected to two pumps circulating the feed and the permeate between the membrane module and the feed permeate containers respectively the flowrates of the feed and the permeate were controlled using flowmeters connected beside the pumps the temperature of the permeate and feed was controlled using a chiller maintained at 20 c and a hot plate maintained at 60 c this temperature difference of 40 c between the two sides of the membrane drives the vapor through the hydrophobic membrane following which the vapor condenses on the permeate side changes in permeate weight used to calculate the vapor flux and conductivity used to calculate the salt rejection sr are automatically recorded by a precision balance and a conductivity probe respectively the same md experimental setup was used to investigate the scale inhibition performance of nb assisted md in treating high salinity water with the only difference being the presence of nbs in the feed water briefly in the nb assisted md test nbs of natural air was first generated in a tank containing 20 l di water for 15 min at a pressure of 4 bar next 3 l bubbled di water was collected from the tank salts were added in the concentrations indicated in table 1 to prepare a synthetic high salinity feed solution hereafter referred to as hs 100 as the test feed fig 1 three sets of dcmd experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the c pvdf membrane the first set was designed to assess the effect of introducing only nbs on md two feeds were prepared in di water with and without nbs the second set was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of nbs in reducing membrane scaling propensity two feeds were prepared for this set namely hs 100 in di water and hs 100 in nb di water in this second test the experiment ran in a continuous mode without feed replenishment the third set was performed to assess the benefits of nbs in long term dcmd by using the hs 100 in nb di water as the test feed in this third test the experiment ran in a batch mode where the feed was replenished with di water whenever 100 ml permeate was collected to keep the variation in feed concentration within 5 di water was used at the permeate side in all md experiments and the feed and permeate flowrates were maintained at 500 ml min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanobubble water generation and characterization immediately after the nanobubble generator started the di water inside the tank turned into a milky appearance this is due to the presence of a large number of micron sized bubbles which leaves the tank over a few minutes seconds due to bursting either after rising to the surface due to their buoyancy or coalescing in the water solution atkinson et al 2019 this was confirmed when the generator was stopped following 15 min of operation the milky color disappears within a few minutes and becomes clear as the larger micron sized bubbles burst out of the solution leaving behind nanobubbles because the generated nbs were too small to be visible to the naked eye and even under a standard microscope given their transparent nature their presence in water was first visualized by the backscattering of light from a green laser pointer as shown in fig 2 a the green laser beam was invisible in the beaker containing the control ultrapure di water without nbs in contrast it was visible in the beaker containing nb water note that the internal pump pressure of the nb generator showed an inverse relationship with bubble size we optimized the generator pressure to 3 8 4 bar in the tests mentioned above to obtain small uniformly distributed nbs it is well established in the literature that nbs once generated in the aqueous environment remain highly stable for prolonged periods meegoda et al 2018 nirmalkar et al 2018a ushikubo et al 2010 to verify this we further analyzed and quantified the fundamental characteristics of nbs particularly their average bubble size concentration and stability over 14 days by using nanosight lm 10hs see section 2 2 for details to observe changes in bubble size and concentration over time the results showed that nbs generated with air in ultrapure di water for 15 min yielded millions of nbs per ml with each bubble measuring less than 150 nm in diameter fig 2b and c specifically the average bubble concentration was found to be approximately 7 8 107 bubbles ml 1 with bubble diameters distributed in the narrow range of 100 150 nm the size of the bubbles remained nearly unchanged over the 14 days with an average bubble size of 142 81 nm on day 14 almost the same as that on day 1 128 81 nm fig 2b similarly the concentration of the nbs did not vary significantly as only a 15 decrease in nb concentration was observed after 14 days fig 2c the observed longevity of nbs in water as evident from their consistent size and concentration for prolonged periods can be attributed to the unique characteristics directly related to their nanoscale size namely their high internal pressure minimal buoyancy and strong electric charge meegoda et al 2018 nirmalkar et al 2018a unlike macro or micro bubbles which quickly rise to and burst on the surface the minimal buoyancy of nbs prevents them from reaching the surface instead they move around randomly following the principles of brownian motion the net effect is that nbs remain suspended in water for extended periods moving randomly throughout the water suspension additionally the electric charge on the nbs also plays an essential role in their stability nirmalkar et al 2018a ushikubo et al 2010 it is well reported in the literature that air nbs formed in ultrapure water exhibit a high absolute negative zp which is attributed to the predominance of oh ions in the first molecular layers of water at the gas liquid interface bui et al 2019 takahashi 2005 we have measured the zeta potential of our nbs water as described in the methods section and our results are in line with the reported literature showing a zp value of 15 9 2 7 mv at room temperature i e 23 c and ph of 6 8 the strong negative charge on the liquid gas interface of nbs increases the degree of electrostatic repulsion between individual bubbles thus keeping them evenly distributed in the water for longer without coalescence temperature is an essential parameter in all fields of natural science and has prominent effects on the physical and chemical properties of many materials and media and can affect their stability the size and stability of macro sized bubbles are also affected by the variation in temperatures due to a decreased gas solubility at higher temperatures however we expect a different behavior for nbs as they are fundamentally different and show high stability due to their unique characteristics as explained above therefore we have also tested the effect of temperature on physiochemical properties of the generated nbs water fig 3 nbs were first generated at room temperature and left for 15 min after which a 1 ml sample was filled in a glass cell and placed in the sample chamber of either zetasizer nanozs or nanosight lm10 instrument the temperature was reduced to 20 c and left to stabilize for 10 15 min before starting the first test this was followed by testing the size via increasing the temperature to 70 c and the concentration via increasing the temperature to 50 c fig 3a and fig 3b show the intensity weighted size distribution and average bubble diameter at a temperature range of 20 c 70 c respectively the nbs shows a relatively broad size range at low temperatures and become narrower with temperature increase at lower temperatures i e 20 c and 30 c b a wider range with two peaks could be seen a move towards a single peak with narrower distribution is noticed at higher temperatures confirming that nbs are temperature sensitive fig 3a measurement of nbs size i e diameter further confirms a larger nbs size at lower temperatures 154 93 23 13 nm at 20 c with a decreasing trend where the size shrinks to a minimum of 92 93 13 12 nm at 40 c the same temperature at which the narrowest size distribution was observed however fig 3b shows that nbs size increases slowly at temperatures higher than 40 c up to a maximum nbs diameter of 117 92 4 23 nm at 70 c these observations suggest a transition temperature at around 40 c where the nbs size shrinks to a minimum upon heating from lower temperatures and steadily expands again upon heating beyond such a transition temperature to understand such observations we first studied the effect of temperature on the concentration of nbs fig 3c shows that within the temperature range tested the concentration of nbs showed a decreasing trend when temperature increased from 20 to 50 c the rate of nbs concentration decline however was slowing down as the temperature increases at which the highest decrease in nbs concentration was observed when the temperature increased from 20 c to 30 c but slowed after when the temperature increased further up to 40 c and 50 c respectively such a behavior could be due to the coalescence of larger size bubbles as the temperature increases followed by their buoyancy and subsequent burst at the surface in this case the reminder of nbs is smaller in size and less in concentration which is in line with the measured size in the range of 20 c 40 c fig 3b however this does not explain the increase in nbs size associated with the decline in their concentration when the temperature further increased to 50 c additionally our results on the effect of temperature on nbs concentration are contradictory to some of the reported data in literature in which a measurement of nbs concentration as a function of temperature in the range of 20 70 c revealed no change of concentration as a function of temperature and thus concluded that nbs once generated remain stable in the thermal interval tested 20 70 c li et al 2021 these differences could be attributed to some limitations of the used nanosight ns300 instrument compared to the zetasizer nanozs for instance the size range for the zetasizer used to measure the size in fig 3b 0 3 nm 10 µm is broader than the size range of the nanosight ns300 used to measure the concentration in fig 3c 10 nm 1 µm moreover the concentration range for nanosight ns300 is limited to 106 109 particles ml compared to the zetasizer nanozs which can measure concentrated samples without dilution however despite such limitations it should be noted that although the general trend was a decrease in nbs concentration when the temperature increased fig 3c the quantitative measurement of nbs concentration still confirms very high numbers of nbs when the temperature increased up to a maximum of 50 c the concentration of nbs was around 3 107 nbs ml a very high concentration that can still contribute to the reduced scaling in md as will be discussed in the later sections here and considering such high concentrations of nbs limitations of the used instrument and reported literature we conclude that the generated nbs are deemed to be stable not only over long periods fig 2b and 2c but also at different temperature changes fig 3c yet as mentioned above the decline in nbs concentration with temperature does not explain the trend in nbs size two temperature ranges have been identified 20 40 c and 40 70 c being inversely proportional and directly proportional respectively considering the effect of temperature on nbs size and the observed transition trend at around 40 c fig 3b this suggests that at different temperatures the nbs either shrink or expand and obtain a new stable equilibrium our observations align with the literature and in a recent study on the stability of bulk nbs over a wide range of temperatures li et al 2021 obtained a similar trend at varying temperatures their measurements defined two regimes of size temperature behavior a strongly temperature sensitive regime 10 45 c where the nbs size shrinks and reaches a minimum and a weakly temperature sensitive regime 45 70 c where the nbs size weakly grow upon testing the variation in nbs size from 10 to 70 c and 70 10 c they found a fully reversible thermodynamic response in this range and concluded stability of nbs they suggested a correlation between the nbs stability and their negative surface charge other recent studies have also suggested that the stability of bulk nbs was due to the selective adsorption of negative electrical charges at the gas liquid interface of nbs in which bubbles coalescence and diffusion of gas into the bulk liquid are prevented due to the same charged surface nirmalkar et al 2018b tan et al 2020 thus to test and confirm the negative charge of the nbs interface we further tested the zeta potential of our nb water via the zetasizer nanozs instrument at the same temperature range used to test the bubble size as expected nb water showed a negative charge with negative zeta potential values throughout the tested temperature range fig 3d at around 15 2 3 92 mv at 20 c the nbs showed increased negativity with increasing the temperature up to 40 c after which the zp value remained almost constant with further temperature increase up to 70 c the similarities in a transition temperature i e around 40 c for the nbs size and zp show a correlation and confirm the suggestion that the stability of nbs is due to their interface negative charge between 20 and 40 c an increase in the negativity of zp was associated with a decrease in average nbs size whereas between 40 and 70 c an opposite trend was observed i e a slight increase in zp negativity was associated with a slight increase in average nbs size here the stability of nbs is due to their negative charge at the gas liquid interface which is a result of the net amount of hydroxide ions oh this net amount of oh results from both adsorbed and desorbed oh ions via two competing and temperature dependent contributors that result in charge stabilization li et al 2021 higher temperatures promote adsorption of oh ions due to increased activity of self ionization of water while at the same time promoting desorption of oh ions as a result of decreased ions mobility the sum of these two competing contributors presents the equilibrium oh concentration responsible for the negative zp i e charge at the liquid gas interface at temperatures lower than 40 c self ionization of water is slow and the net oh is decided by the relatively more dominant oh desorption due to ions mobility however a significant increase happens for water s self ionization at temperatures higher than 40 c resulting in higher adsorption of oh ions and reaching an equilibrium between the two i e adsorption and desorption thus showing a relatively stable zp above 40 c fig 3d and reaching a new stable equilibrium size li et al 2021 3 2 membrane characterization because standard hydrophobic membranes structural and surface properties are fundamental to their performance in md we next examined the intrinsic properties of the pristine c pvdf membrane used in the study the detailed characteristics of this membrane are presented in table 2 briefly the c pvdf membrane showed an average pore diameter of 0 22 0 02 µm with a narrow psd range of 0 14 0 01 to 0 41 0 03 μm the surface porosity of the membrane measured by the gravimetric method was 65 2 1 52 the wca 123 1 0 9 and lep 1 88 0 11 bar of the c pvdf membrane indicated that the membrane has sufficient hydrophobicity to prevent liquid water transport through it during md operation the electric charge on the membrane as characterized by the negative zp at neutral ph zp 39 0 15 mv revealed that the membrane possesses a strong negatively charged surface which can be attributed to the electronegative charge of the cf moiety in the pvdf polymer guo et al 2018 similar findings of strong negative charge with negative zp for the commercial pvdf membranes are reported in the literature boo et al 2016 chen et al 2017 han et al 2011 3 3 effect of nanobubbles in deionized water feed on membrane distillation the first set of experiments was designed to test the effect of introducing nbs to the feed and how the membrane behaves in dcmd without any salt which was realized by using di water as the feed either with or without nbs such a preliminary test was conducted to eliminate the effect of membrane scaling in the experiment involving nbs in the feed fig 4 shows the dcmd performance in terms of permeate flux and permeate conductivity over a 3 5 h period the results showed that the c pvdf membrane did not exhibit any reduction in permeate flux regardless of whether nbs were present in the di water feed which was expected given the absence of any foulants or scalants in the feed however when tested with the feed containing nbs the c pvdf membrane showed slightly higher 7 6 permeate flux than that in the feed without nbs this higher flux although not significant could be attributable to the hydrodynamic disturbance in the boundary layer when nbs are present in the feed nbs near the membrane surface can induce turbulence and disturb the boundary layer leading to improved heat transfer transport efficiency and thus mitigation of temperature and concentration polarization effects khayet and matsuura 2011 the reduction in temperature polarization tp enhances the cross membrane temperature difference δt resulting in increased vapor flux however it should be pointed out that a reduction in tp and the subsequent enhancement of cross membrane δt can also lead to an increased heat loss by conduction resulting in a slight decline in flux yet this decline in flux due to increased heat loss by conduction is expected to be minimal given its weak effect relative to the more dominant heat transfer through the feed boundary layer which is maximized in our nbs enhanced operation as a result of reduced tp khayet and matsuura 2011 another factor potentially contributing to the increase in flux could be a reduced heat of vaporization of water containing nbs when nbs are generated in the di water feed part of the intermolecular forces that hold the molecules together are broken reducing the heat of vaporization this weakening of intermolecular forces increases the surface area of the free water molecules which means that at the same feed temperature the vaporization rate increases increasing the flux additionally one would also consider the possibility of reduced flux in the presence of non condensable gases due to a decrease in partial vapor pressure as will be explained later in the scaling inhibition mechanism section 3 6 a simple experiment and calculation revealed that the concentration of dissolved co2 in the nb di water feed is comparable to that of the control di water feed and introducing air nbs does not result in considerable changes in the partial vapor pressure that would result in dominant flux reduction overall while it is difficult to quantify the contribution of each of these factors i e hydrodynamic disturbance in the boundary layer alleviating tp and cp increased heat loss by conduction reduced heat of vaporization presence of non condensable gases on flux it is concluded from the obtained higher flux that the factors enhancing the flux due to the addition of air nbs into the feed have a more dominant effect than the factors possibly decreasing the flux and determining the contribution of each mechanism is complex and requires further investigation in both tests permeate conductivity decreased from an initial value of approximately 3 75 µs cm to 3 57 and 3 20 µs cm for the feeds without and with nbs respectively this reduction is due to the continuous dilution of the permeate by the collected pure water permeate here we also tested the effect of introducing air nbs on the conductivity and ph of the feed two feed samples di water and nb di water were analyzed for their ph and conductivity and the measurements showed that upon generating air nbs in di water for 15 min both the conductivity and ph remained almost unchanged in particular di water and nb di water samples had conductivity values of 4 21 0 32 and 4 15 0 28 µs cm and ph values of 6 83 0 14 and 6 71 0 21 respectively 3 4 effect of nanobubbles in high salinity feed on scaling inhibition in md in this set of experiments the effect of nbs on membrane scaling during dcmd was evaluated using a high salinity feed i e hs 100 mimicking ro brine and other hypersaline wastewaters the feed was prepared by dissolving a mixture of salts i e nacl mgso4 nahco3 and cacl2 2h2o in di water to a final concentration of 100 g l these salts are usually present in ro brines and other industrial wastewater streams and may lead to severe scaling in md yin et al 2020 the final ion composition of hs 100 is presented in table 1 the results of the two dcmd experiments with the c pvdf membrane are presented in fig 5 the two experiments were conducted under the same conditions but using different feeds hs 100 in di water and hs 100 in nb di water table 3 summarizes the flux trends in the two tests at different points in time fig 5 shows a dramatic decline in the c pvdf flux in the absence of nbs i e in the hs 100 feed this decline can be attributed to the combined effect of concentration polarization and severe membrane scaling arising from the precipitation of salts on the membrane surface followed by crystal growth christie et al 2020 the salt crystals precipitation and growth block the membrane pores diminishing the porous area available for vapor transport and creating additional mass and heat transfer resistance gryta 2008b rezaei et al 2020 consequently the membrane flux eventually fell from its initial value of 18 8 l m 2 h 1 to zero i e 100 reduction after 13 h of md operation yielding an average fouling rate i e percentage of flux decline per hour of 7 69 h 1 for the first 13 h of operation the membrane did not show signs of wetting apart from the slight reduction in permeate conductivity due to the pure water permeate however after 13 h the permeate conductivity rapidly increased indicating membrane wetting gryta 2005 demonstrated that scalant deposition on the membrane surface is one of the major reasons for membrane wetting yin et al 2020 tested membranes with different wettability in dcmd using high salinity feeds and reported that the wetting of pvdf membranes was associated with gypsum scaling additionally the increase in permeate conductivity after 13 h was associated with a slight rise in flux 1 8 l m 2 h 1 which can be attributed to the passage of the liquid feed thus confirming the wetting of the c pvdf membrane not to be mistaken with pure water vapor flux the addition of nbs to the hs 100 feed substantially hindered the flux reduction fig 5 allowing the c pvdf membrane to be operated for a remarkably prolonged period in contrast to the dcmd test with hs 100 in di water as the feed in which the c pvdf membrane flux reduced to zero after 13 h introducing nbs to the feed resulted in a high membrane flux of 14 5 l m 2 h 1 a reduction of only 24 from its initial value 19 2 l m 2 h 1 with an average fouling rate of 1 88 the decrease in the flux of the c pvdf membrane in both experiments with hs 100 in di water and hs 100 in nb di water as the feeds indicates membrane scaling but this was more severe in the absence of nbs after 45 h of operation the c pvdf membrane tested with the hs 100 in nb di water feed showed a high flux of 9 5 l m 2 h 1 a 50 reduction from its initial value with an average fouling rate of 1 12 table 3 compared with the use of hs 100 in di water as the feed this much lower fouling rate and relatively high flux are mainly attributable to the reduced deposition of scalants on the membrane surface because the only difference between the feeds was the introduction of the nbs this reduction in scaling deposition can be concluded to be a direct effect of the nbs the use of nbs prolonged the life of the c pvdf membrane reducing the membrane cleaning and replacement requirements and thereby decreasing the operational costs the presence of tiny nbs in high concentrations in both the bulk and the boundary layer of the feed enhanced the flow hydrodynamics which induced turbulence and introduced shear forces near the membrane surface thus reducing the ability of the salts to deposit and grow moreover the presence of these air nbs near the feed boundary layer reduced heat losses and minimized the effect of concentration polarization the detailed mechanism of flux enhancement and scaling reduction in md due to nbs is explained in detail in the following section in addition to the improved scaling resistance the c pvdf membrane tested with hs 100 in nb di water feed did not show any wetting even after 45 h of operation as evidenced by its stable sr the permeate conductivity gradually declined throughout the experiment proving that pure product water was permeating into and diluting the distillate in the distillate tank fig 5 yin et al 2020 showed that only a superhydrophobic membrane has excellent resistance against membrane pore wetting associated with gypsum scaling in dcmd which is due to the membrane s ability to prevent feedwater intrusion into the membrane pores in contrast hydrophobic and surface hydrophilic janus membranes were both wetted due to severe scaling in this study we eliminated the need for complex and expensive modification steps in the fabrication of superhydrophobic membranes that is the simple and chemical free method of introducing nbs into the feed significantly delayed the extend of flux reduction associated with scaling while maintaining robust resistance against the pore wetting of hydrophobic membranes the deposition of salts on the membrane surface and the subsequent decline in flux was further evaluated by sem of the membranes after their use in dcmd fig 6 when the c pvdf membrane was tested with the hs 100 in di water feed a clear and thick salt deposition layer formed on the membrane surface fig 6a1 a3 the whole surface was densely covered and no pores could be seen which explains the sharp reduction in flux however when nbs were introduced into the feed salt deposition on the c pvdf sharply decreased the surface remained relatively clean with clear and open pores and only a few crystals fig 6b1 b3 this finding explains the low flux reduction rate of the membrane and its ability to maintain a high flux of 9 5 l m 2 h 1 after 45 h next the elemental composition of the salt crystals deposited on the membrane surface was identified by eds of the tested membranes two distinct depositions were identified on the surface of the c pvdf membrane tested with the hs 100 in di water feed fig 7 a1 a6 the spectrum in fig 7a2 which corresponds to the c pvdf surface shown in fig 71 contains signatures of cacl2 caso4 and nacl deposits whereas the spectrum in fig 7a5 which corresponds to the c pvdf surface shown in fig 7a4 contains signatures of cacl2 and nacl deposits the mass fraction wt of the elements found on the membrane surface in both locations fig 7a3 and a6 indicates the presence of low concentrations of the chemical element fluorine f of the pvdf membrane material 0 13 and 0 0 wt respectively proving that the surface pores were blocked entirely all the salt deposits identified in this study have frequently been reported in the literature as inorganic foulants on md membranes guillen burrieza et al 2013 kharraz et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015 in contrast when tested with the hs 100 in nb di water feed the c pvdf membrane showed little salt deposition and scaling the spectrum in fig 7a8 which corresponds to the c pvdf surface shown in fig 7a7 has signatures of small deposits of nacl and cacl2 the c pvdf surface was clean and had open pores as confirmed by the high mass fractions of the chemical elements fluorine and carbon representing the pvdf material fig 7a9 however it should be pointed out that the eds technology still faces some limitations that should be considered when used for quantitative analysis for instance the detection limit in eds depends on sample surface conditions and eds falls short for detection of trace elements with concentrations below 1 wt nasrazadani and hassani 2016 additionally many software systems used for element identification are vulnerable to the occasional misidentification of major constituent peaks particularly for minor and trace elements newbury and ritchie 2013 thus although eds can identify and quantify elements with relatively high accuracy and precision analysis of eds data should be performed with caution here the spectra and mass fractions are shown in fig 7a corresponds to significant salt deposits detected on the surface of the membrane their presence is to compare the blockage and cleanliness of the membrane s surfaces tested with di water and nb di water feeds respectively and as supporting evidence for the sem images and md performance but should not be considered statistically representative of the whole membrane surface the psds of the scaled c pvdf after dcmd experiments with both feeds and the pristine c pvdf are shown in fig 7b when tested with different feeds the scaling propensity of the membranes affected their psd differently with the hs 100 in di water feed c pvdf showed a smaller mps 0 11 0 03 µm and the psd shifted toward the smaller sizes unlike the wide psd and large mps of 0 22 0 02 µm of the pristine membrane this change in pore size is directly related to forming a thick scaling layer on the membrane surface resulting in partial pore blockage and potential scale intrusion into larger pores as confirmed by the sem images with the hs 100 in nb di water feed however the c pvdf membrane showed a different trend in its pore size after dcmd testing with only a few pores blocked and most of the membrane surface appearing clean with open pores fig 6b1 b3 the mps was 0 21 0 03 µm almost identical to the pristine membrane before md testing confirming that nbs in the feed imparted the membrane with high resistance against scaling finally membrane scaling was further confirmed by measuring the water ca as shown in fig 7c while the pristine c pvdf membrane showed high hydrophobicity with a wca of 123 1 1 2 the membrane tested with the hs 100 in di water feed for 45 h had a hydrophilic surface with a wca as low as 20 5 3 4 this low wca is due to forming a thick scaling layer on the membrane surface which increases its affinity for water however the c pvdf membrane tested with the hs 100 in nb di water feed sustained its hydrophobic nature with a high wca of 106 9 2 2 comparable with that of the pristine membrane although the reduction in wca is a sign of scaling in both membranes the extent of scaling was much lower in the membrane tested with the feed containing nbs confirming that nbs increase scaling resistance the results mentioned above namely the dcmd performance data and the sem eds psd and wca measurements all highlight the benefits of introducing air nbs into the feed for improving membrane scaling resistance when treating high salinity feeds this chemical free and straightforward approach extends the operational life of the membranes and reduces the membrane cleaning and replacement costs arising from severe fouling the benefits of nbs in long term dcmd testing are discussed in the next section 3 5 long term scaling performance of nanobubble membrane distillation in treating high salinity feeds the experiments discussed thus far revealed that the presence of nbs in feed water was highly effective in delaying membrane scaling during md operation however the effectiveness of nbs in long term operations is a crucial indicator of md practicality kharraz and an 2019 because nbs exhibit high stability and longevity in water we hypothesized that their persistence in the feed water throughout the test would prevent scale formation and deposition on the c pvdf membrane surface to confirm this hypothesis we have performed an additional experiment to test the performance efficacy of the hybrid nb md process in scaling control during high salinity brine treatment hs 100 over four consecutive days due to the long period of this experiment the test ran in a batch mode in which the feed was continuously replenished when necessary to keep the variation in feed concentration within 5 fig 8 presents the distillate flux behavior and sr of the c pvdf membrane as a function of md operation time as illustrated in the figure the distillate flux of hs 100 in nb di water gradually declined throughout the md operation reaching a 63 reduction during 98 h testing in contrast a high sr 99 9 was recorded throughout the test confirming that the c pvdf membrane did not experience any wetting even during extended md operation we note that when the hs 100 in di water feed was used precipitous declines in the distillate flux and sr were recorded only after 13 h of continuous md operation fig 5 thus the observed performance improvement in long term md when the hs 100 in nb di water feed was used can be directly attributed to the presence of ultrafine nbs in the feed the steady flux decline and stable high sr during the long term md test further verify the effectiveness of nbs in alleviating membrane scaling and consequent wetting during md operations in conclusion although nbs did not completely prevent the reduction in distillate flux during the long term md treatment of a highly saline feed they significantly prolonged the operational life of the membrane delaying scaling induced membrane wetting details of the scaling control and inhibition mechanisms of nbs in md are presented in section 3 6 3 6 scaling inhibition mechanism here we attribute the anti scaling behavior of nbs to the improved hydrodynamic flow conditions in the feed stream and the adsorption of positive counterions at the negative air water interface as discussed in section 3 1 air nbs have low buoyancy and a strongly negative surface charge enabling them to remain suspended in water for prolonged periods in particular owing to their minimal buoyancy nbs are subject to brownian motion and thus disperse randomly throughout the feed at the same time their negative surface charge fig 3d ensures that the millions of nbs in each milliliter of the solution repel each other thus wholly saturating the feed stream and realizing homogenous mixing specifically the exceptionally high concentration of continually moving nbs induces turbulent flow in the feed channel producing uniform flow circulation and thus increasing the surface shear forces at the membrane surface and improving local mixing in the feed stream the surface shear rate directly influences the heat and mass transfer coefficients in the feed stream chen et al 2014 olatunji and camacho 2018 the high shear stress acting on the membrane surface creates a physical disturbance in the boundary layer increasing the heat and mass transfer coefficients chen et al 2014 wu et al 2015 the high heat transfer coefficient increases the temperature at the membrane surface whereas the high mass transfer coefficient decreases the salt ion concentration at the membrane surface respectively alleviating temperature and concentration polarization effects during md operation these improved hydrodynamic conditions in the feed stream induced by nbs play an essential role in delaying scale formation and deposition on the membrane surface in addition to nb induced shear stress on the membrane surface the electrostatic attraction of the counterions to the negatively charged nbs also contributes to the scale inhibition performance of the nb md system briefly as aforementioned the produced nbs carry high negative zeta potential owing to the excess of hydroxide ions oh compared to hydrogen ions h at the gas water interface mainly due to the difference in enthalpies of hydration the hydration energy of oh 489 kj mol is much lower than that of h 1127 kj mol which means that oh is more inclined to stay at the gas water interface giving a negative charge to the bubbles moreover the orientation of water dipoles at the interface may also determine the interface charge with hydrogen atoms pointing toward the water phase and oxygen atoms toward the gas phase causing an attraction of anions to the interface these adsorbed oh and h ions are crucial factors that influence the interface charge while other electrolyte ions are attracted to the interface as the counterions by electrostatic forces for instance here the nbs with negatively charged interface accumulates attracts the positively charged ions from the feed stream na ca2 mg2 etc to preserve electrical neutrality and consequently form an electric double layer eq 1a 1a nb o h ions in feed nb o h io n 2 the force of attraction between the nb interface and the ions is highly dependent on the valency of the counterions bui et al 2019 takahashi 2005 for instance ions with a valency of 2 e g ca2 and mg2 tend to have a stronger affinity for the air water interface than do monovalent ions e g na due to static electricity takahashi 2005 moreover it is also well established that in md salts of calcium and magnesium have a much higher membrane scaling potential than salts of sodium kharraz et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015 given their large specific surface area and negative surface charge nbs in the saline feed attract positive ions with a higher affinity for divalent ca2 and mg2 ions than for monovalent na ions this effect significantly reduces the availability of ca2 and mg2 in the bulk feed for scale formation thereby improving the long term performance efficacy of nb assisted md in the treatment of high salinity water fig 8 moreover one can think that the presence of nbs in the feed may affect the co2 concentration or alter the co2 carbonates equilibrium thus contributing to the observed lower scaling for the nbs containing feed to test this possibility we have performed a simple experiment to measure the concentration of dissolved co2 in two samples a control di water and nbs di water the experimental procedure is given under section 2 2 we found that generating nbs does not highly affect the dissolved co2 concentration the nbs di water sample had a co2 concentration comparable to that found in the control di water sample in fact both samples had shown to have a minimal amount of dissolved co2 less than 1 mg l the real concentration is expected to be even lower since only one droplet of the titrant naoh was enough to complete the reaction this is expected since the nbs used in this study were generated in air in which co2 represents less than 0 03 of the air volume buis 2019 and thus the concentration of co2 in the generated nbs is very low we therefore concluded that changes in co2 carbonate equilibrium due to the generation of nbs are not expected to contribute much to the scaling behavior of the c pvdf membrane during md compared to the more dominant surface shear force and nbs charge effect as explained earlier 4 conclusions membrane scaling represents a significant challenge hindering md industrial application especially for treating hypersaline wastewaters and brine recovery and reduction this study demonstrated the benefits of introducing air nanobubbles into the feed as a chemical free and straightforward method for alleviating flux reduction and membrane pore wetting associated with mineral scaling in md a commercial pvdf membrane was challenged with high salinity brine feed either with the absence or introduction of nbs in a dcmd system compared to the high salinity in di water feed introducing nbs reduced membrane scaling propensity and offered excellent resistance against pore wetting associated with scaling while the membrane surface tested with nbs in the feed showed minimal flux reduction 63 after long term 98 h without the occurrence of pore wetting the membrane tested without nbs in the feed experienced severe scaling and complete loss of flux reaching zero within 13 h of operation after which membrane pore wetting was detected sem images of the fouled membranes revealed an accumulation of salts crystals blocking the membrane pores and a formation of thick salts layer on the surface of the membrane tested without nbs in the feed compared to a clean surface with open pores and significantly fewer salts deposition for the membrane tested with nbs in the feed additionally eds elemental analysis and psds and cas of the pristine and fouled membranes samples confirmed the presence of severe caso4 mgso4 and cacl2 crystals growth resulting in reduced pore sizes and loss of surface hydrophobicity when nbs were absent in the high salinity feed we attribute the improved scaling resistance and absence of pore wetting associated with introducing nbs into the feed to a combination of mechanisms including high surface shear forces due to flow turbulence and electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged nbs and the counterions our findings demonstrate the advantage of introducing nbs into the feed for md treatment of challenging hypersaline feeds and offer valuable insights for the future development of simple chemical free strategies for inorganic

16429,in this study we report the use of nanobubbles nbs as a simple and facile approach to effectively delay scaling in membrane distillation md during the treatment of highly saline feed 100 g l 1 unlike conventional gas bubbling in md for improving the hydrodynamic flow conditions in the feed channel here we generated air nbs with an average size of 128 81 nm in the feed stream and examined their impact on membrane scaling inhibition during md operation due to their small size neutral buoyancy and negative surface charge nbs remain in suspension for a longer time 14 days providing homogenous mixing throughout the entire feed water the md performance results revealed that severe membrane scaling happened during the dcmd treatment of high salinity brine in the absence of nanobubbles which dramatically reduced the distillate flux to zero after 13 h a one time addition of air nbs in the saline feed significantly reduced salt precipitation and crystal deposition on the pvdf membrane surface delayed the occurrence of flux decline prevented membrane wetting thereby prolonging the effective md operating time with similar feed concentration and operating conditions only 63 flux decline after 98 h operation was recorded in nanobubble assisted md two key explanations were suggested for the delayed membrane scaling upon addition of air nbs in the md feed 1 nb induced turbulent flow in the feed channel that increases the surface shear forces at the membrane surface alleviating both temperature and concentration polarization effect 2 electrostatic attractions of the counterions to the negatively charged nbs which reduces the availability of these ions in the bulk feed for scale formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation nanobubbles scaling brine treatment hydrodynamic disturbance charge 1 introduction rapid urbanization unprecedented population growth and the increasing rate and magnitude of climate change have triggered severe freshwater crises particularly in coastal and inland regions deshmukh et al 2018 thermally driven desalination technologies capable of treating high salinity waters using low grade heat sources such as waste solar and geothermal heat are vital in using the water energy nexus to address these crises deshmukh et al 2018 membrane distillation md a membrane thermal hybrid process has emerged as the treatment method of choice for desalinating high salinity waters such as sea and brackish water saline wastewaters and brines drioli et al 2015 kharraz et al 2020 pangarkar et al 2016 md possesses notable advantages over conventional thermal distillation and membrane separation processes namely 1 its relative insensitivity to feed salinity 2 its lack of specialized high pressure requirements unlike reverse osmosis 3 its potential for 100 rejection of ions and macromolecules and 4 its relatively low operation temperature requirement increasing the feasibility of using renewable heating sources as the thermal driving force alkhudhiri et al 2012 deshmukh et al 2018 ullah et al 2018 however despite its many advantages large scale practical applications of md for treating high salinity water remain limited a major bottleneck in their widespread adoption is the inevitable scaling i e inorganic fouling of the md membranes due to the precipitation of sparsely soluble salts present in the feed stream horseman et al 2021 rezaei et al 2020 tijing et al 2015 scaling in md is particularly crucial as this phenomenon increases heat and mass transfer resistance escalates membrane wetting and aggravates temperature and concentration polarization at the membrane surface all of which deteriorate overall md performance horseman et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 various techniques such as feed water pretreatment e g filtration coagulation antiscalant use chemical cleaning e g use of acids or bases and membrane surface modification e g altering the surface roughness hydrophobicity and surface charges have been developed to control scaling in md deka et al 2019 gryta 2008a kamranvand et al 2020 kharraz et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 however these techniques prevent scaling only to a certain extent and their use entails other environmental economic and operational concerns for instance most antiscalant chemicals are organics and may reduce the surface tension of the water thereby promoting membrane wetting he et al 2009 in addition some antiscalant chemicals e g polyacrylate based antiscalants when added to the feed serve as a nutritional source for bacteria and thus promote biofouling on the membrane surface he et al 2009 sweity et al 2013 furthermore the use of these chemicals can be an environmental concern because most antiscalants do not readily degrade in natural environments moreover studies have reported contradictory results regarding superhydrophobic and omniphobic surface modification effects on anti scaling performance liu et al 2021 hydrophobic surfaces are also known to preferentially adsorb organic compounds present in natural feed water which may modify the membrane surface and thus facilitate scaling and membrane wetting eykens et al 2017 servi et al 2016 finally pretreatment and md process parameter optimization which incur additional costs have failed to eliminate scaling in md ultimately considering the severity of scaling in md and the limitations of current technologies in addressing this problem it is essential to seek a chemical free approach that effectively prevents scaling and avoids environmental or operational damage one practical physical approach to prevent scaling in md during the treatment of high salinity water is to create better fluid dynamics and increase the surface shear rate near the membrane surface conventionally flow turbulence in the feed channel is stimulated by either increasing the feed flow velocity or using spacers however chen et al 2013 found that the use of spacers eventually leads to more scaling than in a configuration without spacers because spacers facilitate the local trapping of salts close to the membrane surface another practical approach to increase shear stress near the membrane surface for membrane scaling control is the introduction of a gas liquid two phase flow via gas bubbling chen et al 2013 ding et al 2011 ye et al 2019 various studies have reported that bubbling induced secondary flows significantly increase the maximum shear stress near the membrane surface thus hindering local scale formation chen et al 2013 cui et al 2003 ye et al 2019 furthermore when correctly used bubble technology carries no risk of membrane damage and causes no harm to the environment studies have shown that the efficacy of bubble technology for fouling control in membrane based systems is mainly dependent on the size and distribution of the produced bubbles with uniformly distributed fine bubbles being more efficient in delaying membrane fouling than coarse bubbles under similar operation conditions chen et al 2014 cui et al 2003 the use of nanobubbles nbs tiny bubbles with a diameter of 200 nm is an alternative to the conventional bubbling technique with great potential for scaling control in md nbs are incredibly small 500 times smaller than a microbubble and stable cavities of gas in liquid and have unique physical characteristics such as a large interfacial area low or neutral buoyancy long residence time negative surface charge and high internal pressure agarwal et al 2011 lugli et al 2005 compared with macro and micro bubbles the neutral buoyancy and negative surface charge of nbs allow them to remain in the feed stream for relatively more extended periods bui et al 2019 ushikubo et al 2010 for instance microbubbles tend to gradually decrease in size and eventually collapse due to long stagnation and the dissolution of interior gases into the surrounding water whereas nbs persist for months lugli et al 2005 ushikubo et al 2010 moreover given their strong negative charge nbs repel each other and thus thoroughly saturate the feed bui et al 2019 the use of extremely small and uniformly distributed nbs in the md feed stream is anticipated to increase the surface shear forces at the membrane surface significantly these shear forces will disturb the boundary layer and reduce the chances of concentration polarization and scaling layer formation on the membrane surface moreover the strong negative charge of nbs in the saline feed will effectively reduce salt precipitation possibly by attracting counterions to the gas water interface in this study we investigated the influence of nb aeration as a chemical free scale inhibition technique for the md treatment of high salinity brine during md operation nanosized air bubbles were added to the feed stream and their effects on mass transfer solute rejection and membrane wetting were systematically examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals a commercially available polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 22 μm gvhp durapore was purchased from merck millipore ltd usa and used as a standard hydrophobic md membrane hereafter referred to as c pvdf in each md test the membranes were used as obtained without any modifications sodium chloride nacl magnesium sulfate mgso4

used in all experiments all salts used were of acs reagent grade and were used as received 2 2 nanobubble generation and characterization nbs of natural air were generated for 15 min in 50 l acrylic tanks containing 20 l di water using an nb generator aqua 075mo aquapro solutions pte ltd singapore the pressure of the nb generator internal pump was controlled between 3 8 and 4 0 bar following the nb operation the water in the tank was left undisturbed for 15 min the physiochemical characteristics of nbs namely size i e diameter distribution concentration decay time and zeta potential zp in di water were characterized based on light scattering methods using nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanosight lm10 and nanosight ns300 systems malvern panalytical ltd uk and dynamic light scattering dls zen3600 zetasizer nanozs malvern instruments the nta s nanosight lm10 was used to measure the size and concentration of nbs over 30 min to 14 days while the nanosight ns300 was used to measure the concentration of nbs over a temperature range of 20 50 c the systems utilize the properties of both light scattering and brownian motion to obtain the size distribution and concentration measurement of particles in liquid suspension a laser beam blue laser with wave length λ 405 nm is passed through the sample chamber and the nbs in suspension in the path of this beam scatter light in such a manner that they are easily visualized via a 20x magnification microscope onto which is mounted a high speed camera the camera operates at 30 frames per second fps capturing a video file of the particles moving under brownian motion the software tracks many particles individually and calculates their hydrodynamic diameters using the stokes einstein equation malvern panalytical ltd 2021 after nbs generation and resting for 15 min as described above six samples each containing 50 ml of bubbled water were collected from the tank at different time intervals t0 initial t1 30 min t2 1 h t3 6 h t4 24 h t5 7 days and t6 14 days and the characteristics of the nbs in the samples were analyzed with three replicate measurements for each sample di water sampled before nb generation was used as the baseline standard the effect of temperature variation on the concentration of nbs was also measured in these temperature dependence tests the camera was operated at 25 fps with level 10 gain 73 and viscosity for water at 25 c 0 9 cp 1 ml of the nbs water was placed inside the testing chamber the measuring temperature was automatically controlled at an accuracy of 0 2 c by setting the desired value in the instrument s software before starting each test the same sample was used during the testing temperature range 20 50 c and was first stabilized at room temperature afterward the temperature was set to 20 c to perform the first measurement followed by increasing the temperature by steps of 10 c for the remaining tests after the instrument reached the set temperature for each test the sample was given 3 min to stabilize and reach thermal equilibrium before the test started the dls s zetasizer nanozs was used to measure the size and size distribution of nbs over a temperature range of 20 70 c the instrument uses non invasive back scatter technology and has a detection range for diameters between 0 3 nm and 10 µm the scattering angle was set to 173 while the dispersant s di water and material s air nbs refractive index ri was set to 1 33 and 1 0 respectively precautions were taken during the preparation and handling of samples to ensure no bubbles were formed during sample filling 1 ml of the nbs water was filled in a disposable glass sizing cuvette and placed inside the testing chamber the measuring temperature was automatically controlled at an accuracy of 0 3 c by setting the desired value in the instrument s software before starting each test the same sample was used during the testing temperature range 20 70 c and was first stabilized at room temperature for 15 min afterward the temperature was reduced to 20 c to perform the first measurement followed by increasing the temperature by steps of 10 c for the remaining tests after the instrument reached the set temperature for each test the sample was given 10 15 min to stabilize before the test started three replicate measurements were performed for each test with at least 13 runs each and the mean value was reported electrophoretic light scattering technology was used to measure the zp of nbs water over a temperature range of 20 70 c using the same zetasizer nanozs described above an electric field is applied to the nbs dispersion leading the nbs to move the velocity of the nbs is related to their zp which is measured using the laser interferometric technique phase analysis light scattering m3 pals technology this enables the calculation of electrophoretic mobility which is used to calculate the zeta potential based on the smoluchowski equation 1 ml of the nbs water was filled in a disposable folded capillary cell using the manufacturer suggested procedure to ensure no air bubbles form in the cell the same value and method for the refractive index and temperature control were applied respectively as mentioned in the size measurement section above three replicate measurements were performed for each test and the mean value was reported for both size and zp and before the analysis of nbs a transfer standard of latex nanospheres aqueous suspension was used to verify the correct operation of the zetasizer nanozs instrument the ph and conductivity of the di water and nbs water were measured at room temperature using pre calibrated ph and conductivity sensors connected to a digital meter multi 3420 wtw gmbh germany the concentration of dissolved co2 in two water samples a control di water and nbs di water was measured by a titration reaction briefly 10 ml of each sample was placed in a conical flask and 2 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator 0 25 solution in 60 ethyl alcohol were added after which the samples remained colorless indicating to be acidic with the possible presence of free co2 this was followed by titrating the samples with 0 05 n naoh solution until a pink color appeared indicating the reaction s completion this is due to the reaction of co2 with naoh forming sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and turning the sample to become basic at around ph 8 3 at this completion point based on the sample volume and normality and volume of naoh used the concentration of co2 was calculated 2 3 membrane characterization the surface morphology of both pristine and fouled membrane samples was evaluated using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem quanta feg 450 fei sem samples were initially gold coated for 120 s btt iv denton vacuum llc moorestown nj us elemental analysis of post md membranes i e scaled samples was performed via energy dispersive spectroscopy eds to identify the salt deposits the water contact angle wca of the pristine and post md membranes was measured using a drop shape analyzer dsa25 kruss germany and the double sessile drop measurement method with a 1 µl water droplet at least two samples with five readings each were measured for each membrane the membrane surface s zeta potential zp was measured according to the streaming current technique by using a streaming potential analyzer surpass anton paar austria equipped with an adjustable gap cell the bubble point bp i e maximum pore size mean flow pore size mps minimum pore size and average pore size distribution psd were measured using a gas liquid displacement porometer porolux 1000 porometer belgium and the wet dry curve procedure the membrane samples were pre wetted using porefill 16 mn m surface tension and placed in the porometer chamber where precise step wise n2 gas pressure was applied the same porometer was operated under the hydro head mode to measure all samples water liquid entry pressure lep lep was recorded as the point at which a pressure increase was automatically detected corresponding to the wetting of the largest pore through the water passage the porosity of the membranes was measured as the difference between the dry and wetted sample weights eq 1 using a gravimetric method with butanol 0 81 g ml as the wetting liquid 1 ε w w e t w d r y ρ b u t a n o l v s where w w e t and w d r y are the wet and dry sample weights respectively ρ b u t a n o l is the density of butanol and vs is the sample volume a precision micrometer was used to measure the sample thickness the zeta potential of the membrane was measured using the same zetasizer nanozs instrument with an additional accessory i e the surface zeta potential measurement cell that enables the measurement of the zp of surfaces approximately 1 1 cm membrane sample was attached to the cell at the designated sample plate and submerged in a medium containing tracer particle negatively charged the surface zp of the membrane is then determined by detecting the movement of tracer particles dispersed in the electrolyte in which the sample is immersed an electric field is applied via the cell electrodes leading to a subsequent motion of tracer particle due to a combination of electrophoresis and electro osmosis such movement is measured as a function of displacement away from the surface the surface zp is then calculated through a model that describes the electro osmosis flow contribution from the sample surface 2 4 nanobubble membrane distillation setup and experiments a lab scale direct contact dc md setup was used to evaluate the md performance of all membranes fig 1 the setup consists of a 10 6 4 cm membrane module designed for an active flat sheet membrane area of 6 2 1 5 cm whose opposite sides are connected to two pumps circulating the feed and the permeate between the membrane module and the feed permeate containers respectively the flowrates of the feed and the permeate were controlled using flowmeters connected beside the pumps the temperature of the permeate and feed was controlled using a chiller maintained at 20 c and a hot plate maintained at 60 c this temperature difference of 40 c between the two sides of the membrane drives the vapor through the hydrophobic membrane following which the vapor condenses on the permeate side changes in permeate weight used to calculate the vapor flux and conductivity used to calculate the salt rejection sr are automatically recorded by a precision balance and a conductivity probe respectively the same md experimental setup was used to investigate the scale inhibition performance of nb assisted md in treating high salinity water with the only difference being the presence of nbs in the feed water briefly in the nb assisted md test nbs of natural air was first generated in a tank containing 20 l di water for 15 min at a pressure of 4 bar next 3 l bubbled di water was collected from the tank salts were added in the concentrations indicated in table 1 to prepare a synthetic high salinity feed solution hereafter referred to as hs 100 as the test feed fig 1 three sets of dcmd experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the c pvdf membrane the first set was designed to assess the effect of introducing only nbs on md two feeds were prepared in di water with and without nbs the second set was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of nbs in reducing membrane scaling propensity two feeds were prepared for this set namely hs 100 in di water and hs 100 in nb di water in this second test the experiment ran in a continuous mode without feed replenishment the third set was performed to assess the benefits of nbs in long term dcmd by using the hs 100 in nb di water as the test feed in this third test the experiment ran in a batch mode where the feed was replenished with di water whenever 100 ml permeate was collected to keep the variation in feed concentration within 5 di water was used at the permeate side in all md experiments and the feed and permeate flowrates were maintained at 500 ml min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanobubble water generation and characterization immediately after the nanobubble generator started the di water inside the tank turned into a milky appearance this is due to the presence of a large number of micron sized bubbles which leaves the tank over a few minutes seconds due to bursting either after rising to the surface due to their buoyancy or coalescing in the water solution atkinson et al 2019 this was confirmed when the generator was stopped following 15 min of operation the milky color disappears within a few minutes and becomes clear as the larger micron sized bubbles burst out of the solution leaving behind nanobubbles because the generated nbs were too small to be visible to the naked eye and even under a standard microscope given their transparent nature their presence in water was first visualized by the backscattering of light from a green laser pointer as shown in fig 2 a the green laser beam was invisible in the beaker containing the control ultrapure di water without nbs in contrast it was visible in the beaker containing nb water note that the internal pump pressure of the nb generator showed an inverse relationship with bubble size we optimized the generator pressure to 3 8 4 bar in the tests mentioned above to obtain small uniformly distributed nbs it is well established in the literature that nbs once generated in the aqueous environment remain highly stable for prolonged periods meegoda et al 2018 nirmalkar et al 2018a ushikubo et al 2010 to verify this we further analyzed and quantified the fundamental characteristics of nbs particularly their average bubble size concentration and stability over 14 days by using nanosight lm 10hs see section 2 2 for details to observe changes in bubble size and concentration over time the results showed that nbs generated with air in ultrapure di water for 15 min yielded millions of nbs per ml with each bubble measuring less than 150 nm in diameter fig 2b and c specifically the average bubble concentration was found to be approximately 7 8 107 bubbles ml 1 with bubble diameters distributed in the narrow range of 100 150 nm the size of the bubbles remained nearly unchanged over the 14 days with an average bubble size of 142 81 nm on day 14 almost the same as that on day 1 128 81 nm fig 2b similarly the concentration of the nbs did not vary significantly as only a 15 decrease in nb concentration was observed after 14 days fig 2c the observed longevity of nbs in water as evident from their consistent size and concentration for prolonged periods can be attributed to the unique characteristics directly related to their nanoscale size namely their high internal pressure minimal buoyancy and strong electric charge meegoda et al 2018 nirmalkar et al 2018a unlike macro or micro bubbles which quickly rise to and burst on the surface the minimal buoyancy of nbs prevents them from reaching the surface instead they move around randomly following the principles of brownian motion the net effect is that nbs remain suspended in water for extended periods moving randomly throughout the water suspension additionally the electric charge on the nbs also plays an essential role in their stability nirmalkar et al 2018a ushikubo et al 2010 it is well reported in the literature that air nbs formed in ultrapure water exhibit a high absolute negative zp which is attributed to the predominance of oh ions in the first molecular layers of water at the gas liquid interface bui et al 2019 takahashi 2005 we have measured the zeta potential of our nbs water as described in the methods section and our results are in line with the reported literature showing a zp value of 15 9 2 7 mv at room temperature i e 23 c and ph of 6 8 the strong negative charge on the liquid gas interface of nbs increases the degree of electrostatic repulsion between individual bubbles thus keeping them evenly distributed in the water for longer without coalescence temperature is an essential parameter in all fields of natural science and has prominent effects on the physical and chemical properties of many materials and media and can affect their stability the size and stability of macro sized bubbles are also affected by the variation in temperatures due to a decreased gas solubility at higher temperatures however we expect a different behavior for nbs as they are fundamentally different and show high stability due to their unique characteristics as explained above therefore we have also tested the effect of temperature on physiochemical properties of the generated nbs water fig 3 nbs were first generated at room temperature and left for 15 min after which a 1 ml sample was filled in a glass cell and placed in the sample chamber of either zetasizer nanozs or nanosight lm10 instrument the temperature was reduced to 20 c and left to stabilize for 10 15 min before starting the first test this was followed by testing the size via increasing the temperature to 70 c and the concentration via increasing the temperature to 50 c fig 3a and fig 3b show the intensity weighted size distribution and average bubble diameter at a temperature range of 20 c 70 c respectively the nbs shows a relatively broad size range at low temperatures and become narrower with temperature increase at lower temperatures i e 20 c and 30 c b a wider range with two peaks could be seen a move towards a single peak with narrower distribution is noticed at higher temperatures confirming that nbs are temperature sensitive fig 3a measurement of nbs size i e diameter further confirms a larger nbs size at lower temperatures 154 93 23 13 nm at 20 c with a decreasing trend where the size shrinks to a minimum of 92 93 13 12 nm at 40 c the same temperature at which the narrowest size distribution was observed however fig 3b shows that nbs size increases slowly at temperatures higher than 40 c up to a maximum nbs diameter of 117 92 4 23 nm at 70 c these observations suggest a transition temperature at around 40 c where the nbs size shrinks to a minimum upon heating from lower temperatures and steadily expands again upon heating beyond such a transition temperature to understand such observations we first studied the effect of temperature on the concentration of nbs fig 3c shows that within the temperature range tested the concentration of nbs showed a decreasing trend when temperature increased from 20 to 50 c the rate of nbs concentration decline however was slowing down as the temperature increases at which the highest decrease in nbs concentration was observed when the temperature increased from 20 c to 30 c but slowed after when the temperature increased further up to 40 c and 50 c respectively such a behavior could be due to the coalescence of larger size bubbles as the temperature increases followed by their buoyancy and subsequent burst at the surface in this case the reminder of nbs is smaller in size and less in concentration which is in line with the measured size in the range of 20 c 40 c fig 3b however this does not explain the increase in nbs size associated with the decline in their concentration when the temperature further increased to 50 c additionally our results on the effect of temperature on nbs concentration are contradictory to some of the reported data in literature in which a measurement of nbs concentration as a function of temperature in the range of 20 70 c revealed no change of concentration as a function of temperature and thus concluded that nbs once generated remain stable in the thermal interval tested 20 70 c li et al 2021 these differences could be attributed to some limitations of the used nanosight ns300 instrument compared to the zetasizer nanozs for instance the size range for the zetasizer used to measure the size in fig 3b 0 3 nm 10 µm is broader than the size range of the nanosight ns300 used to measure the concentration in fig 3c 10 nm 1 µm moreover the concentration range for nanosight ns300 is limited to 106 109 particles ml compared to the zetasizer nanozs which can measure concentrated samples without dilution however despite such limitations it should be noted that although the general trend was a decrease in nbs concentration when the temperature increased fig 3c the quantitative measurement of nbs concentration still confirms very high numbers of nbs when the temperature increased up to a maximum of 50 c the concentration of nbs was around 3 107 nbs ml a very high concentration that can still contribute to the reduced scaling in md as will be discussed in the later sections here and considering such high concentrations of nbs limitations of the used instrument and reported literature we conclude that the generated nbs are deemed to be stable not only over long periods fig 2b and 2c but also at different temperature changes fig 3c yet as mentioned above the decline in nbs concentration with temperature does not explain the trend in nbs size two temperature ranges have been identified 20 40 c and 40 70 c being inversely proportional and directly proportional respectively considering the effect of temperature on nbs size and the observed transition trend at around 40 c fig 3b this suggests that at different temperatures the nbs either shrink or expand and obtain a new stable equilibrium our observations align with the literature and in a recent study on the stability of bulk nbs over a wide range of temperatures li et al 2021 obtained a similar trend at varying temperatures their measurements defined two regimes of size temperature behavior a strongly temperature sensitive regime 10 45 c where the nbs size shrinks and reaches a minimum and a weakly temperature sensitive regime 45 70 c where the nbs size weakly grow upon testing the variation in nbs size from 10 to 70 c and 70 10 c they found a fully reversible thermodynamic response in this range and concluded stability of nbs they suggested a correlation between the nbs stability and their negative surface charge other recent studies have also suggested that the stability of bulk nbs was due to the selective adsorption of negative electrical charges at the gas liquid interface of nbs in which bubbles coalescence and diffusion of gas into the bulk liquid are prevented due to the same charged surface nirmalkar et al 2018b tan et al 2020 thus to test and confirm the negative charge of the nbs interface we further tested the zeta potential of our nb water via the zetasizer nanozs instrument at the same temperature range used to test the bubble size as expected nb water showed a negative charge with negative zeta potential values throughout the tested temperature range fig 3d at around 15 2 3 92 mv at 20 c the nbs showed increased negativity with increasing the temperature up to 40 c after which the zp value remained almost constant with further temperature increase up to 70 c the similarities in a transition temperature i e around 40 c for the nbs size and zp show a correlation and confirm the suggestion that the stability of nbs is due to their interface negative charge between 20 and 40 c an increase in the negativity of zp was associated with a decrease in average nbs size whereas between 40 and 70 c an opposite trend was observed i e a slight increase in zp negativity was associated with a slight increase in average nbs size here the stability of nbs is due to their negative charge at the gas liquid interface which is a result of the net amount of hydroxide ions oh this net amount of oh results from both adsorbed and desorbed oh ions via two competing and temperature dependent contributors that result in charge stabilization li et al 2021 higher temperatures promote adsorption of oh ions due to increased activity of self ionization of water while at the same time promoting desorption of oh ions as a result of decreased ions mobility the sum of these two competing contributors presents the equilibrium oh concentration responsible for the negative zp i e charge at the liquid gas interface at temperatures lower than 40 c self ionization of water is slow and the net oh is decided by the relatively more dominant oh desorption due to ions mobility however a significant increase happens for water s self ionization at temperatures higher than 40 c resulting in higher adsorption of oh ions and reaching an equilibrium between the two i e adsorption and desorption thus showing a relatively stable zp above 40 c fig 3d and reaching a new stable equilibrium size li et al 2021 3 2 membrane characterization because standard hydrophobic membranes structural and surface properties are fundamental to their performance in md we next examined the intrinsic properties of the pristine c pvdf membrane used in the study the detailed characteristics of this membrane are presented in table 2 briefly the c pvdf membrane showed an average pore diameter of 0 22 0 02 µm with a narrow psd range of 0 14 0 01 to 0 41 0 03 μm the surface porosity of the membrane measured by the gravimetric method was 65 2 1 52 the wca 123 1 0 9 and lep 1 88 0 11 bar of the c pvdf membrane indicated that the membrane has sufficient hydrophobicity to prevent liquid water transport through it during md operation the electric charge on the membrane as characterized by the negative zp at neutral ph zp 39 0 15 mv revealed that the membrane possesses a strong negatively charged surface which can be attributed to the electronegative charge of the cf moiety in the pvdf polymer guo et al 2018 similar findings of strong negative charge with negative zp for the commercial pvdf membranes are reported in the literature boo et al 2016 chen et al 2017 han et al 2011 3 3 effect of nanobubbles in deionized water feed on membrane distillation the first set of experiments was designed to test the effect of introducing nbs to the feed and how the membrane behaves in dcmd without any salt which was realized by using di water as the feed either with or without nbs such a preliminary test was conducted to eliminate the effect of membrane scaling in the experiment involving nbs in the feed fig 4 shows the dcmd performance in terms of permeate flux and permeate conductivity over a 3 5 h period the results showed that the c pvdf membrane did not exhibit any reduction in permeate flux regardless of whether nbs were present in the di water feed which was expected given the absence of any foulants or scalants in the feed however when tested with the feed containing nbs the c pvdf membrane showed slightly higher 7 6 permeate flux than that in the feed without nbs this higher flux although not significant could be attributable to the hydrodynamic disturbance in the boundary layer when nbs are present in the feed nbs near the membrane surface can induce turbulence and disturb the boundary layer leading to improved heat transfer transport efficiency and thus mitigation of temperature and concentration polarization effects khayet and matsuura 2011 the reduction in temperature polarization tp enhances the cross membrane temperature difference δt resulting in increased vapor flux however it should be pointed out that a reduction in tp and the subsequent enhancement of cross membrane δt can also lead to an increased heat loss by conduction resulting in a slight decline in flux yet this decline in flux due to increased heat loss by conduction is expected to be minimal given its weak effect relative to the more dominant heat transfer through the feed boundary layer which is maximized in our nbs enhanced operation as a result of reduced tp khayet and matsuura 2011 another factor potentially contributing to the increase in flux could be a reduced heat of vaporization of water containing nbs when nbs are generated in the di water feed part of the intermolecular forces that hold the molecules together are broken reducing the heat of vaporization this weakening of intermolecular forces increases the surface area of the free water molecules which means that at the same feed temperature the vaporization rate increases increasing the flux additionally one would also consider the possibility of reduced flux in the presence of non condensable gases due to a decrease in partial vapor pressure as will be explained later in the scaling inhibition mechanism section 3 6 a simple experiment and calculation revealed that the concentration of dissolved co2 in the nb di water feed is comparable to that of the control di water feed and introducing air nbs does not result in considerable changes in the partial vapor pressure that would result in dominant flux reduction overall while it is difficult to quantify the contribution of each of these factors i e hydrodynamic disturbance in the boundary layer alleviating tp and cp increased heat loss by conduction reduced heat of vaporization presence of non condensable gases on flux it is concluded from the obtained higher flux that the factors enhancing the flux due to the addition of air nbs into the feed have a more dominant effect than the factors possibly decreasing the flux and determining the contribution of each mechanism is complex and requires further investigation in both tests permeate conductivity decreased from an initial value of approximately 3 75 µs cm to 3 57 and 3 20 µs cm for the feeds without and with nbs respectively this reduction is due to the continuous dilution of the permeate by the collected pure water permeate here we also tested the effect of introducing air nbs on the conductivity and ph of the feed two feed samples di water and nb di water were analyzed for their ph and conductivity and the measurements showed that upon generating air nbs in di water for 15 min both the conductivity and ph remained almost unchanged in particular di water and nb di water samples had conductivity values of 4 21 0 32 and 4 15 0 28 µs cm and ph values of 6 83 0 14 and 6 71 0 21 respectively 3 4 effect of nanobubbles in high salinity feed on scaling inhibition in md in this set of experiments the effect of nbs on membrane scaling during dcmd was evaluated using a high salinity feed i e hs 100 mimicking ro brine and other hypersaline wastewaters the feed was prepared by dissolving a mixture of salts i e nacl mgso4 nahco3 and cacl2 2h2o in di water to a final concentration of 100 g l these salts are usually present in ro brines and other industrial wastewater streams and may lead to severe scaling in md yin et al 2020 the final ion composition of hs 100 is presented in table 1 the results of the two dcmd experiments with the c pvdf membrane are presented in fig 5 the two experiments were conducted under the same conditions but using different feeds hs 100 in di water and hs 100 in nb di water table 3 summarizes the flux trends in the two tests at different points in time fig 5 shows a dramatic decline in the c pvdf flux in the absence of nbs i e in the hs 100 feed this decline can be attributed to the combined effect of concentration polarization and severe membrane scaling arising from the precipitation of salts on the membrane surface followed by crystal growth christie et al 2020 the salt crystals precipitation and growth block the membrane pores diminishing the porous area available for vapor transport and creating additional mass and heat transfer resistance gryta 2008b rezaei et al 2020 consequently the membrane flux eventually fell from its initial value of 18 8 l m 2 h 1 to zero i e 100 reduction after 13 h of md operation yielding an average fouling rate i e percentage of flux decline per hour of 7 69 h 1 for the first 13 h of operation the membrane did not show signs of wetting apart from the slight reduction in permeate conductivity due to the pure water permeate however after 13 h the permeate conductivity rapidly increased indicating membrane wetting gryta 2005 demonstrated that scalant deposition on the membrane surface is one of the major reasons for membrane wetting yin et al 2020 tested membranes with different wettability in dcmd using high salinity feeds and reported that the wetting of pvdf membranes was associated with gypsum scaling additionally the increase in permeate conductivity after 13 h was associated with a slight rise in flux 1 8 l m 2 h 1 which can be attributed to the passage of the liquid feed thus confirming the wetting of the c pvdf membrane not to be mistaken with pure water vapor flux the addition of nbs to the hs 100 feed substantially hindered the flux reduction fig 5 allowing the c pvdf membrane to be operated for a remarkably prolonged period in contrast to the dcmd test with hs 100 in di water as the feed in which the c pvdf membrane flux reduced to zero after 13 h introducing nbs to the feed resulted in a high membrane flux of 14 5 l m 2 h 1 a reduction of only 24 from its initial value 19 2 l m 2 h 1 with an average fouling rate of 1 88 the decrease in the flux of the c pvdf membrane in both experiments with hs 100 in di water and hs 100 in nb di water as the feeds indicates membrane scaling but this was more severe in the absence of nbs after 45 h of operation the c pvdf membrane tested with the hs 100 in nb di water feed showed a high flux of 9 5 l m 2 h 1 a 50 reduction from its initial value with an average fouling rate of 1 12 table 3 compared with the use of hs 100 in di water as the feed this much lower fouling rate and relatively high flux are mainly attributable to the reduced deposition of scalants on the membrane surface because the only difference between the feeds was the introduction of the nbs this reduction in scaling deposition can be concluded to be a direct effect of the nbs the use of nbs prolonged the life of the c pvdf membrane reducing the membrane cleaning and replacement requirements and thereby decreasing the operational costs the presence of tiny nbs in high concentrations in both the bulk and the boundary layer of the feed enhanced the flow hydrodynamics which induced turbulence and introduced shear forces near the membrane surface thus reducing the ability of the salts to deposit and grow moreover the presence of these air nbs near the feed boundary layer reduced heat losses and minimized the effect of concentration polarization the detailed mechanism of flux enhancement and scaling reduction in md due to nbs is explained in detail in the following section in addition to the improved scaling resistance the c pvdf membrane tested with hs 100 in nb di water feed did not show any wetting even after 45 h of operation as evidenced by its stable sr the permeate conductivity gradually declined throughout the experiment proving that pure product water was permeating into and diluting the distillate in the distillate tank fig 5 yin et al 2020 showed that only a superhydrophobic membrane has excellent resistance against membrane pore wetting associated with gypsum scaling in dcmd which is due to the membrane s ability to prevent feedwater intrusion into the membrane pores in contrast hydrophobic and surface hydrophilic janus membranes were both wetted due to severe scaling in this study we eliminated the need for complex and expensive modification steps in the fabrication of superhydrophobic membranes that is the simple and chemical free method of introducing nbs into the feed significantly delayed the extend of flux reduction associated with scaling while maintaining robust resistance against the pore wetting of hydrophobic membranes the deposition of salts on the membrane surface and the subsequent decline in flux was further evaluated by sem of the membranes after their use in dcmd fig 6 when the c pvdf membrane was tested with the hs 100 in di water feed a clear and thick salt deposition layer formed on the membrane surface fig 6a1 a3 the whole surface was densely covered and no pores could be seen which explains the sharp reduction in flux however when nbs were introduced into the feed salt deposition on the c pvdf sharply decreased the surface remained relatively clean with clear and open pores and only a few crystals fig 6b1 b3 this finding explains the low flux reduction rate of the membrane and its ability to maintain a high flux of 9 5 l m 2 h 1 after 45 h next the elemental composition of the salt crystals deposited on the membrane surface was identified by eds of the tested membranes two distinct depositions were identified on the surface of the c pvdf membrane tested with the hs 100 in di water feed fig 7 a1 a6 the spectrum in fig 7a2 which corresponds to the c pvdf surface shown in fig 71 contains signatures of cacl2 caso4 and nacl deposits whereas the spectrum in fig 7a5 which corresponds to the c pvdf surface shown in fig 7a4 contains signatures of cacl2 and nacl deposits the mass fraction wt of the elements found on the membrane surface in both locations fig 7a3 and a6 indicates the presence of low concentrations of the chemical element fluorine f of the pvdf membrane material 0 13 and 0 0 wt respectively proving that the surface pores were blocked entirely all the salt deposits identified in this study have frequently been reported in the literature as inorganic foulants on md membranes guillen burrieza et al 2013 kharraz et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015 in contrast when tested with the hs 100 in nb di water feed the c pvdf membrane showed little salt deposition and scaling the spectrum in fig 7a8 which corresponds to the c pvdf surface shown in fig 7a7 has signatures of small deposits of nacl and cacl2 the c pvdf surface was clean and had open pores as confirmed by the high mass fractions of the chemical elements fluorine and carbon representing the pvdf material fig 7a9 however it should be pointed out that the eds technology still faces some limitations that should be considered when used for quantitative analysis for instance the detection limit in eds depends on sample surface conditions and eds falls short for detection of trace elements with concentrations below 1 wt nasrazadani and hassani 2016 additionally many software systems used for element identification are vulnerable to the occasional misidentification of major constituent peaks particularly for minor and trace elements newbury and ritchie 2013 thus although eds can identify and quantify elements with relatively high accuracy and precision analysis of eds data should be performed with caution here the spectra and mass fractions are shown in fig 7a corresponds to significant salt deposits detected on the surface of the membrane their presence is to compare the blockage and cleanliness of the membrane s surfaces tested with di water and nb di water feeds respectively and as supporting evidence for the sem images and md performance but should not be considered statistically representative of the whole membrane surface the psds of the scaled c pvdf after dcmd experiments with both feeds and the pristine c pvdf are shown in fig 7b when tested with different feeds the scaling propensity of the membranes affected their psd differently with the hs 100 in di water feed c pvdf showed a smaller mps 0 11 0 03 µm and the psd shifted toward the smaller sizes unlike the wide psd and large mps of 0 22 0 02 µm of the pristine membrane this change in pore size is directly related to forming a thick scaling layer on the membrane surface resulting in partial pore blockage and potential scale intrusion into larger pores as confirmed by the sem images with the hs 100 in nb di water feed however the c pvdf membrane showed a different trend in its pore size after dcmd testing with only a few pores blocked and most of the membrane surface appearing clean with open pores fig 6b1 b3 the mps was 0 21 0 03 µm almost identical to the pristine membrane before md testing confirming that nbs in the feed imparted the membrane with high resistance against scaling finally membrane scaling was further confirmed by measuring the water ca as shown in fig 7c while the pristine c pvdf membrane showed high hydrophobicity with a wca of 123 1 1 2 the membrane tested with the hs 100 in di water feed for 45 h had a hydrophilic surface with a wca as low as 20 5 3 4 this low wca is due to forming a thick scaling layer on the membrane surface which increases its affinity for water however the c pvdf membrane tested with the hs 100 in nb di water feed sustained its hydrophobic nature with a high wca of 106 9 2 2 comparable with that of the pristine membrane although the reduction in wca is a sign of scaling in both membranes the extent of scaling was much lower in the membrane tested with the feed containing nbs confirming that nbs increase scaling resistance the results mentioned above namely the dcmd performance data and the sem eds psd and wca measurements all highlight the benefits of introducing air nbs into the feed for improving membrane scaling resistance when treating high salinity feeds this chemical free and straightforward approach extends the operational life of the membranes and reduces the membrane cleaning and replacement costs arising from severe fouling the benefits of nbs in long term dcmd testing are discussed in the next section 3 5 long term scaling performance of nanobubble membrane distillation in treating high salinity feeds the experiments discussed thus far revealed that the presence of nbs in feed water was highly effective in delaying membrane scaling during md operation however the effectiveness of nbs in long term operations is a crucial indicator of md practicality kharraz and an 2019 because nbs exhibit high stability and longevity in water we hypothesized that their persistence in the feed water throughout the test would prevent scale formation and deposition on the c pvdf membrane surface to confirm this hypothesis we have performed an additional experiment to test the performance efficacy of the hybrid nb md process in scaling control during high salinity brine treatment hs 100 over four consecutive days due to the long period of this experiment the test ran in a batch mode in which the feed was continuously replenished when necessary to keep the variation in feed concentration within 5 fig 8 presents the distillate flux behavior and sr of the c pvdf membrane as a function of md operation time as illustrated in the figure the distillate flux of hs 100 in nb di water gradually declined throughout the md operation reaching a 63 reduction during 98 h testing in contrast a high sr 99 9 was recorded throughout the test confirming that the c pvdf membrane did not experience any wetting even during extended md operation we note that when the hs 100 in di water feed was used precipitous declines in the distillate flux and sr were recorded only after 13 h of continuous md operation fig 5 thus the observed performance improvement in long term md when the hs 100 in nb di water feed was used can be directly attributed to the presence of ultrafine nbs in the feed the steady flux decline and stable high sr during the long term md test further verify the effectiveness of nbs in alleviating membrane scaling and consequent wetting during md operations in conclusion although nbs did not completely prevent the reduction in distillate flux during the long term md treatment of a highly saline feed they significantly prolonged the operational life of the membrane delaying scaling induced membrane wetting details of the scaling control and inhibition mechanisms of nbs in md are presented in section 3 6 3 6 scaling inhibition mechanism here we attribute the anti scaling behavior of nbs to the improved hydrodynamic flow conditions in the feed stream and the adsorption of positive counterions at the negative air water interface as discussed in section 3 1 air nbs have low buoyancy and a strongly negative surface charge enabling them to remain suspended in water for prolonged periods in particular owing to their minimal buoyancy nbs are subject to brownian motion and thus disperse randomly throughout the feed at the same time their negative surface charge fig 3d ensures that the millions of nbs in each milliliter of the solution repel each other thus wholly saturating the feed stream and realizing homogenous mixing specifically the exceptionally high concentration of continually moving nbs induces turbulent flow in the feed channel producing uniform flow circulation and thus increasing the surface shear forces at the membrane surface and improving local mixing in the feed stream the surface shear rate directly influences the heat and mass transfer coefficients in the feed stream chen et al 2014 olatunji and camacho 2018 the high shear stress acting on the membrane surface creates a physical disturbance in the boundary layer increasing the heat and mass transfer coefficients chen et al 2014 wu et al 2015 the high heat transfer coefficient increases the temperature at the membrane surface whereas the high mass transfer coefficient decreases the salt ion concentration at the membrane surface respectively alleviating temperature and concentration polarization effects during md operation these improved hydrodynamic conditions in the feed stream induced by nbs play an essential role in delaying scale formation and deposition on the membrane surface in addition to nb induced shear stress on the membrane surface the electrostatic attraction of the counterions to the negatively charged nbs also contributes to the scale inhibition performance of the nb md system briefly as aforementioned the produced nbs carry high negative zeta potential owing to the excess of hydroxide ions oh compared to hydrogen ions h at the gas water interface mainly due to the difference in enthalpies of hydration the hydration energy of oh 489 kj mol is much lower than that of h 1127 kj mol which means that oh is more inclined to stay at the gas water interface giving a negative charge to the bubbles moreover the orientation of water dipoles at the interface may also determine the interface charge with hydrogen atoms pointing toward the water phase and oxygen atoms toward the gas phase causing an attraction of anions to the interface these adsorbed oh and h ions are crucial factors that influence the interface charge while other electrolyte ions are attracted to the interface as the counterions by electrostatic forces for instance here the nbs with negatively charged interface accumulates attracts the positively charged ions from the feed stream na ca2 mg2 etc to preserve electrical neutrality and consequently form an electric double layer eq 1a 1a nb o h ions in feed nb o h io n 2 the force of attraction between the nb interface and the ions is highly dependent on the valency of the counterions bui et al 2019 takahashi 2005 for instance ions with a valency of 2 e g ca2 and mg2 tend to have a stronger affinity for the air water interface than do monovalent ions e g na due to static electricity takahashi 2005 moreover it is also well established that in md salts of calcium and magnesium have a much higher membrane scaling potential than salts of sodium kharraz et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015 given their large specific surface area and negative surface charge nbs in the saline feed attract positive ions with a higher affinity for divalent ca2 and mg2 ions than for monovalent na ions this effect significantly reduces the availability of ca2 and mg2 in the bulk feed for scale formation thereby improving the long term performance efficacy of nb assisted md in the treatment of high salinity water fig 8 moreover one can think that the presence of nbs in the feed may affect the co2 concentration or alter the co2 carbonates equilibrium thus contributing to the observed lower scaling for the nbs containing feed to test this possibility we have performed a simple experiment to measure the concentration of dissolved co2 in two samples a control di water and nbs di water the experimental procedure is given under section 2 2 we found that generating nbs does not highly affect the dissolved co2 concentration the nbs di water sample had a co2 concentration comparable to that found in the control di water sample in fact both samples had shown to have a minimal amount of dissolved co2 less than 1 mg l the real concentration is expected to be even lower since only one droplet of the titrant naoh was enough to complete the reaction this is expected since the nbs used in this study were generated in air in which co2 represents less than 0 03 of the air volume buis 2019 and thus the concentration of co2 in the generated nbs is very low we therefore concluded that changes in co2 carbonate equilibrium due to the generation of nbs are not expected to contribute much to the scaling behavior of the c pvdf membrane during md compared to the more dominant surface shear force and nbs charge effect as explained earlier 4 conclusions membrane scaling represents a significant challenge hindering md industrial application especially for treating hypersaline wastewaters and brine recovery and reduction this study demonstrated the benefits of introducing air nanobubbles into the feed as a chemical free and straightforward method for alleviating flux reduction and membrane pore wetting associated with mineral scaling in md a commercial pvdf membrane was challenged with high salinity brine feed either with the absence or introduction of nbs in a dcmd system compared to the high salinity in di water feed introducing nbs reduced membrane scaling propensity and offered excellent resistance against pore wetting associated with scaling while the membrane surface tested with nbs in the feed showed minimal flux reduction 63 after long term 98 h without the occurrence of pore wetting the membrane tested without nbs in the feed experienced severe scaling and complete loss of flux reaching zero within 13 h of operation after which membrane pore wetting was detected sem images of the fouled membranes revealed an accumulation of salts crystals blocking the membrane pores and a formation of thick salts layer on the surface of the membrane tested without nbs in the feed compared to a clean surface with open pores and significantly fewer salts deposition for the membrane tested with nbs in the feed additionally eds elemental analysis and psds and cas of the pristine and fouled membranes samples confirmed the presence of severe caso4 mgso4 and cacl2 crystals growth resulting in reduced pore sizes and loss of surface hydrophobicity when nbs were absent in the high salinity feed we attribute the improved scaling resistance and absence of pore wetting associated with introducing nbs into the feed to a combination of mechanisms including high surface shear forces due to flow turbulence and electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged nbs and the counterions our findings demonstrate the advantage of introducing nbs into the feed for md treatment of challenging hypersaline feeds and offer valuable insights for the future development of simple chemical free strategies for inorganic
