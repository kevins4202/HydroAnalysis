21235,the flow induced vibration fiv of two cylindrical structures may cause serious fatigue damage which is a major concern in engineering fields few studies have focused on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two staggered flexible cylinders in this paper the hydrodynamic coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders are calculated using the structural responses acquired from the model tests the cross flow cf spacing ratios are set as 2 3 4 and 6 and the in line il spacing ratios are set as 4 6 8 thus a total of twelve cases are considered the fluctuating forces in the cf and il directions are reconstructed using a finite element model the forgetting factor least squares method is employed to decompose the cf il fluctuating force into lift varying drag and cf il added mass force in the cf direction the hydrodynamic coefficients of the two staggered cylinders are significantly different from those of the single cylinder in the mode switch regions the cf vibrations of the two staggered cylinders enter the higher order mode earlier resulting in an increase in the cf added mass coefficients the downstream cylinder has larger lift coefficients due to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinders in the il direction the upstream cylinder has lower il added mass coefficients due to the higher order harmonics in the il direction the varying drag coefficients of the two staggered cylinders significantly differ from those of the single cylinder owing to the subharmonic frequency components a hybrid aspect of wake induced flutter and vortex induced vibration is

street will develop behind the cylinder leading to a variation in the fluid pressure along the cylindrical surface if the cylinder is elastically mounted or flexible vibration will be generated under the effect of varied fluid pressure namely flow induced vibration fiv the fiv features of a single cylinder have been widely studied in many research papers williamson and govardhan 2004 ni et al 2019 zou et al 2019 gao et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 when there are other bodies near the cylinder more complicated dynamic characteristics could be observed owing to the interactions among these bodies huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte et al 2016 chen et al 2019 xu et al 2018 2019 ma et al 2020 structures composed of multiple cylinders such as marine risers mooring cables and submarine pipelines are widely applied in offshore engineering and fivs might cause severe fatigue damage to these slender marine structures li et al 2020 tian et al 2020 two cylinders can be regarded as a basic cell of multiple cylinders and the staggered arrangement is the most common configuration zdravkovich 1987 sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008 zhou and alam 2016 the arrangement of two staggered cylinders can be denoted through the stagger angle a and the spacing ratio p d a refers to the angle between the flow velocity and the line connecting the two cylindrical centres which is in the range of 0 90 p refers to the centre to centre distance between the two staggered cylinders and d is the diameter of the cylinder the arrangement of two staggered cylinders can also be defined through the spacing ratios in both the cross flow cf and in line il directions i e s d and t d respectively s refers to the centre to centre distance in the cf direction and t refers to the centre to centre distance in the il direction in the present research s d and t d are used to define the arrangement of the two staggered cylinders hydrodynamic force coefficients are important parameters to understand the fiv features of cylinders there are many studies on the hydrodynamic forces of a single cylinder undergoing fiv sarpkaya 1974 gopalkrishnan 1993 aronsen 2007 however the hydrodynamic force characteristics of multiple cylinders undergoing fiv have attracted little attention in recent years many studies have considered the flow fields and the fluid forces of two fixed rigid cylinders in a staggered arrangement zdravkovich 1977 1987 alam et al 2005 sumner 2010 zhou and alam 2016 at small stagger angles a 15 the downstream cylinder is greatly influenced by the upstream cylinder including the shielding effect and the vortices effect however the upstream cylinder is remarkably affected by the downstream cylinder only at small spacing ratios as the stagger angles are larger than 15 the downstream cylinder is out of the shear layers of the upstream cylinder the flow interactions between the two cylinders are named by the proximity interference notably for some specific stagger angles and spacing ratios the inner negative lift peak at p d 1 8 2 1 and a 10 and outer negative lift peak at p d 3 5 and a 25 can be observed on the downstream cylinder in the cf direction these phenomena result from the wake flow or vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder zhou and alam 2016 previous researchers have also divided the stagger angles and spacing ratios into several regions to show the characteristics of wake patterns and fluid forces zdravkovich 1987 defined four flow regions proximity interference region wake interference region wake and proximity interference region and no interference region this classification is widely accepted and guides the investigation of two staggered cylinders undergoing fiv sumner et al 2000 divided the configuration into nine flow regions based on various stagger angles and wake patterns there are three single bluff body flow patterns single bluff body type 1 ssb1 at p d 1 0 1 125 and a 0 45 single bluff body type 2 ssb2 at p d 1 0 1 125 and a 45 90 and base bleed bb at p d 1 125 1 25 and a 45 90 shear layer reattachment slr at p d 1 125 4 0 and a 0 20 induced separation is at p d 1 125 3 0 and a 10 30 and vortex impingement vi at p d 3 0 5 0 and a 0 20 can be categorized as small incidence angle flow patterns large incidence angle flow patterns also include three subclasses vortex pairing and enveloping vpe at p d 1 25 3 5 and a 20 45 vortex pairing splitting and enveloping vpe at p d 1 25 4 0 and a 20 90 and synchronized vortex shedding svs at p d 1 5 5 0 and a 15 90 hu and zhou 2008 found five flow regions according to the wake patterns the first three flow patterns include the single street modes including mode s ia at p d 1 2 and a 0 90 p d 1 5 and a 20 mode s ib at p d 1 5 and a 10 and mode s ii at 1 2 p d 2 5 and a 20 1 5 p d 4 0 and 10 a 20 the other two flow patterns are twin street modes namely mode t i at p d 2 5 and 20 a 88 and mode t ii at p d 2 5 and a 88 alam et al 2005 studied the mean fluid force coefficients and fluctuating fluid force coefficients of two staggered cylinders in detail and they plotted cloud diagrams to show the fluid force coefficients when the two staggered cylinders are elastically mounted the fluid forces of two cylinders are more complicated than those of two fixed rigid cylinders the tandem arrangement is the limiting case a 0 of the stagger arrangement therefore comparative studies of tandem and staggered arrangements have been conducted by many investigators hover and triantafyllou 2001 mittal and kumar 2001 prasanth and mittal 2009 assi 2014 for two staggered cylinders the downstream cylinder is influenced by vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is in the wake region of the upstream cylinder a phenomenon similar to wake induced vibration wiv in the tandem arrangement was experimentally observed assi 2014 if the downstream cylinder of two staggered cylinders can vibrate in the cf and il directions the fluid forces on the downstream cylinder are unsteady due to the asymmetry of the mean wake a phenomenon called wake induced flutter might be generated on the downstream cylinder mittal and kumar 2001 assi 2014 the il dominant frequency decreases significantly and the il displacement increases therefore the motion trajectory of the downstream cylinder is an ellipse instead of the common figure eight shape notably wake induced flutter usually occurs outside of lock in regions i e the structural vibration is still controlled by the vortex induced vibration in the lock in regions mittal and kumar 2001 in addition alam and kim 2009 conducted a series of model tests on two staggered cylinders at several stagger angles a 5 10 15 25 45 and 60 and a larger range of spacing ratios p d 1 1 4 2 the two cylinders vibrated only in the cf direction they identified seven vibration modes based on the vibration characteristics of the two cylinders prasanth and mittal 2009 carried out a numerical study of two staggered cylinders undergoing fiv the two cylinders were free to vibrate in the cf and il directions the spacing ratio combination was set to t d 5 5 and s d 1 0 for the downstream cylinder wake induced flutter occurred and an obvious non zero lift force occurred as a result of the vortex effect griffith et al 2017 numerically studied the fiv of two staggered cylinders with a smaller il spacing ratio t d 1 5 the cf spacing ratio varied from 0 to 5 they identified seven modes based on the vibration characteristics and vortex shedding modes over the map of t d and the reduced velocity vr u f 1 d where f 1 is the natural frequency and u is the uniform flow velocity for mode 1 s d 0 6 vr 4 5 the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder did not enter the gap and passed around the downstream cylinder for mode 3 s d 0 6 0 9 vr 5 5 6 5 a strong gap flow pushed the shear layer of the upstream cylinder through the gap which generated large fluid forces on the downstream cylinder the critical state between mode 1 and mode 3 was defined as mode 2 mode 21 and mode 31 were subregions of mode 2 and mode 3 respectively in the region dominated by the gap flow s d 1 0 the gap flow had a significant influence on the two cylinders when wake pair dominated mode s d 1 4 2 0 appeared pairs of vortex shedding are generated behind each cylinder notably few studies have focused on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two flexible cylinders because the fluid force distribution of the flexible cylinder is difficult to measure directly however several inverse analysis methods have been proposed for reconstructing the hydrodynamic forces of the flexible cylinder song et al 2016 conducted a model test on a flexible cylinder and identified the fluid force coefficients of fiv with a single frequency based on the measured strains liu et al 2018 proposed the forgetting factor least squares method to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients of a flexible cylinder under multi frequency fiv recently xu et al 2018 and han et al 2018a carried out model tests and studied the fiv hydrodynamic features of two side by side flexible cylinders with four spacing ratios s d 3 4 6 and 8 the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients of the two cylinders increased compared to the results of a single cylinder the wake interaction between the two cylinders had a significant effect on the hydrodynamic coefficients in the case of s d 6 xu et al 2021 reconstructed the fluid forces of three and four side by side flexible cylinders undergoing fiv the hydrodynamic characteristics of the inner cylinder in the three cylinder system were different from those of the outer two cylinders the inner two cylinders in the four cylinder system showed remarkable differences between each other compared with the outer two cylinders ma et al 2019 investigated the fiv hydrodynamic features of two tandem flexible cylinders with spacing ratios of t d 4 6 8 10 and 16 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the two cylinders were calculated using the strain data measured from model tests the vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder may be disturbed by the downstream cylinder leading to a decrease in the lift coefficients and the varying drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder due to the presence of the upstream cylinder the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder were affected by the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect ma et al 2020 experimentally studied the fiv of three flexible cylinders with an equilateral triangular arrangement the spacing ratio was set as 6 0 and the flow incidence angle was 0 30 and 60 the downstream cylinder had an insignificant effect on the hydrodynamic coefficients of the upstream cylinder two robust frequency components were observed from the il displacements of the downstream cylinder which were attributed to the oscillation of the upstream cylinder in engineering applications cylindrical structures such as marine risers and mooring cables always have a large aspect ratio l d l is the length of the structure for a flexible cylinder with a large aspect ratio the interval between the natural frequencies of two adjacent modes is small high order mode vibrations and multi mode vibrations are usually observed when the viv of flexible cylinders occurs lie and kaasen 2006 xu et al 2018 ma et al 2020 which makes the fiv characteristics of flexible cylinders more complicated than those of rigid cylinders little attention has been focused on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two staggered flexible cylinders with a large aspect ratio recently xu et al 2020a conducted model tests on two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv the dominant mode dominant frequency and displacement amplitude of the two staggered flexible cylinders were presented to study the dynamic features the fiv involves complicated fluid structure interactions the investigation of hydrodynamic characteristics is also beneficial for understanding the fiv mechanisms of two staggered flexible cylinders the main aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the spacing ratio on the hydrodynamic coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv the fluctuating force coefficient lift coefficient varying drag coefficient and added mass coefficient are reconstructed by an inverse analysis method to study the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two staggered flexible cylinders the remainder of this paper is organized into the following sections the inverse analysis method for identifying the hydrodynamic coefficients is described in section 2 a brief introduction of the model tests is presented in section 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv are discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 a calculation method of the fiv hydrodynamic force the hydrodynamic force of flexible cylinders vary with the axial position many load sensors are required to measure the distribution of the hydrodynamic force the utilization of load sensors can disturb the flow around a flexible cylinder which affects the fiv characteristics hence it is difficult to measure the hydrodynamic force of a flexible cylinder undergoing fiv directly the inverse analysis method can be employed to reconstruct the hydrodynamic coefficients of the flexible cylinder using the displacements huera huarte 2006 calculated the cf and il fluctuating forces of a flexible cylinder undergoing fiv by a finite element method song et al 2016 han et al 2018a 2018b and ma et al 2020 utilized the least squares method to decompose the cf and il fluctuating forces the cf fluctuating force can be decomposed into the part in phase with the vibration velocity namely the lift and the part in phase with the vibration acceleration namely the cf added mass force similarly the il fluctuating force can be decomposed into the varying drag and the il added mass force for two tandem or staggered flexible cylinders multi frequency components are always found in the vibrations of the downstream cylinder due to the effect of the upstream cylinders xu et al 2018 2020a b liu et al 2018 proposed the forgetting factor least squares method to decompose the fluctuating force with multi frequency components subsequently ma et al 2019 identified the hydrodynamic coefficients of two tandem flexible cylinders undergoing multi frequency fiv by the forgetting factor least squares method in the present research the forgetting factor least squares method is applied to decompose the fluctuating force of two staggered flexible cylinders the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients in the cf direction is presented as an example and the il hydrodynamic force coefficients can be calculated similarly the flexible cylinder can be modelled as an euler bernoulli beam and the vibration equation in the cf direction is expressed as follows 1 e i 4 y z t z 4 t 0 2 y z t z 2 c y y z t m s y z t f y z t eq 1 can be transformed into a finite element equation as given in eq 2 2 m s y c y y k e k t y f y the mass matrix m s and structural stiffness matrix k e and k t can be calculated by a finite element method huera huarte 2006 and the structural damping matrix c y can be obtained using the rayleigh damping equation given in eq 3 3 c y λ 1 m s λ 2 k e k t the constants λ 1 and λ 2 can be acquired from the free decay tests all variables on the left side of eq 2 are known in advance f y which is on the right side can be calculated the fluctuating force f y at each node is obtained from the fluid force matrix f y the mean values of the rmss of the fluctuating forces in the cf direction can be acquired from eq 4 4 c y r m s 2 ρ d u 2 l l i 1 l l 1 n s j 1 n s f y 2 z i t j then the forgetting factor least squares method is applied to decompose the fluctuating force with multiple frequencies considering the multi frequency components and introducing the lift coefficient and the cf added mass coefficient the fluctuating force f y can be expressed as in eq 5 5 f y z t i

s y 0 t s y y z t ω y i 2 d t here t s y refers to the least common multiple of different vibration periods considering the coupling effects between multi frequency components a time varying

ρ π d 2 l 4 c a y z t n where t 1 t 2 t n refer to sample time moments when all sample time moments are used to calculate the hydrodynamic force the sensitivity of the sample time moments is quite weak hence a constant factor β 0 β 1 is introduced into the calculation the data weight of the force and response at each moment can vary with the various sample time moments the data weights are larger if the sample time moments are closer to the present moment t n liu et al 2018 eqs 9 and 10 can be transformed into eqs 12 and 13 12 f n β n 1 f y z t 1 β n 2 f y z t 2 β f y z t n 1 f y z t n

to the measuring data which enhances the sensitivity of the calculation results in a positive way more detailed demonstrations of the forgetting factor least squares method can be found in liu et al 2018 3 model tests 3 1 experimental arrangement xu et al 2020a conducted model tests on two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv and studied the dynamic characteristics of fiv the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders were calculated using the response amplitudes acquired from the model tests in xu et al 2020a during the model tests the experimental apparatus in fig 1 was towed by a carriage to simulate a uniform flow there are twelve cases of spacing ratios in the present research as shown in fig 2 the spacing ratios in the cf direction s d were set as 2 3 4 and 6 while the spacing ratios in the il direction t d were set as 4 6 and 8 the patterns of the interaction between the two staggered cylinders were classified into four regions by zdravkovich 1987 as shown in fig 2 the classification of zdravkovich 1987 is based on two rigid cylinders which is slightly different from that of two flexible cylinders it has been confirmed that the vibration amplitude of a flexible cylinder is slightly larger than that of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder huera huarte et al 2014 therefore the spacing ratio combinations are set to slightly larger values in the present work though the downstream cylinder is mainly in the no interference region classified by zdravkovich 1987 the two flexible cylinders still show significant mutual interactions in these cases the main parameters of the cylinder model are listed in table 1 the two cylinder models have the same parameters the length of the model was 5 60 m and the outer diameter was 16 0 mm the cylinder model was composed of two main parts as shown in fig 3 a the inner part was a copper pipe with an outer diameter of 8 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 0 mm the outer part was a silicone tube with an outer diameter which is the outer diameter of the cylinder of 16 0 mm the silicone tube provided a smooth surface for the cylinder model at one end of the cylinder model a universal joint was applied to avoid torsion the other end was connected to a steel wire and could move freely in the axial direction as shown in fig 1 a spring was connected to the steel wire to ensure gradual tension variation during the model tests the load cell was applied to measure the axial tension xu et al 2020b employed the similar experiment facility to investigated the fiv of two staggered flexible cylinders with unequal diameters along the axis of the cylinder there were seven measurement points i e g1 g7 as shown in fig 3 b at each measurement point two groups of strain gauges were utilized to measure the bending strains in the cf and il directions respectively the towing velocities equal to the flow velocities varied from 0 05 m s to 1 00 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s which correspond to reynolds numbers re of approximately 800 16 000 the reduced velocity vr u f 1 d where f 1 2 49 hz is the fundamental natural frequency in still water is in the range of 1 25 25 05 the rayleigh damping constants can be obtained from the free decay tests the two cylinder models in this paper have been employed to investigate the fiv of the two tandem flexible cylinders in xu et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 the rayleigh damping constants of the cylinder model were presented in table 2 3 2 data processing the strain acquisition occurred over 50s after the towing carriage reached a stable velocity the sampling frequency was set to 100 hz the interval between two consecutive tests was 15 min to ensure that the disturbed water was calm the strain data were filtered with a band of 1 0 40 0 hz to remove low frequency and high frequency noise the vibration displacements were reconstructed using a modal analysis method trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 and the hydrodynamic force coefficients were calculated based on the vibration displacements to obtain the hydrodynamic force coefficients the selection of the forgetting factor must make a compromise between the adaptive capability and the estimation accuracy for a larger forgetting factor the influences of the signal noise are weak but the characteristics of the signal details may be ignored for a smaller forgetting factor the description of the signal details is improved but the effect of the signal noise increases the forgetting factor was set to 0 7 as in ma et al 2019 which is quite suitable for the calculation of the hydrodynamic force coefficients of two tandem flexible cylinders in the present research three forgetting factors 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 were checked to choose the suitable value the original hydrodynamic force f y is decomposed into the lift and the cf added mass force using the forgetting factor least squares method as demonstrated in section 2 f y can be reconstructed based on the lift and the cf added mass force using eq 9 the original force and the reconstructed force of the downstream cylinder based on different μ values are shown in fig 4 for all three forgetting factors the accuracy of the force decomposition is acceptable however when the forgetting factor is 0 8 the description of the signal details is slightly worse than that of the other two forgetting factors fig 5 shows the lift coefficient based on different μ values of the downstream cylinder for μ 0 6 the lift coefficient shows drastic variation at some time points this variation is related to the influence of noise in the signals hence the forgetting factor value was set as 0 7 in the present research 4 results and discussion the displacements of two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv were presented and discussed in xu et al 2020a the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients of the two staggered flexible cylinders were calculated based on the displacement response in xu et al 2020a using the method in section 2 the axial mean values of the hydrodynamic force coefficients were obtained to investigate the influence of spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics 4 1 cf hydrodynamic force coefficients the added mass force which is in phase with the vibration acceleration is one of the two components of the hydrodynamic force hence the added mass coefficient is an important parameter for determining the hydrodynamic characteristics gopalkrishnan 1993 and aronsen 2007 found that the added mass coefficient is strongly related to the vibration frequency the cf added mass coefficients versus the reduced velocity are shown in fig 6 the variation in ca y of the upstream and downstream cylinders shares a similar trend with that of the single cylinder the dominant modes of the two staggered cylinders and the single cylinder were presented in xu et al 2020a and are not presented here xu et al 2020a found that the mode switch regions of the single cylinder are slightly different from those of two staggered cylinders for the single cylinder the mode switch regions correspond to the reduced velocity in the range of v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 and 23 80 25 05 it is tedious to show the range of reduced velocities in the mode switch regions of two staggered cylinders in each space ratio case thus for the sake of simplification the range of reduced velocities in the mode switch regions of two staggered cylinders is not presented in the mode switch regions v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 and 23 80 25 05 the ca y values of both cylinders abruptly increase in the lock in regions ca y shows a downward variation for s d 2 and t d 4 s d 2 and t d 8 and s d 3 and t d 4 ca y of the downstream cylinder does not show the sudden increase at v r 25 05 this phenomenon is attributed to the fact that the vibrations of the upstream cylinder and single cylinder enter the fourth order mode at v r 25 05 however the vibration of the downstream cylinder is still dominated by the third order mode due to the shielding effect the upstream cylinder shields the downstream cylinder and prevents the downstream cylinder from interacting directly with the free stream which causes the mean wake flow velocity acting on the downstream cylinder to be lower than the free stream velocity xu et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 studied the fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders and found that the downstream cylinder has lower vibration frequency and dominant mode than the upstream cylinder due to the shielding effect to analyse the dominant frequency of the displacements wavelet analysis was employed to obtain the time frequency diagram of the displacement responses the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is quite close to that of the upstream cylinder as shown in fig 7 however the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder shows obvious fluctuations in fig 7 b due to the influence of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder in the mode switch regions v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 23 80 25 05 multi frequency components are observed in the results of wavelet analysis as shown in fig 8 the values of these frequency components are quite close and the dominant frequency tends to regularly switch from one value to another overall the dominant frequency is unstable and disordered leading to the differences in ca y in the mode switch regions when the cf spacing ratio is 6 ca y of the two staggered cylinders abruptly rises to a high value at v r 22 55 indicating that the vibrations of the two staggered cylinders enter the fourth order vibration mode meanwhile the vibrations of the single cylinder enter the fourth order vibration mode at v r 25 05 the higher order mode vibrations are excited earlier for the two staggered cylinders hence ca y of the two staggered cylinders are larger than that of single cylinders the larger ca y of the two cylinders at v r 16 28 18 79 can also be attributed to this reason the lift which is in phase with the cf vibration velocity is another component of the hydrodynamic force in the cf direction the varying drag is in phase with the il vibration velocity the lift coefficients and the varying drag coefficients are closely related to both the vibration displacement and the response frequency gopalkrishnan 1993 aronsen 2007 similar to the upper and lower branches of the vibration displacement c l reaches a relatively high value first and then decreases until the end of the lock in region sarpkaya 1995 for an elastically mounted rigid cylinder the vibration displacement in the cf direction decreases to nearly zero when the reduced velocity exceeds the lock in region only a weak random vibration can be observed and the lift coefficient is close to zero however for a flexible cylinder non zero lift coefficient and vibration displacement are observed in the cf direction due to the multi mode vibrations the lift coefficients of the two staggered cylinders versus reduced velocity are presented in fig 9 at low reduced velocities the variation in c l of the two staggered cylinders shows a similar trend with that of the single cylinder in the mode switch regions v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 23 80 25 05 the c l values of the upstream and downstream cylinders show considerable differences from that of the single cylinder due to the multi frequency components for some large spacing ratios s d 3 t d 6 8 s d 4 t d 4 8 s d 6 t d 4 6 the downstream cylinder has slightly larger lift coefficients than the single cylinder especially at v r 8 77 12 52 mainly in the second order vibration mode this phenomenon is probably related to the outer negative lift peak which has been widely observed on two rigid staggered cylinders zdravkovich 1987 zhou and alam 2016 the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has a higher flow velocity and a lower fluid pressure than the outer free flow a pressure differential can be generated when these vortices pass through the inner side of the downstream cylinder which results in larger lift coefficients for spacing ratios of s d 2 and t d 4 the vortices may directly attach to the front part of the downstream cylinder instead of passing through the inner side hence c l of the downstream cylinder for s d 2 and t d 4 is quite similar to that of the single cylinder at v r 8 77 12 52 notably the two cylinders have larger c l values than that of the single cylinder at v r 13 78 17 54 a similar phenomenon also occurs for the ca y of the two cylinders as shown in fig 7 the cf vibrations of the two cylinders are usually under the second order vibration mode at v r 13 78 17 54 while the il vibration mode shifts from the third order to the fourth order and the il dominant frequency shows an abrupt change at approximately v r 13 78 15 03 for the fiv of the single cylinder the il vibrations considerably affect the cf vibrations jauvtis and williamson 2003 2004 for the fiv of the two staggered cylinders the mode switch of the il vibration can affect the cf vibrations the cf and il dominant frequencies for s d 3 and t d 4 are shown in fig 10 as an example st f s d u where f s is the vortex shedding frequency is the strouhal number for the two staggered cylinders the il dominant frequencies shift to higher values at v r 15 03 similar behaviours can also be observed in the cf direction although the cf vibration is still under the same dominant mode xu et al 2020a for the single cylinder the cf and il dominant frequencies abruptly change at v r 16 28 multi frequency components have obvious influences on the vibration when the mode switch occurs i e the switch of the dominant frequency such influences can also be confirmed by the variation in hydrodynamic force coefficients as shown in fig 11 the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the two staggered cylinders show different axial distributions from those of the single cylinder remarkable differences also exist in the mean values of these force coefficients in fig 9 specifically for a spacing ratio of s d 2 and t d 8 the downstream cylinder has obviously larger c l values at v r 15 03 21 29 compared with the downstream cylinder under the other spacing ratio considerable fluctuations are observed in the wavelet time frequency diagram as shown in fig 12 these phenomena indicate that the downstream cylinder in the case of s d 2 and t d 8 is significantly affected by the vortex the downstream cylinder has a slightly larger ca y and slightly lower dominant frequency indicating the appearance of wake induced vibrations wivs assi 2009 2014 it appears that the effect of the spacing ratio on the hydrodynamic coefficients depends on the velocity at low reduced velocities the differences in c l between the two staggered cylinders and single cylinder are small significant differences in c l are observed when the reduced velocity exceeds 11 27 huang and herfjord 2013 found that the upstream cylinder always had a larger mean drag than the downstream cylinder which caused the mean il displacement of the downstream cylinder to be smaller than that of the upstream cylinder when the two cylinders reach their respective equilibrium positions the actual spacing ratio may be smaller than the initial spacing ratio hence the actual spacing ratio decreases with increasing velocity which enhances the interaction between the two cylinders at high reduced velocities in the case of v r 11 27 the difference in c l between the upstream cylinder decreases with increasing spacing ratio the c l value of the upstream cylinder is close to that of the single cylinder except for s d 2 0 and t d 4 0 when the reduced velocity is less than 11 27 the c l value of the downstream cylinder depends on the cf spacing ratio for s d 2 0 and 3 0 the c l value of the downstream cylinder in the case of t d 4 0 is similar to that of the upstream cylinder and single cylinder the downstream cylinder has larger c l values when the il spacing ratio t d is 6 0 and 8 0 when the cf spacing ratio increases to 4 0 and 6 0 the c l value of the downstream cylinder is larger than that of the upstream cylinder regardless of the il space ratio when the reduced velocity exceeds 11 27 the c l value of the two staggered cylinders is considerably different from that of a single flexible cylinder under all spacing ratio cases fig 13 shows the rms of the fluctuating force coefficient in the cf direction the c yrms values of two staggered cylinders show similar trends with that of the single cylinder in each lock in region the c yrms value reaches a peak value and then decreases gradually until the end of the lock in region at low reduced velocities the cf spacing ratio has a significant effect on the c yrms value of the upstream cylinder as s d 3 0 the c yrms value of the upstream cylinder shows remarkable differences from that of the single cylinder which is related to the presence of the downstream cylinder in the case of s d 4 0 the downstream cylinder has a slight influence on the upstream cylinder which makes the c yrms value of the upstream cylinder close to that of the single cylinder for some larger spacing ratios i e s d 3 t d 6 8 s d 4 t d 4 8 s d 6 t d 4 6 the c yrms value of the downstream cylinder is slightly larger than that of the upstream cylinder and single cylinder which is consistent with the phenomenon of the outer negative lift peak for other spacing ratio combinations the c yrms values of the two staggered cylinders show insignificant differences however the ca y and c l values of the two staggered cylinders are not the same in the above cases which indicates that decomposing the fluctuating fluid force into lift and the added mass force is necessary to further understand fiv hydrodynamic features 4 2 il hydrodynamic force coefficients the il dominant frequency of the flexible cylinder increases rapidly with the reduced velocity and the six order mode vibration can be excited in the il direction compared to the cf vibrations more frequency components are observed in the il vibrations fig 14 shows the il added mass coefficients versus the reduced velocity in the lock in regions ca x shows a downward trend until the end of the lock in region when the il vibrations enter the next order mode ca x suddenly reaches a high value the ca x values of the two staggered cylinders are remarkably different from that of the single cylinder the il vibration mode of the two staggered cylinders switches frequently at v r 10 02 16 28 xu et al 2020a during the mode switch many frequency components are included in the il vibrations of the two staggered cylinders which considerably affects the values of ca x hence the ca x values of the two staggered cylinders significantly fluctuate in the above range of reduced velocity fig 15 shows the time frequency diagram of the il displacement of the upstream cylinder at v r 12 52 for s d 2 t d 4 and s d 3 t d 8 the il vibrations of the upstream cylinder contain more frequency components compared to the il vibrations of the single cylinder when the spacing ratio is small s d 2 and 3 the downstream cylinder has a strong interaction with the shear layer or the vortices of the upstream cylinder which may disturb the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder and lead to many frequency components in the il vibrations of the upstream cylinder the multi frequency components result in the lower ca x values of the upstream cylinders however for s d 6 and t d 8 only one prominent frequency component is observed in the il vibrations of the upstream cylinder ca x of the upstream cylinder is close to that of the single cylinder for s d 6 and t d 8 at v r 12 52 as shown in fig 16 the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder have a prominent frequency component with a high value and a secondary frequency component with a low value at v r 12 52 the frequency components in the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder are similar to those of the single cylinder which is consistent with the results of hover and triantafyllou 2001 however the downstream cylinder has a larger ca x value than the single cylinder at v r 12 52 which results from the variation of the il displacements xu et al 2020a due to the upstream cylinder the maximum rms of il displacements of the downstream cylinder reaches a prominent value before v r 12 52 at v r 12 52 the il displacements of the downstream cylinder decrease suddenly for the single cylinder the il vibrations are dominated by the third order mode and reach a peak at v r 12 52 hence the larger ca x values of the downstream cylinder can be attributed to the sudden decrease in il displacements for s d 2 and t d 8 the downstream cylinder has considerably larger ca x values than the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder which is related to the wiv vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has an obvious impact on the downstream cylinder leading to the distinct features of the il vibrations fig 17 shows the time frequency curve of the il displacements of the downstream cylinder in the lock in regions and mode switch regions for s d 2 and t d 8 viv dominates the vibration in the lock in regions however the dominant frequency fluctuates strongly and the lower frequency component is heavily weighted as shown in fig 17 a in the mode switch regions the dominant frequency is inconsecutive and unstable as shown in fig 17 c furthermore for the downstream cylinder in the case of s d 4 and t d 4 the lower frequency component slightly contributes to the il vibrations hence the larger value of ca x of the downstream cylinder for s d 2 and t d 8 is mainly attributed to the prominent low frequency component fig 18 shows the varying drag coefficients versus the reduced velocity theoretically in each lock in region c d is supposed to have a similar trend as c l for example c d increases first and then decreases after reaching a peak in the fifth order lock in region at v r 20 04 23 80 however this trend is not apparent at v r 10 02 20 04 due to the frequent switching of the vibration modes c d tends to show abrupt changes in the mode switch regions v r 7 52 10 02 12 52 15 03 18 79 20 04 and 23 80 25 05 which results from the fact that the il vibrations include multi frequency components in the mode switch regions compared with the vibration in the cf direction more frequency components are observed in the time frequency diagram of the il displacements as shown in fig 19 generally in the mode switch regions the dominant frequency of cf vibrations fluctuates with time but the higher and lower subharmonic frequency components are weak as shown in fig 19 a however the il vibrations have considerable subharmonic frequency components as shown in fig 19 b sometimes the subharmonic frequency components are highly weighted and it is difficult to define the dominant frequency leading to the district variation of c d in the mode switch regions at v r 5 01 10 02 the vibrations of the two staggered cylinders are at the end of the second order lock in region or the mode switch region the c d values of the two staggered cylinders show remarkable differences from that of the single cylinder especially for the downstream cylinder because il displacement responses contain many frequency components in the mode switch regions c d of the downstream cylinder changes abruptly at v r 5 01 10 02 for s d 4 t d 8 and s d 6 t d 6 8 il vibrations of the downstream cylinder exhibit the features of wake induced flutter a lower frequency component 10 7 hz which is the same as the cf dominant frequency is observed in the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 20 b the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is 10 7 hz while the higher frequency component is 21 37 hz for the upstream cylinder the lower frequency component is very weak and only one prominent frequency is observed as shown in fig 20 a the dominant frequency 10 7 hz of the il vibrations may cause an elliptical trajectory instead of the figure eight trajectory shown by xu et al 2020a the higher frequency component in the il displacement of the downstream cylinder may not be the il dominant frequency but its weight is close to the weight of the il dominant frequency if the weight of the higher frequency component is close to that of the dominant frequency the axial c d distribution of the downstream cylinder still shows a high order mode as shown in fig 21 instead of a low order vibration mode the classic definition of wake induced flutter and its mechanism was first demonstrated in simpson 1971 wake induced flutter is also observed in the fiv of two rigid elastically mounted cylinders in a staggered arrangement assi 2014 mittal and kumar 2001 prasanth and mittal 2009 wake induced flutter usually occurs outside of lock in regions specifically the structural vibration is still controlled by vortex induced vibrations in the lock in regions mittal and kumar 2001 for wake induced flutter and vortex induced vibration viv the ratios of the il dominant frequency and the cf dominant frequency are 1 0 and 2 0 respectively ellipse shaped motion trajectories are usually observed when the cylinder undergoes wake induced flutter however the viv of the cylinder usually shows figure eight trajectories in addition wake induced flutter can cause a significant increase in the il displacements for the two staggered flexible cylinders the il vibration of the downstream cylinder always has a lower frequency that is equal to the cf dominant frequency when wake induced flutter occurs the robust frequency component that is close to the cf dominant frequency in the il vibrations is the main feature to determine whether the wake induced flutter appears the occurrence of the robust lower frequency component indicates that the downstream cylinder of the two staggered flexible cylinders suffers wake induced flutter the higher frequency component in the il displacements of the downstream cylinder is related to the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder it can be concluded that the downstream cylinder shows hybrid features of wake induced flutter and vortex induced vibration the phenomenon of wake induced flutter was also observed in the fiv of two staggered flexible cylinders with unequal diameters xu et al 2020b to show the feature of the hydrodynamic coefficients for each vibration mode fig 22 presents the distribution of the varying drag coefficients of the two staggered cylinders in the case of s d 6 and t d 4 the second order to the sixth order mode vibrations of the upstream cylinder are excited at v r 3 76 11 27 16 28 20 04 and 22 55 respectively for the upstream cylinder the distribution of c d is asymmetric especially when the high order mode vibrations are excited the number of crests in the distribution of c d is equal to the number of vibration modes the distribution of c d of the downstream cylinder shows distinct features compared to that of the upstream cylinder the second order to the fifth order mode vibrations of the downstream cylinder are excited successively with increasing reduced velocity the c d values of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the upstream cylinder the number of crests in the distribution of c d is equal to the number of vibration modes except for v r 11 27 at v r 11 27 the third order vibration mode dominates the il vibrations however the distribution of c d has three obvious crests and an obscure crest this phenomenon is attributed to the multi mode vibrations the fourth order mode also has some contribution to the il vibrations at v r 11 27 which results in the obscure crest the rms values of the il fluctuating force coefficients versus reduced velocity are shown in fig 23 the variation in c xrms has a similar trend with that of c d in several cases c xrms may abruptly change this phenomenon usually occurs on the upstream cylinder in the mode switch regions v r 7 52 10 02 12 52 15 03 18 79 20 04 and 23 80 25 05 resulting from the higher frequency harmonics observed in the il vibrations at v r 5 01 10 02 the vibrations of both cylinders switch gradually from the second order vibration mode to the third order vibration mode due to the mode switch the c xrms values of the two staggered cylinders differ significantly from that of the single cylinder it is noted that the c d and c xrms values of the single cylinder are obviously larger than those of the two staggered cylinders at v r 16 28 and 17 54 as shown in figs 18 and 23 this phenomenon results from the mode switch of the single cylinder the two staggered cylinders switch from the third order vibration mode to the fourth order vibration mode at v r 15 03 xu et al 2020a the dominant frequency at v r 16 28 is relatively stable as shown in fig 24 a however the mode switch of the single cylinder occurs at v r 16 28 and the dominant frequency strongly fluctuates as shown in fig 24 b the existence of other harmonics and the fluctuation of the dominant frequency have some effect on the hydrodynamic force coefficients 5 conclusion the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders were calculated using an inverse analysis method based on the response amplitudes obtained from model tests twelve spacing ratio conditions were considered the lift coefficients varying drag coefficients added mass coefficients and fluctuating force coefficients were discussed to show the fiv hydrodynamic features of two staggered flexible cylinders the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the cf direction the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the two staggered cylinders are significantly different from those of the single cylinder in the mode switch regions the two staggered cylinders have larger cf added mass coefficients than the single cylinder because the vibrations of the two staggered cylinders enter the higher order mode much earlier the downstream cylinders are considerably influenced by vortex shedding from the upstream cylinders for s d 2 and t d 8 wake induced vibration wiv can be observed on the downstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder has large lift coefficients for some large spacing ratios i e s d 3 t d 6 8 s d 4 t d 4 8 s d 6 t d 4 6 the downstream cylinder has slightly larger lift coefficients and cf fluctuating force coefficients than the single cylinder which is related to the outer negative lift peak phenomenon 2 in the il direction the switches of the vibration modes are more frequent and the multiple frequency components in the il displacements are more obvious at approximately v r 10 02 16 28 the upstream cylinder has much lower il added mass coefficients due to the higher order harmonics in the il displacements for s d 2 and t d 8 the il added mass coefficients of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the single cylinder subharmonic frequency components are always observed in the il displacements of the two staggered cylinders which causes that the varying drag coefficients of the two staggered cylinders significantly differ from those of the single cylinder due to the presence of the upstream cylinder the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder show hybrid features of wake induced flutter and vortex induced vibration the conclusions in the present research are based on the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients

21235,the flow induced vibration fiv of two cylindrical structures may cause serious fatigue damage which is a major concern in engineering fields few studies have focused on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two staggered flexible cylinders in this paper the hydrodynamic coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders are calculated using the structural responses acquired from the model tests the cross flow cf spacing ratios are set as 2 3 4 and 6 and the in line il spacing ratios are set as 4 6 8 thus a total of twelve cases are considered the fluctuating forces in the cf and il directions are reconstructed using a finite element model the forgetting factor least squares method is employed to decompose the cf il fluctuating force into lift varying drag and cf il added mass

two staggered cylinders enter the higher order mode earlier resulting in an increase in the cf added mass coefficients the downstream cylinder has larger lift coefficients due to the vortex shedding effect of the upstream cylinders in the il direction the upstream cylinder has lower il added mass coefficients due to the higher order harmonics in the il direction the varying drag coefficients of

street will develop behind the cylinder leading to a variation in the fluid pressure along the cylindrical surface if the cylinder is elastically mounted or flexible vibration will be generated under the effect of varied fluid pressure namely flow induced vibration fiv the fiv features of a single cylinder have been widely studied in many research papers williamson and govardhan 2004 ni et al 2019 zou et al 2019 gao et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 when there are other bodies near the cylinder more complicated dynamic characteristics could be observed owing to the interactions among these bodies huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte et al 2016 chen et al 2019 xu et al 2018 2019 ma et al 2020 structures composed of multiple cylinders such as marine risers mooring cables and submarine pipelines are widely applied in offshore engineering and fivs might cause severe fatigue damage to these slender marine structures li et al 2020 tian et al 2020 two cylinders can be regarded as a basic cell of multiple cylinders and the staggered arrangement is the most common configuration zdravkovich 1987 sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008 zhou and alam 2016 the arrangement of two staggered cylinders can be denoted through the stagger angle a and the spacing ratio p d a refers to the angle between the flow velocity and the line connecting the two cylindrical centres which is in the range of 0 90 p refers to the centre to centre distance between the two staggered cylinders and d is the diameter of the cylinder the arrangement of two staggered cylinders can also be defined through the spacing ratios in both the cross flow cf and in line il directions i e s d and t d respectively s refers to the centre to centre distance in the cf direction and t refers to the centre to centre distance in the il direction in the present research s d and t d are used to define the arrangement of the two staggered cylinders hydrodynamic force coefficients are important parameters to understand the fiv features of cylinders there are many studies on the hydrodynamic forces of a single cylinder undergoing fiv sarpkaya 1974 gopalkrishnan 1993 aronsen 2007 however the hydrodynamic force characteristics of multiple cylinders undergoing fiv have attracted little attention in recent years many studies have considered the flow fields and the fluid forces of two fixed rigid cylinders in a staggered arrangement zdravkovich 1977 1987 alam et al 2005 sumner 2010 zhou and alam 2016 at small stagger angles a 15 the downstream cylinder is greatly influenced by the upstream cylinder including the shielding effect and the vortices effect however the upstream cylinder is remarkably affected by the downstream cylinder only at small spacing ratios as the stagger angles are larger than 15 the downstream cylinder is out of the shear layers of the upstream cylinder the flow interactions between the two cylinders are named by the proximity interference notably for some specific stagger angles and spacing ratios the inner negative lift peak at p d 1 8 2 1 and a 10 and outer negative lift peak at p d 3 5 and a 25 can be observed on the downstream cylinder in the cf direction these phenomena result from the wake flow or vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder zhou and alam 2016 previous researchers have also divided the stagger angles and spacing ratios into several regions to show the characteristics of wake patterns and fluid forces zdravkovich 1987 defined four flow regions proximity interference region wake interference region wake and proximity interference region and no interference region this classification is widely accepted and guides the investigation of two staggered cylinders undergoing fiv sumner et al 2000 divided the configuration into nine flow regions based on various stagger angles and wake patterns there are three single bluff body flow patterns single bluff body type 1 ssb1 at p d 1 0 1 125 and a 0 45 single bluff body type 2 ssb2 at p d 1 0 1 125 and a 45 90 and base bleed bb at p d 1 125 1 25 and a 45 90 shear layer reattachment slr at p d 1 125 4 0 and a 0 20 induced separation is at p d 1 125 3 0 and a 10 30 and vortex impingement vi at p d 3 0 5 0 and a 0 20 can be categorized as small incidence angle flow patterns large incidence angle flow patterns also include three subclasses vortex pairing and enveloping vpe at p d 1 25 3 5 and a 20 45 vortex pairing splitting and enveloping vpe at p d 1 25 4 0 and a 20 90 and synchronized vortex shedding svs at p d 1 5 5 0 and a 15 90 hu and zhou 2008 found five flow regions according to the wake patterns the first three flow patterns include the single street modes including mode s ia at p d 1 2 and a 0 90 p d 1 5 and a 20 mode s ib at p d 1 5 and a 10 and mode s ii at 1 2 p d 2 5 and a 20 1 5 p d 4 0 and 10 a 20 the other two flow patterns are twin street modes namely mode t i at p d 2 5 and 20 a 88 and mode t ii at p d 2 5 and a 88 alam et al 2005 studied the mean fluid force coefficients and fluctuating fluid force coefficients of two staggered cylinders in detail and they plotted cloud diagrams to show the fluid force coefficients when the two staggered cylinders are elastically mounted the fluid forces of two cylinders are more complicated than those of two fixed rigid cylinders the tandem arrangement is the limiting case a 0 of the stagger arrangement therefore comparative studies of tandem and staggered arrangements have been conducted by many investigators hover and triantafyllou 2001 mittal and kumar 2001 prasanth and mittal 2009 assi 2014 for two staggered cylinders the downstream cylinder is influenced by vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is in the wake region of the upstream cylinder a phenomenon similar to wake induced vibration wiv in the tandem arrangement was experimentally observed assi 2014 if the downstream cylinder of two staggered cylinders can vibrate in the cf and il directions the fluid forces on the downstream cylinder are unsteady due to the asymmetry of the mean wake a phenomenon called wake induced flutter might be generated on the downstream cylinder mittal and kumar 2001 assi 2014 the il dominant frequency decreases significantly and the il displacement increases therefore the motion trajectory of the downstream cylinder is an ellipse instead of the common figure eight shape notably wake induced flutter usually occurs outside of lock in regions i e the structural vibration is still controlled by the vortex induced vibration in the lock in regions mittal and kumar 2001 in addition alam and kim 2009 conducted a series of model tests on two staggered cylinders at several stagger angles a 5 10 15 25 45 and 60 and a larger range of spacing ratios p d 1 1 4 2 the two cylinders vibrated only in the cf direction they identified seven vibration modes based on the vibration characteristics of the two cylinders prasanth and mittal 2009 carried out a numerical study of two staggered cylinders undergoing fiv the two cylinders were free to vibrate in the cf and il directions the spacing ratio combination was set to t d 5 5 and s d 1 0 for the downstream cylinder wake induced flutter occurred and an obvious non zero lift force occurred as a result of the vortex effect griffith et al 2017 numerically studied the fiv of two staggered cylinders with a smaller il spacing ratio t d 1 5 the cf spacing ratio varied from 0 to 5 they identified seven modes based on the vibration characteristics and vortex shedding modes over the map of t d and the reduced velocity vr u f 1 d where f 1 is the natural frequency and u is the uniform flow velocity for mode 1 s d 0 6 vr 4 5 the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder did not enter the gap and passed around the downstream cylinder for mode 3 s d 0 6 0 9 vr 5 5 6 5 a strong gap flow pushed the shear layer of the upstream cylinder through the gap which generated large fluid forces on the downstream cylinder the critical state between mode 1 and mode 3 was defined as mode 2 mode 21 and mode 31 were subregions of mode 2 and mode 3 respectively in the region dominated by the gap flow s d 1 0 the gap flow had a significant influence on the two cylinders when wake pair dominated mode s d 1 4 2 0 appeared pairs of vortex shedding are generated behind each cylinder notably few studies have focused on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two flexible cylinders because the fluid force distribution of the flexible cylinder is difficult to measure directly however several inverse analysis methods have been proposed for reconstructing the hydrodynamic forces of the flexible cylinder song et al 2016 conducted a model test on a flexible cylinder and identified the fluid force coefficients of fiv with a single frequency based on the measured strains liu et al 2018 proposed the forgetting factor least squares method to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients of a flexible cylinder under multi frequency fiv recently xu et al 2018 and han et al 2018a carried out model tests and studied the fiv hydrodynamic features of two side by side flexible cylinders with four spacing ratios s d 3 4 6 and 8 the cf and il fluctuating force coefficients of the two cylinders increased compared to the results of a single cylinder the wake interaction between the two cylinders had a significant effect on the hydrodynamic coefficients in the case of s d 6 xu et al 2021 reconstructed the fluid forces of three and four side by side flexible cylinders undergoing fiv the hydrodynamic characteristics of the inner cylinder in the three cylinder system were different from those of the outer two cylinders the inner two cylinders in the four cylinder system showed remarkable differences between each other compared with the outer two cylinders ma et al 2019 investigated the fiv hydrodynamic features of two tandem flexible cylinders with spacing ratios of t d 4 6 8 10 and 16 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the two cylinders were calculated using the strain data measured from model tests the vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder may be disturbed by the downstream cylinder leading to a decrease in the lift coefficients and the varying drag coefficients of the upstream cylinder due to the presence of the upstream cylinder the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder were affected by the wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect ma et al 2020 experimentally studied the fiv of three flexible cylinders with an equilateral triangular arrangement the spacing ratio was set as 6 0 and the flow incidence angle was 0 30 and 60 the downstream cylinder had an insignificant effect on the hydrodynamic coefficients of the upstream cylinder two robust frequency components were observed from the il displacements of the downstream cylinder which were attributed to the oscillation of the upstream cylinder in engineering applications cylindrical structures such as marine risers and mooring cables always have a large aspect ratio l d l is the length of the structure for a flexible cylinder with a large aspect ratio the interval between the natural frequencies of two adjacent modes is small high order mode vibrations and multi mode vibrations are usually observed when the viv of flexible cylinders occurs lie and kaasen 2006 xu et al 2018 ma et al 2020 which makes the fiv characteristics of flexible cylinders more complicated than those of rigid cylinders little attention has been focused on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two staggered flexible cylinders with a large aspect ratio recently xu et al 2020a conducted model tests on two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv the dominant mode dominant frequency and displacement amplitude of the two staggered flexible cylinders were presented to study the dynamic features the fiv involves complicated fluid structure interactions the investigation of hydrodynamic characteristics is also beneficial for understanding the fiv mechanisms of two staggered flexible cylinders the main aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the spacing ratio on the hydrodynamic coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv the fluctuating force coefficient lift coefficient varying drag coefficient and added mass coefficient are reconstructed by an inverse analysis method to study the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics of two staggered flexible cylinders the remainder of this paper is organized into the following sections the inverse analysis method for identifying the hydrodynamic coefficients is described in section 2 a brief introduction of the model tests is presented in section 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv are discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 a calculation method of the fiv hydrodynamic force the hydrodynamic force of flexible cylinders vary with the axial position many load sensors are required to measure the distribution of the hydrodynamic force the utilization of load sensors can disturb the flow around a flexible cylinder which affects the fiv characteristics hence it is difficult to measure the hydrodynamic force of a flexible cylinder undergoing fiv directly the inverse analysis method can be employed to reconstruct the hydrodynamic coefficients of the flexible cylinder using the displacements huera huarte 2006 calculated the cf and il fluctuating forces of a flexible cylinder undergoing fiv by a finite element method song et al 2016 han et al 2018a 2018b and ma et al 2020 utilized the least squares method to decompose the cf and il fluctuating forces the cf fluctuating force can be decomposed into the part in phase with the vibration velocity namely the lift and the part in phase with the vibration acceleration namely the cf added mass force similarly the il fluctuating force can be decomposed into the varying drag and the il added mass force for two tandem or staggered flexible cylinders multi frequency components are always found in the vibrations of the downstream cylinder due to the effect of the upstream cylinders xu et al 2018 2020a b liu et al 2018 proposed the forgetting factor least squares method to decompose the fluctuating force with multi frequency components subsequently ma et al 2019 identified the hydrodynamic coefficients of two tandem flexible cylinders undergoing multi frequency fiv by the forgetting factor least squares method in the present research the forgetting factor least squares method is applied to decompose the fluctuating force of two staggered flexible cylinders the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients in the cf direction is presented as an example and the il hydrodynamic force coefficients can be calculated similarly the flexible cylinder can be modelled as an euler bernoulli beam and the vibration equation in the cf direction is expressed as follows 1 e i 4 y z t z 4 t 0 2 y z t z 2 c y y z t m s y z t f y z t eq 1 can be transformed into a finite element equation as given in eq 2 2 m s y c y y k e k t y f y the mass matrix m s and structural stiffness matrix k e and k t can be calculated by a finite element method huera huarte 2006 and the structural damping matrix c y can be obtained using the rayleigh damping equation given in eq 3 3 c y λ 1 m s λ 2 k e k t the constants λ 1 and λ 2 can be acquired from the free decay tests all variables on the left side of eq 2 are known in advance f y which is on the right side can be calculated the fluctuating force f y at each node is obtained from the fluid force matrix f y the mean values of the rmss of the fluctuating forces in the cf

weak hence a constant factor β 0 β 1 is introduced into the calculation the data weight of the force and response at each moment can vary with the various sample time moments the data weights are

to the measuring data which enhances the sensitivity of the calculation results in a positive way more detailed demonstrations of the forgetting factor least squares method can be found in liu et al 2018 3 model tests 3 1 experimental arrangement xu et al 2020a conducted model tests on two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv and studied the dynamic characteristics of fiv the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders were calculated using the response amplitudes acquired from the model tests in xu et al 2020a during the model tests the experimental apparatus in fig 1 was towed by a carriage to simulate a uniform flow there are twelve cases of spacing ratios in the present research as shown in fig 2 the spacing ratios in the cf direction s d were set as 2 3 4 and 6 while the spacing ratios in the il direction t d were set as 4 6 and 8 the patterns of the interaction between the two staggered cylinders were classified into four regions by zdravkovich 1987 as shown in fig 2 the classification of zdravkovich 1987 is based on two rigid cylinders which is slightly different from that of two flexible cylinders it has been confirmed that the vibration amplitude of a flexible cylinder is slightly larger than that of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder huera huarte et al 2014 therefore the spacing ratio combinations are set to slightly larger values in the present work though the downstream cylinder is mainly in the no interference region classified by zdravkovich 1987 the two flexible cylinders still show significant mutual interactions in these cases the main parameters of the cylinder model are listed in table 1 the two cylinder models have the same parameters the length of the model was 5 60 m and the outer diameter was 16 0 mm the cylinder model was composed of two main parts as shown in fig 3 a the inner part was a copper pipe with an outer diameter of 8 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 0 mm the outer part was a silicone tube with an outer diameter which is the outer diameter of the cylinder of 16 0 mm the silicone tube provided a smooth surface for the cylinder model at one end of the cylinder model a universal joint was applied to avoid torsion the other end was connected to a steel wire and could move freely in the axial direction as shown in fig 1 a spring was connected to the steel wire to ensure gradual tension variation during the model tests the load cell was applied to measure the axial tension xu et al 2020b employed the similar experiment facility to investigated the fiv of two staggered flexible cylinders with unequal diameters along the axis of the cylinder there were seven measurement points i e g1 g7 as shown in fig 3 b at each measurement point two groups of strain gauges were utilized to measure the bending strains in the cf and il directions respectively the towing velocities equal to the flow velocities varied from 0 05 m s to 1 00 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s which correspond to reynolds numbers re of approximately 800 16 000 the reduced velocity vr u f 1 d where f 1 2 49 hz is the fundamental natural frequency in still water is in the range of 1 25 25 05 the rayleigh damping constants can be obtained from the free decay tests the two cylinder models in this paper have been employed to investigate the fiv of the two tandem flexible cylinders in xu et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 the rayleigh damping constants of the cylinder model were presented in table 2 3 2 data processing the strain acquisition occurred over 50s after the towing carriage reached a stable velocity the sampling frequency was set to 100 hz the interval between two consecutive tests was 15 min to ensure that the disturbed water was calm the strain data were filtered with a band of 1 0 40 0 hz to remove low frequency and high frequency noise the vibration displacements were reconstructed using a modal analysis method trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 and the hydrodynamic force coefficients were calculated based on the vibration displacements to obtain the hydrodynamic force coefficients the selection of the forgetting factor must make a compromise between the adaptive capability and the estimation accuracy for a larger forgetting factor the influences of the signal noise are weak but the characteristics of the signal details may be ignored for a smaller forgetting factor the description of the signal details is improved but the effect of the signal noise increases the forgetting factor was set to 0 7 as in ma et al 2019 which is quite suitable for the calculation of the hydrodynamic force coefficients of two tandem flexible cylinders in the present research three forgetting factors 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 were checked to choose the suitable value the original hydrodynamic force f y is decomposed into the lift and the cf added mass force using the forgetting factor least squares method as demonstrated in section 2 f y can be reconstructed based on the lift and the cf added mass force using eq 9 the original force and the reconstructed force of the downstream cylinder based on different μ values are shown in fig 4 for all three forgetting factors the accuracy of the force decomposition is acceptable however when the forgetting factor is 0 8 the description of the signal details is slightly worse than that of the other two forgetting factors fig 5 shows the lift coefficient based on different μ values of the downstream cylinder for μ 0 6 the lift coefficient shows drastic variation at some time points this variation is related to the influence of noise in the signals hence the forgetting factor value was set as 0 7 in the present research 4 results and discussion the displacements of two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv were presented and discussed in xu et al 2020a the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients of the two staggered flexible cylinders were calculated based on the displacement response in xu et al 2020a using the method in section 2 the axial mean values of the hydrodynamic force coefficients were obtained to investigate the influence of spacing ratio on the fiv hydrodynamic characteristics 4 1 cf hydrodynamic force coefficients the added mass force which is in phase with the vibration acceleration is one of the two components of the hydrodynamic force hence the added mass coefficient is an important parameter for determining the hydrodynamic characteristics gopalkrishnan 1993 and aronsen 2007 found that the added mass coefficient is strongly related to the vibration frequency the cf added mass coefficients versus the reduced velocity are shown in fig 6 the variation in ca y of the upstream and downstream cylinders shares a similar trend with that of the single cylinder the dominant modes of the two staggered cylinders and the single cylinder were presented in xu et al 2020a and are not presented here xu et al 2020a found that the mode switch regions of the single cylinder are slightly different from those of two staggered cylinders for the single cylinder the mode switch regions correspond to the reduced velocity in the range of v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 and 23 80 25 05 it is tedious to show the range of reduced velocities in the mode switch regions of two staggered cylinders in each space ratio case thus for the sake of simplification the range of reduced velocities in the mode switch regions of two staggered cylinders is not presented in the mode switch regions v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 and 23 80 25 05 the ca y values of both cylinders abruptly increase in the lock in regions ca y shows a downward variation for s d 2 and t d 4 s d 2 and t d 8 and s d 3 and t d 4 ca y of the downstream cylinder does not show the sudden increase at v r 25 05 this phenomenon is attributed to the fact that the vibrations of the upstream cylinder and single cylinder enter the fourth order mode at v r 25 05 however the vibration of the downstream cylinder is still dominated by the third order mode due to the shielding effect the upstream cylinder shields the downstream cylinder and prevents the downstream cylinder from interacting directly with the free stream which causes the mean wake flow velocity acting on the downstream cylinder to be lower than the free stream velocity xu et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 studied the fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders and found that the downstream cylinder has lower vibration frequency and dominant mode than the upstream cylinder due to the shielding effect to analyse the dominant frequency of the displacements wavelet analysis was employed to obtain the time frequency diagram of the displacement responses the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is quite close to that of the upstream cylinder as shown in fig 7 however the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder shows obvious fluctuations in fig 7 b due to the influence of vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder in the mode switch regions v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 23 80 25 05 multi frequency components are observed in the results of wavelet analysis as shown in fig 8 the values of these frequency components are quite close and the dominant frequency tends to regularly switch from one value to another overall the dominant frequency is unstable and disordered leading to the differences in ca y in the mode switch regions when the cf spacing ratio is 6 ca y of the two staggered cylinders abruptly rises to a high value at v r 22 55 indicating that the vibrations of the two staggered cylinders enter the fourth order vibration mode meanwhile the vibrations of the single cylinder enter the fourth order vibration mode at v r 25 05 the higher order mode vibrations are excited earlier for the two staggered cylinders hence ca y of the two staggered cylinders are larger than that of single cylinders the larger ca y of the two cylinders at v r 16 28 18 79 can also be attributed to this reason the lift which is in phase with the cf vibration velocity is another component of the hydrodynamic force in the cf direction the varying drag is in phase with the il vibration velocity the lift coefficients and the varying drag coefficients are closely related to both the vibration displacement and the response frequency gopalkrishnan 1993 aronsen 2007 similar to the upper and lower branches of the vibration displacement c l reaches a relatively high value first and then decreases until the end of the lock in region sarpkaya 1995 for an elastically mounted rigid cylinder the vibration displacement in the cf direction decreases to nearly zero when the reduced velocity exceeds the lock in region only a weak random vibration can be observed and the lift coefficient is close to zero however for a flexible cylinder non zero lift coefficient and vibration displacement are observed in the cf direction due to the multi mode vibrations the lift coefficients of the two staggered cylinders versus reduced velocity are presented in fig 9 at low reduced velocities the variation in c l of the two staggered cylinders shows a similar trend with that of the single cylinder in the mode switch regions v r 6 26 7 52 17 54 18 79 23 80 25 05 the c l values of the upstream and downstream cylinders show considerable differences from that of the single cylinder due to the multi frequency components for some large spacing ratios s d 3 t d 6 8 s d 4 t d 4 8 s d 6 t d 4 6 the downstream cylinder has slightly larger lift coefficients than the single cylinder especially at v r 8 77 12 52 mainly in the second order vibration mode this phenomenon is probably related to the outer negative lift peak which has been widely observed on two rigid staggered cylinders zdravkovich 1987 zhou and alam 2016 the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has a higher flow velocity and a lower fluid pressure than the outer free flow a pressure differential can be generated when these vortices pass through the inner side of the downstream cylinder which results in larger lift coefficients for spacing ratios of s d 2 and t d 4 the vortices may directly attach to the front part of the downstream cylinder instead of passing through the inner side hence c l of the downstream cylinder for s d 2 and t d 4 is quite similar to that of the single cylinder at v r 8 77 12 52 notably the two cylinders have larger c l values than that of the single cylinder at v r 13 78 17 54 a similar phenomenon also occurs for the ca y of the two cylinders as shown in fig 7 the cf vibrations of the two cylinders are usually under the second order vibration mode at v r 13 78 17 54 while the il vibration mode shifts from the third order to the fourth order and the il dominant frequency shows an abrupt change at approximately v r 13 78 15 03 for the fiv of the single cylinder the il vibrations considerably affect the cf vibrations jauvtis and williamson 2003 2004 for the fiv of the two staggered cylinders the mode switch of the il vibration can affect the cf vibrations the cf and il dominant frequencies for s d 3 and t d 4 are shown in fig 10 as an example st f s d u where f s is the vortex shedding frequency is the strouhal number for the two staggered cylinders the il dominant frequencies shift to higher values at v r 15 03 similar behaviours can also be observed in the cf direction although the cf vibration is still under the same dominant mode xu et al 2020a for the single cylinder the cf and il dominant frequencies abruptly change at v r 16 28 multi frequency components have obvious influences on the vibration when the mode switch occurs i e the switch of the dominant frequency such influences can also be confirmed by the variation in hydrodynamic force coefficients as shown in fig 11 the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the two staggered cylinders show different axial distributions from those of the single cylinder remarkable differences also exist in the mean values of these force coefficients in fig 9 specifically for a spacing ratio of s d 2 and t d 8 the downstream cylinder has obviously larger c l values at v r 15 03 21 29 compared with the downstream cylinder under the other spacing ratio considerable fluctuations are observed in the wavelet time frequency diagram as shown in fig 12 these phenomena indicate that the downstream cylinder in the case of s d 2 and t d 8 is significantly affected by the vortex the downstream cylinder has a slightly larger ca y and slightly lower dominant frequency indicating the appearance of wake induced vibrations wivs assi 2009 2014 it appears that the effect of the spacing ratio on the hydrodynamic coefficients depends on the velocity at low reduced velocities the differences in c l between the two staggered cylinders and single cylinder are small significant differences in c l are observed when the reduced velocity exceeds 11 27 huang and herfjord 2013 found that the upstream cylinder always had a larger mean drag than the downstream cylinder which caused the mean il displacement of the downstream cylinder to be smaller than that of the upstream cylinder when the two cylinders reach their respective equilibrium positions the actual spacing ratio may be smaller than the initial spacing ratio hence the actual spacing ratio decreases with increasing velocity which enhances the interaction between the two cylinders at high reduced velocities in the case of v r 11 27 the difference in c l between the upstream cylinder decreases with increasing spacing ratio the c l value of the upstream cylinder is close to that of the single cylinder except for s d 2 0 and t d 4 0 when the reduced velocity is less than 11 27 the c l value of the downstream cylinder depends on the cf spacing ratio for s d 2 0 and 3 0 the c l value of the downstream cylinder in the case of t d 4 0 is similar to that of the upstream cylinder and single cylinder the downstream cylinder has larger c l values when the il spacing ratio t d is 6 0 and 8 0 when the cf spacing ratio increases to 4 0 and 6 0 the c l value of the downstream cylinder is larger than that of the upstream cylinder regardless of the il space ratio when the reduced velocity exceeds 11 27 the c l value of the two staggered cylinders is considerably different from that of a single flexible cylinder under all spacing ratio cases fig 13 shows the rms of the fluctuating force coefficient in the cf direction the c yrms values of two staggered cylinders show similar trends with that of the single cylinder in each lock in region the c yrms value reaches a peak value and then decreases gradually until the end of the lock in region at low reduced velocities the cf spacing ratio has a significant effect on the c yrms value of the upstream cylinder as s d 3 0 the c yrms value of the upstream cylinder shows remarkable differences from that of the single cylinder which is related to the presence of the downstream cylinder in the case of s d 4 0 the downstream cylinder has a slight influence on the upstream cylinder which makes the c yrms value of the upstream cylinder close to that of the single cylinder for some larger spacing ratios i e s d 3 t d 6 8 s d 4 t d 4 8 s d 6 t d 4 6 the c yrms value of the downstream cylinder is slightly larger than that of the upstream cylinder and single cylinder which is consistent with the phenomenon of the outer negative lift peak for other spacing ratio combinations the c yrms values of the two staggered cylinders show insignificant differences however the ca y and c l values of the two staggered cylinders are not the same in the above cases which indicates that decomposing the fluctuating fluid force into lift and the added mass force is necessary to further understand fiv hydrodynamic features 4 2 il hydrodynamic force coefficients the il dominant frequency of the flexible cylinder increases rapidly with the reduced velocity and the six order mode vibration can be excited in the il direction compared to the cf vibrations more frequency components are observed in the il vibrations fig 14 shows the il added mass coefficients versus the reduced velocity in the lock in regions ca x shows a downward trend until the end of the lock in region when the il vibrations enter the next order mode ca x suddenly reaches a high value the ca x values of the two staggered cylinders are remarkably different from that of the single cylinder the il vibration mode of the two staggered cylinders switches frequently at v r 10 02 16 28 xu et al 2020a during the mode switch many frequency components are included in the il vibrations of the two staggered cylinders which considerably affects the values of ca x hence the ca x values of the two staggered cylinders significantly fluctuate in the above range of reduced velocity fig 15 shows the time frequency diagram of the il displacement of the upstream cylinder at v r 12 52 for s d 2 t d 4 and s d 3 t d 8 the il vibrations of the upstream cylinder contain more frequency components compared to the il vibrations of the single cylinder when the spacing ratio is small s d 2 and 3 the downstream cylinder has a strong interaction with the shear layer or the vortices of the upstream cylinder which may disturb the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder and lead to many frequency components in the il vibrations of the upstream cylinder the multi frequency components result in the lower ca x values of the upstream cylinders however for s d 6 and t d 8 only one prominent frequency component is observed in the il vibrations of the upstream cylinder ca x of the upstream cylinder is close to that of the single cylinder for s d 6 and t d 8 at v r 12 52 as shown in fig 16 the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder have a prominent frequency component with a high value and a secondary frequency component with a low value at v r 12 52 the frequency components in the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder are similar to those of the single cylinder which is consistent with the results of hover and triantafyllou 2001 however the downstream cylinder has a larger ca x value than the single cylinder at v r 12 52 which results from the variation of the il displacements xu et al 2020a due to the upstream cylinder the maximum rms of il displacements of the downstream cylinder reaches a prominent value before v r 12 52 at v r 12 52 the il displacements of the downstream cylinder decrease suddenly for the single cylinder the il vibrations are dominated by the third order mode and reach a peak at v r 12 52 hence the larger ca x values of the downstream cylinder can be attributed to the sudden decrease in il displacements for s d 2 and t d 8 the downstream cylinder has considerably larger ca x values than the single cylinder and the upstream cylinder which is related to the wiv vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder has an obvious impact on the downstream cylinder leading to the distinct features of the il vibrations fig 17 shows the time frequency curve of the il displacements of the downstream cylinder in the lock in regions and mode switch regions for s d 2 and t d 8 viv dominates the vibration in the lock in regions however the dominant frequency fluctuates strongly and the lower frequency component is heavily weighted as shown in fig 17 a in the mode switch regions the dominant frequency is inconsecutive and unstable as shown in fig 17 c furthermore for the downstream cylinder in the case of s d 4 and t d 4 the lower frequency component slightly contributes to the il vibrations hence the larger value of ca x of the downstream cylinder for s d 2 and t d 8 is mainly attributed to the prominent low frequency component fig 18 shows the varying drag coefficients versus the reduced velocity theoretically in each lock in region c d is supposed to have a similar trend as c l for example c d increases first and then decreases after reaching a peak in the fifth order lock in region at v r 20 04 23 80 however this trend is not apparent at v r 10 02 20 04 due to the frequent switching of the vibration modes c d tends to show abrupt changes in the mode switch regions v r 7 52 10 02 12 52 15 03 18 79 20 04 and 23 80 25 05 which results from the fact that the il vibrations include multi frequency components in the mode switch regions compared with the vibration in the cf direction more frequency components are observed in the time frequency diagram of the il displacements as shown in fig 19 generally in the mode switch regions the dominant frequency of cf vibrations fluctuates with time but the higher and lower subharmonic frequency components are weak as shown in fig 19 a however the il vibrations have considerable subharmonic frequency components as shown in fig 19 b sometimes the subharmonic frequency components are highly weighted and it is difficult to define the dominant frequency leading to the district variation of c d in the mode switch regions at v r 5 01 10 02 the vibrations of the two staggered cylinders are at the end of the second order lock in region or the mode switch region the c d values of the two staggered cylinders show remarkable differences from that of the single cylinder especially for the downstream cylinder because il displacement responses contain many frequency components in the mode switch regions c d of the downstream cylinder changes abruptly at v r 5 01 10 02 for s d 4 t d 8 and s d 6 t d 6 8 il vibrations of the downstream cylinder exhibit the features of wake induced flutter a lower frequency component 10 7 hz which is the same as the cf dominant frequency is observed in the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 20 b the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is 10 7 hz while the higher frequency component is 21 37 hz for the upstream cylinder the lower frequency component is very weak and only one prominent frequency is observed as shown in fig 20 a the dominant frequency 10 7 hz of the il vibrations may cause an elliptical trajectory instead of the figure eight trajectory shown by xu et al 2020a the higher frequency component in the il displacement of the downstream cylinder may not be the il dominant frequency but its weight is close to the weight of the il dominant frequency if the weight of the higher frequency component is close to that of the dominant frequency the axial c d distribution of the downstream cylinder still shows a high order mode as shown in fig 21 instead of a low order vibration mode the classic definition of wake induced flutter and its mechanism was first demonstrated in simpson 1971 wake induced flutter is also observed in the fiv of two rigid elastically mounted cylinders in a staggered arrangement assi 2014 mittal and kumar 2001 prasanth and mittal 2009 wake induced flutter usually occurs outside of lock in regions specifically the structural vibration is still controlled by vortex induced vibrations in the lock in regions mittal and kumar 2001 for wake induced flutter and vortex induced vibration viv the ratios of the il dominant frequency and the cf dominant frequency are 1 0 and 2 0 respectively ellipse shaped motion trajectories are usually observed when the cylinder undergoes wake induced flutter however the viv of the cylinder usually shows figure eight trajectories in addition wake induced flutter can cause a significant increase in the il displacements for the two staggered flexible cylinders the il vibration of the downstream cylinder always has a lower frequency that is equal to the cf dominant frequency when wake induced flutter occurs the robust frequency component that is close to the cf dominant frequency in the il vibrations is the main feature to determine whether the wake induced flutter appears the occurrence of the robust lower frequency component indicates that the downstream cylinder of the two staggered flexible cylinders suffers wake induced flutter the higher frequency component in the il displacements of the downstream cylinder is related to the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder it can be concluded that the downstream cylinder shows hybrid features of wake induced flutter and vortex induced vibration the phenomenon of wake induced flutter was also observed in the fiv of two staggered flexible cylinders with unequal diameters xu et al 2020b to show the feature of the hydrodynamic coefficients for each vibration mode fig 22 presents the distribution of the varying drag coefficients of the two staggered cylinders in the case of s d 6 and t d 4 the second order to the sixth order mode vibrations of the upstream cylinder are excited at v r 3 76 11 27 16 28 20 04 and 22 55 respectively for the upstream cylinder the distribution of c d is asymmetric especially when the high order mode vibrations are excited the number of crests in the distribution of c d is equal to the number of vibration modes the distribution of c d of the downstream cylinder shows distinct features compared to that of the upstream cylinder the second order to the fifth order mode vibrations of the downstream cylinder are excited successively with increasing reduced velocity the c d values of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the upstream cylinder the number of crests in the distribution of c d is equal to the number of vibration modes except for v r 11 27 at v r 11 27 the third order vibration mode dominates the il vibrations however the distribution of c d has three obvious crests and an obscure crest this phenomenon is attributed to the multi mode vibrations the fourth order mode also has some contribution to the il vibrations at v r 11 27 which results in the obscure crest the rms values of the il fluctuating force coefficients versus reduced velocity are shown in fig 23 the variation in c xrms has a similar trend with that of c d in several cases c xrms may abruptly change this phenomenon usually occurs on the upstream cylinder in the mode switch regions v r 7 52 10 02 12 52 15 03 18 79 20 04 and 23 80 25 05 resulting from the higher frequency harmonics observed in the il vibrations at v r 5 01 10 02 the vibrations of both cylinders switch gradually from the second order vibration mode to the third order vibration mode due to the mode switch the c xrms values of the two staggered cylinders differ significantly from that of the single cylinder it is noted that the c d and c xrms values of the single cylinder are obviously larger than those of the two staggered cylinders at v r 16 28 and 17 54 as shown in figs 18 and 23 this phenomenon results from the mode switch of the single cylinder the two staggered cylinders switch from the third order vibration mode to the fourth order vibration mode at v r 15 03 xu et al 2020a the dominant frequency at v r 16 28 is relatively stable as shown in fig 24 a however the mode switch of the single cylinder occurs at v r 16 28 and the dominant frequency strongly fluctuates as shown in fig 24 b the existence of other harmonics and the fluctuation of the dominant frequency have some effect on the hydrodynamic force coefficients 5 conclusion the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients of two staggered flexible cylinders were calculated using an inverse analysis method based on the response amplitudes obtained from model tests twelve spacing ratio conditions were considered the lift coefficients varying drag coefficients added mass coefficients and fluctuating force coefficients were discussed to show the fiv hydrodynamic features of two staggered flexible cylinders the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the cf direction the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the two staggered cylinders are significantly different from those of the single cylinder in the mode switch regions the two staggered cylinders have larger cf added mass coefficients than the single cylinder because the vibrations of the two staggered cylinders enter the higher order mode much earlier the downstream cylinders are considerably influenced by vortex shedding from the upstream cylinders for s d 2 and t d 8 wake induced vibration wiv can be observed on the downstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder has large lift coefficients for some large spacing ratios i e s d 3 t d 6 8 s d 4 t d 4 8 s d 6 t d 4 6 the downstream cylinder has slightly larger lift coefficients and cf fluctuating force coefficients than the single cylinder which is related to the outer negative lift peak phenomenon 2 in the il direction the switches of the vibration modes are more frequent and the multiple frequency components in the il displacements are more obvious at approximately v r 10 02 16 28 the upstream cylinder has much lower il added mass coefficients due to the higher order harmonics in the il displacements for s d 2 and t d 8 the il added mass coefficients of the downstream cylinder are much larger than those of the single cylinder subharmonic frequency components are always observed in the il displacements of the two staggered cylinders which causes that the varying drag coefficients of the two staggered cylinders significantly differ from those of the single cylinder due to the presence of the upstream cylinder the il vibrations of the downstream cylinder show hybrid features of wake induced flutter and vortex induced vibration the conclusions in the present research are based on the fiv hydrodynamic force coefficients reconstructed from model tests the wake patterns of two staggered flexible cylinders undergoing fiv are still unknown further investigation into the wake patterns of two staggered flexible cylinders

naval architecture indian institute of technology kharagpur kharagpur west bengal 721302 india corresponding author bragg scattering of surface gravity waves by a slender pile supported submerged wavy porous plate is studied under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory the waves past porous barriers are modeled using linearized pressure drop boundary condition known as darcy law numerical solution for the boundary value problem is obtained using the multi domain boundary element method and the outcomes are validated with known results in the literature for different wave and structural parameters such as the effect of the number of ripples of the wavy plate effect of the relative ripple amplitude relative plate length plate porosities and relative submergence depth various physical quantities of interests like reflection and transmission coefficients vertical force and horizontal force coefficients are computed and analyzed the study reveals that bragg scattering occurs in the water of shallow and intermediate depth for a wavy plate having more than two ripples and wave reflection increases with an increase in the amplitude of the wavy plate for higher wavenumber or with an increase in plate length bragg scattering with harmonic and sub harmonic peaks in the reflection coefficients are noticed in the case of wavy plate irrespective of permeability unlike the oscillatory decreasing pattern in the case of a flat plate wave forces exerted on the submerged plate decreases significantly with the introduction of structural porosity due to the dissipation of wave energy moreover an increase in the number of ripples and ripple amplitude reduces the wave transmission thus improving the overall performance for a wide range of frequencies the study will be useful in the design of effective breakwaters for mitigating wave effects in the marine environment keywords bragg scattering submerged wavy plate reflection coefficient permeable structure surface gravity waves breakwater 1 introduction the breakwaters are commonly employed at a finite distance from the shore to protect the beaches the selection of the breakwater is often based on the availability of raw materials project investments service life etc of the total project capital investments 75 of the cost is attributed to raw materials the breakwaters are broadly divided into two types namely i thick porous structures and ii thin porous structures in the recent past as there is a growing scarcity of raw materials in many countries thin porous structures have gained importance among the coastal engineers and the policymakers these thin porous structures can be oriented either horizontally or vertically a few of the advantages of horizontal porous barriers are minimal structural complexity less dependency of geotechnical bottom seabed profile cost effective eco friendly does not affect the quality of water and no visual hindrance to natural sea early studies on submerged horizontal plate confirmed that an impermeable structure attracts more loads on to the piles handling higher design loads is not cost effective as far as offshore structure is concerned study shows that to mitigate the effect of higher loads on the offshore structure the introduction of porosity is one of efficient way which also enhances the functionality see yu 2002 as the mitigation of the effect of wave attack vulnerability is desired in a structural design point of view while having a higher reflection coefficient a careful selection of porosity is essential many theoretical approaches and experiments have been put forth by various researchers to know the effect of hydrodynamic performances on a solid horizontal plate early studies started with heins 1950 and burke 1964 who studied the performance of horizontal rigid barrier of finite and infinite width respectively using the wiener hopf technique and their study reported the scattering coefficients such as the reflection and transmission of the barrier siew and hurley 1977 used a novel matching asymptotic method to obtain the solution for the submerged horizontal plate under a long wave approximation patarapanich 1984a analyzed wave reflection using the method developed by siew and hurley 1977 and discussed the maximum and zero reflection conditions by accessing the energy fluxes nearby a horizontal plate further patarapanich 1984b applied the finite element method for calculating wave forces and reflection and transmission coefficients due to wave scattering of a horizontal plate for a wide range of water depth from deep water to shallow water from the experiments of kojima et al 1990 for a fixed and submerged horizontal plate of finite length decomposition of regular and irregular waves due to substantial change of spectrum of transmitted waves are observed which results in a significant reduction of wave period an extensive literature survey presented by yu 2002 illustrates the recent development for a submerged horizontal plate used in coastal and offshore engineering to control the surface gravity waves physical model tests carried by neelamani and reddy 1992 for a different submerged depth of horizontal plate demonstrated that wave reflection and dissipation energy performs better when the ratio between submerged depth to water depth is 0 85 1 0 the prime objective of the research on the horizontal plate is to increase the performance by achieving higher reflection and lower transmission coefficients by introducing porosity the reduction of hydrodynamic forces acting on the submerged horizontal structure is observed along with the transmission coefficient yu and chwang 1994 found that a reasonably moderate value of porosity reduces vertical wave forces and at the same time more energy dissipation usha and gayathri 2005 carried out an analytical study and demonstrated the effectiveness of the twin horizontal plate compared to a single submerged horizontal plate further this study was verified experimentally by neelamani and gayathri 2006 to confirm the better performance of the twin plate than the single plate wave transmission through multi layers of horizontal plates was conducted by wang et al 2006 their study revealed that there is a significant reduction of wave energy but higher uplift forces were noticed cho and kim 2013 carried out theoretical and experimental studies on the submerged horizontal porous plate and showed that there exists an optimal porosity and submerged depth for a single horizontal plate to decrease the wave force and higher energy dissipation further the study also confirms that an increasing number of the plate helps in energy dissipation cho et al 2013 analyzed a dual horizontal porous plate and illustrated a very good performance for some certain combinations of wave and structural parameters one of the widely used method for analyzing wave structure interaction problems is the multi domain boundary element method some of the useful application include the works of yu and chwang 1994 lee 1995 cho et al 2013 bakhti et al 2017 vijay et al 2020 various methods have been established to deal with the infinite fluid domain by converting it to a finite domain without the loss of generality one of the most effective methods the fundamental singularity distribution method defined by bai and yeung 1974 has been widely adopted for truncating the infinite radiation boundary which was initially used for calculating added mass coefficients for horizontal and vertical cylinders further a hybrid integral method with an analytical solution for radiation condition was implemented by liu and abbaspour 1982 as mentioned in bird and shepherd 1984 for most of the engineering application free surface can be truncated with five time of the structural dimension which is sufficient for dealing with the far field boundary where the local effects are negligible i e the contribution of evanescent modes in the global hydrodynamic behavior though analytical studies such as eigenfunction method are computationally efficient they are generally cumbersome to deal with as it involves lengthy complex expressions and by virtue it is restricted to rectilinear structural shapes on the other hand the multi domain boundary element method is advantageous for the structure of irregular shapes and multiple structures further they are widely used for studies involving variable topography however as the number of structures increases the requirement to create multiple regions may sometimes messy and computationally time consuming the study on wave reflection characteristics due to seabed undulation has been studied by many researchers a resonating phenomenon was noticed at frequencies when the wave number corresponding to seabed undulation is twice the surface wave number that results in a high reflection coefficient this is termed as bragg reflection davies and heathershaw 1984 performed an experimental study to understand the behavior of the wave reflection on the sinusoidal seabed on the other side a theoretical study also conducted by many researchers such as o hare and davies 1992 and suh et al 1997 using various numerical models kirby and anton 1990 further extended the study and observed peak at 2 k w k r 2 in addition to the peak at 2 k w k r 1 where k w is the wavenumber of the surface gravity waves and k r is the wavenumber of the ripple wave at seabed topography guazzelli et al 1992 used a doubly sinusoidal profile and conducted experiments to observe the higher order bragg reflection zhang et al 1999 extended the work of kirby and anton 1990 using the hybrid model and studied the interaction of surface wave interaction with the slow and rapidly varying undulated bottom profile by increasing the number of sinusoidal ripple wavelengths bragg reflection improved showing more sub harmonic peaks and the overall performance range also enhanced cho 2000 analyzed the propagation of both normal and oblique incident wave propagation over singly and doubly sinusoidal seabed topographies on the other hand parsons and martin 1994 investigated the wave scattering by submerged curved plate and surface piercing curved plate using chebyshev expansions and collocation technique the experimental and numerical study performed by jeon and cho 2006 on multiple trapezoidal breakwaters placed on the bottom to check the effect of bragg reflection yueh et al 2018 adopted the concept of the undulated seabed on to the submerged thin wavy impermeable plate and studied the hydrodynamic behavior using dual boundary element method bem to the best of the author s knowledge gravity wave interaction with a submerged

in place by a group of slender piles in the transverse direction whose effects are considered to be negligible in the process of wave transformation known results in the literature are reproduced to check the validity of the present model the bragg reflection pattern due to increase in the number of ripples of the plate depth of submergence of the plate the relative amplitude of the wavy plate and variation in structural porosity are studied for a range of non dimensional wavenumber and relative plate length by analyzing the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients along with wave loads on the wavy plate 2 mathematical formulation the gravity wave interaction with a wavy porous plate by the normally incident monochromatic waves is analyzed within the framework of two dimensional small amplitude water wave theory in the cartesian coordinate system the positive horizontal x axis is taken in the direction of wave motion and z axis is vertically positive upward with the origin o chosen at the intersection of mean free surface and midpoint of the horizontal wavy plate as shown in fig 1 the wavy plate of width b ripple amplitude d s ripple wavelength λ rpl and the boundary τ s is placed at a submergence height h 1 in the water of finite depth h the number of ripples wavelength calculated by using a sinusoidal waveform m b λ r p l the ratio between the length of the plate and ripple wavelength when the ripple amplitude d s is zero the wavy horizontal plate can be treated as a horizontal flat plate the thickness of the plate is insignificant as compared to the incident wavelength and is presumed as zero the calculation is done with the assumption that the fluid is incompressible inviscid motion is irrotational and simple harmonic in time t with angular

porous plate and a computer program is developed using matlab to analyze the hydrodynamic parameters to verify the correctness of the developed bem code results from the existing known special cases are compared in figs 3 a and b reflection and transmission coefficients against different relative submergence depths are compared with yu and chwang 1994 for an impermeable and porous flat plate both the figures reveal that results obtained using the present model agree well with that of yu and chwang 1994 in figs 4 a and b the effect of sinusoidal seabed profiles is carried out and compared with the experimental results of davies and heathershaw 1984 and numerical results of yueh et al 2018 to maintain consistency similar notations are used for this validation as defined in fig 1 λ r p l is the ripple wavelength of the seabed b is the length of the wavy seabed profile d s is the amplitude of the wavy seabed profile fig 4 reveals that the reflection coefficient for various values of the ratio of twice that of the incident wave number to the ripple wave number of the seabed i e 2 k w k r p l are found very close to that of yueh et al 2018 which is marked in solid line and experimental results from davies and heathershaw 1984 marked in filled square based on the above a sinusoidal wavy form of different ripple wavelengths is taken as a wavy porous plate profile the wave scattering behavior of a horizontal wavy plate is studied using multi domain boundary element method mdbem by analyzing the different hydrodynamic properties in the following sections results related to the wavy porous plate are discussed 4 1 variation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients versus wavenumber in this subsection behaviors of bragg scattering of gravity wave past over a submerged wavy porous plate are studied by analyzing the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against dimensionless wave number k 0 h 4 1 1 effect of number of ripple wavelength figures 5 a and b show the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients against k 0 h for different ripple wavelengths m in the case of an impermeable wavy plate an oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient with different magnitude is observed peak values in the amplitudes of reflection coefficients with higher and lower magnitude are referred to as harmonic and subharmonic peaks fig 5 a reveals that the reflection coefficient is higher for k 0 h close to 2 8 it is understood that for intermediate water depth higher reflection can be achieved by the wavy plate with the increase in the number of ripple wavelengths of the wavy plate the width of the peak is reduced and higher reflection can be attained moreover it is observed that the reflection coefficient attains its maximum value which is close to 0 9 as the number of ripple wavelength m increases to 8 the increase in the peak of the reflection coefficient with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths is due to the combined effect of the back and forth motion of waves within the ripples of the submerged plate along with the superposition of the incident and reflected waves this kind of resonating interaction is known as bragg resonance which occurs in the presence of a wavy plate for 0 k 0 h 3 5 a similar phenomenon was observed in the case of surface wave propagation over submerged sand bars as in davies and heathershaw 1984 and recently in case of wave scattering by an array of trenches by kar et al 2018 the effect of bragg resonance is insignificant for higher k 0 h where wave energy concentration is less this shows that the wavy plate provides its maximum performance for intermediate water depth in addition to the harmonic peak close to 2 8 sub harmonic peaks are also noticed between the range 0 k 0 h 3 5 it is found that the sub harmonic peaks are increased with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths m figs 5 a and b demonstrate a relationship between the number of ripple wavelength and the number of sub harmonic peaks can be established and found to be in the form m 1 on the other hand fig 5 b demonstrates that the transmission coefficient is low where the reflection coefficient is high which satisfies the energy relation fig 6 exhibits the variations of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against k 0 h for different values of ripple wavelengths m in the case of a submerged porous wavy plate both the figures reveal that with the introduction of porosity harmonic peaks are shifted towards lower wavenumbers k 0 h corresponding to shallower water depths moreover the amplitude of the subharmonic peaks in the reflection coefficients is reduced however the number of peaks before the harmonic peak remains the same further it is observed that for smaller values of m the amplitude of peak in the shallow water region is higher whilst for higher values of m there is a significant reduction in the peak amplitudes of the reflection coefficients in the water of intermediate depth and that of deep water with an increase in the number of ripple wavelength m the number of subharmonic peaks is increased further it may be noted that in the case of m 7 variation in the reflection and transmission coefficients are negligible due to porosity the transmission is low compared to the impermeable wavy plate and higher dissipation is also observed on the other hand with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths higher dissipation is achieved which is close to 90 in other words the wavy plate is most effective for higher ripple wavelength and intermediate porosity further in case of deepwater corresponding to k 0 h π since the wave energy concentration is more on the free surface the submerged plate has a negligible role in reflecting the wave energy whilst a part of the wave energy is dissipated which passes through the submerged plate with the rest being transmitted 4 1 2 effect of relative submergence depth fig 7 demonstrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients against k 0 h for different relative submergence depth of the plate h 1 h for an impermeable wavy plate the variation of the depth of submergence h 1 h lies within the range of 0 4 0 7 since the relative amplitude of the submerged wavy plate is fixed at 0 3 fig 7 a reveals that bragg resonance occurs in the case of a submerged wavy plate irrespective of the depth of submergence of the wavy plate and the number of subharmonic peaks does not change with the change in the depth of submergence however the harmonic peaks are observed for smaller values of wave number when the submerged plate is close to the free surface this may be due to the change of phase of the incident and reflected waves in the presence of the wavy plate moreover wave reflection is higher as the submerged plate is close to the free surface which is due to the reflection of a major part of wave energy concentrating near the free surface it is imperative to note from fig 7 a that in case of an impermeable wavy plate with d s h 0 3 and m 4 the reflection coefficient is close to 0 9 for h 1 h 0 4 at k 0 h 2 a similar observation was observed when a horizontal submerged plate as in patarapanich and cheong 1989 and a submerged wavy plate see yueh et al 2018 is kept close to the free surface on the other hand for larger values of the wavenumber k 0 h a significant reduction in wave reflection occurs irrespective of the depth of submergence of the submerged plate and the pattern is similar to that observed in fig 5 whilst significant effect of the wavy plate on wave reflection is noticed in the water of shallow and intermediate depths the wave transmission pattern is complementary to that of wave reflection which is similar to the observation made in fig 5 b moreover there is a significant amount of energy dissipation occurs by the porous wavy plate for higher values of the wave number corresponding to deep water this also confirms the energy relation k r 2 k t 2 1 fig 8 exhibits the variations in the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients k r k t and k d respectively against k 0 h for different values of depth of submergence of the wavy porous plate h 1 h the patterns of reflection and transmission coefficients are similar to that of a wavy impermeable plate however the amplitude of the reflection coefficient is reduced due to the higher dissipation of wave energy by the wavy plate the number of peaks in the range 0 k 0 h 3 5 is the same as the impermeable wavy plate furthermore the amplitude of the peaks in the shallow water zone is predominant than the intermediate zone with an increase in the depth of submergence h 1 h this indicates that the wavy porous plate can be effectively used in the shallow water zone for the depth of submergence h 1 h 0 6 further lower transmission and higher dissipation are noticed for lower relative water depth as shown in fig 8 b and c fig 9 demonstrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients against k 0 h for different values of the depth of submergence h 1 h in the case of an impermeable flat plate a comparison between figs 7 and 9 reveals that higher reflection close to 20 can be achieved using the wavy plate for a wider range of k 0 h value in shallow water and intermediate water zone on the other hand the effects of porosity on the wavy plate and flat plate are compared in figs 8 and 10 it is noticed that for k 0 h value 2 75 due to the introduction of the porosity increase in reflection coefficient by 20 decrease in transmission coefficient by 20 and increase in dissipation by 10 a comparison of figs 7 a and 8 a and 9 a 10 a on the wavy plate with that of flat plate reveals that bragg scattering occurs in case of wavy submerged plate with subharmonic and harmonic peaks unlike the occurrence of oscillatory decreasing pattern in wave reflection in the case of a submerged flat plate irrespective of plate permeability 4 1 3 effect of relative wavy plate amplitudes fig 11 demonstrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients verses k 0 h for different values of relative amplitudes d s h for an impermeable wavy plate the pattern of wave reflection and transmission is similar to that of fig 5 in the case of a wavy plate with m 4 it is found that with an increase in the relative amplitude of the wavy plate d s h reflection coefficient increases and accordingly transmission coefficient decreases which is due to the reflection of a major part of the wave energy in the case of a wavy plate of higher amplitude however as observed in fig 11 the effect of the relative amplitude d s h on the reflection coefficient is insignificant in the case of deep water for k 0 h 3 75 this is due to the fact that the submerged structure has less influence in reflecting wave energy concentrating near the free surface in case of deep water moreover the lower transmission is observed where wave reflection due to the wavy impermeable plate is high fig 12 illustrates the variation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against wave number k 0 h for different values of relative amplitudes d s h of the wavy porous plate it is observed that the effect of porosity on the reflection coefficient for various relative amplitudes is quite significant as compared to the impermeable wavy plate less wave reflection occurs in the case of a porous plate is due to the dissipation and transmission of wave energy in the case of the horizontal submerged porous plate unlike the case of the impermeable plate peak in the wave reflection occurs in the case of a submerged permeable plate for smaller wavenumbers corresponding to waves in shallow water this is due to the fact that wave propagation is uniform along with the depth in case of shallow water without much energy being dissipated by the porous plate on the other hand a major part of the wave energy is dissipated for higher values of the wavenumber with the subsequent increase in the wavenumber bragg scattering occurs when wave interacts with the submerged porous plate and more energy is dissipated however for higher wave number corresponding to deep water negligible wave reflection occurs as reported earlier in figs 5 and 9 on the other hand figs 12 b and c reveal that wave energy transmission becomes minimum in the water of intermediate depth and dissipation is maximum in case of intermediate water depth further fig 12 reveals that both wave reflection and dissipation increases whilst wave transmission decreases with an increase in the relative amplitudes d s h of the wavy porous plate 4 1 4 effect of porosity in figs 13 and 14 variations of the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients are plotted against k 0 h for different values of porosity g p in case of submerged flat and wavy plates respectively in the case of impermeable submerged plates maximum wave reflection occurs moreover more reflection close to 20 occurs in the case of a wavy plate compared to that of the flat plate further wave reflection follows an oscillatory decreasing pattern for a submerged flat plate with multiple occurrences of zero reflection with an increase in the wavenumber k 0 h whilst bragg resonance occurs in case of a wavy plate as discussed in figs 5 and 9 however with the introduction of structural porosity a major part of the wave energy dissipated in both the cases of flat and wavy plates with minimum transmission and maximum dissipation occurring in case of water of intermediate depth further with an increase in structural porosity the optima in bragg reflection reduces significantly whilst for very high porosity the minima in wave reflection approach to zero in case of a submerged wavy plate like the case of a flat plate this is due to the fact that for higher porosity both the incident and reflected waves propagate with similar phase difference irrespective of the plate configurations however the number of zeros and peaks remains the same as the change in porosity in addition harmonic peaks are found only near the shallow water zone when g p 1 a comparison of fig 14 b and c reveals that the transmission and dissipation coefficients remain the same for g p 0 5 and 1 0 further it is observed that the inertia component of structural porosity significantly reduces wave reflection compared to the case without the inertia component thus suitable porosity is required to choose from the intermediate range of porosity to obtain higher reflection lower transmission and higher dissipation moreover wave reflection is negligible for k 0 h π corresponding to deep water as energy transmission and dissipation dominate irrespective of plate configurations 4 2 variation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients versus plate length in this subsection behaviors of bragg scattering of gravity wave past over a submerged wavy porous plate are studied by analyzing the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against relative plate length b λ 4 2 1 effect of the relative amplitude of wavy plate fig 15 illustrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients verses b λ for different values of relative amplitudes d s h for an impermeable wavy plate it is evident that hydrodynamic properties are varied periodically with the increase in the change in relative plate length in case of a flat plate which is similar to the observation made by newman 1965 yu and chwang 1994 and wang and shen 1999 unlike the case of a flat plate in which maxima in wave reflection occurs when the plate length is an integer multiple of half of the wavelength of the incident waves i e b n λ 2 for wavy plate certain variation occurs which is due to the fact that phase shift among incident and reflected waves for wavy plate does not coincide with 180 out of phase moreover the peak amplitude of the reflected waves attends maximum when the relative plate length becomes close to 1 75 in case of a wavy plate which is due to the combined effect of the resonating pattern developed between each ripple of the wavy plate which has been described as the bragg resonance in fig 5 to obtain a higher wave absorbing performance of the wavy plate suitable plate length is required to be considered moreover with an increase in relative amplitude d s h ratio higher reflection can be achieved on the other hand fig 15 b depicts that the transmission coefficient follows the complementary trend to the reflection coefficient as shown in fig 15 a fig 16 illustrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients verses b λ for different values of relative amplitudes d s h for a porous wavy plate fig 16 a depicts a substantial reduction in the magnitude of the reflection coefficient whilst a similar bragg resonance pattern is observed as in the case of the impermeable plate furthermore due to the introduction of structural porosity figs 16 b and c reveal that wave transmission decreases whilst energy dissipation increases with an increase in the relative amplitude of the wavy permeable plate 4 2 2 effect of number of ripple wavelength fig 17 shows the variations of reflection and transmitted coefficient against b λ for different ripple wavelengths m for an impermeable wavy plate with h 1 h 0 6 d s h 0 3 and h λ 0 25 it is observed that with an increase in relative plate length reflection and transmission coefficients changes in an oscillatory manner with an increase in plate width however the amplitude of oscillation changes due to the change in ripple wavelength m however optima in the reflection and transmission coefficients vary with the length of the plate thus depending upon the stability for the structural integrity and quantity of wave transmission to be allowed relative plate length can be chosen for design consideration moreover it is observed that relative plate length has a significant influence on the peak reflection coefficient due to an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths which is close to 0 9 in the water of intermediate depth it is noticed easily from fig 17 that the harmonic peaks are shifted towards the right along relative plate length for higher ripple wavelength m however a diminishing trend of the reflection coefficient is noticed for higher b λ after the harmonic peak of the corresponding number of ripple wavelengths harmonic peaks are observed when the ripple wavelength m 2 with the occurrence of maximum wave reflection which can be represented empirically as b λ 0 75 m 2 0 5 c where c is the value of b λ for which the first minimum in wave reflection occurs irrespective of ripple wavelength unlike the case of a flat plate the bandwidth of the reflection coefficient curve for which harmonic peak becomes maximum increases with an increase in the ripple wavelength the above observation highlights the performance of a wavy plate as a breakwater compared to that of a flat plate moreover fig 17 b exhibits the complementary trend to that of wave reflection in fig 17 a whilst both the figures for the reflection and transmission coefficients satisfy energy identity k r 2 k t 2 1 fig 18 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficient and transmitted coefficient against b λ for different values of ripple wavelength m in the case of a submerged porous wavy plate fig 18 a illustrates that the optimum magnitude of the reflection coefficient is reduced to 0 25 in case of a porous plate from that of 0 9 in the case of an impermeable plate in addition to a certain decrease in wave transmission whilst a major part of wave energy being dissipated by the permeable wavy plate unlike an impermeable plate the influence of the higher number of ripples marginally affect wave reflection as a major part of the wave energy is dissipated in case of a permeable wavy plate the study reveals that optimum relative length can be decided based on structural stability amount of wave energy to be transmitted for creating a tranquility zone in the marine environment 4 3 forces on wavy plate in the subsequent subsection behaviors of bragg scattering of gravity wave past over a submerged wavy porous plate are studied by understanding the nature horizontal force coefficient and vertical force coefficient acting on the wavy plate 4 3 1 effect of number of ripple wavelength fig 19 exhibits the variations of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against k 0 h for a different number of ripple wavelength m in case of a submerged wavy impermeable plate a comparison between both the subfigures reveals that horizontal force is significantly smaller than the vertical force which is due to the fact that hydrodynamic pressure in the vertical direction acting on the submerged horizontal structure is much higher than in the horizontal direction moreover the vertical forces acting on the structure is predominantly higher for waves in shallow and intermediate depths than that of deep water further it is observed that with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths wave forces exerted on the wavy plate reduces which is due to the increase in wave reflection due to bragg resonance moreover zeros in wave reflection correspond to zeros in the horizontal forces exerted on the wavy plate whilst certain variation occurs in the vertical forces however optima in wave forces are observed alternately with an increase in wave number which is similar to that of fig 5 fig 20 demonstrates the effect of horizontal and vertical forces for different numbers of ripple wavelength in the case of a permeable wavy plate a comparison of figs 19 and 20 reveal that there is a significant reduction in the magnitude of wave forces due to the introduction of structural porosity the oscillatory pattern in the horizontal wave forces remains similar to that of impermeable plates whilst the oscillatory pattern diminishes in the case of vertical forces due to the introduction of structural porosity as maximum wave energy dissipation takes place 4 3 2 effect of relative submergence depth figs 21 and 22 demonstrate the variations of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against k 0 h for different relative submergence depth h 1 h in case of impermeable and permeable wavy plates it is observed that variations in the horizontal forces are comparable in the case of permeable and impermeable submerged plates whilst there is a significant reduction in the vertical wave forces in case of permeable plate compared to that of the impermeable plate moreover higher wave loads in horizontal and vertical directions are observed in the intermediate water depth on the other hand with an increase in k 0 h value wave loads are decreased due to less influence of wave energy on the structure in the subsequent discussion the emphasis is on the vertical forces as horizontal forces have a negligible effect in the case of the wavy plate due to bragg resonance fig 23 reveals that the vertical wave forces exerted on a submerged plate is found to be much less than the corresponding forces in case of a wavy plate irrespective of plate permeability this is due to the bragg reflection of a major part of wave energy by the wavy plate compared to that of a flat plate 4 3 3 variation of wave force versus wavenumber fig 24 demonstrates the variation of vertical force coefficient against k 0 h for different values of relative amplitudes d s h in case of an impermeable wavy plate with g p 0 and a permeable plate with g p 1 both the subfigures reveal that vertical wave forces decrease with an increase in the relative amplitude of the wavy plate however a significant reduction in the magnitude of the vertical force coefficient occurs in the case of the permeable wavy plate compared to that of the impermeable plate this is due to the increase in wave reflection by the wavy plate as discussed in figs 11 and 12 further wave forces decrease in an oscillatory pattern with an increase in wave number which is similar to the observation made in figs 22 and 23 moreover vertical forces become more predominant for waves in shallow water compared to that of waves of intermediate depth and deep water 4 3 4 effect of porosity fig 25 illustrates the variation of the vertical force coefficient k f z against k 0 h in the case of different values of porosity g p for the flat plate and wavy plate it is observed that vertical loads are mitigated due to the introduction of porosity from 0 4 to 0 05 both the sub figures reveal that wave loads decrease in an oscillatory decreasing manner with an increase in k 0 h moreover the number of minima are observed as one less than the number of ripple wavelength in both the wavy plate and flat plate the maximum value of the vertical loads is observed for k 0 h value close to 0 75 a comparison between both the figures reveals that vertical loads on the structure are reduced around 10 when the wavy profile is considered instead of a flat surface vertical loads in both wavy plate and flat is diminished in case of higher wavenumber k 0 h π in the case of permeable plates 4 3 5 variation of wave force versus plate length figs 26 and 27 demonstrate the variations of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against b λ for different values of relative amplitudes d s h in case of an impermeable wavy plate with g p 0 and a permeable plate with g p 1 it is evident that a change in relative plate length horizontal force exerted on the plate is much lower than that of the vertical loads as discussed in figs 19 22 for both impermeable and permeable plates however both the forces follow an oscillatory decreasing pattern with an increase in the relative plate length which is due to the increase in surface area for dissipating wave energy moreover due to the introduction of porosity a considerable amount of reduction in vertical force is noticed with an increase in relative amplitude d s h vertical force coefficient is reduced however there is a marginal increase in the horizontal force coefficient the marginal increase in the horizontal force coefficient is due to the direct impact of wave forces with an increase in the amplitude of the wavy plate unlike the impermeable wavy plate a decreasing pattern with negligible load is observed in the vertical force coefficients for a permeable wavy plate in the case of higher relative plate length b λ the occurrence of optima in vertical wave forces is observed for the same relative plate length irrespective of the relative amplitude of the wavy plate on the other hand a comparison of figs 26 and 27 reveal that optima of the horizontal force coefficient shift along plate length b λ due to change of plate permeability from g p 0 to g p 1 which is due to the phase shift of the incident and reflected waves due to change in plate permeability 4 3 6 effect of number of ripple wavelength figs 28 and 29 demonstrate the variation of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against b λ for different values of ripple wavelength m in case of an impermeable wavy plate with g p 0 and a permeable plate with g p 1 both the figures reveal that the horizontal and vertical loads decrease with an increase in the number of ripples m 2 which is similar to that of figs 26 and 27 this is due to the formation of bragg resonance whose amplitude increases for a higher number of ripples of the submerged wavy plate on the other hand as noted earlier for waves in shallow and intermediate depth with ripple wavelength m 2 wave propagation remains uniform across water depth and less reflection takes place which in turn leads to more wave force being exerted on the plate before it is being transmitted to the open water region moreover due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous plate of multiple ripple wavelength wave forces exerted on the submerged plate decreases for higher values of m which is contrary to the observation made in case of the impermeable plate further it may be noted that for higher values of plate length b λ with a higher number of ripples both vertical and horizontal forces becomes negligible in the case of the porous wavy plate 5 conclusion in the present study surface gravity wave interaction with a horizontal wavy porous structure is studied using the linearized theory of water waves where the wave past porous structure is modeled based on darcy s law the physical problem is studied in the two dimensional fluid domain having a horizontal porous structure placed at a finite submergence depth and the solution for this physical problem is handled using a multi domain boundary element method mdbem method numerical results were validated with known results to confirm the suitability of the developed model and the associated computational results thereafter hydrodynamic properties of engineering interest like reflection transmission dissipation horizontal and vertical force coefficients were obtained various parametric studies have been conducted and comparison among permeable as well as impermeable wavy plates with that of a horizontal flat plate is established which in turn exhibits the applicability of the horizontal wavy porous plate it has been noticed that a suitable parameter is required to be chosen for the optimum performance of the wavy porous plate further it is noticed that due to the bragg resonance in the shallow and intermediate water depth with a higher number of ripples intermediate porosity lower submergence depth and higher relative amplitude reduces the hydrodynamic loads and increases the reflection and dissipation coefficients with a lower transmission coefficient further some important relationship between the number of ripple wavelength to the harmonic peak has been established it is found that the sub harmonic peaks are increased with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths m and the relation between ripple wavelength and the subharmonic peak is found to be m 1 additionally with an increase in plate length harmonic peaks are observed for ripple wavelength greater than two with a maximum wave reflection at the location b λ 0 75 m 2 0 5 c where c is the value of b λ for which the first minimum in wave reflection occurs irrespective of ripple wavelength evidently relevant information for the calculation of suitable relative plate length can be obtained based on the structural stability and quantity of wave to be transmitted it is also observed that the horizontal wavy plate has higher performance than the horizontal impermeable flat plate under the same applicability condition moreover the use of a wavy porous plate enhances the design suitability for an application as a breakwater in a wide range of

porous plate is studied under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory the waves past porous barriers are modeled using linearized pressure drop boundary condition known as darcy law numerical solution for the boundary value problem is obtained using the multi domain boundary element method and the outcomes are validated with known results in the literature for different wave and structural parameters such as the effect of the number of ripples of the wavy plate effect of the relative ripple amplitude relative plate length plate porosities and relative submergence depth various physical quantities of interests like reflection and transmission coefficients vertical force and horizontal force coefficients are computed and analyzed the study reveals that bragg scattering occurs in the water of shallow and intermediate depth for a wavy plate having more than two ripples and wave reflection increases with an increase in the amplitude of the wavy plate for higher wavenumber or with an increase in plate length bragg scattering with harmonic and sub harmonic peaks in the reflection coefficients are noticed in the case of wavy plate irrespective of permeability unlike the oscillatory decreasing pattern in the case of a flat plate wave forces exerted on the submerged plate decreases significantly with the introduction of structural porosity due to the dissipation of wave energy moreover an increase in the number of ripples and ripple amplitude reduces the wave transmission thus improving the overall performance for a wide range of frequencies the study will be useful in the design of effective breakwaters for mitigating wave effects in the marine environment keywords bragg scattering submerged wavy plate reflection coefficient permeable structure surface gravity waves breakwater 1 introduction the breakwaters are commonly employed at a finite distance from the shore to protect the beaches the selection of the breakwater is often based on the availability of raw materials project investments service life etc of the total project capital investments 75 of the cost is attributed to raw materials the breakwaters are broadly divided into two types namely i thick porous structures and ii thin porous structures in the recent past as there is a growing scarcity of raw materials in many countries thin porous structures have gained importance among the coastal engineers and the policymakers these thin porous structures can be oriented either horizontally or vertically a few of the advantages of horizontal porous barriers are minimal structural complexity less dependency of geotechnical bottom seabed profile cost effective eco friendly does not affect the quality of water and no visual hindrance to natural sea early studies on submerged horizontal plate confirmed that an impermeable structure attracts more loads on to the piles handling higher design loads is not cost effective as far as offshore structure is concerned study shows that to mitigate the effect of higher loads on the offshore structure the introduction of porosity is one of efficient way which also enhances the functionality see yu 2002 as the mitigation of the effect of wave attack vulnerability is desired in a structural design point of view while having a higher reflection coefficient a careful selection of porosity is essential many theoretical approaches and experiments have been put forth by various researchers to know the effect of hydrodynamic performances on a solid horizontal plate early studies started with heins 1950 and burke 1964 who studied the performance of horizontal rigid barrier of finite and infinite width respectively using the wiener hopf technique and their study reported the scattering coefficients such as the reflection and transmission of the barrier siew and hurley 1977 used a novel matching asymptotic method to obtain the solution for the submerged horizontal plate under a long wave approximation patarapanich 1984a analyzed wave reflection using the method developed by siew and hurley 1977 and discussed the maximum and zero reflection conditions by accessing the energy fluxes nearby a horizontal plate further patarapanich 1984b applied the finite element method for calculating wave forces and reflection and transmission coefficients due to wave scattering of a horizontal plate for a wide range of water depth from deep water to shallow water from the experiments of kojima et al 1990 for a fixed and submerged horizontal plate of finite length decomposition of regular and irregular waves due to substantial change of spectrum of transmitted waves are observed which results in a significant reduction of wave period an extensive literature survey presented by yu 2002 illustrates the recent development for a submerged horizontal plate used in coastal and offshore engineering to control the surface gravity waves physical model tests carried by neelamani and reddy 1992 for a different submerged depth of horizontal plate demonstrated that wave reflection and dissipation energy performs better when the ratio between submerged depth to water depth is 0 85 1 0 the prime objective of the research on the horizontal plate is to increase the performance by achieving higher reflection and lower transmission coefficients by introducing porosity the reduction of hydrodynamic forces acting on the submerged horizontal structure is observed along with the transmission coefficient yu and chwang 1994 found that a reasonably moderate value of porosity reduces vertical wave forces and at the same time more energy dissipation usha and gayathri 2005 carried out an analytical study and demonstrated the effectiveness of the twin horizontal plate compared to a single submerged horizontal plate further this study was verified experimentally by neelamani and gayathri 2006 to confirm the better performance of the twin plate than the single plate wave transmission through multi layers of horizontal plates was conducted by wang et al 2006 their study revealed that there is a significant reduction of wave energy but higher uplift forces were noticed cho and kim 2013 carried out theoretical and experimental studies on the submerged horizontal porous plate and showed that there exists an optimal porosity and submerged depth for a single horizontal plate to decrease the wave force and higher energy dissipation further the study also confirms that an increasing number of the plate helps in energy dissipation cho et al 2013 analyzed a dual horizontal porous plate and illustrated a very good performance for some certain combinations of wave and structural parameters one of the widely used method for analyzing wave structure interaction problems is the multi domain boundary element method some of the useful application include the works of yu and chwang 1994 lee 1995 cho et al 2013 bakhti et al 2017 vijay et al 2020 various methods have been established to deal with the infinite fluid domain by converting it to a finite domain without the loss of generality one of the most effective methods the fundamental singularity distribution method defined by bai and yeung 1974 has been widely adopted for truncating the infinite radiation boundary which was initially used for calculating added mass coefficients for horizontal and vertical cylinders further a hybrid integral method with an analytical solution for radiation condition was implemented by liu and abbaspour 1982 as mentioned in bird and shepherd 1984 for most of the engineering application free surface can be truncated with five time of the structural dimension which is sufficient for dealing with the far field boundary where the local effects are negligible i e the contribution of evanescent modes in the global hydrodynamic behavior though analytical studies such as eigenfunction method are computationally efficient they are generally cumbersome to deal with as it involves lengthy complex expressions and by virtue it is restricted to rectilinear structural shapes on the other hand the multi domain boundary element method is advantageous for the structure of irregular shapes and multiple structures further they are widely used for studies involving variable topography however as the number of structures increases the requirement to create multiple regions may sometimes messy and computationally time consuming the study on wave reflection characteristics due to seabed undulation has been studied by many researchers a resonating phenomenon was noticed at frequencies when the wave number corresponding to seabed undulation is twice the surface wave number that results in a high reflection coefficient this is termed as bragg reflection davies and heathershaw 1984 performed an experimental study to understand the behavior of the wave reflection on the sinusoidal seabed on the other side a theoretical study also conducted by many researchers such as o hare and davies 1992 and suh et al 1997 using various numerical models kirby and anton 1990 further extended the study and observed peak at 2 k w k r 2 in addition to the peak at 2 k w k r 1 where k w is the wavenumber of the surface gravity waves and k r is the wavenumber of the ripple wave at seabed topography guazzelli et al 1992 used a doubly sinusoidal profile and conducted experiments to observe the higher order bragg reflection zhang et al 1999 extended the work of kirby and anton 1990 using the hybrid model and studied the interaction of surface wave interaction with the slow and rapidly varying undulated bottom profile by increasing the number of sinusoidal ripple wavelengths bragg reflection improved showing more sub harmonic peaks and the overall performance range also enhanced cho 2000 analyzed the propagation of both normal and oblique incident wave propagation over singly and doubly sinusoidal seabed topographies on the other hand parsons and martin 1994 investigated the wave scattering by submerged curved plate and surface piercing curved plate using chebyshev expansions and collocation technique the experimental and numerical study performed by jeon and cho 2006 on multiple trapezoidal breakwaters placed on the bottom to check the effect of bragg reflection yueh et al 2018 adopted the concept of the undulated seabed on to the submerged thin wavy impermeable plate and studied the hydrodynamic behavior using dual boundary element method bem to the best of the author s knowledge gravity wave interaction with a submerged wavy porous plate discussing bragg s phenomena has not been studied in the literature in the present study gravity wave interaction with submerged wavy porous plate is studied using a multi domain boundary element method in finite water depth the wave past porous structure is modeled using well known linear pressure drop i e darcy s law the submerged porous plate is assumed to be rigidly held in place by a group of slender piles in the transverse direction whose effects are considered to be negligible in the process of wave transformation known results in the literature are reproduced to check the validity of the present model the bragg reflection pattern due to increase in the number of ripples of the plate depth of submergence of the plate the relative amplitude of the wavy plate and variation in structural porosity are studied for a range of non dimensional wavenumber and relative plate length by analyzing the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients along with wave loads on the wavy plate 2 mathematical formulation the gravity wave interaction with a wavy porous plate by the normally incident monochromatic waves is analyzed within the framework of two dimensional small amplitude water wave theory in the cartesian coordinate system the positive horizontal x axis is taken in the direction of wave motion and z axis is vertically positive upward with the origin o chosen at the intersection of mean free surface and midpoint of the horizontal wavy plate as shown in fig 1 the wavy plate of width b ripple amplitude d s ripple wavelength λ rpl and the boundary τ s is placed at a submergence height h 1 in the water of finite depth h the number of ripples wavelength calculated by using a sinusoidal waveform m b λ r p l the ratio between the length of the plate and ripple wavelength when the ripple amplitude d s is zero the wavy horizontal plate can be treated as a horizontal flat plate the thickness of the plate is insignificant as compared to the incident wavelength and is presumed as zero the calculation is done with the assumption that the fluid is incompressible inviscid motion is irrotational and simple harmonic in time t with angular

boundary element method mbem is used to solve the above mentioned boundary value problem bvp the computational domain is divided into two regions demarcation of the regions and boundaries are as indicated in fig 2 region ι is the fluid above the horizontal wavy plate including the outer region of the plate whilst region ιi is the fluid domain below the wavy plate confined above the sea bed in

discretizing the boundaries using a finite number of linear constant boundary elements where g and g n are constant over discretized element length τ a system of linear equations can be generated by keeping the field point fix and changing the source point over the discretized element and using corresponding boundary conditions numerical integration is carried out using the gauss quadrature

nishad et al 2016 katsikadelis 2002 outward normal direction and finer discretized elements are considered for structural boundary and free surface boundary at free surface boundary 1700 discretized

porous plate and a computer program is developed using matlab to analyze the hydrodynamic parameters to verify the correctness of the developed bem code results from the existing known special cases are compared in figs 3 a and b reflection and transmission coefficients against different relative submergence depths are compared with yu and chwang 1994 for an impermeable and porous flat plate both the figures reveal that results obtained using the present model agree well with that of yu and chwang 1994 in figs 4 a and b the effect of sinusoidal seabed profiles is carried out and compared with the experimental results of davies and heathershaw 1984 and numerical results of yueh et al 2018 to maintain consistency similar notations are used for this validation as defined in fig 1 λ r p l is the ripple wavelength of the seabed b is the length of the wavy seabed profile d s is the amplitude of the wavy seabed profile fig 4 reveals that the reflection coefficient for various values of the ratio of twice that of the incident wave number to the ripple wave number of the seabed i e 2 k w k r p l are found very close to that of yueh et al 2018 which is marked in solid line and experimental results from davies and heathershaw 1984 marked in filled square based on the above a sinusoidal wavy form of different ripple wavelengths is taken as a wavy porous plate profile the wave scattering behavior of a horizontal wavy plate is studied using multi domain boundary element method mdbem by analyzing the different hydrodynamic properties in the following sections results related to the wavy porous plate are discussed 4 1 variation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients versus wavenumber in this subsection behaviors of bragg scattering of gravity wave past over a submerged wavy porous plate are studied by analyzing the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against dimensionless wave number k 0 h 4 1 1 effect of number of ripple wavelength figures 5 a and b show the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients against k 0 h for different ripple wavelengths m in the case of an impermeable wavy plate an oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient with different magnitude is observed peak values in the amplitudes of reflection coefficients with higher and lower magnitude are referred to as harmonic and subharmonic peaks fig 5 a reveals that the reflection coefficient is higher for k 0 h close to 2 8 it is understood that for intermediate water depth higher reflection can be achieved by the wavy plate with the increase in the number of ripple wavelengths of the wavy plate the width of the peak is reduced and higher reflection can be attained moreover it is observed that the reflection coefficient attains its maximum value which is close to 0 9 as the number of ripple wavelength m increases to 8 the increase in the peak of the reflection coefficient with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths is due to the combined effect of the back and forth motion of waves within the ripples of the submerged plate along with the superposition of the incident and reflected waves this kind of resonating interaction is known as bragg resonance which occurs in the presence of a wavy plate for 0 k 0 h 3 5 a similar phenomenon was observed in the case of surface wave propagation over submerged sand bars as in davies and heathershaw 1984 and recently in case of wave scattering by an array of trenches by kar et al 2018 the effect of bragg resonance is insignificant for higher k 0 h where wave energy concentration is less this shows that the wavy plate provides its maximum performance for intermediate water depth in addition to the harmonic peak close to 2 8 sub harmonic peaks are also noticed between the range 0 k 0 h 3 5 it is found that the sub harmonic peaks are increased with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths m figs 5 a and b demonstrate a relationship between the number of ripple wavelength and the number of sub harmonic peaks can be established and found to be in the form m 1 on the other hand fig 5 b demonstrates that the transmission coefficient is low where the reflection coefficient is high which satisfies the energy relation fig 6 exhibits the variations of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against k 0 h for different values of ripple wavelengths m in the case of a submerged porous wavy plate both the figures reveal that with the introduction of porosity harmonic peaks are shifted towards lower wavenumbers k 0 h corresponding to shallower water depths moreover the amplitude of the subharmonic peaks in the reflection coefficients is reduced however the number of peaks before the harmonic peak remains the same further it is observed that for smaller values of m the amplitude of peak in the shallow water region is higher whilst for higher values of m there is a significant reduction in the peak amplitudes of the reflection coefficients in the water of intermediate depth and that of deep water with an increase in the number of ripple wavelength m the number of subharmonic peaks is increased further it may be noted that in the case of m 7 variation in the reflection and transmission coefficients are negligible due to porosity the transmission is low compared to the impermeable wavy plate and higher dissipation is also observed on the other hand with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths higher dissipation is achieved which is close to 90 in other words the wavy plate is most effective for higher ripple wavelength and intermediate porosity further in case of deepwater corresponding to k 0 h π since the wave energy concentration is more on the free surface the submerged plate has a negligible role in reflecting the wave energy whilst a part of the wave energy is dissipated which passes through the submerged plate with the rest being transmitted 4 1 2 effect of relative submergence depth fig 7 demonstrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients against k 0 h for different relative submergence depth of the plate h 1 h for an impermeable wavy plate the variation of the depth of submergence h 1 h lies within the range of 0 4 0 7 since the relative amplitude of the submerged wavy plate is fixed at 0 3 fig 7 a reveals that bragg resonance occurs in the case of a submerged wavy plate irrespective of the depth of submergence of the wavy plate and the number of subharmonic peaks does not change with the change in the depth of submergence however the harmonic peaks are observed for smaller values of wave number when the submerged plate is close to the free surface this may be due to the change of phase of the incident and reflected waves in the presence of the wavy plate moreover wave reflection is higher as the submerged plate is close to the free surface which is due to the reflection of a major part of wave energy concentrating near the free surface it is imperative to note from fig 7 a that in case of an impermeable wavy plate with d s h 0 3 and m 4 the reflection coefficient is close to 0 9 for h 1 h 0 4 at k 0 h 2 a similar observation was observed when a horizontal submerged plate as in patarapanich and cheong 1989 and a submerged wavy plate see yueh et al 2018 is kept close to the free surface on the other hand for larger values of the wavenumber k 0 h a significant reduction in wave reflection occurs irrespective of the depth of submergence of the submerged plate and the pattern is similar to that observed in fig 5 whilst significant effect of the wavy plate on wave reflection is noticed in the water of shallow and intermediate depths the wave transmission pattern is complementary to that of wave reflection which is similar to the observation made in fig 5 b moreover there is a significant amount of energy dissipation occurs by the porous wavy plate for higher values of the wave number corresponding to deep water this also confirms the energy relation k r 2 k t 2 1 fig 8 exhibits the variations in the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients k r k t and k d respectively against k 0 h for different values of depth of submergence of the wavy porous plate h 1 h the patterns of reflection and transmission coefficients are similar to that of a wavy impermeable plate however the amplitude of the reflection coefficient is reduced due to the higher dissipation of wave energy by the wavy plate the number of peaks in the range 0 k 0 h 3 5 is the same as the impermeable wavy plate furthermore the amplitude of the peaks in the shallow water zone is predominant than the intermediate zone with an increase in the depth of submergence h 1 h this indicates that the wavy porous plate can be effectively used in the shallow water zone for the depth of submergence h 1 h 0 6 further lower transmission and higher dissipation are noticed for lower relative water depth as shown in fig 8 b and c fig 9 demonstrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients against k 0 h for different values of the depth of submergence h 1 h in the case of an impermeable flat plate a comparison between figs 7 and 9 reveals that higher reflection close to 20 can be achieved using the wavy plate for a wider range of k 0 h value in shallow water and intermediate water zone on the other hand the effects of porosity on the wavy plate and flat plate are compared in figs 8 and 10 it is noticed that for k 0 h value 2 75 due to the introduction of the porosity increase in reflection coefficient by 20 decrease in transmission coefficient by 20 and increase in dissipation by 10 a comparison of figs 7 a and 8 a and 9 a 10 a on the wavy plate with that of flat plate reveals that bragg scattering occurs in case of wavy submerged plate with subharmonic and harmonic peaks unlike the occurrence of oscillatory decreasing pattern in wave reflection in the case of a submerged flat plate irrespective of plate permeability 4 1 3 effect of relative wavy plate amplitudes fig 11 demonstrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients verses k 0 h for different values of relative amplitudes d s h for an impermeable wavy plate the pattern of wave reflection and transmission is similar to that of fig 5 in the case of a wavy plate with m 4 it is found that with an increase in the relative amplitude of the wavy plate d s h reflection coefficient increases and accordingly transmission coefficient decreases which is due to the reflection of a major part of the wave energy in the case of a wavy plate of higher amplitude however as observed in fig 11 the effect of the relative amplitude d s h on the reflection coefficient is insignificant in the case of deep water for k 0 h 3 75 this is due to the fact that the submerged structure has less influence in reflecting wave energy concentrating near the free surface in case of deep water moreover the lower transmission is observed where wave reflection due to the wavy impermeable plate is high fig 12 illustrates the variation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against wave number k 0 h for different values of relative amplitudes d s h of the wavy porous plate it is observed that the effect of porosity on the reflection coefficient for various relative amplitudes is quite significant as compared to the impermeable wavy plate less wave reflection occurs in the case of a porous plate is due to the dissipation and transmission of wave energy in the case of the horizontal submerged porous plate unlike the case of the impermeable plate peak in the wave reflection occurs in the case of a submerged permeable plate for smaller wavenumbers corresponding to waves in shallow water this is due to the fact that wave propagation is uniform along with the depth in case of shallow water without much energy being dissipated by the porous plate on the other hand a major part of the wave energy is dissipated for higher values of the wavenumber with the subsequent increase in the wavenumber bragg scattering occurs when wave interacts with the submerged porous plate and more energy is dissipated however for higher wave number corresponding to deep water negligible wave reflection occurs as reported earlier in figs 5 and 9 on the other hand figs 12 b and c reveal that wave energy transmission becomes minimum in the water of intermediate depth and dissipation is maximum in case of intermediate water depth further fig 12 reveals that both wave reflection and dissipation increases whilst wave transmission decreases with an increase in the relative amplitudes d s h of the wavy porous plate 4 1 4 effect of porosity in figs 13 and 14 variations of the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients are plotted against k 0 h for different values of porosity g p in case of submerged flat and wavy plates respectively in the case of impermeable submerged plates maximum wave reflection occurs moreover more reflection close to 20 occurs in the case of a wavy plate compared to that of the flat plate further wave reflection follows an oscillatory decreasing pattern for a submerged flat plate with multiple occurrences of zero reflection with an increase in the wavenumber k 0 h whilst bragg resonance occurs in case of a wavy plate as discussed in figs 5 and 9 however with the introduction of structural porosity a major part of the wave energy dissipated in both the cases of flat and wavy plates with minimum transmission and maximum dissipation occurring in case of water of intermediate depth further with an increase in structural porosity the optima in bragg reflection reduces significantly whilst for very high porosity the minima in wave reflection approach to zero in case of a submerged wavy plate like the case of a flat plate this is due to the fact that for higher porosity both the incident and reflected waves propagate with similar phase difference irrespective of the plate configurations however the number of zeros and peaks remains the same as the change in porosity in addition harmonic peaks are found only near the shallow water zone when g p 1 a comparison of fig 14 b and c reveals that the transmission and dissipation coefficients remain the same for g p 0 5 and 1 0 further it is observed that the inertia component of structural porosity significantly reduces wave reflection compared to the case without the inertia component thus suitable porosity is required to choose from the intermediate range of porosity to obtain higher reflection lower transmission and higher dissipation moreover wave reflection is negligible for k 0 h π corresponding to deep water as energy transmission and dissipation dominate irrespective of plate configurations 4 2 variation of reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients versus plate length in this subsection behaviors of bragg scattering of gravity wave past over a submerged wavy porous plate are studied by analyzing the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients against relative plate length b λ 4 2 1 effect of the relative amplitude of wavy plate fig 15 illustrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients verses b λ for different values of relative amplitudes d s h for an impermeable wavy plate it is evident that hydrodynamic properties are varied periodically with the increase in the change in relative plate length in case of a flat plate which is similar to the observation made by newman 1965 yu and chwang 1994 and wang and shen 1999 unlike the case of a flat plate in which maxima in wave reflection occurs when the plate length is an integer multiple of half of the wavelength of the incident waves i e b n λ 2 for wavy plate certain variation occurs which is due to the fact that phase shift among incident and reflected waves for wavy plate does not coincide with 180 out of phase moreover the peak amplitude of the reflected waves attends maximum when the relative plate length becomes close to 1 75 in case of a wavy plate which is due to the combined effect of the resonating pattern developed between each ripple of the wavy plate which has been described as the bragg resonance in fig 5 to obtain a higher wave absorbing performance of the wavy plate suitable plate length is required to be considered moreover with an increase in relative amplitude d s h ratio higher reflection can be achieved on the other hand fig 15 b depicts that the transmission coefficient follows the complementary trend to the reflection coefficient as shown in fig 15 a fig 16 illustrates the variations of reflection and transmission coefficients verses b λ for different values of relative amplitudes d s h for a porous wavy plate fig 16 a depicts a substantial reduction in the magnitude of the reflection coefficient whilst a similar bragg resonance pattern is observed as in the case of the impermeable plate furthermore due to the introduction of structural porosity figs 16 b and c reveal that wave transmission decreases whilst energy dissipation increases with an increase in the relative amplitude of the wavy permeable plate 4 2 2 effect of number of ripple wavelength fig 17 shows the variations of reflection and transmitted coefficient against b λ for different ripple wavelengths m for an impermeable wavy plate with h 1 h 0 6 d s h 0 3 and h λ 0 25 it is observed that with an increase in relative plate length reflection and transmission coefficients changes in an oscillatory manner with an increase in plate width however the amplitude of oscillation changes due to the change in ripple wavelength m however optima in the reflection and transmission coefficients vary with the length of the plate thus depending upon the stability for the structural integrity and quantity of wave transmission to be allowed relative plate length can be chosen for design consideration moreover it is observed that relative plate length has a significant influence on the peak reflection coefficient due to an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths which is close to 0 9 in the water of intermediate depth it is noticed easily from fig 17 that the harmonic peaks are shifted towards the right along relative plate length for higher ripple wavelength m however a diminishing trend of the reflection coefficient is noticed for higher b λ after the harmonic peak of the corresponding number of ripple wavelengths harmonic peaks are observed when the ripple wavelength m 2 with the occurrence of maximum wave reflection which can be represented empirically as b λ 0 75 m 2 0 5 c where c is the value of b λ for which the first minimum in wave reflection occurs irrespective of ripple wavelength unlike the case of a flat plate the bandwidth of the reflection coefficient curve for which harmonic peak becomes maximum increases with an increase in the ripple wavelength the above observation highlights the performance of a wavy plate as a breakwater compared to that of a flat plate moreover fig 17 b exhibits the complementary trend to that of wave reflection in fig 17 a whilst both the figures for the reflection and transmission coefficients satisfy energy identity k r 2 k t 2 1 fig 18 demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficient and transmitted coefficient against b λ for different values of ripple wavelength m in the case of a submerged porous wavy plate fig 18 a illustrates that the optimum magnitude of the reflection coefficient is reduced to 0 25 in case of a porous plate from that of 0 9 in the case of an impermeable plate in addition to a certain decrease in wave transmission whilst a major part of wave energy being dissipated by the permeable wavy plate unlike an impermeable plate the influence of the higher number of ripples marginally affect wave reflection as a major part of the wave energy is dissipated in case of a permeable wavy plate the study reveals that optimum relative length can be decided based on structural stability amount of wave energy to be transmitted for creating a tranquility zone in the marine environment 4 3 forces on wavy plate in the subsequent subsection behaviors of bragg scattering of gravity wave past over a submerged wavy porous plate are studied by understanding the nature horizontal force coefficient and vertical force coefficient acting on the wavy plate 4 3 1 effect of number of ripple wavelength fig 19 exhibits the variations of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against k 0 h for a different number of ripple wavelength m in case of a submerged wavy impermeable plate a comparison between both the subfigures reveals that horizontal force is significantly smaller than the vertical force which is due to the fact that hydrodynamic pressure in the vertical direction acting on the submerged horizontal structure is much higher than in the horizontal direction moreover the vertical forces acting on the structure is predominantly higher for waves in shallow and intermediate depths than that of deep water further it is observed that with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths wave forces exerted on the wavy plate reduces which is due to the increase in wave reflection due to bragg resonance moreover zeros in wave reflection correspond to zeros in the horizontal forces exerted on the wavy plate whilst certain variation occurs in the vertical forces however optima in wave forces are observed alternately with an increase in wave number which is similar to that of fig 5 fig 20 demonstrates the effect of horizontal and vertical forces for different numbers of ripple wavelength in the case of a permeable wavy plate a comparison of figs 19 and 20 reveal that there is a significant reduction in the magnitude of wave forces due to the introduction of structural porosity the oscillatory pattern in the horizontal wave forces remains similar to that of impermeable plates whilst the oscillatory pattern diminishes in the case of vertical forces due to the introduction of structural porosity as maximum wave energy dissipation takes place 4 3 2 effect of relative submergence depth figs 21 and 22 demonstrate the variations of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against k 0 h for different relative submergence depth h 1 h in case of impermeable and permeable wavy plates it is observed that variations in the horizontal forces are comparable in the case of permeable and impermeable submerged plates whilst there is a significant reduction in the vertical wave forces in case of permeable plate compared to that of the impermeable plate moreover higher wave loads in horizontal and vertical directions are observed in the intermediate water depth on the other hand with an increase in k 0 h value wave loads are decreased due to less influence of wave energy on the structure in the subsequent discussion the emphasis is on the vertical forces as horizontal forces have a negligible effect in the case of the wavy plate due to bragg resonance fig 23 reveals that the vertical wave forces exerted on a submerged plate is found to be much less than the corresponding forces in case of a wavy plate irrespective of plate permeability this is due to the bragg reflection of a major part of wave energy by the wavy plate compared to that of a flat plate 4 3 3 variation of wave force versus wavenumber fig 24 demonstrates the variation of vertical force coefficient against k 0 h for different values of relative amplitudes d s h in case of an impermeable wavy plate with g p 0 and a permeable plate with g p 1 both the subfigures reveal that vertical wave forces decrease with an increase in the relative amplitude of the wavy plate however a significant reduction in the magnitude of the vertical force coefficient occurs in the case of the permeable wavy plate compared to that of the impermeable plate this is due to the increase in wave reflection by the wavy plate as discussed in figs 11 and 12 further wave forces decrease in an oscillatory pattern with an increase in wave number which is similar to the observation made in figs 22 and 23 moreover vertical forces become more predominant for waves in shallow water compared to that of waves of intermediate depth and deep water 4 3 4 effect of porosity fig 25 illustrates the variation of the vertical force coefficient k f z against k 0 h in the case of different values of porosity g p for the flat plate and wavy plate it is observed that vertical loads are mitigated due to the introduction of porosity from 0 4 to 0 05 both the sub figures reveal that wave loads decrease in an oscillatory decreasing manner with an increase in k 0 h moreover the number of minima are observed as one less than the number of ripple wavelength in both the wavy plate and flat plate the maximum value of the vertical loads is observed for k 0 h value close to 0 75 a comparison between both the figures reveals that vertical loads on the structure are reduced around 10 when the wavy profile is considered instead of a flat surface vertical loads in both wavy plate and flat is diminished in case of higher wavenumber k 0 h π in the case of permeable plates 4 3 5 variation of wave force versus plate length figs 26 and 27 demonstrate the variations of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against b λ for different values of relative amplitudes d s h in case of an impermeable wavy plate with g p 0 and a permeable plate with g p 1 it is evident that a change in relative plate length horizontal force exerted on the plate is much lower than that of the vertical loads as discussed in figs 19 22 for both impermeable and permeable plates however both the forces follow an oscillatory decreasing pattern with an increase in the relative plate length which is due to the increase in surface area for dissipating wave energy moreover due to the introduction of porosity a considerable amount of reduction in vertical force is noticed with an increase in relative amplitude d s h vertical force coefficient is reduced however there is a marginal increase in the horizontal force coefficient the marginal increase in the horizontal force coefficient is due to the direct impact of wave forces with an increase in the amplitude of the wavy plate unlike the impermeable wavy plate a decreasing pattern with negligible load is observed in the vertical force coefficients for a permeable wavy plate in the case of higher relative plate length b λ the occurrence of optima in vertical wave forces is observed for the same relative plate length irrespective of the relative amplitude of the wavy plate on the other hand a comparison of figs 26 and 27 reveal that optima of the horizontal force coefficient shift along plate length b λ due to change of plate permeability from g p 0 to g p 1 which is due to the phase shift of the incident and reflected waves due to change in plate permeability 4 3 6 effect of number of ripple wavelength figs 28 and 29 demonstrate the variation of horizontal and vertical force coefficients against b λ for different values of ripple wavelength m in case of an impermeable wavy plate with g p 0 and a permeable plate with g p 1 both the figures reveal that the horizontal and vertical loads decrease with an increase in the number of ripples m 2 which is similar to that of figs 26 and 27 this is due to the formation of bragg resonance whose amplitude increases for a higher number of ripples of the submerged wavy plate on the other hand as noted earlier for waves in shallow and intermediate depth with ripple wavelength m 2 wave propagation remains uniform across water depth and less reflection takes place which in turn leads to more wave force being exerted on the plate before it is being transmitted to the open water region moreover due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous plate of multiple ripple wavelength wave forces exerted on the submerged plate decreases for higher values of m which is contrary to the observation made in case of the impermeable plate further it may be noted that for higher values of plate length b λ with a higher number of ripples both vertical and horizontal forces becomes negligible in the case of the porous wavy plate 5 conclusion in the present study surface gravity wave interaction with a horizontal wavy porous structure is studied using the linearized theory of water waves where the wave past porous structure is modeled based on darcy s law the physical problem is studied in the two dimensional fluid domain having a horizontal porous structure placed at a finite submergence depth and the solution for this physical problem is handled using a multi domain boundary element method mdbem method numerical results were validated with known results to confirm the suitability of the developed model and the associated computational results thereafter hydrodynamic properties of engineering interest like reflection transmission dissipation horizontal and vertical force coefficients were obtained various parametric studies have been conducted and comparison among permeable as well as impermeable wavy plates with that of a horizontal flat plate is established which in turn exhibits the applicability of the horizontal wavy porous plate it has been noticed that a suitable parameter is required to be chosen for the optimum performance of the wavy porous plate further it is noticed that due to the bragg resonance in the shallow and intermediate water depth with a higher number of ripples intermediate porosity lower submergence depth and higher relative amplitude reduces the hydrodynamic loads and increases the reflection and dissipation coefficients with a lower transmission coefficient further some important relationship between the number of ripple wavelength to the harmonic peak has been established it is found that the sub harmonic peaks are increased with an increase in the number of ripple wavelengths m and the relation between ripple wavelength and the subharmonic peak is found to be m 1 additionally with an increase in plate length harmonic peaks are observed for ripple wavelength greater than two with a maximum wave reflection at the location b λ 0 75 m 2 0 5 c where c is the value of b λ for which the first minimum in wave reflection occurs irrespective of ripple wavelength evidently relevant information for the calculation of suitable relative plate length can be obtained based on the structural stability and quantity of wave to be transmitted it is also observed that the horizontal wavy plate has higher performance than the horizontal impermeable flat plate under the same applicability condition moreover the use of a wavy porous plate enhances the design suitability for an application as a breakwater in a wide range of

21237,uninhabited vehicles uxvs are becoming an important component of naval warfare providing an entirely new capability by projecting military power in a more affordable way through the use of uxvs exposure of human life to military threats should be significantly reduced while several navies are employing uxvs for a variety of applications the concept of operating a fleet of such vehicles from a mothership that supports their overall operations during a mission is a further challenge this paper describes the research conducted by university college london ucl design research centre drc to develop and demonstrate a relevant analytical approach to design a mothership supporting a fleet of uxvs this research should provide ship designers with the basis for early stage assessment of the impact of the various facilities seen as appropriate to host and support a substantial fleet of uxvs it is particularly focused on the launch and recovery lar capability of the uxv mothership the research explored various options to demonstrate the proposed approach rather than producing a definitive mothership design solution this was appropriate given the fact that any uxv fleet composition is hard to predict since mission related and uxv technology is rapidly developing so both must be speculative it was found that the qt tool could provide meaningful investigation into the impact of potential tasks to be undertaken by a fleet of uxvs addressing the design of mission bays which were shown to be key to usv mothership design while more focused simulations could refine subsystem options this was not pursued given the technology is still developing consequently at this very early stage of investigating the deployment of a fleet of usvs from surface ships through case studies queuing network theory was seen to be more appropriate than a simulation based analysis for this initial exploratory and investigatory work on future naval deployment of uxvs keywords uxv fleet

procured for the royal navy with an adaptable mission space for some uxv modules providing the capability to deploy uninhabited air uav surface usv and underwater uuv warfare vehicles modules ministry of defence de s 2012 in contrast to the discrete uxv capability of both the lcs and the type 26 the concept of hosting deploying and supporting a large fleet of uxvs say over 50 vehicles from a mother surface vessel can be seen as a new capability consequently there is a need to investigate the ship design implications of this new operational concept the deployment of a fleet of uxvs in a theatre of operations requires the presence of a mother vessel or several vessels capable of transporting and hosting a considerable force of uxvs together with supporting facilities this means a design approach needs to be devised in order to explore at a concept level how a fleet of uxvs could drive the design of a mothership the proposed approach exploits the ucl originated design building block dbb approach to early stage ship design essd andrews and pawling 2003 and combines it with an analytical tool which would quantify the operations of a fleet of uxvs where the mothership supports the lar of that fleet this is seen to be a holistic numerically and architecturally focused investigation of the initial design of such a vessel type studies have been undertaken using a recently developed ucl dbb based ship design tool informed by the proposed method for evaluating the lar implications of a fleet of uxvs and their associated facilities which drive the mothership designs the paper firstly outlines the problem of deploying supporting and retrieving a fleet of uxvs from warships followed by the proposed approach to tackle the lar demands thereafter several ship design case studies demonstrate the proposed approach finally the mothership evaluation approach for the early design stages is discussed and the main conclusions are provided from the research 2 background to uxv naval deployment this section considers issues raised by the deployment of a uxv fleet from a naval surface ship it explores the topics of uxvs and naval ship design with the aim of identifying issues that are both relevant and feasible in investigating the deployment of a large number of naval uxvs from surface vessels 2 1 deployment of a fleet of uninhabited vehicles in support of naval missions uxvs provide a number of potential benefits to naval operations as they can act as force multipliers while reducing the operational risks to which personnel might be exposed savitz et al 2013 the future vision of naval operations involves the application of autonomous vehicles that could potentially reduce personnel related costs by reducing the extent of facilities on board naval combatants required for humans canning 2005 this would lessen humans exposure to tasks that are dirty dealing with hazardous material dull long duration and dangerous exposure to hostile environment alkire et al 2010 pawling and andrews 2009 additionally removing the human from the vehicle can significantly reduce vehicle size and also lower its signatures clapper et al 2012 advances in computer software speed and processing power improved sensor technologies enhanced communications better image processing capabilities efficient and miniaturized propulsion systems giving longer endurance and range make uxvs potentially attractive rather than deploying one or two uxvs per ship a substantial coordinated fleet of uxvs could provide an increased capability to naval missions especially if supported from a mothership mission profiles would be determined by a range of appropriate concepts of operations conops where each conop should define the number and types of uxvs required to operate in each mission theatre the capabilities uxvs deliver for each mission would be driven by the needs to meet each selected mission scenario which can then give the technological requirements for both uxvs and support vessels canning 2005 the operations of uxvs during a naval mission could cover all evolutions from the deployment of the vehicles to the mission theatre to their recovery on board the host ship including the required support while they are deployed the off board tasks involve the support of the uxvs while on station i e monitoring identification of potential problems command and control c2 interpreting sensor information communications and interoperation authorisation of weapon systems use or other mission related activities refuelling recharging and replenishing ordnance on station uxv operations on board the mothership could include fault diagnosis and repair maintenance refuelling rearming stowage pre mission checks and lar clapper et al 2007 broadbent and binns 2006 a uxv mothership would provide the base for a group of uxvs integrated into an overall naval force providing not just their stowage maintenance and lar operations but also significantly contributing to c2 and communications to manage them braithwaite 2013 although stowage space demands on board handling systems maintenance and refuel equipment and ordnance for the uxvs systems have implications on the design of a mothership any successful uxv operations are likely to depend substantially on the capabilities of delivering and recovering the vehicles from the operational area thomsen 2007 this would have a major impact on the performance configuration and size of the intended mothership there are numerous potential ways of deploying and retrieving uxvs from naval ships including catapult launcher crane and stern ramp issues relevant to selecting appropriate lars for operating a fleet of uxvs from a surface vessel include space allocation appropriate lars location to compensate for wave induced motions in limiting sea state conditions adequate freeboard operational availability deck loading well trained personnel power needs and cost implications lester 2007 a dedicated uxv mothership should have the ability to deploy a range of types and sizes of uxvs that can provide a network of interconnected uxvs able to adjust to changing operational needs braithwaite 2013 this could be achieved by providing flexible mission compartments on the host ship to enable it to support a wide range of uxv operations the implications of the uxvs on a host ship design and the resultant interfaces between the ship and the uxvs are of vital importance and hence need to be considered from the start of designing any host ship to enhance safety multi mission capability mission effectiveness and affordability the mission oriented spaces need to be effectively integrated into the host ship s architecture mothership integration issues include larss stowage spaces and handling systems with a lifting allowance required to allow for the vehicles to be handled inside the mission bay pawling and andrews 2013 maintenance and repair equipment refuelling and rearming facilities relevant crew and their accommodation needs as part of the ship infrastructure power system demands f020 relevant communications systems eaton et al 2014 the capabilities of a mothership relevant to host and support a uxv fleet i e ship performance including speed range endurance seakeeping manoeuvrability and stability 2 2 the challenge of deploying a fleet of uninhabited vehicles from a naval vessel future naval capabilities may be delivered by a system composed of a variety of conventional or unconventional vessels and uninhabited vehicles whereas traditionally a set of naval capabilities could be provided by a single unit and thus designers could focus on that design the evaluation of uxv system concepts is likely to require a broader more holistic approach to designing the complete system thus a ship concept designer must trade off model resolution for speed and flexibility in methods and tools in the early stages of design the dbb approach can be utilised to assess the performance of an individual mothership and daughter craft designs by addressing the capability of the mothership to operate a fleet of uxvs the dbb approach can also examine the impact the uxv fleet and the required facilities sub systems and on board services to support such a fleet will have on the size configuration performance and cost of the resultant mothership solution additionally certain ship architectural decisions e g integration of mission oriented spaces into overall general arrangement ga could also affect the ability of a mothership to host and support such uxv fleets consideration to date of the design of a ship that would be able to carry and support the overall operations of a number of uxvs has been limited to both a specific small number of vehicles and generic conops studies conops studies would normally provide estimates of the numbers and types of uxvs required to bring distinct capabilities into a theatre of operations purton and andrews 2014 however oa assessment that is restricted only to the study of particular conops scenarios was not considered sufficient to inform a generic mothership solution this is because such studies alone would not take into account any potential issues regarding the physical impact of a fleet of uxvs on the design of an equivalent mothership a wider design based approach could capture the overall usage of a fleet of uxvs and then integrate support of that fleet into the design of a mothership therefore accommodating the above features in the ship so it can deliver its primary uxv support function was considered to be key to the design of uxv fleet mothership given the immaturity of the uxv fleet concept and of any appropriate systems for the lar of such a sizeable number of vehicles the physical demands on the mothership had to be speculative thus it is not possible to currently exploit speculative ship design technologies such those for uxvs and larss given their rapid evolution however the design approach is not aimed at delivering definitive or absolute design solutions appropriate to precise uxv technological solutions but to provide ship designers with an approach able to investigate a wide range of potential and generic uxv systems and their supporting equipment and resources most significant decisions ought to be explored if not all fixed in the concept phase of ship design andrews 2018 this was achieved in this investigation through the use of oa to couple conops alternatives with considering the impact of a fleet of uninhabited assets on the design of a dedicated supporting vessel thus oa derived functional requirements were postulated e g extent of larss c2 maintenance refuelling rearming space etc to support the operations of a fleet of uxvs during a set of representative uxv led missions 2 3 the importance of an architectural approach to ship design the traditional numerically based approach to naval ship design synthesis delays architectural modelling while focusing on the readily quantified aspects of speed seakeeping stability strength and the combat system numerical demands thus the initial ship sizing ends up largely considering the internal arrangement once an initial numerically balanced gross weight and space design has been achieved andrews 2003 such sizing ignores the disposition of the different space requirements within the overall envelope and hence is bound to limit exploration of design variety the examination of key design related issues such as the integration of mission bay systems are likely to be postponed to later design stages despite the fact that most warships are generally not weight or space limited but architecturally driven brown 1993 andrews inside out or architecturally driven approach to essd namely the ucl dbb approach has been summarised in andrews 2018 and has become an accepted approach to essd tupper 2013 the dbb approach deliberately encourages exploration of novel solutions both at macro and major level from the commencement of ship design andrews and pawling 2006 analytically described the appropriate steps of using the dbb approach for the design of innovative vessels such as the us navy lcs design the design of an innovative vessel such that of a uxv mothership where large mission bays are to be integrated in the ship is seen to be configurationally driven so the dbb approach was proposed and adopted in the usv mothership case studies described later 3 a novel integrated approach to uxv mothership system design the proposed approach combines two tools a ucl developed on line implementation of the design building block approach and a fortran based queuing theory analysis tool developed by kouriampalis 2019 3 1 the ucl ship design layout tool the use of sophisticated 3d computer aided design cad models such as that of paramarine in the implementation of the dbb approach has a particular drawback such full design level sophisticated naval architectural tools can require a level of detail often inappropriate to the very earliest stage of requirements elucidation andrews 2018 such comprehensive tools demand a high learning and familiarisation overhead for new users such as students pawling et al 2015 in order to address these issues an online ship design toolset implementing the dbb approach in essd has been developed at ucl for use in essd teaching and research pawling et al 2015 coded in javascript this tool uses a simplified cellular representation of the arrangeable space on the ship in a 2 5d i e decks rather than fully 3d approach link 2016 fig 1 shows an example ga for a ucl study of a uxv capable offshore patrol vessel opv pawling et al 2017 as presented by this on line tool although including basic analysis tools such as intact stability and resistance and powering the javascript tool was primarily developed to allow visualisation and manipulation of ships gas the numerical sizing is carried out in excel or any other tool capable of outputting the appropriate data with any more detailed analysis needing to be carried out in sophisticated casd tools such as paramarine moreover using network analysis pawling et al 2015 and 2d modelling the javascript toolset enables quick extraction of a range of spatial features such as the extent of block adjacency these additional geometric metrics can also then be used for innovative network based layout analysis pawling et al 2016 3 2 modelling the operation of uxvs in order to produce an indicative uxv mothership design it was necessary to investigate the overall uxvs operations required to operate a fleet of uxvs those revealed the necessary physical interfaces between the uninhabited assets and the mothership while also suggesting non intuitive improvements to the overall operations the latter were taken into consideration in the mothership studies the likely operations of a fleet of uxvs supported by a mothership was represented as a number of interconnected nodes forming a network system shown in fig 2 where each node represents a task in the uxv operations some nodes relate to mothership characteristics such as launch and recovery and others to the uxv capabilities such as reliability analysis of the operation of a fleet of uxvs from a mothership was seen to need a novel quantitative approach the method developed used queuing theory qt which is a mathematical representation of waiting lines i e queues suitable for the modelling and analysis of certain systems robertazzi 1994 qt has been used in operations research or to determine the type and number of resources to be allocated to provide a specific service within certain time limitations hillier and lieberman 2001 qt has also been applied to various issues involving transport airports production lines telecommunications and the internals of computers bhat 2008 by providing a quantification of performance qt can provide a ship designer with measures of effectiveness of a potential uxv mothership by indicating the ability of a given ship design option to support the operations of the ship s uxv fleet these metrics could then be used to compare the capabilities required to support a fleet of uxvs provided on various potential mothership solutions qt can be adopted to represent any system where customers arrive looking for service of some kind and depart once the appropriate service has been provided such models can be constructed to predict performance measures appropriate to a queuing system such as the queue length i e number of customers waiting in the queue and waiting time which would also contribute to understanding the behaviour of such systems bhat 2008 a simple queuing model can have two distinct elements the waiting area and the service area as is schematically shown in fig 3 such a model may be used to represent a number of customers i e uxvs that arrive at a waiting area where they queue up if all servers are busy such a conceptual model can be used to represent each task shown in fig 3 forming a network of queuing nodes in a qt representation of a uxv mothership the uxvs themselves are the customers and the lars can be considered resources that need to be allocated two key features of qt that led to its adoption were the short computation times and most significantly the high level of abstraction this permitted a wide range of novel lars uxvs and even uxv tasks to be included in a common representation through changing the numerical characteristics of the nodes qt analysis can generate various numerical outputs and in this application these were divided into two broad categories i information on node performance and ii ship impact due to providing the necessary ship equipment systems and resources to support such a fleet of uninhabited assets i e space requirements and consequential mothership size layout and performance i node performance total time a uxv spent at a node i e facility requesting the appropriate service e g lar this relates to the performance of the lars adopted in a given ship installation ii ship impact number of vehicles in a queue at a node as a measure of the space i e waiting area required in front of the facility that provides the service in question number of servers being a measure of the space required for the facilities e g larss that provide the appropriate service e g lar the service rate of a node within a queuing network system could be improved by either allocating more servers of identical type e g more lars or by employing faster servers e g better lars the designer could explore the extent of necessary changes to the underperforming nodes noting subsequent impacts on the mothership design based on such investigations the ship designer could assess whether the performance of the selected network was satisfactory thus the qt tool contributed to the decision making process with regards to the mothership design in terms of the features needed for the mothership to deliver its primary functions see fig 4 in general smaller times spent at each node along with high throughput values and low queue lengths indicated a mothership design of enhanced ability to support the uxv fleet hence by analysing a queuing network of uxv operations on a mothership if the resulted network metrics quantifying the mothership capability to support those operations is satisfactory then the relevant mothership design is accepted otherwise the inputs to queuing network could be modified until the queuing network performance is acceptable 3 3 applying the qt approach to mothership options based on the broader uxv system activities shown in fig 2 the interactions between the uxvs and mothership could be identified as summarised in fig 5 for a dedicated uxv mothership these interactions would likely be significant drivers of the ship design ranging from high level topological decisions such as the location of uxv hangars through design impacts of accommodating multiple lars to specific performance features e g seakeeping to ensure low motions during launch and recovery the qt demonstration of lar capability was used as a proxy measure of the overall effectiveness of potential mothership concepts i e the faster a fleet of uxvs can be launched and subsequently recovered on board then the more efficiently a mission should be executed this focus was primarily to constrain the problem to that which could be assessed in a university research scenario given limited technical information available and the rapid development of uxv technologies the qt tool results were incorporated in the design of a mothership by modelling the performance of the relevant launching nodes and their implications on a mothership design the following issues were considered for their impact on the configuration of the mission bays and thus on the overall mothership design i the implication of the number of uxvs for a given set of lar facilities on a mothership or the implication of the number of lar facilities for a given fleet of uxvs ii the implication of the type of lar facilities for a given fleet of uxvs distinct types of lar equipment provided assumed different lar service time per vehicle based on current data obtained from uxv manufacturers knight 2012 future larss are likely to be enhanced and more sophisticated larss would provide more specific and improved metrics the qt tool was not used to analyse different uxv fleet compositions subject to various operational scenarios although this could have been done to gain insight into how the design drivers for ship and uxv lars would affect the design of potential uxv motherships for the case studies described a particular fleet of uxvs was proposed thus changes in the values adopted for the queuing network could reveal the likely impact on the mothership s capability to support uxvs such changes might have resulted in further distinct mothership solutions due to the implications regarding the required equipment systems spaces associated complement and on board supporting services fig 6 summarises the overall flow of information that would be expected in a study of uxv mothership system capability thus information would flow from the conops to the qt model and then to the architectural model of the mothership enabling the calculation of ship size and its upc the development of multiple options in each of the first three stages would allow a cost and operational effectiveness analysis coea to be conducted the arrows from qt and the dbba represent two possible approaches the use of the qt model to develop specifications for mothership alternatives as was done in this study or the use of mothership designs to constrain the numerical characteristics for nodes in a qt analysis the latter could have been used to drive lars or even uxv development conops studies are typically conducted to define the payload required throughout a set of mission scenarios for the purpose of demonstrating the proposed uxv mothership design approach a fleet of uxvs was proposed for potential mission scenarios the qt network tool is a numerical approach that employs the mean value analysis mva algorithm for queuing networks without buffers as described by bose 2002 analysing a proposed network of uxv operations supported by a mothership the tool provides information regarding i the lar capability i e lar duration of the resulted mothership and ii mission bay and uxv related ship facilities as well as the incurred queuing demands that have to be considered in the mission bay configurations the javascript ucl concept ship design tool that employs the dbb approach is then used to configure the mission bay arrangements and the overall disposition of the blocks resulting in the uxv mothership design while also preforming basic architectural analyses i e stability powering the resulted designs were costed using ucl upc algorithms ucl 2014a finally various uxv mothership options can be assesses against cost upc and operational effectiveness lar capability measures the proposed uxv mothership design approach is presented in the usv case studies below 4 usv case study conops and system modelling for the purpose of this study a usv fleet package of some 60 vehicles was assumed consisting of two distinct usv types as shown in table 1 fleets composed of multiple vehicle types could have diverse capabilities but may also present distinct demands for mission bay systems and equipment including larss the large number of vehicles was specified to present a challenging requirement contrasting with current ship designs featuring small numbers of uxvs the wider system network analysed using the qt model is shown in fig 7 which is a modification of generic fig 2 with the input data for nodes shown in table a1 in appendix 1 this analysis gives the amount of space required around each shipboard node e g lars in the form of queue length which could be multiplied by the physical size of each relevant usv to determine area required the usv related activities were divided into the following stages 1 the deployment of the usv fleet for a given mission scenario would start with positioning the stowed vehicles on board the mothership adjacent to the lar positions using internal handling systems i e stowage handling node 2 vehicles would be directed towards the lar points i e launch nodes where final pre mission checks would be performed involving fuel battery ammunition levels checks and fault tracing before launching them into the water 3 once launched the usvs transit towards the mission theatre i e mission theatre nodes where certain tasks would be performed according to the appropriate conops scenario 4 in case of a detected malfunction in the usvs control room on the mothership i e malfunction at sea node the affected vehicle s would abort the mission and if possible head back to the mothership where they would be intended to be recovered on board for repairs refuel recharge and rearming i e maintenance refuelling and rearming nodes and are then re launched alternatively if a repair by exchange policy was deemed appropriate spare vehicles would be launched to replace defective ones generally during peacetime vehicles would be recovered on board and stowed where any necessary further vehicle repairs could be undertaken 5 given that the installed energy and ammunition capacity of a usv is likely to be limited it may be necessary for vehicles to be able to be refuelled and rearmed on station i e refuel and ordnance nodes 6 once the operations at the mission theatre had been completed the vehicles would return to the mothership to be recovered on board at the lar points i e recovery nodes thereafter the vehicles would be stowed while any ammunition replenished unless directed energy weapons were employed 7 once the vehicles completed their allocated activities they would be recovered on board and stowed while stowed the vehicles are likely to require certain activities including refuel recharge as well as exchange of any collected data information with the mothership i e through plug ins or without physical connections via wireless technology 5 usv mothership design case studies the approach shown in fig 6 was applied to three mothership case studies the qt model was used in a comparative manner with different lars options being compared against a common usv fleet requirement metrics appropriate to operational effectiveness and ship requirements were extracted from the qt model with concept level balanced ship designs then being developed and costed using excel tools and the javascript layout tool costing of the potential mothership options was performed using the ucl ship costing procedure ucl 2014a fig 8 summarises the baseline and two variant designs design variant 1 represented an incremental design change i e enhancement of a single ship s lar capability the effect investigated was to increase the number of larss fitted in a single mothership by doubling the lar capability through fitting four cranes in the amidships mission bay i e two port and two starboard cranes and two ramps in the stern mission bay in contrast design variant 2 represented a step design change the effect investigated was to distribute equally the fleet of usvs in two smaller identical mothership designs each with the same larss as the baseline ship 5 1 baseline mothership design the principal particulars of the baseline usv mothership design are described in table 2 and table 3 summarises the various craft carried by the mothership in addition to these a basic frigate level self defence and communications system was included fig 9 shows the ga of the baseline mothership colour coded by functional group float functional group in blue move functional group in yellow fight functional group in red and infrastructure functional group in green the baseline design featured two usv bays and ocean interfaces one amidships in the superstructure and one at the stern the details of the ga beyond the usv features are extracted from kouriampalis 2019 which needs to be consulted for completeness which is beyond the main thrust of this paper the service facilities associated with the proposed mission bay arrangements are listed in table 4 while the queuing spaces resulting from modelling the network considered are shown in table 5 two mission bay arrangements i e amidships and stern were proposed as shown in figs 10 and 11 based on the required number of usv spaces and allowances for equipment personnel access etc the lar capability for the baseline mothership design was defined by the queuing network model in the form of the total time i e actual service time plus queuing delay required to deploy and retrieve the whole fleet of usvs namely 20 usvs type a operated from stern mission bay and 40 usvs type b operated from amidships mission bay this is summarised in table 6 5 2 mothership design variants other than the lars and uxv requirements the design requirements for variant 1 increased lars were identical to those for the baseline i e defensive weapons accommodation etc design variant 2 had a smaller complement per ship due to the smaller number of uxvs however the duplication of defensive and auxiliary systems in a multi ship approach conributed to the increased overall cost table 7 summarises several comparative characteristics across the three ship designs including lars and overall ship design characteristics these are shown in absolute values and non dimensionalised to the baseline mothership design 6 discussion of results 6 1 analysis of the results of lar capability and usv mothership configuration the resultant usv mothership baseline design option was quite large relative to current usv carrying naval combatants this was due to the substantial mission bay arrangements for such a fleet of usvs having to be integrated into a naval ship design the overall beam of each usv mothership design was driven by the arrangement of the mission oriented spaces additionally the mission bay spaces were seen to drive the general configuration of the ship it was observed that the disposition of the fight and move functional group elements primarily usv bays and main machinery were prioritised while the infrastructure and float functional groups had to meet typical naval standards as did the overall ship all contributed to the overall substantial usv mothership designs 6 1 1 first design variant assessing the impact of increasing the number of the larss employed in the mission bay arrangements and the resulting usv mothership design showed that the increase of these service facilities enhanced the deployment and retrieval of the prospective usv fleet for an assumed mission scenario this first design variant gave an improved ship s lar capability thus leading to a faster launching and recovering of the specified usv fleet design variant 1 enabled concurrent lar activities for the same size of usv fleet when compared to the fleet operated from the baseline usv mothership design because of the increased number of lar service facilities which were able to be operated independently the major ship design characteristics namely displacement enclosed volume density and upc were comparable for the usv baseline design and design variant 1 table 1 despite the similarities in the overall ship design characteristics the lar capability performances achieved in the baseline design and the design variant 1 were noticeably different as seen in table 7 although lar overall capability in design variant 1 was improved by roughly 25 when compared to the baseline design through installing twice the number of larss the overall ship impact was relatively small design variant 1 upc was 1 0 less than that of baseline design although more larss were installed in design variant 1 the resultant mission bays were smaller than those of the baseline design since the queuing spaces were decreased which allowed the mission bays to be reconfigured moreover it was observed that the integration of the appropriate mission oriented spaces resulted in distinctly different mothership design configurations illustrated in figure a2 1 in appendix 2 this was due to the integration of twice the number of larss which meant for design variant 1 different configurations of the mission bays and thus for the overall mothership arrangement including the ship passageway arrangement and the arrangement of the crew accommodation spaces compared to the baseline the amidships mission bay of design variant 1 was significantly reconfigured since the need of queuing spaces ahead of the port and starboard crane based larss was significantly reduced therefore the spaces that were initially used for queuing in the amidships mission bay of the baseline usv mothership design could then be employed for stowage space resulting in the reduced amidships mission bay configuration in design variant 1 moreover the resultant stern mission bay configuration of design variant 1 required no queuing space resulting in a smaller stern mission bay arrangement than for the baseline design this counter intuitive result shows that using the dbb ship synthesis approach over purely numerical sizing ensured a better means for initial ship sizing certainly for such architecturally driven ships since the resultant stern mission bay arrangement fitted in design variant 1 was smaller in length this readily enabled a double sided and athwartships passageway arrangement within comparable overall ship design characteristics i e displacement gross volume and overall length this was considered plausible due to the space made available in design variant 1 through accommodating a smaller stern mission bay it is noteworthy that the overall beams i e 31 m of both the baseline design and design variant 1 were driven by the size of the proposed mission bay arrangements given the maximum beam a double sided and athwartships passageway arrangement might be desirable in easing accessibility i e enhanced routeability given a degree of passageway redundancy throughout the main access decks however this raised possible structural considerations arising from such an arrangement such issues as the arrangement of openings i e uptakes downtakes hatches and other openings would need to be addressed for longitudinal strength implications chalmers 1993 with the extensive stern mission bay integrated in the baseline design a double passageway arrangement was likely to have resulted in a bigger ship given a smaller stern mission bay accommodated in design variant 1 than in the baseline design a more flexible overall ship arrangement was possible with regards to the accommodation spaces the available deck area due to the shorter stern mission bay meant the accommodation spaces could be pushed further aft in the ship this could prove to be a more attractive solution for laying out these jr accommodation spaces given wave induced ship motions are likely to be less in the central aft portion of the ship than in the forward location of the ship it was also observed that design variant 1 ought to achieve a noticeably better lar capability seen in table 7 with an estimated cost upc that is comparable to that of the baseline usv mothership design this comparison indicated that the lar capability of the mothership could be noticeably improved for almost the same major ship design characteristics ship displacement 1 smaller than that of baseline and assessed upc 6 1 2 second design variant the concept of splitting equally the assumed fleet of usvs between two identical smaller motherships was considered as a plausible second alternative to the quite large and costly baseline design compared to the option of a single usv mothership design two design variant 2 ships shown in figure a2 2 in appendix 2 would provide the force command with better force redundancy by distributing the usv fleet across two hulls this would avoid a single hull lethality hit destroying the whole of the force s usv fleet s capability or mitigating lesser damage states the proposed measure of the mothership s lar capability for the assumed generic mission scenario was found to be significantly improved for design variant 2 when compared to the baseline design this was due to a more effective lar arrangement for the given usv fleet such an overall lar enhancement could have been expected due to the decrease of the number of usvs operated from each of the design variant 2 vessels since each one of them had two mission bays in such a design option the overall usv capability was maintained but it was accommodated and independently supported by the two identical motherships furthermore these two smaller motherships could independently transit towards a potential theatre of operations and concurrently deploy their usv capability to meet that mission the reduced mission bay size for the design variant 2 solution consequent on a reduced number of usvs operated by each ship plus the decrease in accommodation space for the lower crew numbers given the reduction of usv fleet per ship and the smaller ship size resulted in a noticeably smaller ship design solution than the baseline option i e 25 smaller in gross volume and 22 smaller in displacement than the baseline at a upc 19 cheaper per ship hence when compared to the baseline design the integration of the resultant mission oriented arrangements into the mothership design resulted in a ship design option with different major ship design characteristics and internal arrangements design variant 2 mission bays were reconfigured from those for the baseline based on the derived reduced stowage demands and the reduced queuing effects 70 less queuing demands in amidships mission bay for design variant 2 compared to the baseline plus needing a third fewer queuing spaces for the stern mission bay giving smaller and noticeably different ship arrangements to those of the baseline design this enabled the maximum beam requirement to be reduced to 26 m from 31 m for the baseline which subsequently drove the overall beam of design variant 2 i e maximum beam 16 smaller to that of the baseline design the proposed ga of design variant 2 followed the generic deck plan arrangement adopted in both the baseline design and design variant 1 i e double bottom two machinery decks two main passageway decks and superstructure two vessels of design variant 2 could together achieve a significantly enhanced lar capability over the baseline design since the two ships could simultaneously deploy and retrieve the fleet of usvs however the overall upc to acquire the two smaller identical usv motherships was estimated to 62 greater than that for the single baseline design consequent on procuring two ships and would have greater running costs 6 2 review of the proposed uxv fleet mothership design approach the proposed uxv mothership design approach i e combining the qt tool with the architectural oriented ship design provides a requirement driven approach to the design of a mothership for a fleet of uxvs for mothership design studies such an approach could be employed in an actual concept phase in collaboration with mission specialists thus various potential ship design solutions could be investigated in terms of technical feasibility and affordability and result in refining the user requirements captured through a comprehensive requirements elucidation process andrews 2018 due to the immature nature of uxv technology the mothership design case studies were a means to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed evaluation approach to aid early work on a future concept of a fleet of uxvs rather than the initiation of a full concept design since uxv technology continues to develop rapidly the research aim was to scope the problem of a uxv fleet operational scenario supported by a mother vessel while providing reasonable and believable results of varying the larss and mission bay features at high level the purpose of this research was to devise a plausible approach for exploring the implications of deploying a fleet of uxvs on the design of a potential mothership able to host many such autonomous assets on board deploy recover and support their operations for typical naval missions thus incremental and step design changes were undertaken to a sufficient level of detail appropriate to what might be considered pre concept research the research investigated major ship s capabilities to accommodate and support a fleet of usvs emphasising the impact of lars on the design of a mothership the proposed approach was broad brush and focused on usv operational impacts on the mission bay configurations and hence on the overall configuration of a potential usv mothership while still producing concept level naval architecturally balanced ship designs given the driving ship design issue for such a mothership would be the deployment of a large number of usvs recourse to a numerical and structured approach for assessing the impact of such operating conditions was necessary network theory seemed to provide the basis of modelling the fleet of usvs when operated from a mothership due to the set of tasks the usvs would undertake in a predefined sequence this sequence could be assumed to meet a generic flow of activities in the order of launch i e mission initiation mission activities and appropriate support during a mission scenario and recovery i e mission completion consequently a network system of uxv related activities was devised where those activities taking place on board the mothership including lar operations would be likely to significantly impact the design of a ship this is because the on board ship support systems could be represented as the facilities providing an appropriate service to each usv and thus queuing network theory was able to capture the relevant operational steps use of qt was possible due to the limited number of service facilities likely to be available on a ship and the large number of usvs to be processed through the deployment process additionally the queuing network model was used to quantify a mothership s lar capability as a proxy measure of the usv fleet s mission effectiveness this then provided a means to compare different mothership design options with the addition of comparative upc estimates from the concept level balanced ship designs it was possible to define some coea like conclusions applying qt to network systems is a mathematical modelling approach that can be considered to approximate the behaviour of a real process one alternative to qt in modelling network systems would be to use a simulation software package that would mimic the behaviour of the deployment recovering of the fleet of uxvs more realistically than simple numerical models such as the qt based approach explored simulations ought to provide more accurate representations of the process of deploying a fleet of uxvs from a surface ship as well as providing further potential insights through for example animations however such simulation software would require detailed understanding of a yet to be developed use of a large number of disparate uxvs at sea currently it would probably still be preferable to adopt a combination of both numerical modelling and high level simplified simulation techniques this is because numerical modelling such as provided by qt enables an abstraction of the problem revealing its underlying structure and the cause and effect relationships inside the system consequently at this very early stage investigation the use of queuing network theory was seen to be more appropriate and sufficient when used with an early stage architecturally driven ship synthesis approach e g the ucl dbb approach andrews 2018 the demonstrated combination of qt and the ucl dbb approach enabled exploration of both processes and the arrangements for handling different uxv related aspects on board a mothership the qt tool could provide meaningful investigation into the impact of potential tasks to be undertaken by a fleet of uxvs addressing the design of mission bays which were shown to be key to such mothership design options 7 conclusions 7 1 general conclusions overall a new quantitative and structured approach was proposed and implemented to capture at early stage design the implications of rapidly deploying from and retrieving a fleet of uxvs to a new concept mothership surface vessel this showed operating such a fleet of uninhabited vehicles resulted in large and costly naval vessels it was demonstrated through the ship design case studies that the proposed approach was able to differentiate between different design options this difference centred on the choice and use of the metrics extracted from the qt model acting as measures of a uxv mothership s capability as well as assessing the impact of uxv operations on the mission bay arrangements thus distinct mothership design options in terms of size configuration and performance were produced by integrating the various proposed mission bay arrangements into a new overall ship design solution the mothership options were assessed against what was considered to be meaningful criteria which were met using the proposed design approach thus ship upc and lar capability acted jointly as a proxy measure of operational cost effectiveness in the absence of direct mission performance indicators and fully costed procurement and through life expenditure although specific down selection methods were not considered as part of this research coea can be seen as a framework to assist such a decision making process given the values were essentially indicative the results could only be strictly considered on a comparative basis when judging potential options furthermore the latter should be seen as part of a wider exploration of the available solution space andrews 2018 the integration of the qt tool with a ship design tool was seen as providing the ship designer with insights into the space demands from operating an assumed uxv fleet composition additionally the number and types of on board uxv facilities the ship s performance requirements i e s5 plus combat systems capability brown and andrews 1980 and the appropriate configuration for a mothership to successfully carry on board and support the operations of a given fleet of uxvs were all broadly assessed furthermore qt modelling was considered a reasonable means in assessing a uxv mothership s capability by numerically indicating the operational effectiveness that can be achieved by the engagement of a potential uxv mothership in a generic mission scenario thus believable and informative concept solutions informing the impacts of future technologies were considered to be demonstrated 7 2 further work this broad exploration of a limited set of designs necessarily revealed several limitations which emerged throughout the development implementation and application of the proposed uxv mothership design approach in essd such aspects merit further investigation in order to improve the proposed evaluation approach the javascript tool could be further developed to include modelling different hull types and important essd analyses such as damage stability and seakeeping a full concept phase would not just require further conops but also a comparative ship solution space exploration andrews 2018 this might well reveal unconventional or multi hull configurations could provide cost effective competing design styles in reality the duration of lar activities per vehicle is likely to be affected by endogenous i e human factor related aspects ship speed and exogenous i e sea state and headings ship motions factors the anglo dutch laura project has been investigating probabilistic methods for describing lar operations in order to quantify some of those factors knight 2012 such investigations are based on essd experience simulations i e seakeeping model testing lar research probabilistic and risk based design research as well as feedback from operators involved in current uxv lar operations thus the proposed uxv mothership design evaluation approach could be used to interface with such insights such investigation should be able to inform the lar service times per vehicle modelled in the proposed queuing network tool since more realistic data modelling would then be available albeit for specific current vehicles simulation techniques although computationally more expensive could provide a more accurate analysis of queuing networks the proposed mothership design evaluation approach can be seen to provide an early investigation of the implications of a fleet of uxvs on the configuration of a mothership since it allows a relatively fast depending on the complexity of the network system under study exploration and comparison of different mothership design options against a cost lar capability criteria favourable design options might then emerge through conducting comparative studies these could then be explored using simulation techniques providing more accurate results on the vehicles operations supported from the ship and keeping in step with uxv technologies for fleet like operations despite the above issues it is considered that the research presented here has shown how high level and generic information resulting from numerical operating modelling techniques can be integrated

21237,uninhabited vehicles uxvs are becoming an important component of naval warfare providing an entirely new capability by projecting military power in a more affordable way through the use of uxvs exposure of human life to military threats should be significantly reduced while several navies are employing uxvs for a variety of applications the concept of operating a fleet of such vehicles from a mothership that supports their overall operations during a mission is a further challenge this paper describes the research conducted by university college london ucl design research centre drc to develop and demonstrate a relevant analytical approach to design a mothership supporting a fleet of uxvs this research should provide ship designers with the basis for early stage assessment of the impact of the various facilities seen as appropriate to host and support a substantial fleet of uxvs it is particularly focused on the launch and recovery lar capability of the uxv mothership the research explored various options to demonstrate the proposed approach rather than producing a definitive mothership design solution this was appropriate given the fact that any uxv fleet composition is hard to predict since mission related and uxv technology is rapidly developing so both must be speculative it was found that the qt tool could provide meaningful investigation into the impact of potential tasks to be undertaken by a fleet of uxvs addressing the design of mission bays which were shown to be key to usv mothership design while more focused simulations could refine subsystem options this was not pursued given the technology is still developing consequently at this very early stage of investigating the deployment of a fleet of usvs from surface ships through case studies queuing network theory was seen to be more appropriate than a simulation based analysis for this initial exploratory and investigatory work on future naval deployment of uxvs keywords uxv fleet

surface vessel can be seen as a new capability consequently there is a need to investigate the ship design implications of this new operational concept the deployment of a fleet of uxvs in a theatre of operations requires the presence of a mother vessel or several vessels capable of transporting and hosting a considerable force of uxvs together with supporting facilities this means a design approach needs to be devised in order to explore at a concept level how a fleet of uxvs could drive the design of a mothership the proposed approach exploits the ucl originated design building block dbb approach to early stage ship design essd andrews and pawling 2003 and combines it with an analytical tool which would quantify the operations of a fleet of uxvs where the mothership supports the lar of that fleet this is seen to be a holistic numerically and architecturally focused investigation of the initial design of such a vessel type studies have been undertaken using a recently developed ucl dbb based ship design tool informed by the proposed method for evaluating the lar implications of a fleet of uxvs and their associated facilities which drive the mothership designs the paper firstly outlines the problem of deploying supporting and retrieving a fleet of uxvs from warships followed by the proposed approach to tackle the lar demands thereafter several ship design case studies demonstrate the proposed approach finally the mothership evaluation approach for the early design stages is discussed and the main conclusions are provided from the research 2 background to uxv naval deployment this section considers issues raised by the deployment of a uxv fleet from a naval surface ship it explores the topics of uxvs and naval ship design with the aim of identifying issues that are both relevant and feasible in investigating the deployment of a large number of naval uxvs from surface vessels 2 1 deployment of a fleet of uninhabited vehicles in support of naval missions uxvs provide a number of potential benefits to naval operations as they can act as force multipliers while reducing the operational risks to which personnel might be exposed savitz et al 2013 the future vision of naval operations involves the application of autonomous vehicles that could potentially reduce personnel related costs by reducing the extent of facilities on board naval combatants required for humans canning 2005 this would lessen humans exposure to tasks that are dirty dealing with hazardous material dull long duration and dangerous exposure to hostile environment alkire et al 2010 pawling and andrews 2009 additionally removing the human from the vehicle can significantly reduce vehicle size and also lower its signatures clapper et al 2012 advances in computer software speed and processing power improved sensor technologies enhanced communications better image processing capabilities efficient and miniaturized propulsion systems giving longer endurance and range make uxvs potentially attractive rather than deploying one or two uxvs per ship a substantial coordinated fleet of uxvs could provide an increased capability to naval missions especially if supported from a mothership mission profiles would be determined by a range of appropriate concepts of operations conops where each conop should define the number and types of uxvs required to operate in each mission theatre the capabilities uxvs deliver for each mission would be driven by the needs to meet each selected mission scenario which can then give the technological requirements for both uxvs and support vessels canning 2005 the operations of uxvs during a naval mission could cover all evolutions from the deployment of the vehicles to the mission theatre to their recovery on board the host ship including the required support while they are deployed the off board tasks involve the support of the uxvs while on station i e monitoring identification of potential problems command and control c2 interpreting sensor information communications and interoperation authorisation of weapon systems use or other mission related activities refuelling recharging and replenishing ordnance on station uxv operations on board the mothership could include fault diagnosis and repair maintenance refuelling rearming stowage pre mission checks and lar clapper et al 2007 broadbent and binns 2006 a uxv mothership would provide the base for a group of uxvs integrated into an overall naval force providing not just their stowage maintenance and lar operations but also significantly contributing to c2 and communications to manage them braithwaite 2013 although stowage space demands on board handling systems maintenance and refuel equipment and ordnance for the uxvs systems have implications on the design of a mothership any successful uxv operations are likely to depend substantially on the capabilities of delivering and recovering the vehicles from the operational area thomsen 2007 this would have a major impact on the performance configuration and size of the intended mothership there are numerous potential ways of deploying and retrieving uxvs from naval ships including catapult launcher crane and stern ramp issues relevant to selecting appropriate lars for operating a fleet of uxvs from a surface vessel include space allocation appropriate lars location to compensate for wave induced motions in limiting sea state conditions adequate freeboard operational availability deck loading well trained personnel power needs and cost implications lester 2007 a dedicated uxv mothership should have the ability to deploy a range of types and sizes of uxvs that can provide a network of interconnected uxvs able to adjust to changing operational needs braithwaite 2013 this could be achieved by providing flexible mission compartments on the host ship to enable it to support a wide range of uxv operations the implications of the uxvs on a host ship design and the resultant interfaces between the ship and the uxvs are of vital importance and hence need to be considered from the start of designing any host ship to enhance safety multi mission capability mission effectiveness and affordability the mission oriented spaces need to be effectively integrated into the host ship s architecture mothership integration issues include larss stowage spaces and handling systems with a lifting allowance required to allow for the vehicles to be handled inside the mission bay pawling and andrews 2013 maintenance and repair equipment refuelling and rearming facilities relevant crew and their accommodation needs as part of the ship infrastructure power system demands f020 relevant communications systems eaton et al 2014 the capabilities of a mothership relevant to host and support a uxv fleet i e ship performance including speed range endurance seakeeping manoeuvrability and stability 2 2 the challenge of deploying a fleet of uninhabited vehicles from a naval vessel future naval capabilities may be delivered by a system composed of a variety of conventional or unconventional vessels and uninhabited vehicles whereas traditionally a set of naval capabilities could be provided by a single unit and thus designers could focus on that design the evaluation of uxv system concepts is likely to require a broader more holistic approach to designing the complete system thus a ship concept designer must trade off model resolution for speed and flexibility in methods and tools in the early stages of design the dbb approach can be utilised to assess the performance of an individual mothership and daughter craft designs by addressing the capability of the mothership to operate a fleet of uxvs the dbb approach can also examine the impact the uxv fleet and the required facilities sub systems and on board services to support such a fleet will have on the size configuration performance and cost of the resultant mothership solution additionally certain ship architectural decisions e g integration of mission oriented spaces into overall general arrangement ga could also affect the ability of a mothership to host and support such uxv fleets consideration to date of the design of a ship that would be able to carry and support the overall operations of a number of uxvs has been limited to both a specific small number of vehicles and generic conops studies conops studies would normally provide estimates of the numbers and types of uxvs required to bring distinct capabilities into a theatre of operations purton and andrews 2014 however oa assessment that is restricted only to the study of particular conops scenarios was not considered sufficient to inform a generic mothership solution this is because such studies alone would not take into account any potential issues regarding the physical impact of a fleet of uxvs on the design of an equivalent mothership a wider design based approach could capture the overall usage of a fleet of uxvs and then integrate support of that fleet into the design of a mothership therefore accommodating the above features in the ship so it can deliver its primary uxv support function was considered to be key to the design of uxv fleet mothership given the immaturity of the uxv fleet concept and of any appropriate systems for the lar of such a sizeable number of vehicles the physical demands on the mothership had to be speculative thus it is not possible to currently exploit speculative ship design technologies such those for uxvs and larss given their rapid evolution however the design approach is not aimed at delivering definitive or absolute design solutions appropriate to precise uxv technological solutions but to provide ship designers with an approach able to investigate a wide range of potential and generic uxv systems and their supporting equipment and resources most significant decisions ought to be explored if not all fixed in the concept phase of ship design andrews 2018 this was achieved in this investigation through the use of oa to couple conops alternatives with considering the impact of a fleet of uninhabited assets on the design of a dedicated supporting vessel thus oa derived functional requirements were postulated e g extent of larss c2 maintenance refuelling rearming space etc to support the operations of a fleet of uxvs during a set of representative uxv led missions 2 3 the importance of an architectural approach to ship design the traditional numerically based approach to naval ship design synthesis delays architectural modelling while focusing on the readily quantified aspects of speed seakeeping stability strength and the combat system numerical demands thus the initial ship sizing ends up largely considering the internal arrangement once an initial numerically balanced gross weight and space design has been achieved andrews 2003 such sizing ignores the disposition of the different space requirements within the overall envelope and hence is bound to limit exploration of design variety the examination of key design related issues such as the integration of mission bay systems are likely to be postponed to later design stages despite the fact that most warships are generally not weight or space limited but architecturally driven brown 1993 andrews inside out or architecturally driven approach to essd namely the ucl dbb approach has been summarised in andrews 2018 and has become an accepted approach to essd tupper 2013 the dbb approach deliberately encourages exploration of novel solutions both at macro and major level from the commencement of ship design andrews and pawling 2006 analytically described the appropriate steps of using the dbb approach for the design of innovative vessels such as the us navy lcs design the design of an innovative vessel such that of a uxv mothership where large mission bays are to be integrated in the ship is seen to be configurationally driven so the dbb approach was proposed and adopted in the usv mothership case studies described later 3 a novel integrated approach to uxv mothership system design the proposed approach combines two tools a ucl developed on line implementation of the design building block approach and a fortran based queuing theory analysis tool developed by kouriampalis 2019 3 1 the ucl ship design layout tool the use of sophisticated 3d computer aided design cad models such as that of paramarine in the implementation of the dbb approach has a particular drawback such full design level sophisticated naval architectural tools can require a level of detail often inappropriate to the very earliest stage of requirements elucidation andrews 2018 such comprehensive tools demand a high learning and familiarisation overhead for new users such as students pawling et al 2015 in order to address these issues an online ship design toolset implementing the dbb approach in essd has been developed at ucl for use in essd teaching and research pawling et al 2015 coded in javascript this tool uses a simplified cellular representation of the arrangeable space on the ship in a 2 5d i e decks rather than fully 3d approach link 2016 fig 1 shows an example ga for a ucl study of a uxv capable offshore patrol vessel opv pawling et al 2017 as presented by this on line tool although including basic analysis tools such as intact stability and resistance and powering the javascript tool was primarily developed to allow visualisation and manipulation of ships gas the numerical sizing is carried out in excel or any other tool capable of outputting the appropriate data with any more detailed analysis needing to be carried out in sophisticated casd tools such as paramarine moreover using network analysis pawling et al 2015 and 2d modelling the javascript toolset enables quick extraction of a range of spatial features such as the extent of block adjacency these additional geometric metrics can also then be used for innovative network based layout analysis pawling et al 2016 3 2 modelling the operation of uxvs in order to produce an indicative uxv mothership design it was necessary to investigate the overall uxvs operations required to operate a fleet of uxvs those revealed the necessary physical interfaces between the uninhabited assets and the mothership while also suggesting non intuitive improvements to the overall operations the latter were taken into consideration in the mothership studies the likely operations of a fleet of uxvs supported by a mothership was represented as a number of interconnected nodes forming a network system shown in fig 2 where each node represents a task in the uxv operations some nodes relate to mothership characteristics such as launch and recovery and others to the uxv capabilities such as reliability analysis of the operation of a fleet of uxvs from a mothership was seen to need a novel quantitative approach the method developed used queuing theory qt which is a mathematical representation of waiting lines i e queues suitable for the modelling and analysis of certain systems robertazzi 1994 qt has been used in operations research or to determine the type and number of resources to be allocated to provide a specific service within certain time limitations hillier and lieberman 2001 qt has also been applied to various issues involving transport airports production lines telecommunications and the internals of computers bhat 2008 by providing a quantification of performance qt can provide a ship designer with measures of effectiveness of a potential uxv mothership by indicating the ability of a given ship design option to support the operations of the ship s uxv fleet these metrics could then be used to compare the capabilities required to support a fleet of uxvs provided on various potential mothership solutions qt can be adopted to represent any system where customers arrive looking for service of some kind and depart once the appropriate service has been provided such models can be constructed to predict performance measures appropriate to a queuing system such as the queue length i e number of customers waiting in the queue and waiting time which would also contribute to understanding the behaviour of such systems bhat 2008 a simple queuing model can have two distinct elements the waiting area and the service area as is schematically shown in fig 3 such a model may be used to represent a number of customers i e uxvs that arrive at a waiting area where they queue up if all servers are busy such a conceptual model can be used to represent each task shown in fig 3 forming a network of queuing nodes in a qt representation of a uxv mothership the uxvs themselves are the customers and the lars can be considered resources that need to be allocated two key features of qt that led to its adoption were the short computation times and most significantly the high level of abstraction this permitted a wide range of novel lars uxvs and even uxv tasks to be included in a common representation through changing the numerical characteristics of the nodes qt analysis can generate various numerical outputs and in this application these were divided into two broad categories i information on node performance and ii ship impact due to providing the necessary ship equipment systems and resources to support such a fleet of uninhabited assets i e space requirements and consequential mothership size layout and performance i node performance total time a uxv spent at a node i e facility requesting the appropriate service e g lar this relates to the performance of the lars adopted in a given ship installation ii ship impact number of vehicles in a queue at a node as a measure of the space i e waiting area required in front of the facility that provides the service in question number of servers being a measure of the space required for the facilities e g larss that provide the appropriate service e g lar the service rate of a node within a queuing network system could be improved by either allocating more servers of identical type e g more lars or by employing faster servers e g better lars the designer could explore the extent of necessary changes to the underperforming nodes noting subsequent impacts on the mothership design based on such investigations the ship designer could assess whether the performance of the selected network was satisfactory thus the qt tool contributed to the decision making process with regards to the mothership design in terms of the features needed for the mothership to deliver its primary functions see fig 4 in general smaller times spent at each node along with high throughput values and low queue lengths indicated a mothership design of enhanced ability to support the uxv fleet hence by analysing a queuing network of uxv operations on a mothership if the resulted network metrics quantifying the mothership capability to support those operations is satisfactory then the relevant mothership design is accepted otherwise the inputs to queuing network could be modified until the queuing network performance is acceptable 3 3 applying the qt approach to mothership options based on the broader uxv system activities shown in fig 2 the interactions between the uxvs and mothership could be identified as summarised in fig 5 for a dedicated uxv mothership these interactions would likely be significant drivers of the ship design ranging from high level topological decisions such as the location of uxv hangars through design impacts of accommodating multiple lars to specific performance features e g seakeeping to ensure low motions during launch and recovery the qt demonstration of lar capability was used as a proxy measure of the overall effectiveness of potential mothership concepts i e the faster a fleet of uxvs can be launched and subsequently recovered on board then the more efficiently a mission should be executed this focus was primarily to constrain the problem to that which could be assessed in a university research scenario given limited technical information available and the rapid development of uxv technologies the qt tool results were incorporated in the design of a mothership by modelling the performance of the relevant launching nodes and their implications on a mothership design the following issues were considered for their impact on the configuration of the mission bays and thus on the overall mothership design i the implication of the number of uxvs for a given set of lar facilities on a mothership or the implication of the number of lar facilities for a given fleet of uxvs ii the implication of the type of lar facilities for a given fleet of uxvs distinct types of lar equipment provided assumed different lar service time per vehicle based on current data obtained from uxv manufacturers knight 2012 future larss are likely to be enhanced and more sophisticated larss would provide more specific and improved metrics the qt tool was not used to analyse different uxv fleet compositions subject to various operational scenarios although this could have been done to gain insight into how the design drivers for ship and uxv lars would affect the design of potential uxv motherships for the case studies described a particular fleet of uxvs was proposed thus changes in the values adopted for the queuing network could reveal the likely impact on the mothership s capability to support uxvs such changes might have resulted in further distinct mothership solutions due to the implications regarding the required equipment systems spaces associated complement and on board supporting services fig 6 summarises the overall flow of information that would be expected in a study of uxv mothership system capability thus information would flow from the conops to the qt model and then to the architectural model of the mothership enabling the calculation of ship size and its upc the development of multiple options in each of the first three stages would allow a cost and operational effectiveness analysis coea to be conducted the arrows from qt and the dbba represent two possible approaches the use of the qt model to develop specifications for mothership alternatives as was done in this study or the use of mothership designs to constrain the numerical characteristics for nodes in a qt analysis the latter could have been used to drive lars or even uxv development conops studies are typically conducted to define the payload required throughout a set of mission scenarios for the purpose of demonstrating the proposed uxv mothership design approach a fleet of uxvs was proposed for potential mission scenarios the qt network tool is a numerical approach that employs the mean value analysis mva algorithm for queuing networks without buffers as described by bose 2002 analysing a proposed network of uxv operations supported by a mothership the tool provides information regarding i the lar capability i e lar duration of the resulted mothership and ii mission bay and uxv related ship facilities as well as the incurred queuing demands that have to be considered in the mission bay configurations the javascript ucl concept ship design tool that employs the dbb approach is then used to configure the mission bay arrangements and the overall disposition of the blocks resulting in the uxv mothership design while also preforming basic architectural analyses i e stability powering the resulted designs were costed using ucl upc algorithms ucl 2014a finally various uxv mothership options can be assesses against cost upc and operational effectiveness lar capability measures the proposed uxv mothership design approach is presented in the usv case studies below 4 usv case study conops and system modelling for the purpose of this study a usv fleet package of some 60 vehicles was assumed consisting of two distinct usv types as shown in table 1 fleets composed of multiple vehicle types could have diverse capabilities but may also present distinct demands for mission bay systems and equipment including larss the large number of vehicles was specified to present a challenging requirement contrasting with current ship designs featuring small numbers of uxvs the wider system network analysed using the qt model is shown in fig 7 which is a modification of generic fig 2 with the input data for nodes shown in table a1 in appendix 1 this analysis gives the amount of space required around each shipboard node e g lars in the form of queue length which could be multiplied by the physical size of each relevant usv to determine area required the usv related activities were divided into the following stages 1 the deployment of the usv fleet for a given mission scenario would start with positioning the stowed vehicles on board the mothership adjacent to the lar positions using internal handling systems i e stowage handling node 2 vehicles would be directed towards the lar points i e launch nodes where final pre mission checks would be performed involving fuel battery ammunition levels checks and fault tracing before launching them into the water 3 once launched the usvs transit towards the mission theatre i e mission theatre nodes where certain tasks would be performed according to the appropriate conops scenario 4 in case of a detected malfunction in the usvs control room on the mothership i e malfunction at sea node the affected vehicle s would abort the mission and if possible head back to the mothership where they would be intended to be recovered on board for repairs refuel recharge and rearming i e maintenance refuelling and rearming nodes and are then re launched alternatively if a repair by exchange policy was deemed appropriate spare vehicles would be launched to replace defective ones generally during peacetime vehicles would be recovered on board and stowed where any necessary further vehicle repairs could be undertaken 5 given that the installed energy and ammunition capacity of a usv is likely to be limited it may be necessary for vehicles to be able to be refuelled and rearmed on station i e refuel and ordnance nodes 6 once the operations at the mission theatre had been completed the vehicles would return to the mothership to be recovered on board at the lar points i e recovery nodes thereafter the vehicles would be stowed while any ammunition replenished unless directed energy weapons were employed 7 once the vehicles completed their allocated activities they would be recovered on board and stowed while stowed the vehicles are likely to require certain activities including refuel recharge as well as exchange of any collected data information with the mothership i e through plug ins or without physical connections via wireless technology 5 usv mothership design case studies the approach shown in fig 6 was applied to three mothership case studies the qt model was used in a comparative manner with different lars options being compared against a common usv fleet requirement metrics appropriate to operational effectiveness and ship requirements were extracted from the qt model with concept level balanced ship designs then being developed and costed using excel tools and the javascript layout tool costing of the potential mothership options was performed using the ucl ship costing procedure ucl 2014a fig 8 summarises the baseline and two variant designs design variant 1 represented an incremental design change i e enhancement of a single ship s lar capability the effect investigated was to increase the number of larss fitted in a single mothership by doubling the lar capability through fitting four cranes in the amidships mission bay i e two port and two starboard cranes and two ramps in the stern mission bay in contrast design variant 2 represented a step design change the effect investigated was to distribute equally the fleet of usvs in two smaller identical mothership designs each with the same larss as the baseline ship 5 1 baseline mothership design the principal particulars of the baseline usv mothership design are described in table 2 and table 3 summarises the various craft carried by the mothership in addition to these a basic frigate level self defence and communications system was included fig 9 shows the ga of the baseline mothership colour coded by functional group float functional group in blue move functional group in yellow fight functional group in red and infrastructure functional group in green the baseline design featured two usv bays and ocean interfaces one amidships in the superstructure and one at the stern the details of the ga beyond the usv features are extracted from kouriampalis 2019 which needs to be consulted for completeness which is beyond the main thrust of this paper the service facilities associated with the proposed mission bay arrangements are listed in table 4 while the queuing spaces resulting from modelling the network considered are shown in table 5 two mission bay arrangements i e amidships and stern were proposed as shown in figs 10 and 11 based on the required number of usv spaces and allowances for equipment personnel access etc the lar capability for the baseline mothership design was defined by the queuing network model in the form of the total time i e actual service time plus queuing delay required to deploy and retrieve the whole fleet of usvs namely 20 usvs type a operated from stern mission bay and 40 usvs type b operated from amidships mission bay this is summarised in table 6 5 2 mothership design variants other than the lars and uxv requirements the design requirements for variant 1 increased lars were identical to those for the baseline i e defensive weapons accommodation etc design variant 2 had a smaller complement per ship due to the smaller number of uxvs however the duplication of defensive and auxiliary systems in a multi ship approach conributed to the increased overall cost table 7 summarises several comparative characteristics across the three ship designs including lars and overall ship design characteristics these are shown in absolute values and non dimensionalised to the baseline mothership design 6 discussion of results 6 1 analysis of the results of lar capability and usv mothership configuration the resultant usv mothership baseline design option was quite large relative to current usv carrying naval combatants this was due to the substantial mission bay arrangements for such a fleet of usvs having to be integrated into a naval ship design the overall beam of each usv mothership design was driven by the arrangement of the mission oriented spaces additionally the mission bay spaces were seen to drive the general configuration of the ship it was observed that the disposition of the fight and move functional group elements primarily usv bays and main machinery were prioritised while the infrastructure and float functional groups had to meet typical naval standards as did the overall ship all contributed to the overall substantial usv mothership designs 6 1 1 first design variant assessing the impact of increasing the number of the larss employed in the mission bay arrangements and the resulting usv mothership design showed that the increase of these service facilities enhanced the deployment and retrieval of the prospective usv fleet for an assumed mission scenario this first design variant gave an improved ship s lar capability thus leading to a faster launching and recovering of the specified usv fleet design variant 1 enabled concurrent lar activities for the same size of usv fleet when compared to the fleet operated from the baseline usv mothership design because of the increased number of lar service facilities which were able to be operated independently the major ship design characteristics namely displacement enclosed volume density and upc were comparable for the usv baseline design and design variant 1 table 1 despite the similarities in the overall ship design characteristics the lar capability performances achieved in the baseline design and the design variant 1 were noticeably different as seen in table 7 although lar overall capability in design variant 1 was improved by roughly 25 when compared to the baseline design through installing twice the number of larss the overall ship impact was relatively small design variant 1 upc was 1 0 less than that of baseline design although more larss were installed in design variant 1 the resultant mission bays were smaller than those of the baseline design since the queuing spaces were decreased which allowed the mission bays to be reconfigured moreover it was observed that the integration of the appropriate mission oriented spaces resulted in distinctly different mothership design configurations illustrated in figure a2 1 in appendix 2 this was due to the integration of twice the number of larss which meant for design variant 1 different configurations of the mission bays and thus for the overall mothership arrangement including the ship passageway arrangement and the arrangement of the crew accommodation spaces compared to the baseline the amidships mission bay of design variant 1 was significantly reconfigured since the need of queuing spaces ahead of the port and starboard crane based larss was significantly reduced therefore the spaces that were initially used for queuing in the amidships mission bay of the baseline usv mothership design could then be employed for stowage space resulting in the reduced amidships mission bay configuration in design variant 1 moreover the resultant stern mission bay configuration of design variant 1 required no queuing space resulting in a smaller stern mission bay arrangement than for the baseline design this counter intuitive result shows that using the dbb ship synthesis approach over purely numerical sizing ensured a better means for initial ship sizing certainly for such architecturally driven ships since the resultant stern mission bay arrangement fitted in design variant 1 was smaller in length this readily enabled a double sided and athwartships passageway arrangement within comparable overall ship design characteristics i e displacement gross volume and overall length this was considered plausible due to the space made available in design variant 1 through accommodating a smaller stern mission bay it is noteworthy that the overall beams i e 31 m of both the baseline design and design variant 1 were driven by the size of the proposed mission bay arrangements given the maximum beam a double sided and athwartships passageway arrangement might be desirable in easing accessibility i e enhanced routeability given a degree of passageway redundancy throughout the main access decks however this raised possible structural considerations arising from such an arrangement such issues as the arrangement of openings i e uptakes downtakes hatches and other openings would need to be addressed for longitudinal strength implications chalmers 1993 with the extensive stern mission bay integrated in the baseline design a double passageway arrangement was likely to have resulted in a bigger ship given a smaller stern mission bay accommodated in design variant 1 than in the baseline design a more flexible overall ship arrangement was possible with regards to the accommodation spaces the available deck area due to the shorter stern mission bay meant the accommodation spaces could be pushed further aft in the ship this could prove to be a more attractive solution for laying out these jr accommodation spaces given wave induced ship motions are likely to be less in the central aft portion of the ship than in the forward location of the ship it was also observed that design variant 1 ought to achieve a noticeably better lar capability seen in table 7 with an estimated cost upc that is comparable to that of the baseline usv mothership design this comparison indicated that the lar capability of the mothership could be noticeably improved for almost the same major ship design characteristics ship displacement 1 smaller than that of baseline and assessed upc 6 1 2 second design variant the concept of splitting equally the assumed fleet of usvs between two identical smaller motherships was considered as a plausible second alternative to the quite large and costly baseline design compared to the option of a single usv mothership design two design variant 2 ships shown in figure a2 2 in appendix 2 would provide the force command with better force redundancy by distributing the usv fleet across two hulls this would avoid a single hull lethality hit destroying the whole of the force s usv fleet s capability or mitigating lesser damage states the proposed measure of the mothership s lar capability for the assumed generic mission scenario was found to be significantly improved for design variant 2 when compared to the baseline design this was due to a more effective lar arrangement for the given usv fleet such an overall lar enhancement could have been expected due to the decrease of the number of usvs operated from each of the design variant 2 vessels since each one of them had two mission bays in such a design option the overall usv capability was maintained but it was accommodated and independently supported by the two identical motherships furthermore these two smaller motherships could independently transit towards a potential theatre of operations and concurrently deploy their usv capability to meet that mission the reduced mission bay size for the design variant 2 solution consequent on a reduced number of usvs operated by each ship plus the decrease in accommodation space for the lower crew numbers given the reduction of usv fleet per ship and the smaller ship size resulted in a noticeably smaller ship design solution than the baseline option i e 25 smaller in gross volume and 22 smaller in displacement than the baseline at a upc 19 cheaper per ship hence when compared to the baseline design the integration of the resultant mission oriented arrangements into the mothership design resulted in a ship design option with different major ship design characteristics and internal arrangements design variant 2 mission bays were reconfigured from those for the baseline based on the derived reduced stowage demands and the reduced queuing effects 70 less queuing demands in amidships mission bay for design variant 2 compared to the baseline plus needing a third fewer queuing spaces for the stern mission bay giving smaller and noticeably different ship arrangements to those of the baseline design this enabled the maximum beam requirement to be reduced to 26 m from 31 m for the baseline which subsequently drove the overall beam of design variant 2 i e maximum beam 16 smaller to that of the baseline design the proposed ga of design variant 2 followed the generic deck plan arrangement adopted in both the baseline design and design variant 1 i e double bottom two machinery decks two main passageway decks and superstructure two vessels of design variant 2 could together achieve a significantly enhanced lar capability over the baseline design since the two ships could simultaneously deploy and retrieve the fleet of usvs however the overall upc to acquire the two smaller identical usv motherships was estimated to 62 greater than that for the single baseline design consequent on procuring two ships and would have greater running costs 6 2 review of the proposed uxv fleet mothership design approach the proposed uxv mothership design approach i e combining the qt tool with the architectural oriented ship design provides a requirement driven approach to the design of a mothership for a fleet of uxvs for mothership design studies such an approach could be employed in an actual concept phase in collaboration with mission specialists thus various potential ship design solutions could be investigated in terms of technical feasibility and affordability and result in refining the user requirements captured through a comprehensive requirements elucidation process andrews 2018 due to the immature nature of uxv technology the mothership design case studies were a means to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed evaluation approach to aid early work on a future concept of a fleet of uxvs rather than the initiation of a full concept design since uxv technology continues to develop rapidly the research aim was to scope the problem of a uxv fleet operational scenario supported by a mother vessel while providing reasonable and believable results of varying the larss and mission bay features at high level the purpose of this research was to devise a plausible approach for exploring the implications of deploying a fleet of uxvs on the design of a potential mothership able to host many such autonomous assets on board deploy recover and support their operations for typical naval missions thus incremental and step design changes were undertaken to a sufficient level of detail appropriate to what might be considered pre concept research the research investigated major ship s capabilities to accommodate and support a fleet of usvs emphasising the impact of lars on the design of a mothership the proposed approach was broad brush and focused on usv operational impacts on the mission bay configurations and hence on the overall configuration of a potential usv mothership while still producing concept level naval architecturally balanced ship designs given the driving ship design issue for such a mothership would be the deployment of a large number of usvs recourse to a numerical and structured approach for assessing the impact of such operating conditions was necessary network theory seemed to provide the basis of modelling the fleet of usvs when operated from a mothership due to the set of tasks the usvs would undertake in a predefined sequence this sequence could be assumed to meet a generic flow of activities in the order of launch i e mission initiation mission activities and appropriate support during a mission scenario and recovery i e mission completion consequently a network system of uxv related activities was devised where those activities taking place on board the mothership including lar operations would be likely to significantly impact the design of a ship this is because the on board ship support systems could be represented as the facilities providing an appropriate service to each usv and thus queuing network theory was able to capture the relevant operational steps use of qt was possible due to the limited number of service facilities likely to be available on a ship and the large number of usvs to be processed through the deployment process additionally the queuing network model was used to quantify a mothership s lar capability as a proxy measure of the usv fleet s mission effectiveness this then provided a means to compare different mothership design options with the addition of comparative upc estimates from the concept level balanced ship designs it was possible to define some coea like conclusions applying qt to network systems is a mathematical modelling approach that can be considered to approximate the behaviour of a real process one alternative to qt in modelling network systems would be to use a simulation software package that would mimic the behaviour of the deployment recovering of the fleet of uxvs more realistically than simple numerical models such as the qt based approach explored simulations ought to provide more accurate representations of the process of deploying a fleet of uxvs from a surface ship as well as providing further potential insights through for example animations however such simulation software would require detailed understanding of a yet to be developed use of a large number of disparate uxvs at sea currently it would probably still be preferable to adopt a combination of both numerical modelling and high level simplified simulation techniques this is because numerical modelling such as provided by qt enables an abstraction of the problem revealing its underlying structure and the cause and effect relationships inside the system consequently at this very early stage investigation the use of queuing network theory was seen to be more appropriate and sufficient when used with an early stage architecturally driven ship synthesis approach e g the ucl dbb approach andrews 2018 the demonstrated combination of qt and the ucl dbb approach enabled exploration of both processes and the arrangements for handling different uxv related aspects on board a mothership the qt tool could provide meaningful investigation into the impact of potential tasks to be undertaken by a fleet of uxvs addressing the design of mission bays which were shown to be key to such mothership design options 7 conclusions 7 1 general conclusions overall a new quantitative and structured approach was proposed and implemented to capture at early stage design the implications of rapidly deploying from and retrieving a fleet of uxvs to a new concept mothership surface vessel this showed operating such a fleet of uninhabited vehicles resulted in large and costly naval vessels it was demonstrated through the ship design case studies that the proposed approach was able to differentiate between different design options this difference centred on the choice and use of the metrics extracted from the qt model acting as measures of a uxv mothership s capability as well as assessing the impact of uxv operations on the mission bay arrangements thus distinct mothership design options in terms of size configuration and performance were produced by integrating the various proposed mission bay arrangements into a new overall ship design solution the mothership options were assessed against what was considered to be meaningful criteria which were met using the proposed design approach thus ship upc and lar capability acted jointly as a proxy measure of operational cost effectiveness in the absence of direct mission performance indicators and fully costed procurement and through life expenditure although specific down selection methods were not considered as part of this research coea can be seen as a framework to assist such a decision making process given the values were essentially indicative the results could only be strictly considered on a comparative basis when judging potential options furthermore the latter should be seen as part of a wider exploration of the available solution space andrews 2018 the integration of the qt tool with a ship design tool was seen as providing the ship designer with insights into the space demands from operating an assumed uxv fleet composition additionally the number and types of on board uxv facilities the ship s performance requirements i e s5 plus combat systems capability brown and andrews 1980 and the appropriate configuration for a mothership to successfully carry on board and support the operations of a given fleet of uxvs were all broadly assessed furthermore qt modelling was considered a reasonable means in assessing a uxv mothership s capability by numerically indicating the operational effectiveness that can be achieved by the engagement of a potential uxv mothership in a generic mission scenario thus believable and informative concept solutions informing the impacts of future technologies were considered to be demonstrated 7 2 further work this broad exploration of a limited set of designs necessarily revealed several limitations which emerged throughout the development implementation and application of the proposed uxv mothership design approach in essd such aspects merit further investigation in order to improve the proposed evaluation approach the javascript tool could be further developed to include modelling different hull types and important essd analyses such as damage stability and seakeeping a full concept phase would not just require further conops but also a comparative ship solution space exploration andrews 2018 this might well reveal unconventional or multi hull configurations could provide cost effective competing design styles in reality the duration of lar activities per vehicle is likely to be affected by endogenous i e human factor related aspects ship speed and exogenous i e sea state and headings ship motions factors the anglo dutch laura project has been investigating probabilistic methods for describing lar operations in order to quantify some of those factors knight 2012 such investigations are based on essd experience simulations i e seakeeping model testing lar research probabilistic and risk based design research as well as feedback from operators involved in current uxv lar operations thus the proposed uxv mothership design evaluation approach could be used to interface with such insights such investigation should be able to inform the lar service times per vehicle modelled in the proposed queuing network tool since more realistic data modelling would then be available albeit for specific current vehicles simulation techniques although computationally more expensive could provide a more accurate analysis of queuing networks the proposed mothership design evaluation approach can be seen to provide an early investigation of the implications of a fleet of uxvs on the configuration of a mothership since it allows a relatively fast depending on the complexity of the network system under study exploration and comparison of different mothership design options against a cost lar capability criteria favourable design options might then emerge through conducting comparative studies these could then be explored using simulation techniques providing more accurate results on the vehicles operations supported from the ship and keeping in step with uxv technologies for fleet like operations

21238,dynamic responses of offshore structures are usually calculated by time domain methods employing a step by step procedure in this paper a method to estimate the dynamic response of offshore structures by a combination of segmented responses is proposed which is depending on the pole residue method to calculate those segmented responses this method improves over the traditional pole residue method in two aspects the problem of accuracy loss on poles and residues of an external loading is significantly reduced and adjacent estimated responses can be accurately connected in the laplace domain considering the fact that responses of a single degree of freedom sdof system subjected to a harmonic loading can be analytically obtained a mathematical sdof model imposed by a cosine loading is used to demonstrate and investigate the performance of the pore p method numerical results show that 1 the estimated displacement from the proposed method is consistent with the analytical result 2 the computational time required to obtain poles and residues of the loading is significantly reduced compared to the traditional pole residue method and 3 the developed approach is less sensitive to the adopted time interval compared to numerical approximation procedures such as the newmark β method subsequently a numerical cantilever beam is studied to extend the approach from single input single output to multiple input multiple output and it is found that responses can be estimated with good accuracy finally a physical beam is tested in an experiment with one force sensor measuring the imposed loading one laser rangefinder and five accelerometers recording the displacement and accelerations and good consistency is observed between the estimated responses and the measured data keywords dynamic response offshore structure long time loading pole and residue laplace domain 1 introduction fixed offshore structures such as jacket type platforms and offshore wind turbines are often employed for the exploitation of oil gas and renewable energy in ocean to ensure the safety of a structure during its whole service life dynamic response analysis plays an important role in determining whether its responses match the design code including scenarios such as normal severe and extreme sea conditions in these scenarios the so called long time responses over a period of at least three hours are normally required for fatigue life predication so the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency is a key issue in design and should be taken into account to obtain dynamic responses of a structure time or frequency domain methods are usually employed in engineering traditional wisdom shows that the time domain methods are capable of addressing nonlinear soil structure or fluid structure interaction problems with reasonable accuracy teng and cong 2017 ahmed et al 2016 hafele et al 2016 heo and masashi 2019 because of the complexity of imposed loadings numerical techniques such as newmark β and wilson θ are often employed newmark 1959 adeli et al 1978 bathe and wilson 1976 ozkul 2004 and one can also find a wide application of these numerical techniques in some commercial software packages such as ansys sesam etc however as discussed by clough and penzien 1993 one key issue of using these numerical techniques is the selection of a proper time interval which is often affected by the rate of variation of the applied loading the complexity of nonlinear damping and stiffness properties and the vibration period of the structure one recent work on improving computational efficiency was done by shi et al 2016 who introduced a new unconditionally stable finite difference time domain scheme based on the newmark β algorithm to efficiently solve multiscale problems wang et al 2018 combined the newmark β method with cfd calculations to obtain fast results in the study of vortex induced vibration one can also find similar works on the improvement of these numerical techniques in references mohammadzadeh et al 2017 cameron and griffin 1989 kampas and nicos 2012 taghipour et al 2008 liu et al 2019 in contrast to the time domain methods the frequency domain method has better computational efficiency due to the utilization of a fast fourier transform which explains why frequency domain methods are preferred during the fatigue analysis of designed structures but the frequency domain method is limited to steady state responses only han et al 2019 lemmer et al 2018 parallel to the time and frequency domain methods the laplace domain method has co existed for a long time which is based on the multiplication of transfer functions and external loadings in the laplace domain this method is particularly useful if the forward and inverse transforms can be found directly craig and kurdila 2006 compared to the time or frequency domain methods the laplace domain method was not widely used in engineering due to the difficulty of obtaining laplace transform pairs of arbitrary loadings as an important breakthrough recent work has extended the traditional laplace domain method to be able to deal with arbitrary loadings such as earthquake by representing them with poles and corresponding residues hu et al 2016 besides one can find that a structure with asymmetric system matrices can also be analyzed in the frequency or laplace domain liu et al 2016 2018 however when the new approach is applied to the field of ocean engineering e g fatigue analysis in designing offshore structures it is immediately noted that the difficulty of obtaining poles and residues of external loadings increases rapidly fig 1 a shows the measured signal derived from a riser high mode vortex induced vibration test sponsored by the norwegian deepwater programme ndp which was a riser hydrodynamics testing program the acceleration signal selected at z l 0 6401 is applied z and l represent the distance to the bottom and the length of the rise a detailed description of the experiments can be obtained in reference trim et al 2005 fig 1 b compares the reconstructed and measured signals from 10 to 15 s with a model order of 300 as shown in fig 1 b the reconstructed signal agrees well with the original signal however if the length of the original signal becomes longer while keeping the model order unchanged the computing time increases along with the signal length as shown in fig 2 a more importantly it becomes increasingly difficult for the reconstructed and original signals to match as indicated by the comparison illustrated in fig 2 b to obtain the accurate poles and residues of long time signal the decomposition model order must be set to a sufficiently large number the huge size of the hankel matrix and large model order make the poles and residues estimation difficult fig 1 clearly shows that present pole residue method is good at estimating short time responses seconds level but not long time responses in hours level therefore this paper aims to extend the pole residue method to deal with long time external loadings one easy way is to divide the long time loading into multiple equivalent segments and calculate their responses respectively a critical issue to address in this approach is how to connect these separated responses in the laplace domain which will be discussed in this work two numerical examples i e a single degree of freedom sdof system and a cantilever model will be used to demonstrate the capability and accuracy of the proposed method a beam experiment will then be performed to discuss its potential applications in ocean engineering 2 preliminary pole residue method for laplace domain response calculation three steps are mainly included during the implementation of the pole residue method the first step is to obtain poles and residues of the transfer function of the analyzed system by 1 t s l s 1 l s β l s s μ l s where t s is the transfer function that corresponds to the known positions of input and output and μ l s and β l s are the poles and corresponding residues of the transfer function respectively the second step is to use poles and residues λ l f and α l f to represent an input in the laplace domain as tian et al 2020 2 f s l f 1 l f α l f s λ l f where f s is the laplace transform of an input f t from eqs 1 and 2 the laplace domain response can be obtained 3 y s l s 1 l s β l s s μ l s l f 1 l f α l f s λ l f m 1 l s l f γ m s ν m where ν m and γ m are poles and residues of the laplace domain response y s respectively implementing an inverse laplace transform to this equation the time domain response y t can then be calculated 4 y t l 1 y s m 1 l s l f γ m e ν m t the procedure for obtaining y t is detailed in reference hu et al 2016 2020 3 response estimation by using pole residue method based on piecewise loadings pore p to obtain the dynamic responses of offshore structures under long time loadings e g wave forces currents and winds an easy way is to divide the long time loading into a series of segments and then calculate the responses of the structure subjected to these loading segments thus the main work of this paper is to combine these response segments into the equivalent responses of the structure corresponding to the long time loading in the following section the proposed piecewise pole residue method denoted as pore p is introduced and how the responses under piecewise loadings are calculated and combined is presented 3 1 laplace domain response of a structure subjected to segmented loadings for fixed offshore structures such as offshore platforms offshore wind turbines etc the dynamic responses can be obtained via the following second order differential equation in matrix form as 5 m y t c y t k y t f t where m is a combination of the system mass and the added mass of surrounding fluids and c and k are the damping matrix and stiffness matrix of the system respectively y t represents the displacements of the structure subjected to a loading f t and the first derivative of y t and the second derivative of y t denote the velocities and accelerations of the structure respectively based on the piecewise concept the loading f t can be divided into n s segments with equal or unequal scales here consider the n th segmented loading f n t as an example where n 2 3 n s the motion equation of the structure excited by f n t can be rewritten by 6 m y n t c y n t k y n t f n t different from directly solving eq 6 by using the pole residue method the proposed method divides the long time loadings into a series of segments and employs the pole residue method to the segments which can improve the calculational efficiency greatly the key issue of the proposed method is how to connect the different segment response for n th segment the vibrating equation is converted into the laplace domain as follows liu et al 2017 7 m s 2 c s k y n f s f n s where y n f s is referred to as the laplace domain response excited by f n s which is the laplace transform of f n t note that the assumption of obtaining eq 7 is that the structure during this time segment should start vibrating from rest which may be true for the first segment during most designs but is usually false for other segments in most cases the endpoints of the obtained responses will be continually transferred to subsequent segments thus n 2 in eq 6 is considered the starting number for the response estimation of the n th segment denote the last point of the calculated n 1 th segment s displacements velocities and accelerations as y n 1 t e n d y n 1 t e n d and y n 1 t e n d respectively the resulting laplace domain responses can be obtained by 8 m s 2 c s k y n e s m s y n 1 t e n d m y n 1 t e n d c y n 1 t e n d where y n e s is the transferred responses from the former segment for simplification purposes eq 8 can be rewritten as 9 m s 2 c s k y n e s f n e s in which f n e s can be regarded as an equivalent loading from eqs 7 and 9 the whole laplace domain response y n s can be expressed as 10 y n s y n f s y n e s 3 2 laplace domain response induced by the equivalent loading in eq 10 the second term represents the response induced by the equivalent loading the key is how to calculate the second term y n e s assuming 11 f n t f n 1 t f n p t f n n t where n is the number of dofs of the vibrating system to implement eq 10 the responses of the structure excited by the first segmented loading f 1 p t have to be calculated denote the response at the q th position as y 1 p q s then 12 y 1 q s p 1 n f y 1 p q s where y 1 p q s can be calculated by using eq 3 because the structure initially at rest the second term in eq 10 is zero and 13 y 1 s y 1 f s y 1 1 s y 1 q s y 1 n s the last question is how to obtain y n e s in eq 10 where n 2 3 n s similar to eq 13 the key is to obtain its component y n q e s denote φ h m y n 1 t e n d and φ c m y n 1 t e n d c y n 1 t e n d then 14 f n e s φ h s φ c substituting eq 14 into eq 9 yields 15 m s 2 c s k y n e s φ h s φ c the transient response can be calculated using following formula 16 y n e s t s φ h s φ c where t s m s 2 c s k 1 is the transfer function of the vibrating system 3 3 poles and residues estimation of segmented loadings and transfer function to obtain the poles and corresponding residues of exciting loads a complex exponential decomposition is applied to those forces which is expressed as following liu et al 2020a 17 f n p t l 1 l α n l e λ n l t n f n p 0 p 1 2 n where l is the number of terms λ n l are the poles and α n l are the corresponding residues the poles λ n l and residues α n l are unknown hu et al 2013 proposed a method depending on first order difference equation to estimate the poles and residues of discrete signal which is so called prony ss method depending on the method a hankel matrix consisting of discrete exciting force is constructed as following 18 h k f n p k f n p k 1 f n p k η 1 f n p k 1 f n p k 2 f n p k η f n p k ξ f n p k ξ 1 f n p k ξ η 2 where f n p k f n p k δ t δ t is the sampling interval ξ is the row of the hankel matrix and η is the column letting k 0 and implementing the truncated singular value decomposition to the hankel matrix h 0 the hankel matrix can be expressed as follows liu et al 2020b 19 h 0 u 1 u 2 s 1 0 0 0 v 1 t v 2 t u 1 s 1 v 1 t where u 1 u 2 v 1 and v 2 are block orthogonal matrices s 1 is a diagonal matrix and the superscript represents transpose operation then substituting k 1 into eq 18 and choosing a balanced pattern to express h 0 a realization of system matrix can be calculated as follows hu et al 2013 20 a s 1 1 2 u 1 t h 1 v 1 s 1 1 2 to estimate the poles in eq 17 an eigenvalue analysis is employed to the matrix a using z n l l 1 2 l to represent the eigenvalues the poles can be obtained by formula λ n l ln z n l δ t after estimating the poles λ n l the corresponding residues α n l can be calculated using eq 17 eqs 17 20 are the process of the prony ss method the matrix s 1 is a diagonal matrix with order l i e the decomposition model order it is obvious that the exponential function α e λ t and the pole residue form α s λ are a laplace transform pair the laplace transform of eq 17 can be expressed as follows 21 f n p s l 1 l α n l s λ n l depending on eq 3 once the poles and residues of the n th segmented loading f n t are obtained the next step is calculating the poles and residues of the transfer function of the vibrating system for eq 7 the laplace domain response can be calculated based on cramer s rule as follows 22 y n q f s d q s d s p 1 n 1 p q d q p s d s f n q s where y n q f s and f n q s are the q th element of y n f s and f n s d s is the determinant of the impedance function z s m s 2 c s k d q is the determinant obtained from d s by replacing the q th column in d s with f n s and d q p s is the cofactor of d s based on eq 22 the transfer function can be calculated depending on d q p s and d s and can be further expressed using zeros and poles of the vibrating system hu et al 2016 23 t q p s 1 p q d q p s d s κ t q p s in which 24 t q

multiple degrees of freedom system the equation d s 0 is usually difficult to be solved directly to obtain the poles of the transfer function the vibrating system is converted to an equivalent state space model whose system matrix can be expressed as follows 25 a 0 n n i n n m 1 k m 1 c where 0 n n is the n order zero matrix and i n n is the n order identity matrix implementing eigenvalue analysis to eq 25 the eigenvalues of the system matrix can be obtained i e the poles of the vibrating system μ q p m m 1 2 2 n are estimated similarly the zeros of the vibrating system τ q p l l 1 2 2 n 2 can be calculated by employing eigenvalue analysis the matrix as follows 26 a q p 0 n 1 n 1 i n 1 n 1 m q p 1 k q p m q p 1 c q p where m q p c q p and k q p are the matrix after deleting the p th row and q th column of m c and k substituting the poles μ q p m and the zeros τ q p l into eqs 23 and 24 and letting s 0 the relationship can be obtained as follows 27 t q p 0 1 p q d q p 0 d 0 and 28 t q p 0 π l 1 2 n 2 τ j k l π m 1 2 n μ q p m where d q p 0 k q p d 0 k base on eqs 27 and 28 the scale factor is calculated using following formula 29 κ t q p 0 t q p 0 then the transfer function of the vibrating system can expressed by the pole residue form as follows 30 t q p s m 1 2 n β p q m s μ p q m where the residues β p q m lim s μ p q m s μ p q m t q p s 3 4 calculation of dynamic response for offshore structures the dynamic response of n th segment includes two parts 1 the response induced by the n th segment loading i e y n f s and 2 the response induced by the last point of the calculated n 1 th displacements velocities and accelerations i e y n e s the first part can be easily calculated by substituting eqs 21 and 30 into eq 3 and combining eq 22 as follows 31 y n q f s p 1 n m 1 2 n l γ m p s ν m p the second part is the transient response induced by the last point of n 1 th segment response which can be estimated using eqs 15 and 30 as follows 32 y n q p e s t q p s ϕ h p s ϕ c p where y n q p e s is the response of p th dof induced by q th input ϕ h p and ϕ c p are the p th element of φ h and φ c depending on eq 25 the denominator order of the transfer function t q p s is 2 n and the corresponding numerator order is 2 n 2 hence the denominator order of y n q p e s is 2 n and the numerator order is 2 n 1 after reduction of fractions to a common denominator which means eq 32 can be expressed with pole residue form 33 y n q p e s m 1 2 n δ q p m s μ q p m where δ q p m are the residues of the transient response which are calculated using formula δ q p m lim s μ q p m s μ q p m y n p q e s substituting eqs 31 and 33 into eq 10 the n th segment response in the laplace domain at the q th position can be obtained by 34 y n q s p 1 n m 1 2 n l γ m p s ν m p m 1 2 n δ q p m s μ q p m therefore the time domain response of the structure can also be obtained by implementing an inverse laplace transform as follows 35 y n q t n l 1 y n q s p

system a mathematical sdof system is used to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed piecewise pole residue method with system parameters k 40 n m m 38 6 kg and c 15 7175 n s m in the following studies three key questions will be investigated can the proposed pore p method connect segmented responses what is the computational efficiency compared with the traditional pole residue method can the pore p method provide more accurate results than numerical approximation techniques such as the newmark β method extensively applied in most commercial software packages 4 1 response estimation of the system by using the pore p method to obtain the dynamic responses of this sdof system an external loading is applied to simulate forces resulting from waves which typically have a time period of 2 5 s to 12 s for simplification only one harmonically varying load f t in sin wave form is synthesized with a frequency of 0 2 hz and an amplitude of 1 2 n fig 3 shows the simulated external loading with a time interval δ t 0 01 s with a time duration of 60 s during the implementation of the proposed method the first step is to divide the original external load into a number of segments which can be either equally or unequally sized here we choose n s 3 i e three equal sized segments as an example and a comparison with the original load is shown in fig 4 as shown in eqs 12 13 n a 1 and q 1 considering that the system starts to vibrate from rest the first term in eq 10 needs to be calculated for the response estimation caused by the first segmented load the most important development of this paper is to properly and simultaneously estimate the dynamic responses of the system in the laplace domain and time domain which are caused by the second and subsequent segmented loads to obtain the dynamic response of this system related to the second load segment eqs 31 33 should be calculated and then combined into eq 34 yields the poles and residues of response induced by second segmented loading and the initial conditions of first segment response which are listed in table 1 substitute these values into eq 35 to obtain the estimated responses in the time domain based on the same procedure for obtaining the second segmented response the third segmented response can also be estimated as shown in fig 5 which includes the analytical results by directly solving eq 5 from fig 5 one can find that the estimated displacement from the proposed method is consistent with the analytical result the discrepancy of the two results is subtle and the standard deviation of the discrepancy is 1 0772 10 5 readers can change the segment number and or length of each segment and reach the same conclusion 4 2 investigation of computational efficiency compared with traditional pole residue method as previously discussed one advantage of the proposed method is that it can divide long time loads into segments and then their corresponding responses can be estimated thus an improvement in computational efficiency may be expected when comparing it with the traditional pole residue method in reference hu et al 2016 to assess the efficiency of the proposed method the traditional pole residue method is adopted for the same problem to make results comparable the maximum size of the constructed hankel matrix is kept the same during the implementation of the proposed pore p method e g if the segment has 2000 points then the size of the hankel matrix will be 1000 1001 table 2 lists the cpu time required for both proposed pore p method and the traditional pole residue method to finish the calculation of the structure responses subjected to the external load f t with various time durations note that the length of each segment is maintained at 20 s during the calculations as shown in table 2 the computational time required by the traditional pole residue method is substantially larger and increases rapidly however the proposed pore p method maintains a low computing time consumption when the time duration increasing the significant improvement in computational efficiency results from the reduction in the size of the constructed hankel matrix due to the segmentation of the loading the size of the hankel matrix reaches 15000 15001 by the traditional pole residue method whereas this value is kept constant at 1000 1001 in the pore p method 4 3 accuracy comparison of the proposed to the numerical approximation procedure in most practical issues the analytical results are not easily obtained due to the complexity of the imposed loadings thus numerical approximation procedures such as the newmark β wilson θ etc are often adopted in engineering however as noted by clough and penzien 1993 for any numerical integration procedure its accuracy is dependent on the length of the time increment δ t thus δ t 0 5 s is randomly selected to recalculate the displacement of the system and the parameters except for the time duration of 200 s are identical to those in fig 5 fig 6 shows a comparison of the estimated displacements by using the analytical newmark β method with first parameter 0 5 and second parameter 0 25 i e constant average acceleration method and proposed pore p methods respectively fig 6 reveals obvious discrepancies of the estimated displacements between the analytical and the newmark β methods while the proposed pore p approach provides accurate results even when δ t 0 5 s is employed the theoretical reason for achieving this very good agreement is that the time domain result eq 35 is just an inverse laplace transform of eq 34 which implies that the proposed pore p method provides continuous results while the newmark β is based on numerical integration in each step 5 numerical example 2 a cantilever beam subjected to multiple loads a beam model is employed to investigate the capability of the proposed method for addressing the multiple input multiple output mimo problem with a cross section of 4 4787 1 0 4 m 2 and a height of 3 m fig 7 shows a finite element model fem which is discretized by 10 elements and each node has two translational dofs and one rotational dof based on the fem the stiffness and mass matrices of this model the size of each is 30 30 can be easily obtained with a moment of inertia of 7 9020 1 0 7 m 4 and an elastic modulus of 2 1 1 0 11 pa by implementing an eigen analysis of this model the first two modal frequencies are estimated to be 13 5083 hz and 84 6579 hz respectively to consider the structural damping of the beam we assume that each elemental damping matrix follows the same distribution as the stiffness matrix but with different values a factor of 1 1 0 5 is adopted in the following studies considering the difficulty of numerically obtaining a loading with a physical phenomenon similar to the measured accelerations in fig 1 the part from 10 to 75 s as shown in fig 2 is imposed on the cantilever beam to obtain proper responses as discussed in the first example the first thing is to determine how many segments the loading should be divided into considering the fact that the sampling rate adopted in the ndp experiment is 1200 hz which corresponds to a time interval δ t 8 3333 1 0 4 s with 78001 sampled points in general n s 39 is employed as an example fig 8 shows a comparison of the sampled loading with 39 reconstructed segments note that a model order of 160 is selected for each segment from fig 8 we can conclude that the loading can be properly represented by eq 2 to extend the proposed pore p method to address the mimo problem two loadings as shown in fig 8 will be considered and imposed at the translational dofs i e the first loading occurs at node 5 and the second loading occurs at node 11 based on the same considerations for fig 5 the dynamic responses of the beam can be obtained at all dofs fig 9 a shows the estimated translational displacement at node 11 i e the 29th dof by using the proposed pore p method and the newmark β method which shows general consistency but with some noticeable discrepancies to explain these discrepancies the lsim function in matlab is also employed to obtain the dynamic responses of this beam and a zoomed comparison with the pore p and newmark β is plotted in fig 9 b as shown in fig 9 b the results from the lsim match those from the pore p but do not agree well with those from the newmark β in other words the newmark β method cannot provide accurate results even for a small time interval δ t 8 3333 1 0 4 while the proposed pore p is not sensitive to the time interval compared with the newmark β 6 experimental study to further demonstrate the capability of the proposed pore p method a steel cantilever beam was established and tested in an experiment which is used as an actual physical structure to verify the proposed pore p method the beam has a height of 1 9 m and an area of 4 4787 1 0 4 m 2 s as shown in fig 10 a to obtain the dynamic responses of the beam an exciter laser rangefinder lkg 500 made by keyken and five accelerometers meas 4803a 0002 were attached to the structure the exciter is a reciprocator that can provide periodic loadings with preset frequencies the model of the reciprocator is fsl120slg the rated acceleration is 1 m s 2 the maximum thrust is 2050 n and the position accuracy is 0 03 mm to accurately measure the imposed loading on the beam one force sensor of cls type was installed between the structure and the reciprocator as shown in fig 10 b fig 11 a shows one measured force with a sampling frequency of 500 hz and the recorded displacement from the laser rangefinder at the position 1 6 m from the ground is depicted in fig 11 b in the following section we will investigate whether the proposed method can provide a proper estimation of responses as discussed in the numerical examples system matrices including mass stiffness and damping are required therefore the finite element model of the cantilever beam is established by discretizing the physical model into 19 elements and then the mass matrix and stiffness matrix the size of each is 57 57 can be easily obtained with an elastic modulus of 2 1 1 0 11 pa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 respectively different from the numerical examples rayleigh damping is employed by c α m β k where α 2 ξ ω m ω n ω m ω n and β 2 ξ ω m ω n where ξ is the damping ratio ω m is the fundamental frequency of the cantilever beam and ω n is set among the higher frequencies of the modes that contribute significantly to the dynamic response the two damping factors were estimated by using the eigensystem realization algorithm era to address the impulse response from the accelerometer as shown in fig 12 when the system matrices are obtained the dynamic responses of the model can be estimated based on the segmented loadings here consider a segment number n s 4 as an example fig 13 compares the reconstructed loading with a model order of 160 and the original signal which shows good agreement between them based on the same considerations for the calculations in fig 9 the estimated displacement from the proposed method is plotted in fig 14 with a red line as shown in fig 14 good consistency is observed after 10 s but not at the early part there are a few reasons for the obvious discrepancies within the first 10 s 1 this physical model has non zero displacements and velocities at the starting time point of the numerical calculation and they will cause a transient response of the structural which decays very quickly 2 there may be modeling errors on stiffness mass and damping matrices other scenarios with different excitations have also been attempted and we can conclude that the proposed method is able to provide a reasonable estimation of the dynamic responses 7 conclusions this paper extends the pole residue method to estimate the long time responses of offshore structures based on the idea that if dynamic responses can be estimated segment by segment and properly combined then they can be considered equivalent to those from time domain methods the long time loadings should be divided into segments which may be equally sized these segments are converted to the laplace domain by obtaining their poles and corresponding residues which means that the responses caused by segmented loadings can then be calculated in terms of the traditional pole residue method as a theoretical development of this paper the difficulty of estimating responses transferred from the previous segment was solved in the laplace domain by simultaneously calculating their poles and zeros numerical results show that the proposed pore p method not only can provide more accurate results compared with numerical approximation procedures such as the newmark β method but also achieves significant improvement in computational efficiency compared with the traditional pole residue method the length of each segment is an important parameter in determining computational time and is closely related to the size of the constructed hankel matrix our experience indicates that a matrix size smaller than 2000 2000 can be first tried in our next step we will further develop this method to handle fluid structure interaction problems widely present in the field of offshore engineering credit authorship contribution statement jianhua zhang

21238,dynamic responses of offshore structures are usually calculated by time domain methods employing a step by step procedure in this paper a method to estimate the dynamic response of offshore structures by a combination of segmented responses is proposed which is depending on the pole residue method to calculate those segmented responses this method improves over the traditional pole residue method in two aspects the problem of accuracy loss on poles and residues of an external loading is significantly reduced and adjacent estimated responses can be accurately connected in the laplace domain considering the fact that responses of a single degree of freedom sdof system subjected to a harmonic loading can be analytically obtained a mathematical sdof model imposed by a cosine loading is used to demonstrate and investigate the performance of the pore p method numerical results show that 1 the estimated displacement from the proposed method is consistent with the analytical result 2 the computational time required to obtain poles and residues of the loading is significantly reduced compared to the traditional pole residue method and 3 the developed approach is less sensitive to the adopted time interval compared to numerical approximation procedures such as the newmark β method subsequently a numerical cantilever beam is studied to extend the approach from single input single output to multiple input multiple output and it is found that responses can be estimated with good accuracy finally a physical beam is tested in an experiment with one force sensor measuring the imposed loading one laser rangefinder and five accelerometers recording the displacement and accelerations and good consistency is observed between the estimated responses and the measured data keywords dynamic response offshore structure long time loading pole and residue laplace domain 1 introduction fixed offshore structures such as jacket type platforms and offshore wind turbines are often employed for the exploitation of oil gas and renewable energy in ocean to ensure the safety of a structure during its whole service life dynamic response analysis plays an important role in determining whether its responses match the design code including scenarios such as normal severe and extreme sea conditions in these scenarios the so called long time responses over a period of at least three hours are normally required for fatigue life predication so the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency is a key issue in design and should be taken into account to obtain dynamic responses of a structure time or frequency domain methods are usually employed in engineering traditional wisdom shows that the time domain methods are capable of addressing nonlinear soil structure or fluid structure interaction problems with reasonable accuracy teng and cong 2017 ahmed et al 2016 hafele et al 2016 heo and masashi 2019 because of the complexity of imposed loadings numerical techniques such as newmark β and wilson θ are often employed newmark 1959 adeli et al 1978 bathe and wilson 1976 ozkul 2004 and one can also find a wide application of these numerical techniques in some commercial software packages such as ansys sesam etc however as discussed by clough and penzien 1993 one key issue of using these numerical techniques is the selection of a proper time interval which is often affected by the rate of variation of the applied loading the complexity of nonlinear damping and stiffness properties and the vibration period of the structure one recent work on improving computational efficiency was done by shi et al 2016 who introduced a new unconditionally stable finite difference time domain scheme based on the newmark β algorithm to efficiently solve multiscale problems wang et al 2018 combined the newmark β method with cfd calculations to obtain fast results in the study of vortex induced vibration one can also find similar works on the improvement of these numerical techniques in references mohammadzadeh et al 2017 cameron and griffin 1989 kampas and nicos 2012 taghipour et al 2008 liu et al 2019 in contrast to the time domain methods the frequency domain method has better computational efficiency due to the utilization of a fast fourier transform which explains why frequency domain methods are preferred during the fatigue analysis of designed structures but the frequency domain method is limited to steady state responses only han et al 2019 lemmer et al 2018 parallel to the time and frequency domain methods the laplace domain method has co existed for a long time which is based on the multiplication of transfer functions and external loadings in the laplace domain this method is particularly useful if the forward and inverse transforms can be found directly craig and kurdila 2006 compared to the time or frequency domain methods the laplace domain method was not widely used in engineering due to the difficulty of obtaining laplace transform pairs of arbitrary loadings as an important breakthrough recent work has extended the traditional laplace domain method to be able to deal with arbitrary loadings such as earthquake by representing them with poles and corresponding residues hu et al 2016 besides one can find that a structure with asymmetric system matrices can also be analyzed in the frequency or laplace domain liu et al 2016 2018 however when the new approach is applied to the field of ocean engineering e g fatigue analysis in designing offshore structures it is immediately noted that the difficulty of obtaining poles and residues of external loadings increases rapidly fig 1 a shows the measured signal derived from a riser high mode vortex induced vibration test sponsored by the norwegian deepwater programme ndp which was a riser hydrodynamics testing program the acceleration signal selected at z l 0 6401 is applied z and l represent the distance to the bottom and the length of the rise a detailed description of the experiments can be obtained in reference trim et al 2005 fig 1 b compares the reconstructed and measured signals from 10 to 15 s with a model order of 300 as shown in fig 1 b the reconstructed signal agrees well with the original signal however if the length of the original signal becomes longer while keeping the model order unchanged the computing time increases along with the signal length as shown in fig 2 a more importantly it becomes increasingly difficult for the reconstructed and original signals to match as indicated by the comparison illustrated in fig 2 b to obtain the accurate poles and residues of long time signal the decomposition model order must be set to a sufficiently large number the huge size of the hankel matrix and large model order make the poles and residues estimation difficult fig 1 clearly shows that present pole residue method is good at estimating short time responses seconds level but not long time responses in hours level therefore this paper aims to extend the pole residue method to deal with long time external loadings one easy way is to divide the long time loading into multiple equivalent segments and calculate their responses respectively a critical issue to address in this approach is how to connect these separated responses in the laplace domain which will be discussed in this work two numerical examples i e a single degree of freedom sdof system and a cantilever model will be used to demonstrate the capability and accuracy of the proposed method a beam experiment will then be performed to discuss its potential applications in ocean engineering 2 preliminary pole residue method for laplace domain response calculation three steps are mainly included during the implementation of the pole residue method the first step is to obtain poles and residues of the transfer function of the analyzed system by 1 t s l s 1 l s β l s s μ l s where t s is the transfer function that corresponds to the known positions of input and output and μ l s and β l s are the poles and corresponding residues of the transfer function respectively the second step is to use poles and residues λ l f and α l f to represent an input in the laplace domain as tian et al 2020 2 f s l f 1 l f α l f s λ l f where f s is the laplace transform of an input f t from eqs 1 and 2 the laplace domain response can be obtained 3 y s l s 1 l s β l s s μ l s l f 1 l f α l f s λ l f m 1 l s l f γ m s ν m where ν m and γ m are poles and residues of the laplace domain response y s respectively implementing an inverse laplace transform to this equation the time domain response y t can then be calculated 4 y t l 1 y s m 1 l s l f γ m e ν m t the procedure for obtaining y t is detailed in reference hu et al 2016 2020 3 response estimation by using pole residue method based on piecewise loadings pore p to obtain the dynamic responses of offshore structures under long time loadings e g wave forces currents and winds an easy way is to divide the long time loading into a series of segments and then calculate the responses of the structure subjected to these loading segments thus the main work of this paper is to combine these response segments into the equivalent responses of the structure corresponding to the long time loading in the following section the proposed piecewise pole residue method denoted as pore p is introduced and how the responses under piecewise loadings are calculated and combined is presented 3 1 laplace domain response of a structure subjected to segmented loadings for fixed offshore structures such as offshore platforms offshore wind turbines etc the dynamic responses can be obtained via the following second order differential equation in matrix form as 5 m y t c y t k y t f t where m is a combination of the system mass and the added mass of surrounding fluids and c and k are the damping matrix and stiffness matrix of the system respectively y t represents the displacements of the structure subjected to a loading f t and the first derivative of y t and the second derivative of y t denote the velocities and accelerations of the structure respectively based on the piecewise concept the loading f t can be divided into n s segments with equal or unequal scales here consider the n th segmented loading f n t as an example where n 2 3 n s the motion equation of the structure excited by f n t can be rewritten by 6 m y n t c y n t k y n t f n t different from directly solving eq 6 by using the pole residue method the proposed method divides the long time loadings into a series of segments and employs the pole residue method to the segments which can improve the calculational efficiency greatly the key issue of the proposed method is how to connect the different segment response for n th segment the vibrating equation is converted into the laplace domain as follows liu et al 2017 7 m s 2 c s k y n f s f n s where y n f s is referred to as the laplace domain response excited by f n s which is the laplace transform of f n t note that the assumption of obtaining eq 7 is that the structure during this time segment should start vibrating from rest which may be true for the first segment during most designs but is usually false for other segments in most cases the endpoints of the obtained responses will be continually transferred to subsequent segments thus n 2 in eq 6 is considered the starting number for the response estimation of the n th segment denote the last point of the calculated n 1 th segment s displacements velocities and accelerations as y n 1 t e n d y n 1 t e n d and y n 1 t e n d respectively the resulting laplace domain responses can be obtained by 8 m s 2 c s k y n e s m s y n 1 t e n d m y n 1 t e n d c y n 1 t e n d where y n e s is the transferred responses from the former segment for simplification purposes eq 8 can be rewritten as 9 m s 2 c s k y n e s f n e s in which f n e s can be regarded as an equivalent loading from eqs 7 and 9 the whole laplace domain response y n s can be expressed as 10 y n s y n f s y n e s 3 2 laplace domain response induced by the equivalent loading in eq 10 the second term represents the response induced by the equivalent loading the key is how to calculate the second term y n e s assuming 11 f n t f n 1 t f n p t f n n t where n is the number of dofs of the vibrating system to implement eq 10 the responses of the structure excited by the first segmented loading f 1 p t have to be calculated denote the response at the q th position as y 1 p q s then 12 y 1 q s p 1 n f y 1 p q s where y 1 p q s can be calculated by using eq 3 because the structure initially at rest the second term in eq 10 is zero and 13 y 1 s y 1 f s y 1 1 s y 1 q s y 1 n s the last question is how to obtain y n e s in eq 10 where n 2 3 n s similar to eq 13 the key is to obtain its component y n q e s denote φ h m y n 1 t e n d and φ c m y n 1 t e n d c y n 1 t e n d then 14 f n e s φ h s φ c substituting eq 14 into eq 9 yields 15 m s 2 c s k y n e s φ h s φ c the transient response can be calculated using following formula 16 y n e s t s φ h s φ c where t s m s 2 c s k 1 is the transfer function of the vibrating system 3 3 poles and residues estimation of segmented loadings and transfer function to obtain the poles and corresponding residues of exciting loads a complex exponential decomposition is applied to those forces which is expressed as following liu et al 2020a 17 f n p t l 1 l α n l e λ n l t n f n p 0 p 1 2 n where l is the number of terms λ n l are the poles and α n l are the corresponding residues the poles λ n l and residues α n l are unknown hu et al 2013 proposed a method depending on first order difference equation to estimate the poles and residues of discrete signal which is so called prony ss method depending on the method a hankel matrix consisting of discrete exciting force is constructed as following 18 h k f n p k f n p k 1 f n p k η 1 f n p k 1 f n p k 2 f n p k η f n p k ξ f n p k ξ 1 f n p k ξ η 2 where f n p k f n p k δ t δ t is the sampling interval ξ is the row of the hankel matrix and η is the column letting k 0 and implementing the truncated singular value decomposition to the hankel matrix h 0 the hankel matrix can be expressed as follows liu et al 2020b 19 h 0 u 1 u 2 s 1 0 0 0 v 1 t v 2 t u 1 s 1 v 1 t where u 1 u 2 v 1 and v 2 are block orthogonal matrices s 1 is a diagonal matrix and the superscript represents transpose operation then substituting k 1 into eq 18 and choosing a balanced pattern to express h 0 a realization of system matrix can be calculated as follows hu et al 2013 20 a s 1 1 2 u 1 t h 1 v 1 s 1 1 2 to estimate the poles in eq 17 an eigenvalue analysis is employed to the matrix a using z n l l 1 2 l to represent the eigenvalues the poles can be obtained by formula λ n l ln z n l δ t after estimating the poles λ n l the corresponding residues α n l can be calculated using eq 17 eqs 17 20 are the process of the prony ss method the matrix s 1 is a diagonal matrix with order l i e the decomposition model order it is obvious that the exponential function α e λ t and the pole residue form α s λ are a laplace transform pair the laplace transform of eq 17 can be expressed as follows 21 f n p s l 1 l α n l s λ n l depending on eq 3 once the poles and residues of the n th segmented loading f n t are obtained the next step is calculating the poles and residues of the transfer function of the vibrating system for eq 7 the laplace domain response can be calculated based on cramer s rule as follows 22 y n q f s d q s d s p 1 n 1 p q d q p s d s f n q s where y n q f s and f n q s are the q th element of y n f s and f n s d s is the determinant of the impedance function z s m s 2 c s k d q is the determinant obtained from d s by replacing the q th column in d s with f n s and d q p s is the cofactor of d s based on eq 22 the transfer function can be calculated depending on d q p s and d s and can be further expressed using zeros and poles of the vibrating system hu et al 2016 23 t q p s 1 p q d q p s d s κ t q p s in which 24 t q

multiple degrees of freedom system the equation d s 0 is usually difficult to be solved directly to obtain the poles of the transfer function the vibrating system is converted to an equivalent state space model whose system matrix can be expressed as follows 25 a 0 n n i n n m 1 k m 1 c where 0 n n is the n order zero matrix and i n n is the n order identity matrix implementing eigenvalue analysis to eq 25 the eigenvalues of the system matrix can be obtained i e the poles of the vibrating system μ q p m m 1 2 2 n are estimated similarly the zeros of the vibrating system τ q p l l 1 2 2 n 2 can be calculated by employing eigenvalue analysis the matrix as follows 26 a q p 0 n 1 n 1 i n 1 n 1 m q p 1 k q p m q p 1 c q p where m q p c q p and k q p are the matrix after deleting the p th row and q th column of m c and k substituting the poles μ q p m and the zeros τ q p l into eqs 23 and 24 and letting s 0 the relationship can be obtained as follows 27 t q p 0 1 p q d q p 0 d 0 and 28 t q p 0 π l 1 2 n 2 τ j k l π m 1 2 n μ q p m where d q p 0 k q p d 0 k base on eqs 27 and 28 the scale factor is calculated using following formula 29 κ t q p 0 t q p 0 then the transfer function of the vibrating system can expressed by the pole residue form as follows 30 t q p s m 1 2 n β p q m s μ p q m where the residues β p q m lim s μ p q m s μ p q m t q p s 3 4 calculation of dynamic response for offshore structures the dynamic response of n th segment includes two parts 1 the response induced by the n th segment loading i e y n f s and 2 the response induced by the last point of the calculated n 1 th displacements velocities and accelerations i e y n e s the first part can be easily calculated by substituting eqs 21 and 30 into eq 3 and combining eq 22 as follows 31 y n q f s p 1 n m 1 2 n l γ m p s ν m p the second part is the transient response induced by the last point of n 1 th segment response which can be estimated using eqs 15 and 30 as follows 32 y n q p e s t q p

function t q p s is 2 n and the corresponding numerator order is 2 n 2 hence the denominator order of y n q p e s is 2 n and the numerator order is 2 n 1 after reduction of fractions to a common denominator which means eq 32 can be expressed with pole residue form 33 y n q p e s m 1 2 n δ q p m s μ q p m where δ q p m are the residues of the transient response which are calculated using formula δ q p m lim s μ q p m s μ q p m y n p q e s substituting eqs 31 and 33 into eq 10 the n th segment response in the laplace domain at the q th position can be obtained by 34 y n q s p 1 n m 1 2 n l γ m p s ν m p m 1 2 n δ q p m s μ q p m therefore the time domain response of the structure can also be obtained by implementing an inverse laplace transform as follows 35 y n q t n l 1 y n q s p

system a mathematical sdof system is used to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed piecewise pole residue method with system parameters k 40 n m m 38 6 kg and c 15 7175 n s m in the following studies three key questions will be investigated can the proposed pore p method connect segmented responses what is the computational efficiency compared with the traditional pole residue method can the pore p method provide more accurate results than numerical approximation techniques such as the newmark β method extensively applied in most commercial software packages 4 1 response estimation of the system by using the pore p method to obtain the dynamic responses of this sdof system an external loading is applied to simulate forces resulting from waves which typically have a time period of 2 5 s to 12 s for simplification only one harmonically varying load f t in sin wave form is synthesized with a frequency of 0 2 hz and an amplitude of 1 2 n fig 3 shows the simulated external loading with a time interval δ t 0 01 s with a time duration of 60 s during the implementation of the proposed method the first step is to divide the original external load into a number of segments which can be either equally or unequally sized here we choose n s 3 i e three equal sized segments as an example and a comparison with the original load is shown in fig 4 as shown in eqs 12 13 n a 1 and q 1 considering that the system starts to vibrate from rest the first term in eq 10 needs to be calculated for the response estimation caused by the first segmented load the most important development of this paper is to properly and simultaneously estimate the dynamic responses of the system in the laplace domain and time domain which are caused by the second and subsequent segmented loads to obtain the dynamic response of this system related to the second load segment eqs 31 33 should be calculated and then combined into eq 34 yields the poles and residues of response induced by second segmented loading and the initial conditions of first segment response which are listed in table 1 substitute these values into eq 35 to obtain the estimated responses in the time domain based on the same procedure for obtaining the second segmented response the third segmented response can also be estimated as shown in fig 5 which includes the analytical results by directly solving eq 5 from fig 5 one can find that the estimated displacement from the proposed method is consistent with the analytical result the discrepancy of the two results is subtle and the standard deviation of the discrepancy is 1 0772 10 5 readers can change the segment number and or length of each segment and reach the same conclusion 4 2 investigation of computational efficiency compared with traditional pole residue method as previously discussed one advantage of the proposed method is that it can divide long time loads into segments and then their corresponding responses can be estimated thus an improvement in computational efficiency may be expected when comparing it with the traditional pole residue method in reference hu et al 2016 to assess the efficiency of the proposed method the traditional pole residue method is adopted for the same problem to make results comparable the maximum size of the constructed hankel matrix is kept the same during the implementation of the proposed pore p method e g if the segment has 2000 points then the size of the hankel matrix will be 1000 1001 table 2 lists the cpu time required for both proposed pore p method and the traditional pole residue method to finish the calculation of the structure responses subjected to the external load f t with various time durations note that the length of each segment is maintained at 20 s during the calculations as shown in table 2 the computational time required by the traditional pole residue method is substantially larger and increases rapidly however the proposed pore p method maintains a low computing time consumption when the time duration increasing the significant improvement in computational efficiency results from the reduction in the size of the constructed hankel matrix due to the segmentation of the loading the size of the hankel matrix reaches 15000 15001 by the traditional pole residue method whereas this value is kept constant at 1000 1001 in the pore p method 4 3 accuracy comparison of the proposed to the numerical approximation procedure in most practical issues the analytical results are not easily obtained due to the complexity of the imposed loadings thus numerical approximation procedures such as the newmark β wilson θ etc are often adopted in engineering however as noted by clough and penzien 1993 for any numerical integration procedure its accuracy is dependent on the length of the time increment δ t thus δ t 0 5 s is randomly selected to recalculate the displacement of the system and the parameters except for the time duration of 200 s are identical to those in fig 5 fig 6 shows a comparison of the estimated displacements by using the analytical newmark β method with first parameter 0 5 and second parameter 0 25 i e constant average acceleration method and proposed pore p methods respectively fig 6 reveals obvious discrepancies of the estimated displacements between the analytical and the newmark β methods while the proposed pore p approach provides accurate results even when δ t 0 5 s is employed the theoretical reason for achieving this very good agreement is that the time domain result eq 35 is just an inverse laplace transform of eq 34 which implies that the proposed pore p method provides continuous results while the newmark β is based on numerical integration in each step 5 numerical example 2 a cantilever beam subjected to multiple loads a beam model is employed to investigate the capability of the proposed method for addressing the multiple input multiple output mimo problem with a cross section of 4 4787 1 0 4 m 2 and a height of 3 m fig 7 shows a finite element model fem which is discretized by 10 elements and each node has two translational dofs and one rotational dof based on the fem the stiffness and mass matrices of this model the size of each is 30 30 can be easily obtained with a moment of inertia of 7 9020 1 0 7 m 4 and an elastic modulus of 2 1 1 0 11 pa by implementing an eigen analysis of this model the first two modal frequencies are estimated to be 13 5083 hz and 84 6579 hz respectively to consider the structural damping of the beam we assume that each elemental damping matrix follows the same distribution as the stiffness matrix but with different values a factor of 1 1 0 5 is adopted in the following studies considering the difficulty of numerically obtaining a loading with a physical phenomenon similar to the measured accelerations in fig 1 the part from 10 to 75 s as shown in fig 2 is imposed on the cantilever beam to obtain proper responses as discussed in the first example the first thing is to determine how many segments the loading should be divided into considering the fact that the sampling rate adopted in the ndp experiment is 1200 hz which corresponds to a time interval δ t 8 3333 1 0 4 s with 78001 sampled points in general n s 39 is employed as an example fig 8 shows a comparison of the sampled loading with 39 reconstructed segments note that a model order of 160 is selected for each segment from fig 8 we can conclude that the loading can be properly represented by eq 2 to extend the proposed pore p method to address the mimo problem two loadings as shown in fig 8 will be considered and imposed at the translational dofs i e the first loading occurs at node 5 and the second loading occurs at node 11 based on the same considerations for fig 5 the dynamic responses of the beam can be obtained at all dofs fig 9 a shows the estimated translational displacement at node 11 i e the 29th dof by using the proposed pore p method and the newmark β method which shows general consistency but with some noticeable discrepancies to explain these discrepancies the lsim function in matlab is also employed to obtain the dynamic responses of this beam and a zoomed comparison with the pore p and newmark β is plotted in fig 9 b as shown in fig 9 b the results from the lsim match those from the pore p but do not agree well with those from the newmark β in other words the newmark β method cannot provide accurate results even for a small time interval δ t 8 3333 1 0 4 while the proposed pore p is not sensitive to the time interval compared with the newmark β 6 experimental study to further demonstrate the capability of the proposed pore p method a steel cantilever beam was established and tested in an experiment which is used as an actual physical structure to verify the proposed pore p method the beam has a height of 1 9 m and an area of 4 4787 1 0 4 m 2 s as shown in fig 10 a to obtain the dynamic responses of the beam an exciter laser rangefinder lkg 500 made by keyken and five accelerometers meas 4803a 0002 were attached to the structure the exciter is a reciprocator that can provide periodic loadings with preset frequencies the model of the reciprocator is fsl120slg the rated acceleration is 1 m s 2 the maximum thrust is 2050 n and the position accuracy is 0 03 mm to accurately measure the imposed loading on the beam one force sensor of cls type was installed between the structure and the reciprocator as shown in fig 10 b fig 11 a shows one measured force with a sampling frequency of 500 hz and the recorded displacement from the laser rangefinder at the position 1 6 m from the ground is depicted in fig 11 b in the following section we will investigate whether the proposed method can provide a proper estimation of responses as discussed in the numerical examples system matrices including mass stiffness and damping are required therefore the finite element model of the cantilever beam is established by discretizing the physical model into 19 elements and then the mass matrix and stiffness matrix the size of each is 57 57 can be easily obtained with an elastic modulus of 2 1 1 0 11 pa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 respectively different from the numerical examples rayleigh damping is employed by c α m β k where α 2 ξ ω m ω n ω m ω n and β 2 ξ ω m ω n where ξ is the damping ratio ω m is the fundamental frequency of the cantilever beam and ω n is set among the higher frequencies of the modes that contribute significantly to the dynamic response the two damping factors were estimated by using the eigensystem realization algorithm era to address the impulse response from the accelerometer as shown in fig 12 when the system matrices are obtained the dynamic responses of the model can be estimated based on the segmented loadings here consider a segment number n s 4 as an example fig 13 compares the reconstructed loading with a model order of 160 and the original signal which shows good agreement between them based on the same considerations for the calculations in fig 9 the estimated displacement from the proposed method is plotted in fig 14 with a red line as shown in fig 14 good consistency is observed after 10 s but not at the early part there are a few reasons for the obvious discrepancies within the first 10 s 1 this physical model has non zero displacements and velocities at the starting time point of the numerical calculation and they will cause a transient response of the structural which decays very quickly 2 there may be modeling errors on stiffness mass and damping matrices other scenarios with different excitations have also been attempted and we can conclude that the proposed method is able to provide a reasonable estimation of the dynamic responses 7 conclusions this paper extends the pole residue method to estimate the long time responses of offshore structures based on the idea that if dynamic responses can be estimated segment by segment and properly combined then they can be considered equivalent to those from time domain methods the long time loadings should be divided into segments which may be equally sized these segments are converted to the laplace domain by obtaining their poles and corresponding residues which means that the responses caused by segmented loadings can then be calculated in terms of the traditional pole residue method as a theoretical development of this paper the difficulty of estimating responses transferred from the previous segment was solved in the laplace domain by simultaneously calculating their poles and zeros numerical results show that the proposed pore p method not only can provide more accurate results compared with numerical approximation procedures such as the newmark β method but also achieves significant improvement in computational efficiency compared with the traditional pole residue method the length of each segment is an important parameter in determining computational time and is closely related to the size of the constructed hankel matrix our experience indicates that a matrix size smaller than 2000 2000 can be first tried in our next step we will further develop this method to handle fluid structure interaction problems widely present in the field of offshore engineering credit authorship contribution statement jianhua zhang

21239,this study numerically and experimentally investigates the ship motions and slamming pressures of a 10 000 teu container ship in regular heading waves a modified stavovy chuang model that considers the influence of the wave ship encounter time and asymmetric rolling motions is proposed as the potential flow method to solve symmetric and asymmetric flare slamming calculations instantaneous ship motions from a nonlinear six degree of freedom unified model are adopted to simulate the pressure the ship flare wave encounter time determines the duration of the slamming the commercial software star ccm is utilised for computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of the slamming and motions the modified stavovy chuang model cfd technology and segmented model tests are used for the first time to predict asymmetric slamming accompanied by parametric rolling empirical formulas for various classification society rules are adopted for the cross validation of the symmetric impact forces in conclusion the occurrence of slamming is dominated by the normal impact velocity and the relative positions of the ship and waves the duration of the slamming especially under parametric rolling conditions mainly depends on the rolling period and encountering wave under parametric rolling conditions the magnitude of the slamming pressure decreases and the impact duration increases as the wavelength increases in simulations of symmetric slamming only the duration increases as the wavelength increases and the american bureau of shipping and international association of classification societies results are similar to the test results keywords flare slamming loads paramatric rolling segmented model test cfd classifications rules 1 introduction flare slamming should be attached importance due to increasing large bow flare region as container ship size and capacity increase it is well known that slamming is a nonlinear response of ship wave interaction problem and flare slamming occurs severely in heading wave the relevant investigations should be attached great importance at present the numerical researches of ship motions and slamming loads are divided into two categories potential flow method and cfd computational fluid dynamics method regarding the potential flow method the practical global response model is generally made of a potential time domain code often weakly nonlinear coupled to 2d potential model for slamming and there are many classic theories of slamming von kármán 1929 wagner 1932 zhao and faltinsen 1993 furthermore many researchers have discussed and made recommendations for empirical formula methods they were listed in the international ship structure conference issc 2003 report for instance stavovy and chuang 1976 developed the flare slamming analytical determination method dhavalikar et al 2018 proposed an empirical method as a function of the deadrise angle based on comparisons seo and jeong 2019 compared the slamming pressure from a numerical simulation with the rule formulas proposed by various classification societies and found that the pressures obtained from the formulas of the american bureau of shipping abs and csr tended to be similar to the cfd results these results are expected to be used as a database for revising the slamming load formulas in the future until now the difficulty to incorporate 3d model into practical engineering sea keeping calculation is probably one of the reasons why most of the research on slamming loads is quite concentrated on 2d strip approximation furthermore the potential flow method could not fully reflect the strongly nonlinear problem such as the breaking waves induced by slamming many researchers developed strongly nonlinear model hashimoto and touze 2014 proposed a coupled moving particle semi implicit and finite element method mps fem model for strongly nonlinear fluid structure interaction problems rajendran et al 2016 analysed the vertical responses of a bulk carrier containership and passenger ship using linear to fully nonlinear numerical methods based on strip theory with the development of commercial cfd software slamming analyses based on cfd methods have started to appear chen et al 2014 investigated the local loads for an oil tanker under extreme motion conditions defined in the csr h using the cfd software star ccm cfd simulations including those for a 2d ship section drop and container ship bow flare slamming were reported by kim 2015 wang and guedes soares 2013 discussed slam induced loads on bow flared sections with various roll angles wang and guedes soares 2016 adopted the ale algorithm used in ls dyna and the modified longvinovich model mlm to solve the asymmetric problem of water entry however the slamming event was simulated as a 2d ship section impacting calm water at a constant velocity and was not simulated as a local impact with global ship motions as shown in issc 2018 it is also noted that the practical global response model that compute the ship motions including the effect of slamming loads are nowadays generally made of a potential time domain code often weakly non linear coupled to 2d potential model for slamming most of the time generalized wagner model the difficulty to incorporate 3d model into practical engineering sea keeping calculation is probably one of the reasons why most of the research on slamming loads is quite concentrated on 2d approaches in addition parametric rolling often occurs under some wave conditions when a vessel sails in heading or following seas intact stability code is code of the international maritime organization imo 2017 parametric rolling is a parametric resonance with instability behaviour which may result in significant amplification of the roll motion and lead to very dangerous situations in heading wave asymmetric impact loads may also occur however experimental and numerical studies of slamming loads with parametric rolling are currently rare only a few researchers have studied parametric rolling and green water together for example durand et al 2007 performed an experimental study of the searev wave energy converter when the amplitude of the wave increases nonlinear effects such as slamming and parametric roll appear greco and lugni 2012 performed experiments on parametric roll with water on the deck and bottom slamming however not all the experimental conditions and measured variables were discussed such as the bottom pressure and mid ship bending moment lin et al 2020 found and elaborated the test results of asymmetric impact loads of a container ship in full load condition when parametric rolling occurred this study focuses on the symmetric and asymmetric flare slamming of global ship responses under the heading wave condition first a six degree of freedom 6 dof nonlinear time domain model is adopted to predict the ship motions during parametric rolling then the slamming pressures are analysed using the modified stavovy chuang formula 1976 which is developed from the wagner model the accuracy of this model is verified using cfd simulations experimental results and classification society empirical formulations half and full service speeds are adopted to consider the influence of speed the occurrence of slamming occurs more violently under the service speed condition simultaneously parametric rolling phenomena are observed accompanied by slight flare slamming under a low speed condition the relationship between the slamming and ship motions especially the asymmetric roll motion is discussed here to reveal the mechanism of slamming compared with cfd technology this method is based on potential flow theory the computational time and resource of this method are less the classification rules only predict the peak pressure and could not calculate the time series of slamming pressure the empirical formulae do not consider the effect of roll motion they only simulate the general heading wave conditions these methods could not predict the slamming pressure undergoing parametric rolling condition 2 experimental setup the model experiments in heading waves are conducted in the seakeeping basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc which is approximately 69 m long 46 m wide and 4 m deep a self propulsion test is adopted the full scale main specifications of the 10 000 teu container ship are listed in table 1 the segmented model has a scale ratio of 1 64 as shown in fig 1 the ship model is made of eight segments these are connected by a u shape backbone with varying sections which could satisfy the stiffness distribution request the hull is made of fibre reinforced plastic frp and wood the hull girders are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer abspc this study considers the full load condition with 70 of the original hull girder stiffness the error of the manufactured model in this load condition is shown in table 2 the locations of the gyroscope and slamming measurement points are shown in detail in fig 1 the pitch and roll motions are measured by a gyroscope situated at the center of gravity the accelerations are measured at six positions five of these points a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 in fig 1 are located on the deck of no 0 no 5 no 10 no 15 and no 20 stations the other one is situated at the center of gravity furthermore the hull slamming forces are measured at fourteen points as shown in figs 1 2 and table 3 in contrast to the previous arrangement of slamming measurement points the bow flare pressure measurement points in this test are situated on both the starboard and port sides as shown in fig 2 b this is primarily to consider the asymmetric effect due to the roll motions the measuring technical parameters of the equipment for motions and loads are listed in table 4 different sampling frequencies are chosen during the measurement since the characteristics of each kind of signal are quite different from each other hammering tests are conducted for dry modal analysis the segmented ship model is hung by several springs in the air the natural frequencies could be distinguished by mode shapes in the pulse software part of the hammering test spectrum is shown in figs 3 4 measured dry natural frequencies of bending and torsion of the model ship are summarized in these figures the detailed explanations of the test cases are provided in tables 5 and 6 3 potential flow numerical method 3 1 6 dof weakly nonlinear unified model the simulation of the ship motions is based on skejic and faltinsen s 2008 unified seakeeping and maneuvering model the rapidly varying motions are simulated by a 5 dof sway heave roll pitch yaw weakly nonlinear time domain model based on yu s approach 2012 in his model the irf approach cummins 1962 is adopted for the seakeeping part the equation of motion can be written as follows 1 m i ν i t f i r a d t f i r e s t b v ν 4 f i f k t f i d i f t i 2 6 where m i and v i t stand for the ship s mass moment of inertia and velocity at the ith degree of freedom the radiation forces nonlinear restoring forces f k forces and diffraction forces are denoted by f i r a d t f i r e s t f i f k t and f i d i f t respectively b v ν 4 represents the nonlinear roll viscous damping with linear and quadric coefficients the determination of the roll damping is considered in the next section 2 b v ν 4 b 1 ν 4 b 2 ν 4 ν 4 simultaneously a 3 dof surge sway yaw maneuvering mathematical modelling group mmg model ogawa and kasai 1978 is used in the maneuvering part the equation can be written as follows 3 m m x u m m y v r x h x δ r u 1 t t u m m x u v m m y v y h y δ i z j z r n h n δ where m m x m y i z and j z represent the ship mass surge added mass sway added mass yaw moment of inertia and yaw added moment of inertia respectively x h y h n h t is the higher order hull hydrodynamic force x δ y δ n δ t r u and t u are defined as the rudder force resistance and propeller thrust respectively t is the propeller thrust deduction factor then two parts are combined to obtain the 6 dof unified model the detailed explanation is referred to yu et al 2012 2019 this model is utilised to predict the ship motion displacements and speeds for simulating slamming pressure 3 2 determination of roll damping the parametric rolling response umeda et al 2004 bulian 2005 neves et al 1999 matusiak 2003 spanos and papanikolaou 2007 zhou 2019 is a system instability caused by the time varying transversal metacentric height therefore roll damping plays an important role in the prediction of the parametric roll resonance the free decay test is regarded as the most popular method for measuring the roll damping coefficients however the initial roll angle is small in an actual reduced stiffness condition test hence there is no way to reflect the actual roll damping of a large roll motion for this purpose ikeda and himeno 1978 proposed a semi empirical formula to simulate the roll damping with different initial angles the accuracies of the two methods for simulating roll damping were demonstrated by hashimoto and umeda 2010 it was proved that the parametric rolling results of a numerical simulation that utilised the roll damping obtained by a free decay test were higher than the experimental results simultaneously the parametric rolling results of a numerical simulation that adopted the roll damping obtained by the empirical damping formula were lower than the experimental results as shown in fig 5 the natural roll periods and roll damping are obtained from roll decay tests the 6 dof weakly nonlinear unified model yu et al 2012 could simulate the roll decay test well however the roll damping of a ship with speed will be different from that in calm water the accurate acquisition of roll damping requires further research in the future 3 3 flare slamming calculation of modified stavovy chuang s model in this research three changes are made to the direct slamming calculation one change is to consider the effects of the roll and pitch motions concurrently few studies have focused on the global ship responses to asymmetric water impact the effect of the 6 dof ship motions is considered in the slamming calculation next this is the first study to combine the calculation of parametric rolling with the simulation of slamming the last difference from the previous study lin et al 2018 is the determination of the ship flare and wave encounter time and the confirmation of the pressure coefficients these are explained in the following the total pressure consists of two parts the impact pressure of water entry p i and impact pressure of collision p s the impact pressure of collision is also called the sliding pressure and is determined by the tangential velocity 3 p f b p i p s the impact pressure of water entry is determined by impact pressure factor k w which refers to the stavovy chuang formula and relative normal velocity v n 4 p i ρ k w v n 2 the impact pressure factor is related to waterline angle α bow line angle γ and cross line angle β which consider ship motions the angles are shown in fig 6 in this research these angles are influenced by the 3 dof motions roll θ x pitch θ y and heave which could be found using eqs 5 7 the effect of parametric roll is also reflected in these equations furthermore the relationship between the normal vector of the surface and these angles is shown in fig 7 5 α arctan tan α cos θ x cos θ y 6 γ arctan tan γ cos θ x θ y 7 β 90 arctan tan α tan 90 γ for an arbitrary sections dead rise angle ϕ is obtained using the waterline angle and cross line angle fig 8 shows the relationship 8 φ arccos tan 90 β tan 2 α tan 2 90 β 1 furthermore slope δ of the wave surface is determined by the original slope δ waterline angle and heading angle μ 9 δ δ cos 90 α 180 μ as shown in eq 10 the original slope δ is modified by the ship beam and draught 10 δ 1 1 ω 2 v g s δ 0 here δ 0 is the slope which is related to the wave number and wave amplitude v is the displacement of the vessel and s is the waterline area of the vessel impact angle ξ in the time domain is calculated using eq 11 11 ξ φ δ here it is assumed that the oscillatory motions are linear and harmonic let x y z be a right handed coordinate system fixed with respect to the mean position of the ship with z vertically upward through the center of gravity of the ship x in the direction of forward motion and the origin in the plane of the undisturbed free surface the values of v n in eq 15 and v t in eq 19 may be established in the following manner the determination of v n is based on the hypothesis that the impact pressure is generated only by the velocity component of the moving body normal to the impact surface and the velocity component of the wave normal to its surface the motions of the body and wave are dealt with separately consider first that the vehicle moves with horizontal velocity v h and vertical velocity v v at the impact area the asymmetric effect is also illustrated in eq 12 the vertical velocity of a vehicle is given by the following 12 v v z g x θ y cos θ y v sin θ y y θ x cos θ x the horizontal velocity of a vehicle is obtained as follows 13 v h x θ y sin θ y v cos θ y at the time of impact in the impact area the vehicle has a deadrise angle v nw which is determined by wave celerity v p and slope δ and is a normal velocity component of the wave surface at the impact point it can be found using eq 14 14 v n w v p sin δ relative normal velocity of impact body to wave surface is shown as eq 15 15 v n v h cos 90 α sin δ v n w v v cos δ then the pressure factors k w are obtained based on the impact angle through the stavovy chuang formula stavovy and chuang 1976 simultaneously the impact pressure of collision is shown in the following equation 16 p s 1 2 ρ k s v t 2 in this equation k s is the collision pressure factor which has a value of 2 5 in this simulation the k s value is equal to four based on the reference chen 2012 furthermore the value selected is more suitable for a container ship v t is the relative tangential velocity at the point of impact let v vw the velocity component of the impacting body perpendicular to the wave surface and v hw the velocity component of the impacting body parallel to the wave surface these are found using eqs 17 and 18 respectively 17 v h w ω ξ a cos ω e t k x cos μ k y sin μ 18 v v w ω ξ a sin ω e t k x cos μ k y sin μ the relative tangential velocity of the body impacting the wave surface is found using the following equation 19 v t v v sin δ v h cos 90 α cos δ v h w cos δ v v w sin δ cos 90 δ determining when the encounter will begin and predicting the future slamming are critical to determine the asymmetric effect the occurrence of slamming could be determined using the following explanation the amplitude of the calculated point is the distance between the calculated point and calm water surface and is shown in eq 20 t is instantaneous draught of the section of the calculated point meanwhile the amplitude of an instantaneous wave is found in eq 21 when a c a l x y z t a w a v e x y z t is satisfied slamming phenomena occur therefore the impact time could be confirmed 20 a c a l x y z t z t z g x sin θ y y

jeong 2019 presented the difference between the slamming pressure calculation formulas proposed by various classification societies including the international association of classification societies iacs american bureau of shipping abs and bureau veritas bv the ship length and speed are usually considered in the impact speeds of classification rules furthermore the impact speeds are constant and the roll motion is not considered therefore only the maximum slamming pressure values are directly compared with the rule formulas proposed by various classification societies 3 4 1 slamming empirical formula by iacs the common structural rule iacs 2014 used by the iacs can be used to define the bow flare slamming pressure equation eq 23 although the csr is a common rule developed for cargo ships and tankers it can also be applied to container ships seo and jeong 2019 23 p f b 1 025 f f b c f b v n 2 sin γ w l k n m 2 where f f b is the longitudinal bow flare impact pressure distribution

slamming empirical formula by abs the empirical classification formula of the abs 2016 defines the bow flare slamming pressure as follows 27 p f b 0 5 k c p c 3 d c s v n 2 n m 2 where k 1025 c p is the local pressure coefficient as described in 7 3 3 c 3 d is a three dimensional correction factor as described in 7 3 5 c s is a dynamic load factor as described in 7 3 7 v n is the relative vertical velocity between the water and hull in m s as calculated from the statistical analysis described in the abs classification rule a detailed explanation can be found in the abs rule 3 4 3 slamming empirical formula by bv the empirical classification formula of bv 2017 defines the bow flare slamming pressure as follows 28 p f b c s c z c l 0 22 0 15 tan β 0 4 v sin α 0 6 l 2 where c s is a coefficient that depends on the type of structure on which the bow impact pressure is considered to be acting c z is a coefficient that depends on the distance between summer load waterline t l c

350 m c l is a coefficient that depends on the ship s length and is equal to one when the ship s length is more than 80 m α and β are the waterline angle and body plan angle at the calculated point respectively for a detailed explanation please refer to the bv rule 4 cfd modeling 4 1 computational domain boundary conditions and grids in this section the commercial software star ccm 12 02 is applied to perform the simulations of strongly nonlinear slamming phenomena in heading wave in particular the impact forces undergoing parametric rolling condition are the first time predicted by the cfd method in this calculation the viscous flow is modeled by using the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans tezdogan et al 2015 ma et al 2018 the rans solver is based on a finite volume method the turbulence model utilizes the sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 the volume of fluid vof method is used to simulate the free surface between the water domain and the air domain the selection of the computational domain influences the accuracy of cfd results according to ma et al 2018 the computational domain is rectangular the domain is non dimensional with l pp the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the forward perpendicular on the free surface and the x axis is oriented from bow to stern the y axis is positive to starboard with the z axis pointing upward the computational domain extends from 2l pp x 5 5l pp 2l pp y 2l pp and 3l pp z 1 5l pp for all cases the selection of the incident wave region considers the development of the incident wave and the effect of the hull boundary on the wave reflection as shown in fig 9 for the inlet top and bottom the velocity inlet is specified and for the outlet the boundary is pressure outlet the two sides are symmetrical surfaces the no slip boundary condition is applied on the hull surface the vof waves model in the star ccm is built to generate the first order wave at the inlet boundary wave damping is set at the outlet boundary the ratios of wave length and ship length are 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 the scale ratio from model to ship is λ 64 computational domain mesh and time step in each case are used as per the standard practice ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 7 5 03 01 01 2017 the mesh sizes of free surface in x direction and z direction are 0 04 m and 0 01 m in order that the relationships of wave length wave height and mesh size satisfies 80 λ δ x 120 and 10 h δ z 20 an appropriate mesh count and time is chosen based on standard practice of keeping courant number near free surface within 1 0 therefore the time step is set to 0 0075s and the courant number cfl u δ t δ x is around 0 5 the grids near the free surface are shown in fig 10 the grids of the kelvin wave and overset region are shown in fig 11 furthermore to satisfy the parametric rolling motions the overset mesh method is used in fig 11 the selection of overset region not only affects the number of grids in the computational domain but also affects the computation of the overlapping boundary interpolation the overset grids and the background grids complete the information transmission through the numerical interpolation of the overlap domain therefore the grids of overset and background regions maintain the same scale near the overlap region 5 results and discussion 5 1 experimental validations in this section both half of service speed and service speed are adopted to validate the accuracy of the modified stavovy chuang model parametric rolling occurred in case 2 with a wave height of 100 mm ship model size as listed in table 5 the ratio of the natural roll period and wave encounter period is approximately 2 00 for case 2 figs 12 15 both the potential flow method and cfd method could accurately predict steady amplitudes for the roll motion and pitch motion in the simulation using the potential flow method the initial roll angle has no effect on the final amplitude of the parametric rolling the roll damping in the aforementioned method could affect the processing speed of the parametric rolling and time required for the stabilisation of the roll amplitude although the cfd simulation could accurately reflect the steady roll amplitude the growth rate of the roll motion in the initial range would differ from the experimental results furthermore slight slamming would induce a nonlinear pitch motion and the test results for the pitch motion shows an m shaped time series the effect of flare slamming leads to an m shaped time history for the pitch motion however the pitch motions simulated using two numerical methods simply show harmonic shapes this is mainly because the relationship between the ship motions and slamming pressures is one way in the potential flow method the coupled effect between the motions and slamming is not included in the numerical model although parametric rolling can develop rapidly once it occurs a ship tends to encounter quite a few cycles of wave excitation before reaching significant parametric rolling because the research on flare slamming during steady roll motion is more important the time series of the presented figures is reduced from 20 s to 10 s from figs 13 to 14 as shown in fig 16 the flare slamming pressures obtained from the numerical and model test results are compared this provides the slamming mechanism according to the potential flow result the flare slamming phenomenon also occurs under a bow trimmed condition and the duration is dominated by the roll motion and encounter wave the roll motion affects the asymmetric effect of the magnitudes of the pressures on both the port and starboard sides which can be demonstrated through both numerical simulations and experimental results as shown in fig 16 the predicted magnitude of the flare slamming agrees with the tests results however the simulated slamming duration is shorter than that of the test results this is mainly because the duration of the static pressure is not considered in this study in the potential flow method the instantaneous draught of the section of the calculated point and the instantaneous wave amplitude are utilised to predict the duration of impact pressures as shown in the work of seo and jeong 2019 the total duration of the pressure consisted of the duration due to the impact pressure and duration due to the static pressure the duration of the pressure due to the impact pressure was expressed as the sum of the rise time and drop time therefore the predicted duration of the potential flow method is shorter than that of the test results in addition the slamming durations at points on the port and starboard sides are different because of differences in the distance and encounter time originating from the roll motion the decreased speed is also a factor in the accuracy at the same time the cfd results show the strongly nonlinearity of the flare slamming an increasing tendency for the impact forces is almost unanimous there is satisfactory agreement between numerical results and test results of the steady magnitudes and duration of the slamming pressures however the limitation of the cfd methods is its inability to differentiate the pressures and hydrodynamic forces as shown in fig 16 when the ship speed is equal to the service speed the slamming pressures on the starboard and port sides are symmetrical in case 5 hence only the slamming pressures on the starboard side are presented as shown in figs 17 29 both the potential flow method and cfd method could predict the ship motion and flare slamming tendency as the height of the measurement point increases the duration of slamming decreases as shown in the potential flow cfd and test results the slamming duration at p6 is approximately twice that at p7 the p6 slamming durations of both the potential flow method and cfd technology are larger than that of the test results the predicted duration of slamming is shorter than that seen in the test the reason is explained in the previous part at the same time the p7 slamming magnitudes with both the potential flow method and cfd technology is similar to test result the accuracy of the modified stavovy chuang model is validated through the comparisons of case 2 and case 5 the predicted slamming magnitude agrees with the test results the predicted slamming duration is shorter than that of the test results in summary the potential flow method could accurately simulate the magnitudes of parametric rolling motions and pulse pressures at the same time the potential flow method could predict the ship motions and flare slamming pressures in heading waves however the accuracy of the duration of the slamming pressures needs to be further improved the calculation speed of this technique is faster than that of the cfd method the computation time of the potential flow method for one case is less than 10 min whereas the computation time of the cfd method is more than one week however the strong nonlinearity could not be predicted because of the limitation of the potential flow method the relationship between ship motions and slamming pressures is one way thus the predicted pitch motion is a harmonic motion not an m shaped motion therefore the two way interactions of the ship motions and slamming pressures should be considered in the future 5 2 extended numerical analysis this section discusses the influence of the wavelength on flare slamming at the same time the influence of the speed on flare slamming is considered in cases 1 3 4 and 6 5 2 1 half of service speed parametric rolling occurs in case 1 and case 3 however the parametric rolling does not reach a stable value when the self navigation of the ship model is finished because of the small scale of the seakeeping basin therefore the test results do not show stable roll amplitudes in case 1 and case 3 the wavelength to ship length ratios are 0 8 and 1 0 because the roll amplitudes of case 1 and case 3 are small figs 20 and 23 a low asymmetric effect of slamming is seen a comparison of figs 15 21 and 24 shows that the steady pitch amplitude increases with the wavelength the influence of slamming on the ship motion is not considered therefore the predicted pitch motion is a harmonic motion a comparison of figs 16 22 and 25 shows that the slamming magnitude decreases as the wavelength increases at the same time the impact duration increases with the wavelength 5 2 2 service speed parametric rolling does not occur in case 4 and case 6 the steady pitch amplitude increases with the wavelength a comparison of figs 18 19 27 28 30 and 31 shows that the regulation of the slamming magnitude is not related to the wavelength at the same time a comparison of figs 18 27 and 30 shows that the impact duration increases with the wavelength the influence of the speed on the slamming pressure could be obtained through a comparison of case 2 and case 5 case 1 and case 4 case 3 and case 6 the magnitude of the slamming pressures increases with the speed at the same time the duration of the impact forces decreases as the speed increases through fig 32 the peak pressure rise time and drop time are summarized in table 7 the total duration time of the impact pressure is expressed as the sum of the rise time and drop time the detailed definition is referred to the work of seo and jeong 2019 as shown in fig 32 and table 7 the rise time of potential flow results is similar to that of test results in both parametric rolling condition and service speed condition at the same time the rise time of cfd results is 3 4 times of experimental results as the occurrence of parametric rolling is the most violent when the ratio of wave length and ship length is equal to 0 9 as a result the rise time of slamming pressure is minimum for the drop time and peak pressure in parametric rolling condition three results are similar the drop time and peak pressure are maximum when the ratio of wave length and ship length is equal to 0 9 therefore the flare slamming occurs more violently as the ratio of wave encounter frequency and roll natural frequency is closer to 2 0 in parametric rolling condition in service speed condition peak pressure is maximum when the ratio of wave length and ship length is equal to 0 9 the rise time decreases as the wavelength increases at the same time the drop time increases as the wavelength increases therefore the increasing wavelength aggravates the severity of a slamming event in service speed condition furthermore only the peak pressures which are calculated by classification rules are calculated the rise time and drop time could not been obtained to be consistent the slamming pressures of both parametric rolling condition and service speed condition are summarized to reveal the relationship between slamming and wavelength in tables 8 and 9 the relationship of slamming pressure and wavelength is shown as below in parametric rolling condition for the service speed condition the tendency of the pressure to decrease in the z direction the pressure of test results is similar to the abs and iacs results for the abs results the slamming pressure increases as the wavelength increases for the iacs results the slamming pressure is maximum when the ratio of wavelength and ship length is equal to 0 9 6 conclusion this paper presents an approximate method of symmetric and asymmetric flare slamming analysis based on global ship response in the time domain for the sake of practicability the present numerical results are further validated using experiment results and cfd results for a 10 000 teu container ship the following conclusions could be obtained based on the numerical results 1 the presented potential flow method could accurately simulate the magnitudes of parametric rolling motions and pulse pressures at the same time the potential flow method could predict the ship motions peak pressures rise time and drop time in heading waves 2 at half of service speed parametric rolling and flare slamming phenomena are firstly discussed the asymmetric effect of the slamming duration is affected by the roll motion the severity of flare slamming is related to the ratio of wave encounter frequency and roll natural frequency the flare slamming occurs more violently as the ratio of wave encounter frequency and roll natural frequency is closer to 2 0 3 at the service speed the slamming magnitude is not related to the wavelength the impact duration increases with the wavelength the rise time decreases as the wavelength increases at the same time the drop time increases as the wavelength increases therefore the increasing wavelength aggravates the severity of a slamming event in service speed condition the symmetric slamming results using the abs and iacs classification methods are similar to the test results 4 as the speed froude number increases the slamming duration decreases and the magnitude of the pressures increases in the future the accuracy of the duration of the slamming pressures needs to be further improved the strong nonlinearity could not be predicted because of the limitation of the potential flow method therefore the two way interactions of the ship motions and slamming pressures should be considered credit

ship motions and slamming pressures in cases 2 and 5 are shown within tables 16 17 within table 15 cf obtained with fine mesh and fine time step are presented as can be seen from table 16 17 the combination of all the errors except for the pitch amplitude in case 2 in d and s is smaller than u v and validation is achieved at the u v level the iterative uncertainty listed in table 16 shows relatively large values for the mean value of the motions and slamming about 7 2 d for pitch amplitude 5 2 d for roll amplitude and 0 9 d for maximum slamming pressure the iterative uncertainty listed in table 17 shows relatively large values for the mean value of the motions and slamming about 4 3 d for pitch amplitude 5 2 d for roll amplitude and 4 7 d 5 5 d for maximum slamming pressure the main reason is that the occurrence of parametric rolling causes the low frequency component of pitch motion in case 2 therefore the pitch motion of test results in case 2 presents m shape however the

21239,this study numerically and experimentally investigates the ship motions and slamming pressures of a 10 000 teu container ship in regular heading waves a modified stavovy chuang model that considers the influence of the wave ship encounter time and asymmetric rolling motions is proposed as the potential flow method to solve symmetric and asymmetric flare slamming calculations instantaneous ship motions from a nonlinear six degree of freedom unified model are adopted to simulate the pressure the ship flare wave encounter time determines the duration of the slamming the commercial software star ccm is utilised for computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of the slamming and motions the modified stavovy chuang model cfd technology and segmented model tests are used for the first time to predict asymmetric slamming accompanied by parametric rolling empirical formulas for various classification society rules are adopted for the cross validation of the symmetric impact forces in conclusion the occurrence of slamming is dominated by the normal impact velocity and the relative positions of the ship and waves the duration of the slamming especially under parametric rolling conditions mainly depends on the rolling period and encountering wave under parametric rolling conditions the magnitude of the slamming pressure decreases and the impact duration increases as the wavelength increases in simulations of symmetric slamming only the duration increases as the wavelength increases and the american bureau of shipping and international association of classification societies results are similar to the test results keywords flare slamming loads paramatric rolling segmented model test cfd classifications rules 1 introduction flare slamming should be attached importance due to increasing large bow flare region as container ship size and capacity increase it is well known that slamming is a nonlinear response of ship wave interaction problem and flare slamming occurs severely in heading wave the relevant investigations should be attached great importance at present the numerical researches of ship motions and slamming loads are divided into two categories potential flow method and cfd computational fluid dynamics method regarding the potential flow method the practical global response model is generally made of a potential time domain code often weakly nonlinear coupled to 2d potential model for slamming and there are many classic theories of slamming von kármán 1929 wagner 1932 zhao and faltinsen 1993 furthermore many researchers have discussed and made recommendations for empirical formula methods they were listed in the international ship structure conference issc 2003 report for instance stavovy and chuang 1976 developed the flare slamming analytical determination method dhavalikar et al 2018 proposed an empirical method as a function of the deadrise angle based on comparisons seo and jeong 2019 compared the slamming pressure from a numerical simulation with the rule formulas proposed by various classification societies and found that the pressures obtained from the formulas of the american bureau of shipping abs and csr tended to be similar to the cfd results these results are expected to be used as a database for revising the slamming load formulas in the future until now the difficulty to incorporate 3d model into practical engineering sea keeping calculation is probably one of the reasons why most of the research on slamming loads is quite concentrated on 2d strip approximation furthermore the potential flow method could not fully reflect the strongly nonlinear problem such as the breaking waves induced by slamming many researchers developed strongly nonlinear model hashimoto and touze 2014 proposed a coupled moving particle semi implicit and finite element method mps fem model for strongly nonlinear fluid structure interaction problems rajendran et al 2016 analysed the vertical responses of a bulk carrier containership and passenger ship using linear to fully nonlinear numerical methods based on strip theory with the development of commercial cfd software slamming analyses based on cfd methods have started to appear chen et al 2014 investigated the local loads for an oil tanker under extreme motion conditions defined in the csr h using the cfd software star ccm cfd simulations including those for a 2d ship section drop and container ship bow flare slamming were reported by kim 2015 wang and guedes soares 2013 discussed slam induced loads on bow flared sections with various roll angles wang and guedes soares 2016 adopted the ale algorithm used in ls dyna and the modified longvinovich model mlm to solve the asymmetric problem of water entry however the slamming event was simulated as a 2d ship section impacting calm water at a constant velocity and was not simulated as a local impact with global ship motions as shown in issc 2018 it is also noted that the practical global response model that compute the ship motions including the effect of slamming loads are nowadays generally made of a potential time domain code often weakly non linear coupled to 2d potential model for slamming most of the time generalized wagner model the difficulty to incorporate 3d model into practical engineering sea keeping calculation is probably one of the reasons why most of the research on slamming loads is quite concentrated on 2d approaches in addition parametric rolling often occurs under some wave conditions when a vessel sails in heading or following seas intact stability code is code of the international maritime organization imo 2017 parametric rolling is a parametric resonance with instability behaviour which may result in significant amplification of the roll motion and lead to very dangerous situations in heading wave asymmetric impact loads may also occur however experimental and numerical studies of slamming loads with parametric rolling are currently rare only a few researchers have studied parametric rolling and green water together for example durand et al 2007 performed an experimental study of the searev wave energy converter when the amplitude of the wave increases nonlinear effects such as slamming and parametric roll appear greco and lugni 2012 performed experiments on parametric roll with water on the deck and bottom slamming however not all the experimental conditions and measured variables were discussed such as the bottom pressure and mid ship bending moment lin et al 2020 found and elaborated the test results of asymmetric impact loads of a container ship in full load condition when parametric rolling occurred this study focuses on the symmetric and asymmetric flare slamming of global ship responses under the heading wave condition first a six degree of freedom 6 dof nonlinear time domain model is adopted to predict the ship motions during parametric rolling then the slamming pressures are analysed using the modified stavovy chuang formula 1976 which is developed from the wagner model the accuracy of this model is verified using cfd simulations experimental results and classification society empirical formulations half and full service speeds are adopted to consider the influence of speed the occurrence of slamming occurs more violently under the service speed condition simultaneously parametric rolling phenomena are observed accompanied by slight flare slamming under a low speed condition the relationship between the slamming and ship motions especially the asymmetric roll motion is discussed here to reveal the mechanism of slamming compared with cfd technology this method is based on potential flow theory the computational time and resource of this method are less the classification rules only predict the peak pressure and could not calculate the time series of slamming pressure the empirical formulae do not consider the effect of roll motion they only simulate the general heading wave conditions these methods could not predict the slamming pressure undergoing parametric rolling condition 2 experimental setup the model experiments in heading waves are conducted in the seakeeping basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc which is approximately 69 m long 46 m wide and 4 m deep a self propulsion test is adopted the full scale main specifications of the 10 000 teu container ship are listed in table 1 the segmented model has a scale ratio of 1 64 as shown in fig 1 the ship model is made of eight segments these are connected by a u shape backbone with varying sections which could satisfy the stiffness distribution request the hull is made of fibre reinforced plastic frp and wood the hull girders are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer abspc this study considers the full load condition with 70 of the original hull girder stiffness the error of the manufactured model in this load condition is shown in table 2 the locations of the gyroscope and slamming measurement points are shown in detail in fig 1 the pitch and roll motions are measured by a gyroscope situated at the center of gravity the accelerations are measured at six positions five of these points a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 in fig 1 are located on the deck of no 0 no 5 no 10 no 15 and no 20 stations the other one is situated at the center of gravity furthermore the hull slamming forces are measured at fourteen points as shown in figs 1 2 and table 3 in contrast to the previous arrangement of slamming measurement points the bow flare pressure measurement points in this test are situated on both the starboard and port sides as shown in fig 2 b this is primarily to consider the asymmetric effect due to the roll motions the measuring technical parameters of the equipment for motions and loads are listed in table 4 different sampling frequencies are chosen during the measurement since the characteristics of each kind of signal are quite different from each other hammering tests are conducted for dry modal analysis the segmented ship model is hung by several springs in the air the natural frequencies could be distinguished by mode shapes in the pulse software part of the hammering test spectrum is shown in figs 3 4 measured dry natural frequencies of bending and torsion of the model ship are summarized in these figures the detailed explanations of the test cases are provided in tables 5 and 6 3 potential flow numerical method 3 1 6 dof weakly nonlinear unified model the simulation of the ship motions is based on skejic and faltinsen s 2008 unified seakeeping and maneuvering model the rapidly varying motions are simulated by a 5 dof sway heave roll pitch yaw weakly nonlinear time domain model based on yu s approach 2012 in his model the irf approach cummins 1962 is adopted for the seakeeping part the equation of motion can be written as follows 1 m i ν i t f i r a d t f i r e s t b v ν 4 f i f k t f i d i f t i 2 6 where m i and v i t stand for the ship s mass moment of inertia and velocity at the ith degree of freedom the radiation forces nonlinear restoring forces f k forces and diffraction forces are denoted by f i r a d t f i r e s t f i f k t and f i d i f t respectively b v ν 4 represents the nonlinear roll viscous damping with linear and quadric coefficients the determination of the roll damping is considered in the next section 2 b v ν 4 b 1 ν 4 b 2 ν 4 ν 4 simultaneously a 3 dof surge sway yaw maneuvering mathematical modelling group mmg model ogawa and kasai 1978 is used in the maneuvering part the equation can be written as follows 3 m m x u m m y v r x h x δ r u 1 t t u m m x u v m m y v y h y δ i z j z r n h n δ where m m x m y i z and j z represent the ship mass surge added mass sway added mass yaw moment of inertia and yaw added moment of inertia respectively x h y h n h t is the higher order hull hydrodynamic force x δ y δ n δ t r u and t u are defined as the rudder force resistance and propeller thrust respectively t is the propeller thrust deduction factor then two parts are combined to obtain the 6 dof unified model the detailed explanation is referred to yu et al 2012 2019 this model is utilised to predict the ship motion displacements and speeds for simulating slamming pressure 3 2 determination of roll damping the parametric rolling response umeda et al 2004 bulian 2005 neves et al 1999 matusiak 2003 spanos and papanikolaou 2007 zhou 2019 is a system instability caused by the time varying transversal metacentric height therefore roll damping plays an important role in the prediction of the parametric roll resonance the free decay test is regarded as the most popular method for measuring the roll damping coefficients however the initial roll angle is small in an actual reduced stiffness condition test hence there is no way to reflect the actual roll damping of a large roll motion for this purpose ikeda and himeno 1978 proposed a semi empirical formula to simulate the roll damping with different initial angles the accuracies of the two methods for simulating roll damping were demonstrated by hashimoto and umeda 2010 it was proved that the parametric rolling results of a numerical simulation that utilised the roll damping obtained by a free decay test were higher than the experimental results simultaneously the parametric rolling results of a numerical simulation that adopted the roll damping obtained by the empirical damping formula were lower than the experimental results as shown in fig 5 the natural roll periods and roll damping are obtained from roll decay tests the 6 dof weakly nonlinear unified model yu et al 2012 could simulate the roll decay test well however the roll damping of a ship with speed will be different from that in calm water the accurate acquisition of roll damping requires further research in the future 3 3 flare slamming calculation of modified stavovy chuang s model in this research three changes are made to the direct slamming calculation one change is to consider the effects of the roll and pitch motions concurrently few studies have focused on the global ship responses to asymmetric water impact the effect of the 6 dof ship motions is considered in the slamming calculation next this is the first study to combine the calculation of parametric rolling with the simulation of slamming the last difference from the previous study lin et al 2018 is the determination of the ship flare and wave encounter time and the confirmation of the pressure coefficients these are explained in the following the total pressure consists of two parts the impact pressure of water entry p i and impact pressure of collision p s the impact pressure of collision is also called the sliding pressure and is determined by the tangential velocity 3 p f b p i p s the impact pressure of water entry is determined by impact pressure factor k w which refers to the stavovy chuang formula and relative normal velocity v n 4 p i ρ k w v n 2 the impact pressure factor is related to waterline angle α bow line angle γ and cross line angle β which consider ship motions the angles are shown in fig 6 in this research these angles are influenced by the 3 dof motions roll θ x pitch θ y and heave which could be found using eqs 5 7 the effect of parametric roll is also reflected in these equations furthermore the relationship between the normal vector of the surface and these angles is shown in fig 7 5 α arctan tan α cos θ x cos θ y 6 γ arctan tan γ cos θ x θ y 7 β 90 arctan tan α tan 90 γ for an arbitrary sections dead rise angle ϕ is obtained using the waterline angle and cross line angle fig 8 shows the relationship 8 φ arccos tan 90 β tan 2 α tan 2 90 β 1 furthermore slope δ of the wave surface is determined by the original slope δ waterline angle and heading angle μ 9 δ δ cos 90 α 180 μ as shown in eq 10 the original slope δ is modified by the ship beam and draught 10 δ 1 1 ω 2 v g s δ 0 here δ 0 is the slope which is related to the wave number and wave amplitude v is the displacement of the vessel and s is the waterline area of the vessel impact angle ξ in the time domain is calculated using eq 11 11 ξ φ δ here it is assumed that the oscillatory motions are linear and harmonic let x y z be a right handed coordinate system fixed with respect to the mean position of the ship with z vertically upward through the center of gravity of the ship x in the direction of forward motion and the origin in the plane of the undisturbed free surface the values of v n in eq 15 and v t in eq 19 may be established in the following manner the determination of v n is based on the hypothesis that the impact pressure is generated only by the velocity component of the moving body normal to the impact surface and the velocity component of the wave normal to its surface the motions of the body and wave are dealt with separately consider first that the vehicle moves with horizontal velocity v h and vertical velocity v v at the impact area the asymmetric effect is also illustrated in eq 12 the vertical velocity of a vehicle is given by the following 12 v v z g x θ y cos θ y v sin θ y y θ x cos θ x the horizontal velocity of a vehicle is obtained as follows 13 v h x θ y sin θ y v cos θ y at the time of impact in the impact area the vehicle has a deadrise angle v nw which is determined by wave celerity v p and slope δ and is a normal velocity component of the wave surface at the impact point it can be found using eq 14 14 v n w v p sin δ relative normal velocity of impact body to wave surface is shown as eq 15 15 v n v h cos 90 α sin δ v n w v v cos δ then the pressure factors k w are obtained based on the impact angle through the stavovy chuang formula stavovy and chuang 1976 simultaneously the impact pressure of collision is shown in the following equation 16 p s 1 2 ρ k s v t 2 in this equation k s is the collision pressure factor which has a value of 2 5 in this simulation the k s value is equal to four based on the reference chen 2012 furthermore the value selected is more suitable for a container ship v t is the relative tangential velocity at the point of impact let v vw the velocity component of the impacting body perpendicular to the wave surface and v hw the velocity component of the impacting body parallel to the wave surface these are found using eqs 17 and 18 respectively 17 v h w ω ξ a cos ω e t k x cos μ k y sin μ 18 v v w ω ξ a sin ω e t k x cos μ k y sin μ the relative tangential velocity of the body impacting the wave surface is found using the following equation 19 v t v v sin δ v h cos 90 α cos δ v h w cos δ v v w sin δ cos 90 δ determining when the encounter will begin and predicting the future slamming are critical to determine the asymmetric effect the occurrence of slamming could be determined using the following explanation the amplitude of the calculated point is the distance between the calculated point and calm water surface and is shown in eq 20 t is instantaneous draught of the section of the calculated point meanwhile the amplitude of an instantaneous wave is found in eq 21 when a c a l x y z t a w a v e x y z t is satisfied slamming phenomena occur therefore the impact time could be confirmed 20 a c a l x y z t z t z g x sin θ y y

jeong 2019 presented the difference between the slamming pressure calculation formulas proposed by various classification societies including the international association of classification societies iacs american bureau of shipping abs and bureau veritas bv the ship length and speed are usually considered in the impact speeds of classification rules furthermore the impact speeds are constant and the roll motion is not considered therefore only the maximum slamming pressure values are directly compared with the rule formulas proposed by various classification societies 3 4 1 slamming empirical formula by iacs the common structural rule iacs 2014 used by the iacs can be used to define the bow flare slamming pressure equation eq 23 although the csr is a common rule developed for cargo ships and tankers it can also be applied to container ships seo and jeong 2019 23 p f b 1 025 f f b c f b v n 2 sin γ w l k n m 2 where f f b is the longitudinal bow flare impact pressure distribution

slamming empirical formula by abs the empirical classification formula of the abs 2016 defines the bow flare slamming pressure as follows 27 p f b 0 5 k c p c 3 d c s v n 2 n m 2 where k 1025 c p is the local pressure coefficient as described in 7 3 3 c 3 d is a three dimensional correction factor as described in 7 3 5 c s is a dynamic load factor as described in 7 3 7 v n is the relative vertical velocity between the water and hull in m s as calculated from the statistical analysis described in the abs classification rule a detailed explanation can be found in the abs rule 3 4 3 slamming empirical formula by bv the empirical classification formula of bv 2017 defines the bow flare slamming pressure as follows 28 p f b c s c z c l 0 22 0 15 tan β 0 4 v sin α 0 6 l 2 where c s is a coefficient that depends on the type of structure on which the bow impact pressure is considered to be acting c z is a coefficient that depends on the distance between summer load waterline t l c

350 m c l is a coefficient that depends on the ship s length and is equal to one when the ship s length is more than 80 m α and β are the waterline angle and body plan angle at the calculated point respectively for a detailed explanation please refer to the bv rule 4 cfd modeling 4 1 computational domain boundary conditions and grids in this section the commercial software star ccm 12 02 is applied to perform the simulations of strongly nonlinear slamming phenomena in heading wave in particular the impact forces undergoing parametric rolling condition are the first time predicted by the cfd method in this calculation the viscous flow is modeled by using the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans tezdogan et al 2015 ma et al 2018 the rans solver is based on a finite volume method the turbulence model utilizes the sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 the volume of fluid vof method is used to simulate the free surface between the water domain and the air domain the selection of the computational domain influences the accuracy of cfd results according to ma et al 2018 the computational domain is rectangular the domain is non dimensional with l pp the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the forward perpendicular on the free surface and the x axis is oriented from bow to stern the y axis is positive to starboard with the z axis pointing upward the computational domain extends from 2l pp x 5 5l pp 2l pp y 2l pp and 3l pp z 1 5l pp for all cases the selection of the incident wave region considers the development of the incident wave and the effect of the hull boundary on the wave reflection as shown in fig 9 for the inlet top and bottom the velocity inlet is specified and for the outlet the boundary is pressure outlet the two sides are symmetrical surfaces the no slip boundary condition is applied on the hull surface the vof waves model in the star ccm is built to generate the first order wave at the inlet boundary wave damping is set at the outlet boundary the ratios of wave length and ship length are 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 the scale ratio from model to ship is λ 64 computational domain mesh and time step in each case are used as per the standard practice ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 7 5 03 01 01 2017 the mesh sizes of free surface in x direction and z direction are 0 04 m and 0 01 m in order that the relationships of wave length wave height and mesh size satisfies 80 λ δ x 120 and 10 h δ z 20 an appropriate mesh count and time is chosen based on standard practice of keeping courant number near free surface within 1 0 therefore the time step is set to 0 0075s and the courant number cfl u δ t δ x is around 0 5 the grids near the free surface are shown in fig 10 the grids of the kelvin wave and overset region are shown in fig 11 furthermore to satisfy the parametric rolling motions the overset mesh method is used in fig 11 the selection of overset region not only affects the number of grids in the computational domain but also affects the computation of the overlapping boundary interpolation the overset grids and the background grids complete the information transmission through the numerical interpolation of the overlap domain therefore the grids of overset and background regions maintain the same scale near the overlap region 5 results and discussion 5 1 experimental validations in this section both half of service speed and service speed are adopted to validate the accuracy of the modified stavovy chuang model parametric rolling occurred in case 2 with a wave height of 100 mm ship model size as listed in table 5 the ratio of the natural roll period and wave encounter period is approximately 2 00 for case 2 figs 12 15 both the potential flow method and cfd method could accurately predict steady amplitudes for the roll motion and pitch motion in the simulation using the potential flow method the initial roll angle has no effect on the final amplitude of the parametric rolling the roll damping in the aforementioned method could affect the processing speed of the parametric rolling and time required for the stabilisation of the roll amplitude although the cfd simulation could accurately reflect the steady roll amplitude the growth rate of the roll motion in the initial range would differ from the experimental results furthermore slight slamming would induce a nonlinear pitch motion and the test results for the pitch motion shows an m shaped time series the effect of flare slamming leads to an m shaped time history for the pitch motion however the pitch motions simulated using two numerical methods simply show harmonic shapes this is mainly because the relationship between the ship motions and slamming pressures is one way in the potential flow method the coupled effect between the motions and slamming is not included in the numerical model although parametric rolling can develop rapidly once it occurs a ship tends to encounter quite a few cycles of wave excitation before reaching significant parametric rolling because the research on flare slamming during steady roll motion is more important the time series of the presented figures is reduced from 20 s to 10 s from figs 13 to 14 as shown in fig 16 the flare slamming pressures obtained from the numerical and model test results are compared this provides the slamming mechanism according to the potential flow result the flare slamming phenomenon also occurs under a bow trimmed condition and the duration is dominated by the roll motion and encounter wave the roll motion affects the asymmetric effect of the magnitudes of the pressures on both the port and starboard sides which can be demonstrated through both numerical simulations and experimental results as shown in fig 16 the predicted magnitude of the flare slamming agrees with the tests results however the simulated slamming duration is shorter than that of the test results this is mainly because the duration of the static pressure is not considered in this study in the potential flow method the instantaneous draught of the section of the calculated point and the instantaneous wave amplitude are utilised to predict the duration of impact pressures as shown in the work of seo and jeong 2019 the total duration of the pressure consisted of the duration due to the impact pressure and duration due to the static pressure the duration of the pressure due to the impact pressure was expressed as the sum of the rise time and drop time therefore the predicted duration of the potential flow method is shorter than that of the test results in addition the slamming durations at points on the port and starboard sides are different because of differences in the distance and encounter time originating from the roll motion the decreased speed is also a factor in the accuracy at the same time the cfd results show the strongly nonlinearity of the flare slamming an increasing tendency for the impact forces is almost unanimous there is satisfactory agreement between numerical results and test results of the steady magnitudes and duration of the slamming pressures however the limitation of the cfd methods is its inability to differentiate the pressures and hydrodynamic forces as shown in fig 16 when the ship speed is equal to the service speed the slamming pressures on the starboard and port sides are symmetrical in case 5 hence only the slamming pressures on the starboard side are presented as shown in figs 17 29 both the potential flow method and cfd method could predict the ship motion and flare slamming tendency as the height of the measurement point increases the duration of slamming decreases as shown in the potential flow cfd and test results the slamming duration at p6 is approximately twice that at p7 the p6 slamming durations of both the potential flow method and cfd technology are larger than that of the test results the predicted duration of slamming is shorter than that seen in the test the reason is explained in the previous part at the same time the p7 slamming magnitudes with both the potential flow method and cfd technology is similar to test result the accuracy of the modified stavovy chuang model is validated through the comparisons of case 2 and case 5 the predicted slamming magnitude agrees with the test results the predicted slamming duration is shorter than that of the test results in summary the potential flow method could accurately simulate the magnitudes of parametric rolling motions and pulse pressures at the same time the potential flow method could predict the ship motions and flare slamming pressures in heading waves however the accuracy of the duration of the slamming pressures needs to be further improved the calculation speed of this technique is faster than that of the cfd method the computation time of the potential flow method for one case is less than 10 min whereas the computation time of the cfd method is more than one week however the strong nonlinearity could not be predicted because of the limitation of the potential flow method the relationship between ship motions and slamming pressures is one way thus the predicted pitch motion is a harmonic motion not an m shaped motion therefore the two way interactions of the ship motions and slamming pressures should be considered in the future 5 2 extended numerical analysis this section discusses the influence of the wavelength on flare slamming at the same time the influence of the speed on flare slamming is considered in cases 1 3 4 and 6 5 2 1 half of service speed parametric rolling occurs in case 1 and case 3 however the parametric rolling does not reach a stable value when the self navigation of the ship model is finished because of the small scale of the seakeeping basin therefore the test results do not show stable roll amplitudes in case 1 and case 3 the wavelength to ship length ratios are 0 8 and 1 0 because the roll amplitudes of case 1 and case 3 are small figs 20 and 23 a low asymmetric effect of slamming is seen a comparison of figs 15 21 and 24 shows that the steady pitch amplitude increases with the wavelength the influence of slamming on the ship motion is not considered therefore the predicted pitch motion is a harmonic motion a comparison of figs 16 22 and 25 shows that the slamming magnitude decreases as the wavelength increases at the same time the impact duration increases with the wavelength 5 2 2 service speed parametric rolling does not occur in case 4 and case 6 the steady pitch amplitude increases with the wavelength a comparison of figs 18 19 27 28 30 and 31 shows that the regulation of the slamming magnitude is not related to the wavelength at the same time a comparison of figs 18 27 and 30 shows that the impact duration increases with the wavelength the influence of the speed on the slamming pressure could be obtained through a comparison of case 2 and case 5 case 1 and case 4 case 3 and case 6 the magnitude of the slamming pressures increases with the speed at the same time the duration of the impact forces decreases as the speed increases through fig 32 the peak pressure rise time and drop time are summarized in table 7 the total duration time of the impact pressure is expressed as the sum of the rise time and drop time the detailed definition is referred to the work of seo and jeong 2019 as shown in fig 32 and table 7 the rise time of potential flow results is similar to that of test results in both parametric rolling condition and service speed condition at the same time the rise time of cfd results is 3 4 times of experimental results as the occurrence of parametric rolling is the most violent when the ratio of wave length and ship length is equal to 0 9 as a result the rise time of slamming pressure is minimum for the drop time and peak pressure in parametric rolling condition three results are similar the drop time and peak pressure are maximum when the ratio of wave length and ship length is equal to 0 9 therefore the flare slamming occurs more violently as the ratio of wave encounter frequency and roll natural frequency is closer to 2 0 in parametric rolling condition in service speed condition peak pressure is maximum when the ratio of wave length and ship length is equal to 0 9 the rise time decreases as the wavelength increases at the same time the drop time increases as the wavelength increases therefore the increasing wavelength aggravates the severity of a slamming event in service speed condition furthermore only the peak pressures which are calculated by classification rules are calculated the rise time and drop time could not been obtained to be consistent the slamming pressures of both parametric rolling condition and service speed condition are summarized to reveal the relationship between slamming and wavelength in tables 8 and 9 the relationship of slamming pressure and wavelength is shown as below in parametric rolling condition for the service speed condition the tendency of the pressure to decrease in the z direction the pressure of test results is similar to the abs and iacs results for the abs results the slamming pressure increases as the wavelength increases for the iacs results the slamming pressure is maximum when the ratio of wavelength and ship length is equal to 0 9 6 conclusion this paper presents an approximate method of symmetric and asymmetric flare slamming analysis based on global ship response in the time domain for the sake of practicability the present numerical results are further validated using experiment results and cfd results for a 10 000 teu container ship the following conclusions could be obtained based on the numerical results 1 the presented potential flow method could accurately simulate the magnitudes of parametric rolling motions and pulse pressures at the same time the potential flow method could predict the ship motions peak pressures rise time and drop time in heading waves 2 at half of service speed parametric rolling and flare slamming phenomena are firstly discussed the asymmetric effect of the slamming duration is affected by the roll motion the severity of flare slamming is related to the ratio of wave encounter frequency and roll natural frequency the flare slamming occurs more violently as the ratio of wave encounter frequency and roll natural frequency is closer to 2 0 3 at the service speed the slamming magnitude is not related to the wavelength the impact duration increases with the wavelength the rise time decreases as the wavelength increases at the same time the drop time increases as the wavelength increases therefore the increasing wavelength aggravates the severity of a slamming event in service speed condition the symmetric slamming results using the abs and iacs classification methods are similar to the test results 4 as the speed froude number increases the slamming duration decreases and the magnitude of the pressures increases in the future the accuracy of the duration of the slamming pressures needs to be further improved the strong nonlinearity could not be predicted because of the limitation of the potential flow method therefore the two way interactions of the ship motions and slamming pressures should be considered credit

ship motions and slamming pressures in cases 2 and 5 are shown within tables 16 17 within table 15 cf obtained with fine mesh and fine time step are presented as can be seen from table 16 17 the combination of all the errors except for the pitch amplitude in case 2 in d and s is smaller than u v and validation is achieved at the u v level the iterative uncertainty listed in table 16 shows relatively large values for the mean value of the motions and slamming about 7 2 d for pitch amplitude 5 2 d for roll amplitude and 0 9 d for maximum slamming pressure the iterative uncertainty listed in table 17 shows relatively large values for the mean value of the motions and slamming about 4 3 d for pitch amplitude 5 2 d for roll amplitude and 4 7 d 5 5 d for maximum slamming pressure the main reason is that the occurrence of parametric rolling causes the low frequency component of pitch motion in case 2 therefore the pitch motion of test results in case 2 presents m shape however the present cfd technology could not catch the nonlinearity induced by the low frequency component table 16 validation in case 2 table 16 parameters pitch amplitude deg roll amplitude deg maximum slamming
