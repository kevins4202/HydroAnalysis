9175,knowledge of surface soil moisture ssm at various scales is essential for understanding energy and water exchange between the atmosphere and land surface in this study we propose a practical approach based on the synergy of all weather land surface temperature lst and reanalysis data to generate a daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage in this approach the day night lst difference and ssm derived from the era5 land with a spatial resolution of 0 1 were first used to develop linear relationships between them under various vegetation densities sparse medium and dense for four dominant land cover types forest cropland grassland and barren in china the relationships were subsequently used in an all weather 1 km lst product to generate an initial daily 1 km ssm dataset in 2019 in addition two blended microwave based ssm products were applied to correct the initial dataset by assuming that the aggregated ssm values within the coarse scale were unbiased when compared with the original microwave based ssm products furthermore two blended microwave based ssm products were used to correct the initial dataset with the assumption that aggregated ssm values within the coarse scale are unbiased when compared to the original microwave based ssm products finally the estimated ssm were preliminarily evaluated against the ground in situ measurements at cropland under different aridity conditions a satisfactory accuracy was obtained with an unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of 0 05 m3 m3 which is not only close to the ubrmse requirements of 0 04 m3 m3 for the ssm estimates in most practical applications but is also characterized with quasi full spatial coverage keywords soil moisture land surface temperature reanalysis data blended microwave products data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm has been widely recognized as an essential climate and hydrological variable because it affects the surface energy budget and water cycles across regional to global scales these effects are mostly attributed to its significant role in partitioning turbulent energy into sensible and latent fluxes as well as to its capacity for allocating precipitation into infiltration and surface runoff castillo et al 2003 shein 2010 moreover numerous studies have highlighted the crucial role of ssm in agricultural systems because ssm can significantly affect water and nutrient uptake in roots and transpiration from leaves to maintain plant growth d odorico et al 2007 yadav et al 2009 wang et al 2019 therefore it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of ssm for such essential implications as weather forecasts water managements and yield predictions drusch 2007 rossato et al 2017 liu et al 2020 in recent decades remote sensing has become one of the most efficient ways to obtain ssm data at various scales as it offers several advantages including large scale observations and the rapid acquisition capacity thus far microwave and optical including visible near infrared and thermal data are the two main satellite sources for estimating ssm liu et al 2012 srivastava 2017 compared to optical data microwave mostly passive microwave based ssm retrieval has received increasing attention thus paving the way for the generation of various ssm products for operational applications despite such advantages most currently available microwave ssm products are characterized by coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km which makes them suitable for regional and global scale applications but insufficient for watershed or agricultural field scale applications in the contrast active microwave e g synthetic aperture radar generally reveals fine spatial resolution from meters to tens of meters which is adequate for deriving ssm at field scale however the temporal resolution for most of the currently available active sensors is rather poor nevertheless a number of studies have highlighted the feasibility for estimating ssm with recently launched active observations benninga et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 except for microwave optical based ssm retrieval has also attracted increasing attentions in recent a few decades several typical algorithms include the thermal inertia method senanayake et al 2021 hao et al 2022 the feature space method sadeghi et al 2017 ma et al 2022a and the elliptical method leng et al 2016 li et al 2021 despite its fine spatial resolution from tens of meters to a few kilometers optical data are more easily to be contaminated by clouds and other complex whether conditions which cause substantial gaps in ssm retrievals especially in regions with intense evaporation considering the complementarity of microwave and optical data some scholars have previously attempted to combine microwave and optical data to obtain ssm estimates with either high resolution or enhanced spatial coverage given the requirements of the high spatial resolution ssm various disaggregation algorithms have been utilized in these studies while most currently available ssm products are rather coarse peng et al 2017 several typical examples include the physical and theoretical scale change dispatch algorithm which utilizes soil evaporation efficiency as a link between ssm at different spatial scales merlin et al 2012 song et al 2022 the downscaling algorithm based on thermal inertia theory fang et al 2013 2022 and the empirical polynomial regression method zhao and li 2013 ghahremanloo et al 2018 it should be noted that all these methods require optical measurements of land surface temperature lst owing to the significant effects of lst on ssm dynamics however owing to the effects of clouds most of currently available satellite derived lst products are available only over clear skies in addition to this the scaling issue is also a challenge in disaggregation algorithms since coarse ssm products and fine resolution auxiliary data are synergistically used specifically the scaling issue can also be found in the community of satellite ssm such as validation of satellite derived ssm products and comparison of various ssm datasets with different resolutions kÄ™dzior and zawadzki 2016 in recent years an increasing number of studies have been focused on removing cloud effects and reconstructing ground information to obtain all weather lst and vegetation properties wu et al 2021 jia et al 2021 ma et al 2022b which has provided an unprecedented opportunity to serve as the essential inputs for the aforementioned disaggregation algorithms meanwhile ssm products derived from single sensors such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap have been widely used as raw data in the disaggregation process knipper et al 2017 li et al 2018 recently several studies have shown that multi sensor blended ssm products exhibit both improved accuracy and enhanced spatial coverage time span of data availability yin et al 2019 chen et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge the soil moisture operational product system smops of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the climate change initiative cci of the european space agency are two blended ssm products derived from multiply active passive microwave observations at global scale although a previous study has preliminarily assessed the two products synchronously against in situ measurements and reanalysis data wang et al 2021 the corresponding validation was mainly conducted in europe and the us however the accuracy of the two blended products for china is still undefined especially considering the nearly full land coverage of smops to this end it is interesting to further investigate the performances of the blended microwave based ssm products as raw data in the determination of fine scale ssm in china since the knowledge of the exchange and feedback of water energy between atmospheres and land surfaces at fine spatial resolution in china with such a vast spatial coverage and multiply landscapes is critical the present study had the following main objectives i to obtain high spatial resolution ssm with the blended microwaved products and spatially seamless optical data with an emphasis on the generation of high spatial resolution ssm of quasi full spatial coverage and ii to evaluate the daily 1 km ssm corrected with cci and smops synchronously in china to designate the final efficient dataset the remainder of this article is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data and section 3 describes the methods sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and in situ measurements china is located in the eastern part of the eurasian continent and to the west of the pacific ocean and has a vast territory that spans from 73 30 e to 135 03 e and 3 31 n to 53 33 n due to its vast spatial coverage significantly varying landscapes across its vast width and length can be found according to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover types fig 1 moreover the climatic patterns of china reveal significant regional heterogeneity specifically humidity tends to decrease from the southeast coast to northwest inland china which is the primary reason for the formation of climate and vegetation patterns as shown in fig 1 grassland 46 1 cropland 15 6 barren 24 3 and forest 10 8 are the main land cover types accounting for 97 of the total area it is known that different vegetation types are characterized by discrepant water retention capacities and ecosystem functions making it necessary to obtain spatiotemporally continuous ssm at fine spatial resolution so as to better understand the water and mass exchange between the atmosphere and the earth s surface as shown in fig 1 ground in situ ssm stations are generally distributed in two zones with different climate patterns there are 87 stations in anhui province black triangle in fig 1 which has a semi humid humid climate and five stations under the heihe watershed allied telemetry experiment research project hiwater in the heihe river basin which has a semi arid arid climate li et al 2013a for the anhui sites ssm measurements with a depth of 10 cm for the first day from the typical growing season of march to september 2019 were collected in the present study for further investigations for the hiwater stations daily ssm measurements were also collected at the top layer of 4 cm from may to september 2019 specifically the five hiwater sites were distributed in two 1 1 km modis pixels as shown in fig 1 it notes that all the ssm stations are located in cropland 2 2 reanalysis data era5 land is the fifth generation reanalysis data of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts the era5 land assimilates multi source data including weather station data numerical weather forecasts and satellite observations into the dynamic models to produce the output reanalysis this dataset has superior accuracy compared to previous versions and has a longer temporal span era5 land includes dynamic data since 1981 for 50 indicators that characterize water and heat transfer from the atmosphere to the subsurface with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a temporal interval of 1 h here the skin temperature and volumetric ssm content for the top layer 7 cm of the era5 land were obtained from the climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu home 2 3 microwave based ssm product cci and smops are two currently available active passive microwave blended ssm products that are characterized by an identical spatial resolution of 0 25 and daily interval specifically both products have blended several missions such as smap global precipitation measurement and smos however different retrieval algorithms and data sources have been used to generate these products resulting in significant differences between the two with respect to accuracy and spatial coverage numerous comprehensive assessments of the cci product have revealed good consistency with ground in situ measurements across many regions worldwide which can more accurately characterize ssm and its spatiotemporal dynamics dorigo et al 2015 an et al 2016 mcnally et al 2016 in a recent study a synchronous comparison of the two ssm products against in situ and reanalysis data were conducted the cci has been reported to have slightly better accuracy than smops over most land coverage wang et al 2021 to date compared to smops which has received less attention cci products have received considerable attention worldwide making it one of the most popular microwave based ssm products dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 compared to cci smops stands out with a nearly full land coverage which allows retrieving ssm estimates with fair accuracy when cci is unavailable wang et al 2021 moreover the latest version of the cci v7 1 product has been shown to be the most accurate cci product with improved temporal 1978 2021 and spatial coverage due to the inclusion of two new active and passive sensors advanced scattorometer c and fengyun 3d in contrast the latest version of smops v3 0 was characterized by a short period from 2017 to the present with enhanced accuracy compared to previous versions yin et al 2020 in the present study the two blended microwave based ssm products in 2019 were obtained from the official websites at https www esa soilmoisture cci org and https www ospo noaa gov products land smops respectively 2 4 optical data as mentioned in the previous section the lst plays a crucial role in ssm retrieval and disaggregation however owing to the effects of clouds the algorithms for estimating lst from thermal bands typically fail over clouds pixels consequently ssm retrieval or disaggregation is unavailable for cloud pixels a recent study by zhang et al 2021 used the lst time series decomposition model and proposed a method to obtain all weather lst from the synergistic use of modis and global land data assimilation system gldas derived lst as well as auxiliary data on vegetation properties and land surface albedo which is named as the thermal and reanalysis integrating moderate resolution spatial seamless trims lst assessments of the trims lst dataset with ground lst measurements at 15 sites in china have revealed high accuracy with an overall root mean square error rmse of 1 52 3 71 k thus outperforming other all weather lst products zhou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 2021 in the present study the trims lst product was obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn en data specifically the aqua satellite with the overpassing time of 13 30 and 01 30 was used to produce the trims lst product the primary reason that we selected this data is that the trims can well represent the day night lst differences because the overpassing times of aqua are close to the daily maximum lst time 13 30 and minimum lst time 01 30 ma et al 2013 in addition to lst the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has also been widely used in the determination of ssm at high spatial resolutions in this study to accord with the trims lst dataset the ndvi products of both myd13c1 5 km and myd13a2 1 km were used in the disaggregation algorithm specifically myd13c1 was resampled using the nearest neighbor interpolation to a spatial resolution of 0 1 which was consistent with the era5 land data this study requires daily interval ndvi datasets whereas the ndvi products of modis have a temporal resolution of 16 days therefore spatially and temporally continuous ndvi for the period of 2006 2020 needs to be reconstructed using the savitzky golay s g filter method bian et al 2010 the ndvi products used in this study were obtained from the website at https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search 3 method this study used the ssm products and all weather lst data to generate a daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage fig 2 shows a flow chart for the generation of the daily 1 km ssm data in general this process can be divided into three steps i calibration ii disaggregation and correction and iii validation the following subsections describe these three steps in detail 3 1 calibration as a thermal property of soil soil thermal inertia reflects the ability of soil to prevent a change in its temperature i e the higher the water content of the soil the slower its temperature changes and the higher the thermal inertia ma et al 2013 several studies have confirmed the feasibility of upscaling or downscaling ssm using the thermal inertia theory qin et al 2013 fang et al 2013 liu et al 2021 for the ssm disaggregation a link between the coarse resolution ssm data and those at the fine spatial scale should first be established in the present study the day night lst difference was determined as the link in the disaggregation procedure to better describe the relationships between ssm and the day night lst difference two conditions were considered ndvi level and land cover type for different vegetation coverages distinct relationships were observed between day night lst differences and ssm conditions these relationships emerged because the changes in biomass would induce changes in lst thereby affecting ssm dynamics fang et al 2013 meanwhile numerous studies have already reported that different vegetation types exhibit a more profound effect on ssm wang et al 2009 yang et al 2020 this effect emerges mostly due to the different soil water holding capacities for various vegetation types in particular a forest is mostly tall with strong root systems and water absorption mainly originates from deep soils while grassland cropland and shrubland are all characterized by low canopy density and shallow root systems cropland differs significantly from grassland and shrubland in that the former can be frequently affected by anthropogenic activities barren is mostly concentrated in arid semi arid regions with relatively low vegetation coverage and ssm levels fig 1 shows that the dominant land cover types in china are grassland cropland barren forest and shrubland as the shrubland only accounts for 0 14 it was merged into grassland in this study primarily due to their similar characteristics such as relatively low canopy density and limited human interference ultimately four land cover types were considered in the development of the relationships between ssm and the day night lst difference i forest ii grassland iii cropland and iv barren for each land cover type the relationships between ssm and the day night lst difference were developed under different ndvi levels including i sparse vegetation coverage with ndvi under 0 3 ii medium vegetation coverage with ndvi between 0 3 and 0 6 and iii dense vegetation coverage with ndvi over 0 6 it is widely acknowledged that vegetation exerts a regulating effect on the temperature difference while various vegetation types land cover types and its different growth periods ndvi have different regulating effects in this study it is assumed that the moderating effect is consistent for the same land cover type at the same ndvi level following this assumption a linear relationship between day night lst differences and ssm is expressed in eq 1 based on the groups of land cover types and ndvi status over the entire calibration period 1 Î¸ 9km a i j Î´ l s t 9km b i j where Î¸ 9km and Î´ l s t 9km refer to ssm and day night lst differences respectively and a i j and b i j represent the coefficients of the i th land cover type forest grassland cropland and barren with the j th ndvi level low medium and dense the aim of the first step is to calibrate the coefficients a i j and b i j using the era5 land data 3 2 disaggregation and correction the previous section described how the linear relationships between day night lst differences and ssm were obtained the coefficients a i j and b i j were calibrated with era5 land data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 to further obtain ssm data with the fine spatial resolution of 1 km the developed linear relationships at the coarse spatial resolution of 0 1 were assumed to be feasible for all the 1 km pixels based on this assumption and the day night lst differences derived from modis lst data with the land cover types and ndvi levels were determined for every pixel the daily 1 km ssm was estimated using eq 2 with high spatial resolution data 2 Î¸ 1km a i j Î´ l s t modis 1km b i j where Î¸ 1km is the initial daily 1 km ssm obtained from the disaggregation Î´ l s t modis 1km represents modis day night lst differences a i j and b i j represents the coefficients obtained from eq 1 as ssm at the coarse pixel of 25 km may differ from the averaged value of the downscaled fine pixel of 1 km within a coarse pixel the correction value for each coarse pixel was defined as the difference between these two datasets 3 Î´ Î¸ Î¸ 25km 1 n i 1 n Î¸ 1km where Î´ Î¸ is the correction value for each cci or smops pixel Î¸ 25 km represents the ssm value for a cci or smops pixel and n refers to the number of 1 1 km modis pixels within a cci or smops pixel based on the correction value for the coarse pixel a simple strategy is to equally divide that of the coarse pixel to each modis pixel this is generally justifiable as no recognized rules currently exist to better allocate the coarse resolution ssm correction value to the pixels at fine scale the final corrected daily 1 km ssm can be written as follows 4 Î¸ 1km Î¸ 1km Î´ Î¸ where Î¸ 1 km and Î¸ 1 km are the corrected and initial daily 1 km ssm at respectively based on the corrected and initial ssm datasets the final daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage can be determined as follows 5 Î¸ Î¸ 1km Î» 1 c mask Î¸ 1km c mask where Î¸ is the final daily 1 km ssm cmask refers to the mask for the invalid pixels of cci or smops cmask is 1 if true and 0 otherwise finally the ground in situ measurements over the two regions with semi humid humid anhui province and semi arid arid heihe conditions were used to validate the corrected ssm at 1 km the statistical metrics used in the present study include the bias rmse and ubrmse which are expressed as follows 6 b i a s 1 m i 1 m x i y i 7 r m s e 1 m i 1 m x i y i 2 8 u b r m s e r m s e 2 b i a s 2 where m is the total number of ssm pairs of ground measurements and estimates and x i and y i are the estimated ssm and in situ ssm measurements respectively 4 results 4 1 initial ssm over the study area fig 3 shows the daily 1 km initial ssm obtained from eq 2 at fine spatial resolution on january 15th april 15th july 15th and october 15th which represent winter spring summer and autumn respectively in south china a relatively high ssm level can be observed in all the ssm data whereas a decreased ssm can be found in north china specifically all the data reveal the lowest ssm values over northwest china which is mainly attributed to barren the dominant land type in this region a scaling issue exists between pixel based ssm and in situ measurements which would prevent absolute agreement between the two time series an efficient method namely the cumulative distribution function cdf can effectively remove systematic differences between two scaled datasets brocca et al 2011 lacava et al 2012 through this method the estimated ssm is rescaled such that its cdf matches the cdf of the in situ ssm fig 4 shows the comparison of the initial ssm and in situ measurements during the study period in the semi humid humid region anhui and semi arid arid region heihe owing to the continuous in situ ground measurements over the heihe region the cdf can be applied for this area according to the results the overall rmse in anhui and heihe of 0 090 m3 m3 and 0 057 m3 m3 respectively can be found over the study period in particular it is clear that the initial ssm shows an overestimation with a bias of 0 054 m3 m3 in anhui compared with the in situ ssm the accuracy of the initial ssm was relatively low and the ubrmse of anhui and heihe were 0 071 m3 m3 and 0 057 m3 m3 respectively nevertheless the initial ssm can still be applied in practice such as by roughly monitoring drought when there is no available ssm 4 2 ssm corrected with the two blended products cci and smops have been verified to be reliable in terms of accuracy while a notable issue is the spatial coverage of the corrected ssm with cci and smops gruber et al 2019 yin et al 2020 quasi full spatial coverage of the smops can be found for almost all data periods whereas the cci reveals different gaps the reasons for the distinct discrepancy between the two blended ssm products include the different algorithms data sources and quality controls for producing the products wang et al 2021 fig 5 shows the spatial coverage rates of the cci and smops ssm products for each month in 2019 as for the cci an average spatial coverage rate of approximately 46 can be found for the entire year with a high spatial coverage rate of close to 80 being observed only in summer july august and september the spatial coverage rate in winter was the lowest at less than 20 indicating that almost no data suitable for practical application were available for this period in contrast smops exhibited a significantly enhanced spatial coverage throughout the year throughout the year 2019 the average spatial coverage rate was approximately 93 and almost all months except for january revealed a high spatial coverage rate of over 90 nevertheless further accuracy assessment is required before the determination of a preferred alternative in practice for the generation of the daily 1 km ssm fig 6 shows the original cci images and the Î´ Î¸ obtained using eq 3 on january 15th april 15th july 15th and october 15th it can be seen that the Î´ Î¸ between a cci pixel and the averaged ssm of the initial ssm within the cci pixel is approximately 0 m3 m3 which follows the normal distribution the average correction value of the cci is generally in the range of 0 010 0 023 m3 m3 with a standard deviation of approximately 0 060 m3 m3 taking the four typical days in fig 6 as an example pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 05 m3 m3 account for 60 61 55 and 63 of the total pixels furthermore pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 1 m3 m3 account for 88 90 85 and 92 of the total pixels all these statistics indicate that the Î´ Î¸ is generally reasonable to correct the initial ssm fig 7 shows the smops products and the corresponding Î´ Î¸ with the averaged ssm of the initial ssm in pixels for four typical days the average Î´ Î¸ for the smops was 0 008 m3 m3 and 0 023 m3 m3 moreover the standard deviation was approximately 0 060 m3 m3 which was similar to that of the cci similarly taking the four typical days in fig 7 as an example the pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 05 m3 m3 account for 44 56 47 and 59 of the total pixels furthermore the pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 1 m3 m3 account for 81 83 82 and 91 of the total pixels compared with cci it can be seen that the Î´ Î¸ corresponding to smops is generally larger perhaps because smops has a wider spatial coverage and a larger number of pixels involved in the correction 4 3 corrected ssm over the study area fig 8 shows the daily 1 km ssm corrected by cci and smops the spatial distribution of the coarse microwave based products and the corresponding fine spatial resolution ssm data were highly consistent across the entire study area moreover the overall trends of the two types of images were found to be consistent as well despite such agreement the ssm corrected by cci was lower than that of smops in northwest china whereas the former was slightly higher than the latter in northeastern china in the following sub sections the estimated daily 1 km ssm were evaluated using ground in situ measurements in semi humid humid and semi arid arid regions 4 3 1 evaluation of daily 1 km ssm over semi humid humid region in this study the ssm measurements collected from the 87 stations in anhui province were used to evaluate the estimated daily 1 km ssm over the semi humid humid region fig 9 shows the distribution of the in situ ssm measurements and the corrected ssm with the two blended products of cci and smops on the seven selected days in 2019 specifically the whiskers correspond to the distribution range of the minimum and maximum values of the ssm the boxes represent the quartiles at the 25 and 75 levels fig 9 clearly shows that i both higher averaged ssm values and wider ssm variation ranges were identified in the corrected ssm compared with those of the in situ measurements thus indicating an overestimation for the corrected ssm ii an even more overestimation of the corrected ssm with cci than that of smops was identified with respect to both the averaged ssm and variation ranges to further investigate the accuracy of the corrected ssm the statistical metrics of bias and rmse between the estimated daily 1 km ssm and the in situ measurement over the 87 stations for each of the seven selected days were obtained and plotted in fig 10 the results show fairly accurate rmse varying from 0 057 m3 m3 to 0 112 m3 m3 obtained for the corrected ssm with the smops in contrast the ssm obtained from cci showed a decreased accuracy where the rmse ranged from 0 079 m3 m3 to 0 134 m3 m3 moreover the corrected ssm with the cci and smops showed a significant overestimation with bias of 0 016 0 088 m3 m3 and 0 053 0 114 m3 m3 respectively however both the rmse and bias exhibited similar variations across the study period indicating that the rmse is probably caused by bias fig 11 shows a comparison of the final ssm and in situ measurements over 87 stations during the study period the corrected ssm with cci reveals greater overestimation with a bias of 0 089 m3 m3 compared to that of smops with a bias of 0 058 m3 m3 these significant overestimations can directly lead to an overall rmse of 0 105 m3 m3 and 0 081 m3 m3 for the two datasets nevertheless similar ubrmse values of approximately 0 056 m3 m3 and 0 057 m3 m3 can be obtained for the corrected ssm with cci and smops respectively which is close to the ubrmse requirement of 0 04 m3 m3 for ssm estimates in most practical applications 4 3 2 evaluation of daily 1 km ssm over the semi arid arid region in the present study ssm measurements collected at five stations from may to september 2019 in hiwater over the heihe river basin were used to evaluate the estimated daily 1 km ssm over the semi arid arid region because multiple stations appear in the modis pixels the averaged station measurements within a modis pixel were used to evaluate the corrected ssm fig 12 shows the distribution of the in situ ssm measurements and the corrected ssm with the two blended products of cci and smops in the two modis pixels in 2019 specifically the results show the distribution range in which the boxes represent the standard deviation of the in situ ssm or corrected ssm from the blended microwave products as shown in fig 12 i it is evident that a lower averaged ssm value can be observed in the corrected ssm than that in the in situ measurements indicating an underestimation for the corrected ssm ii the average value of the corrected ssm with smops is closer to the in situ measurements than that of the corrected ssm with cci to further investigate the accuracy of the corrected ssm the statistical metrics of bias and rmse between the daily 1 km corrected ssm and the in situ measurement from may to september for 135 days were obtained and plotted in fig 13 according to the results a fairly accurate average rmse of 0 061 m3 m3 was obtained for the corrected ssm with the smops in contrast the ssm corrected with the cci showed a decreased accuracy where the average rmse was 0 070 m3 m3 moreover the corrected ssm with smops and cci showed a significant underestimation with bias from 0 024 m3 m3 to 0 048 m3 m3 and from 0 036 m3 m3 to 0 062 m3 m3 respectively this is consistent with the conclusion obtained in anhui province indicating that the corrected ssm with smops was of superior quality fig 14 shows a comparison of the corrected ssm and in situ measurements of heihe for five stations from may to september after cdf matching the rmse and ubrmse of the corrected ssm with smops were 0 048 m3 m3 and 0 048 m3 m3 respectively the correction result of cci is similar to that of smops and its rmse and ubrmse are 0 047 m3 m3 and 0 047 m3 m3 respectively although the accuracies of the two datasets were comparable the trend of the ssm corrected with smops was more distinct 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with previous study the validations in semi arid arid and semi humid humid regions indicated that the corrected ssm with smops exhibited accuracy comparable with that of the corrected ssm with cci moreover as cci offered a high spatial coverage 80 only in summer it could not meet the practical application in other seasons while the average spatial coverage rate of smops was 93 in 2019 indicating a high spatial coverage rate of over 90 throughout the year overall the corrected ssm with smops can be considered as a better daily 1 km soil moisture with a quasi full spatial coverage dataset than that of cci table 1 shows a comparison of several methods for obtaining ssm at higher spatial resolution in recent years with respect to the original microwave products temporal spatial resolution study area and ubrmse the results demonstrated that most of the currently available methods can utilize ssm products with single sensors such as smap and amsr 2 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e generally extends the span however only a few methods use blended microwave based ssm products as the original data in the disaggregation procedure overall our method shows slightly better or comparable accuracy to previous methods the existing daily 1 km soil moisture dataset in china in 2019 was derived from the disaggregation of the amsr e amsr 2 product song et al 2022 by considering this ssm dataset as a reference to compare the estimated one from our study 40 000 sampling pixels were randomly selected over the study region in this process the slope of the selected sampling pixels was generally 10 to ensure the reliability of the assessment fig 15 shows the density scatter plot of the resultant 40 000 random pixels between the two ssm datasets as shown in the figure the density of pixels was the highest around the 1 1 line indicating that the ssm dataset obtained by our method with smops correction stands out with a high correlation against the reference dataset the ubrmse on january 15th which typically represents winter was close to 0 08 m3 m3 while in the other seasons ubrmses were 0 074 m3 m3 0 078 m3 m3 and 0 071 m3 m3 respectively all of which were slightly better than that of winter in summary the daily 1 km ssm corrected with smops was highly consistent with the reference ssm 5 2 limitations and future developments although this study showed high accuracy of the estimated ssm by comparison with the ground in situ measurements two primary limitations with respect to the further improvements of the proposed approach should be addressed the first is the obtaining of consistent lst dataset under all weather conditions the present study utilized the all weather lst data as the main auxiliary to obtain daily 1 km ssm at quasi full spatial coverage because of this the accuracy of all weather lst directly affected the estimated ssm although numerous approaches have been previously developed to obtain lst under cloudy pixels the lst filled using statistical or spatiotemporal interpolation methods arguably represents only an approximation of the theoretical cloud free lst therefore this result does not reflect an estimate of the actual cloudy lst thereby inevitably plaguing the accuracy of the reconstructed lst over cloudy pixels compared to clear sky pixels wu et al 2021 currently it is widely recognized that thermal based lst retrieval can reach relatively high accuracy 1 k over clear sky pixels for most of cases li et al 2013b hence it is of great interest to further improve the accuracy of lst estimates over cloudy pixels in future developments so as to enhance the obtaining of all weather lst and ssm at high spatial resolution to this end it is encouraged to develop more reliable passive microwave based lst retrieval and downscaling algorithms due to the capacity of penetrating through cloud and detecting surface radiation for the microwave missions namely it is expected to be a promising way to obtain all weather lst from the combined use of thermal and passive microwave measurements in future developments except for the issue of obtaining actual lst over cloudy pixels it is well recognized that satellites observe the earth with varying angles for pixels over a vast area like china even for a same image scene due to the directionality of lst the observed lst variation due to angular anisotropy can reach up to 15 k following a various of experiments lagouarde et al 2010 coll et al 2019 as a result this angular anisotropy can significantly decrease the spatial comparability of lst and subsequent lst based applications especially for ssm disaggregation using the integration of coarse satellite images and contained fine resolution observations to address this issue it is encouraged to obtain lst dataset with consistent observing angle e g nadir direction from normalizing lsts from different observation angels the other limitation is the development of relationships between day night lst and ssm over more refined vegetation patches the rationale behind the proposed approach is mostly attributed to the regulating effect of lst difference by vegetation although considerable accuracy can be obtained by the proposed approach it is generally assumed a same moderating effect for a given group of land cover type and ndvi status in the present study this assumption can largely decrease the difficulties for applying the approach in practice to further improve the method it is expected that more detailed crop type classifications or vegetation structure maps can be provided as auxiliary input based on these the relationship between day night lst and ssm can be developed on each crop type with similar ecosystem functions which is expected to be more refined than the present classification except for the primary limitations stated earlier several other issues including the different sensing depths of microwave missions and thermal signals as well as the comprehensive assessments of estimated ssm dataset should be also noted it is traditionally considered that microwave ssm products can reflect only the top layer with a depth of 5 cm while the lst difference can reflect the ssm status within deeper soil columns li et al 2021 ahmadi et al 2022 the main reasons for the different sensing depths can be generally attribute to the diverse abilities of penetration with different wavelengths and the disparate sensitivities of remotely sensed parameters to ssm status except for these it is also noteworthy that significant correlation of water content in different layers can be commonly found ghahremanloo et al 2018 li et al 2021 hence it is generally reasonable to evaluate satellite derived ssm dataset with measurements at top layer either 4 cm for hiwater stations or 10 cm for anhui sites nevertheless this may have affected the assessments of the estimated ssm in the present study moreover given the lack of ground in situ ssm measurements the preliminary evaluation of the estimated daily 1 km ssm dataset was mostly conducted over cropland under humid semi humidity and arid semi arid aridity conditions to better understand the accuracy of the proposed method more comprehensive evaluations of the estimated ssm over different land cover types and climate patterns should be investigated in future studies 6 conclusion this study developed a practical approach to estimate ssm at fine spatial resolution from the synergistic use of optical and microwave remote sensing observations this approach yielded a daily 1 km ssm dataset for 2019 over china based on the blended microwave ssm products cci and smops and reconstructed all weather lst data the evaluation was conducted for 2019 with the total of 92 ssm stations in the anhui province in eastern china and the heihe river basin in northwestern china the results revealed comparable accuracy of the estimated ssm with overall ubrmse of 0 05 m3 m3 for the cci and smops however smops offered significantly better spatial coverage than the cci products which makes it more optimized for obtaining the daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage despite promising results several challenges including retrieval of actual lst over cloudy pixels qualification of the sensing depth from different wavelengths and more comprehensive evaluations under different landscapes should be considered in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9175,knowledge of surface soil moisture ssm at various scales is essential for understanding energy and water exchange between the atmosphere and land surface in this study we propose a practical approach based on the synergy of all weather land surface temperature lst and reanalysis data to generate a daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage in this approach the day night lst difference and ssm derived from the era5 land with a spatial resolution of 0 1 were first used to develop linear relationships between them under various vegetation densities sparse medium and dense for four dominant land cover types forest cropland grassland and barren in china the relationships were subsequently used in an all weather 1 km lst product to generate an initial daily 1 km ssm dataset in 2019 in addition two blended microwave based ssm products were applied to correct the initial dataset by assuming that the aggregated ssm values within the coarse scale were unbiased when compared with the original microwave based ssm products furthermore two blended microwave based ssm products were used to correct the initial dataset with the assumption that aggregated ssm values within the coarse scale are unbiased when compared to the original microwave based ssm products finally the estimated ssm were preliminarily evaluated against the ground in situ measurements at cropland under different aridity conditions a satisfactory accuracy was obtained with an unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of 0 05 m3 m3 which is not only close to the ubrmse requirements of 0 04 m3 m3 for the ssm estimates in most practical applications but is also characterized with quasi full spatial coverage keywords soil moisture land surface temperature reanalysis data blended microwave products data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm has been widely recognized as an essential climate and hydrological variable because it affects the surface energy budget and water cycles across regional to global scales these effects are mostly attributed to its significant role in partitioning turbulent energy into sensible and latent fluxes as well as to its capacity for allocating precipitation into infiltration and surface runoff castillo et al 2003 shein 2010 moreover numerous studies have highlighted the crucial role of ssm in agricultural systems because ssm can significantly affect water and nutrient uptake in roots and transpiration from leaves to maintain plant growth d odorico et al 2007 yadav et al 2009 wang et al 2019 therefore it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of ssm for such essential implications as weather forecasts water managements and yield predictions drusch 2007 rossato et al 2017 liu et al 2020 in recent decades remote sensing has become one of the most efficient ways to obtain ssm data at various scales as it offers several advantages including large scale observations and the rapid acquisition capacity thus far microwave and optical including visible near infrared and thermal data are the two main satellite sources for estimating ssm liu et al 2012 srivastava 2017 compared to optical data microwave mostly passive microwave based ssm retrieval has received increasing attention thus paving the way for the generation of various ssm products for operational applications despite such advantages most currently available microwave ssm products are characterized by coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km which makes them suitable for regional and global scale applications but insufficient for watershed or agricultural field scale applications in the contrast active microwave e g synthetic aperture radar generally reveals fine spatial resolution from meters to tens of meters which is adequate for deriving ssm at field scale however the temporal resolution for most of the currently available active sensors is rather poor nevertheless a number of studies have highlighted the feasibility for estimating ssm with recently launched active observations benninga et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 except for microwave optical based ssm retrieval has also attracted increasing attentions in recent a few decades several typical algorithms include the thermal inertia method senanayake et al 2021 hao et al 2022 the feature space method sadeghi et al 2017 ma et al 2022a and the elliptical method leng et al 2016 li et al 2021 despite its fine spatial resolution from tens of meters to a few kilometers optical data are more easily to be contaminated by clouds and other complex whether conditions which cause substantial gaps in ssm retrievals especially in regions with intense evaporation considering the complementarity of microwave and optical data some scholars have previously attempted to combine microwave and optical data to obtain ssm estimates with either high resolution or enhanced spatial coverage given the requirements of the high spatial resolution ssm various disaggregation algorithms have been utilized in these studies while most currently available ssm products are rather coarse peng et al 2017 several typical examples include the physical and theoretical scale change dispatch algorithm which utilizes soil evaporation efficiency as a link between ssm at different spatial scales merlin et al 2012 song et al 2022 the downscaling algorithm based on thermal inertia theory fang et al 2013 2022 and the empirical polynomial regression method zhao and li 2013 ghahremanloo et al 2018 it should be noted that all these methods require optical measurements of land surface temperature lst owing to the significant effects of lst on ssm dynamics however owing to the effects of clouds most of currently available satellite derived lst products are available only over clear skies in addition to this the scaling issue is also a challenge in disaggregation algorithms since coarse ssm products and fine resolution auxiliary data are synergistically used specifically the scaling issue can also be found in the community of satellite ssm such as validation of satellite derived ssm products and comparison of various ssm datasets with different resolutions kÄ™dzior and zawadzki 2016 in recent years an increasing number of studies have been focused on removing cloud effects and reconstructing ground information to obtain all weather lst and vegetation properties wu et al 2021 jia et al 2021 ma et al 2022b which has provided an unprecedented opportunity to serve as the essential inputs for the aforementioned disaggregation algorithms meanwhile ssm products derived from single sensors such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap have been widely used as raw data in the disaggregation process knipper et al 2017 li et al 2018 recently several studies have shown that multi sensor blended ssm products exhibit both improved accuracy and enhanced spatial coverage time span of data availability yin et al 2019 chen et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge the soil moisture operational product system smops of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the climate change initiative cci of the european space agency are two blended ssm products derived from multiply active passive microwave observations at global scale although a previous study has preliminarily assessed the two products synchronously against in situ measurements and reanalysis data wang et al 2021 the corresponding validation was mainly conducted in europe and the us however the accuracy of the two blended products for china is still undefined especially considering the nearly full land coverage of smops to this end it is interesting to further investigate the performances of the blended microwave based ssm products as raw data in the determination of fine scale ssm in china since the knowledge of the exchange and feedback of water energy between atmospheres and land surfaces at fine spatial resolution in china with such a vast spatial coverage and multiply landscapes is critical the present study had the following main objectives i to obtain high spatial resolution ssm with the blended microwaved products and spatially seamless optical data with an emphasis on the generation of high spatial resolution ssm of quasi full spatial coverage and ii to evaluate the daily 1 km ssm corrected with cci and smops synchronously in china to designate the final efficient dataset the remainder of this article is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data and section 3 describes the methods sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and in situ measurements china is located in the eastern part of the eurasian continent and to the west of the pacific ocean and has a vast territory that spans from 73 30 e to 135 03 e and 3 31 n to 53 33 n due to its vast spatial coverage significantly varying landscapes across its vast width and length can be found according to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover types fig 1 moreover the climatic patterns of china reveal significant regional heterogeneity specifically humidity tends to decrease from the southeast coast to northwest inland china which is the primary reason for the formation of climate and vegetation patterns as shown in fig 1 grassland 46 1 cropland 15 6 barren 24 3 and forest 10 8 are the main land cover types accounting for 97 of the total area it is known that different vegetation types are characterized by discrepant water retention capacities and ecosystem functions making it necessary to obtain spatiotemporally continuous ssm at fine spatial resolution so as to better understand the water and mass exchange between the atmosphere and the earth s surface as shown in fig 1 ground in situ ssm stations are generally distributed in two zones with different climate patterns there are 87 stations in anhui province black triangle in fig 1 which has a semi humid humid climate and five stations under the heihe watershed allied telemetry experiment research project hiwater in the heihe river basin which has a semi arid arid climate li et al 2013a for the anhui sites ssm measurements with a depth of 10 cm for the first day from the typical growing season of march to september 2019 were collected in the present study for further investigations for the hiwater stations daily ssm measurements were also collected at the top layer of 4 cm from may to september 2019 specifically the five hiwater sites were distributed in two 1 1 km modis pixels as shown in fig 1 it notes that all the ssm stations are located in cropland 2 2 reanalysis data era5 land is the fifth generation reanalysis data of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts the era5 land assimilates multi source data including weather station data numerical weather forecasts and satellite observations into the dynamic models to produce the output reanalysis this dataset has superior accuracy compared to previous versions and has a longer temporal span era5 land includes dynamic data since 1981 for 50 indicators that characterize water and heat transfer from the atmosphere to the subsurface with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a temporal interval of 1 h here the skin temperature and volumetric ssm content for the top layer 7 cm of the era5 land were obtained from the climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu home 2 3 microwave based ssm product cci and smops are two currently available active passive microwave blended ssm products that are characterized by an identical spatial resolution of 0 25 and daily interval specifically both products have blended several missions such as smap global precipitation measurement and smos however different retrieval algorithms and data sources have been used to generate these products resulting in significant differences between the two with respect to accuracy and spatial coverage numerous comprehensive assessments of the cci product have revealed good consistency with ground in situ measurements across many regions worldwide which can more accurately characterize ssm and its spatiotemporal dynamics dorigo et al 2015 an et al 2016 mcnally et al 2016 in a recent study a synchronous comparison of the two ssm products against in situ and reanalysis data were conducted the cci has been reported to have slightly better accuracy than smops over most land coverage wang et al 2021 to date compared to smops which has received less attention cci products have received considerable attention worldwide making it one of the most popular microwave based ssm products dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 compared to cci smops stands out with a nearly full land coverage which allows retrieving ssm estimates with fair accuracy when cci is unavailable wang et al 2021 moreover the latest version of the cci v7 1 product has been shown to be the most accurate cci product with improved temporal 1978 2021 and spatial coverage due to the inclusion of two new active and passive sensors advanced scattorometer c and fengyun 3d in contrast the latest version of smops v3 0 was characterized by a short period from 2017 to the present with enhanced accuracy compared to previous versions yin et al 2020 in the present study the two blended microwave based ssm products in 2019 were obtained from the official websites at https www esa soilmoisture cci org and https www ospo noaa gov products land smops respectively 2 4 optical data as mentioned in the previous section the lst plays a crucial role in ssm retrieval and disaggregation however owing to the effects of clouds the algorithms for estimating lst from thermal bands typically fail over clouds pixels consequently ssm retrieval or disaggregation is unavailable for cloud pixels a recent study by zhang et al 2021 used the lst time series decomposition model and proposed a method to obtain all weather lst from the synergistic use of modis and global land data assimilation system gldas derived lst as well as auxiliary data on vegetation properties and land surface albedo which is named as the thermal and reanalysis integrating moderate resolution spatial seamless trims lst assessments of the trims lst dataset with ground lst measurements at 15 sites in china have revealed high accuracy with an overall root mean square error rmse of 1 52 3 71 k thus outperforming other all weather lst products zhou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 2021 in the present study the trims lst product was obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn en data specifically the aqua satellite with the overpassing time of 13 30 and 01 30 was used to produce the trims lst product the primary reason that we selected this data is that the trims can well represent the day night lst differences because the overpassing times of aqua are close to the daily maximum lst time 13 30 and minimum lst time 01 30 ma et al 2013 in addition to lst the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has also been widely used in the determination of ssm at high spatial resolutions in this study to accord with the trims lst dataset the ndvi products of both myd13c1 5 km and myd13a2 1 km were used in the disaggregation algorithm specifically myd13c1 was resampled using the nearest neighbor interpolation to a spatial resolution of 0 1 which was consistent with the era5 land data this study requires daily interval ndvi datasets whereas the ndvi products of modis have a temporal resolution of 16 days therefore spatially and temporally continuous ndvi for the period of 2006 2020 needs to be reconstructed using the savitzky golay s g filter method bian et al 2010 the ndvi products used in this study were obtained from the website at https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search 3 method this study used the ssm products and all weather lst data to generate a daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage fig 2 shows a flow chart for the generation of the daily 1 km ssm data in general this process can be divided into three steps i calibration ii disaggregation and correction and iii validation the following subsections describe these three steps in detail 3 1 calibration as a thermal property of soil soil thermal inertia reflects the ability of soil to prevent a change in its temperature i e the higher the water content of the soil the slower its temperature changes and the higher the thermal inertia ma et al 2013 several studies have confirmed the feasibility of upscaling or downscaling ssm using the thermal inertia theory qin et al 2013 fang et al 2013 liu et al 2021 for the ssm disaggregation a link between the coarse resolution ssm data and those at the fine spatial scale should first be established in the present study the day night lst difference was determined as the link in the disaggregation procedure to better describe the relationships between ssm and the day night lst difference two conditions were considered ndvi level and land cover type for different vegetation coverages distinct relationships were observed between day night lst differences and ssm conditions these relationships emerged because the changes in biomass would induce changes in lst thereby affecting ssm dynamics fang et al 2013 meanwhile numerous studies have already reported that different vegetation types exhibit a more profound effect on ssm wang et al 2009 yang et al 2020 this effect emerges mostly due to the different soil water holding capacities for various vegetation types in particular a forest is mostly tall with strong root systems and water absorption mainly originates from deep soils while grassland cropland and shrubland are all characterized by low canopy density and shallow root systems cropland differs significantly from grassland and shrubland in that the former can be frequently affected by anthropogenic activities barren is mostly concentrated in arid semi arid regions with relatively low vegetation coverage and ssm levels fig 1 shows that the dominant land cover types in china are grassland cropland barren forest and shrubland as the shrubland only accounts for 0 14 it was merged into grassland in this study primarily due to their similar characteristics such as relatively low canopy density and limited human interference ultimately four land cover types were considered in the development of the relationships between ssm and the day night lst difference i forest ii grassland iii cropland and iv barren for each land cover type the relationships between ssm and the day night lst difference were developed under different ndvi levels including i sparse vegetation coverage with ndvi under 0 3 ii medium vegetation coverage with ndvi between 0 3 and 0 6 and iii dense vegetation coverage with ndvi over 0 6 it is widely acknowledged that vegetation exerts a regulating effect on the temperature difference while various vegetation types land cover types and its different growth periods ndvi have different regulating effects in this study it is assumed that the moderating effect is consistent for the same land cover type at the same ndvi level following this assumption a linear relationship between day night lst differences and ssm is expressed in eq 1 based on the groups of land cover types and ndvi status over the entire calibration period 1 Î¸ 9km a i j Î´ l s t 9km b i j where Î¸ 9km and Î´ l s t 9km refer to ssm and day night lst differences respectively and a i j and b i j represent the coefficients of the i th land cover type forest grassland cropland and barren with the j th ndvi level low medium and dense the aim of the first step is to calibrate the coefficients a i j and b i j using the era5 land data 3 2 disaggregation and correction the previous section described how the linear relationships between day night lst differences and ssm were obtained the coefficients a i j and b i j were calibrated with era5 land data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 to further obtain ssm data with the fine spatial resolution of 1 km the developed linear relationships at the coarse spatial resolution of 0 1 were assumed to be feasible for all the 1 km pixels based on this assumption and the day night lst differences derived from modis lst data with the land cover types and ndvi levels were determined for every pixel the daily 1 km ssm was estimated using eq 2 with high spatial resolution data 2 Î¸ 1km a i j Î´ l s t modis 1km b i j where Î¸ 1km is the initial daily 1 km ssm obtained from the disaggregation Î´ l s t modis 1km represents modis day night lst differences a i j and b i j represents the coefficients obtained from eq 1 as ssm at the coarse pixel of 25 km may differ from the averaged value of the downscaled fine pixel of 1 km within a coarse pixel the correction value for each coarse pixel was defined as the difference between these two datasets 3 Î´ Î¸ Î¸ 25km 1 n i 1 n Î¸ 1km where Î´ Î¸ is the correction value for each cci or smops pixel Î¸ 25 km represents the ssm value for a cci or smops pixel and n refers to the number of 1 1 km modis pixels within a cci or smops pixel based on the correction value for the coarse pixel a simple strategy is to equally divide that of the coarse pixel to each modis pixel this is generally justifiable as no recognized rules currently exist to better allocate the coarse resolution ssm correction value to the pixels at fine scale the final corrected daily 1 km ssm can be written as follows 4 Î¸ 1km Î¸ 1km Î´ Î¸ where Î¸ 1 km and Î¸ 1 km are the corrected and initial daily 1 km ssm at respectively based on the corrected and initial ssm datasets the final daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage can be determined as follows 5 Î¸ Î¸ 1km Î» 1 c mask Î¸ 1km c mask where Î¸ is the final daily 1 km ssm cmask refers to the mask for the invalid pixels of cci or smops cmask is 1 if true and 0 otherwise finally the ground in situ measurements over the two regions with semi humid humid anhui province and semi arid arid heihe conditions were used to validate the corrected ssm at 1 km the statistical metrics used in the present study include the bias rmse and ubrmse which are expressed as follows 6 b i a s 1 m i 1 m x i y i 7 r m s e 1 m i 1 m x i y i 2 8 u b r m s e r m s e 2 b i a s 2 where m is the total number of ssm pairs of ground measurements and estimates and x i and y i are the estimated ssm and in situ ssm measurements respectively 4 results 4 1 initial ssm over the study area fig 3 shows the daily 1 km initial ssm obtained from eq 2 at fine spatial resolution on january 15th april 15th july 15th and october 15th which represent winter spring summer and autumn respectively in south china a relatively high ssm level can be observed in all the ssm data whereas a decreased ssm can be found in north china specifically all the data reveal the lowest ssm values over northwest china which is mainly attributed to barren the dominant land type in this region a scaling issue exists between pixel based ssm and in situ measurements which would prevent absolute agreement between the two time series an efficient method namely the cumulative distribution function cdf can effectively remove systematic differences between two scaled datasets brocca et al 2011 lacava et al 2012 through this method the estimated ssm is rescaled such that its cdf matches the cdf of the in situ ssm fig 4 shows the comparison of the initial ssm and in situ measurements during the study period in the semi humid humid region anhui and semi arid arid region heihe owing to the continuous in situ ground measurements over the heihe region the cdf can be applied for this area according to the results the overall rmse in anhui and heihe of 0 090 m3 m3 and 0 057 m3 m3 respectively can be found over the study period in particular it is clear that the initial ssm shows an overestimation with a bias of 0 054 m3 m3 in anhui compared with the in situ ssm the accuracy of the initial ssm was relatively low and the ubrmse of anhui and heihe were 0 071 m3 m3 and 0 057 m3 m3 respectively nevertheless the initial ssm can still be applied in practice such as by roughly monitoring drought when there is no available ssm 4 2 ssm corrected with the two blended products cci and smops have been verified to be reliable in terms of accuracy while a notable issue is the spatial coverage of the corrected ssm with cci and smops gruber et al 2019 yin et al 2020 quasi full spatial coverage of the smops can be found for almost all data periods whereas the cci reveals different gaps the reasons for the distinct discrepancy between the two blended ssm products include the different algorithms data sources and quality controls for producing the products wang et al 2021 fig 5 shows the spatial coverage rates of the cci and smops ssm products for each month in 2019 as for the cci an average spatial coverage rate of approximately 46 can be found for the entire year with a high spatial coverage rate of close to 80 being observed only in summer july august and september the spatial coverage rate in winter was the lowest at less than 20 indicating that almost no data suitable for practical application were available for this period in contrast smops exhibited a significantly enhanced spatial coverage throughout the year throughout the year 2019 the average spatial coverage rate was approximately 93 and almost all months except for january revealed a high spatial coverage rate of over 90 nevertheless further accuracy assessment is required before the determination of a preferred alternative in practice for the generation of the daily 1 km ssm fig 6 shows the original cci images and the Î´ Î¸ obtained using eq 3 on january 15th april 15th july 15th and october 15th it can be seen that the Î´ Î¸ between a cci pixel and the averaged ssm of the initial ssm within the cci pixel is approximately 0 m3 m3 which follows the normal distribution the average correction value of the cci is generally in the range of 0 010 0 023 m3 m3 with a standard deviation of approximately 0 060 m3 m3 taking the four typical days in fig 6 as an example pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 05 m3 m3 account for 60 61 55 and 63 of the total pixels furthermore pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 1 m3 m3 account for 88 90 85 and 92 of the total pixels all these statistics indicate that the Î´ Î¸ is generally reasonable to correct the initial ssm fig 7 shows the smops products and the corresponding Î´ Î¸ with the averaged ssm of the initial ssm in pixels for four typical days the average Î´ Î¸ for the smops was 0 008 m3 m3 and 0 023 m3 m3 moreover the standard deviation was approximately 0 060 m3 m3 which was similar to that of the cci similarly taking the four typical days in fig 7 as an example the pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 05 m3 m3 account for 44 56 47 and 59 of the total pixels furthermore the pixels with Î´ Î¸ between 0 1 m3 m3 account for 81 83 82 and 91 of the total pixels compared with cci it can be seen that the Î´ Î¸ corresponding to smops is generally larger perhaps because smops has a wider spatial coverage and a larger number of pixels involved in the correction 4 3 corrected ssm over the study area fig 8 shows the daily 1 km ssm corrected by cci and smops the spatial distribution of the coarse microwave based products and the corresponding fine spatial resolution ssm data were highly consistent across the entire study area moreover the overall trends of the two types of images were found to be consistent as well despite such agreement the ssm corrected by cci was lower than that of smops in northwest china whereas the former was slightly higher than the latter in northeastern china in the following sub sections the estimated daily 1 km ssm were evaluated using ground in situ measurements in semi humid humid and semi arid arid regions 4 3 1 evaluation of daily 1 km ssm over semi humid humid region in this study the ssm measurements collected from the 87 stations in anhui province were used to evaluate the estimated daily 1 km ssm over the semi humid humid region fig 9 shows the distribution of the in situ ssm measurements and the corrected ssm with the two blended products of cci and smops on the seven selected days in 2019 specifically the whiskers correspond to the distribution range of the minimum and maximum values of the ssm the boxes represent the quartiles at the 25 and 75 levels fig 9 clearly shows that i both higher averaged ssm values and wider ssm variation ranges were identified in the corrected ssm compared with those of the in situ measurements thus indicating an overestimation for the corrected ssm ii an even more overestimation of the corrected ssm with cci than that of smops was identified with respect to both the averaged ssm and variation ranges to further investigate the accuracy of the corrected ssm the statistical metrics of bias and rmse between the estimated daily 1 km ssm and the in situ measurement over the 87 stations for each of the seven selected days were obtained and plotted in fig 10 the results show fairly accurate rmse varying from 0 057 m3 m3 to 0 112 m3 m3 obtained for the corrected ssm with the smops in contrast the ssm obtained from cci showed a decreased accuracy where the rmse ranged from 0 079 m3 m3 to 0 134 m3 m3 moreover the corrected ssm with the cci and smops showed a significant overestimation with bias of 0 016 0 088 m3 m3 and 0 053 0 114 m3 m3 respectively however both the rmse and bias exhibited similar variations across the study period indicating that the rmse is probably caused by bias fig 11 shows a comparison of the final ssm and in situ measurements over 87 stations during the study period the corrected ssm with cci reveals greater overestimation with a bias of 0 089 m3 m3 compared to that of smops with a bias of 0 058 m3 m3 these significant overestimations can directly lead to an overall rmse of 0 105 m3 m3 and 0 081 m3 m3 for the two datasets nevertheless similar ubrmse values of approximately 0 056 m3 m3 and 0 057 m3 m3 can be obtained for the corrected ssm with cci and smops respectively which is close to the ubrmse requirement of 0 04 m3 m3 for ssm estimates in most practical applications 4 3 2 evaluation of daily 1 km ssm over the semi arid arid region in the present study ssm measurements collected at five stations from may to september 2019 in hiwater over the heihe river basin were used to evaluate the estimated daily 1 km ssm over the semi arid arid region because multiple stations appear in the modis pixels the averaged station measurements within a modis pixel were used to evaluate the corrected ssm fig 12 shows the distribution of the in situ ssm measurements and the corrected ssm with the two blended products of cci and smops in the two modis pixels in 2019 specifically the results show the distribution range in which the boxes represent the standard deviation of the in situ ssm or corrected ssm from the blended microwave products as shown in fig 12 i it is evident that a lower averaged ssm value can be observed in the corrected ssm than that in the in situ measurements indicating an underestimation for the corrected ssm ii the average value of the corrected ssm with smops is closer to the in situ measurements than that of the corrected ssm with cci to further investigate the accuracy of the corrected ssm the statistical metrics of bias and rmse between the daily 1 km corrected ssm and the in situ measurement from may to september for 135 days were obtained and plotted in fig 13 according to the results a fairly accurate average rmse of 0 061 m3 m3 was obtained for the corrected ssm with the smops in contrast the ssm corrected with the cci showed a decreased accuracy where the average rmse was 0 070 m3 m3 moreover the corrected ssm with smops and cci showed a significant underestimation with bias from 0 024 m3 m3 to 0 048 m3 m3 and from 0 036 m3 m3 to 0 062 m3 m3 respectively this is consistent with the conclusion obtained in anhui province indicating that the corrected ssm with smops was of superior quality fig 14 shows a comparison of the corrected ssm and in situ measurements of heihe for five stations from may to september after cdf matching the rmse and ubrmse of the corrected ssm with smops were 0 048 m3 m3 and 0 048 m3 m3 respectively the correction result of cci is similar to that of smops and its rmse and ubrmse are 0 047 m3 m3 and 0 047 m3 m3 respectively although the accuracies of the two datasets were comparable the trend of the ssm corrected with smops was more distinct 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with previous study the validations in semi arid arid and semi humid humid regions indicated that the corrected ssm with smops exhibited accuracy comparable with that of the corrected ssm with cci moreover as cci offered a high spatial coverage 80 only in summer it could not meet the practical application in other seasons while the average spatial coverage rate of smops was 93 in 2019 indicating a high spatial coverage rate of over 90 throughout the year overall the corrected ssm with smops can be considered as a better daily 1 km soil moisture with a quasi full spatial coverage dataset than that of cci table 1 shows a comparison of several methods for obtaining ssm at higher spatial resolution in recent years with respect to the original microwave products temporal spatial resolution study area and ubrmse the results demonstrated that most of the currently available methods can utilize ssm products with single sensors such as smap and amsr 2 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e generally extends the span however only a few methods use blended microwave based ssm products as the original data in the disaggregation procedure overall our method shows slightly better or comparable accuracy to previous methods the existing daily 1 km soil moisture dataset in china in 2019 was derived from the disaggregation of the amsr e amsr 2 product song et al 2022 by considering this ssm dataset as a reference to compare the estimated one from our study 40 000 sampling pixels were randomly selected over the study region in this process the slope of the selected sampling pixels was generally 10 to ensure the reliability of the assessment fig 15 shows the density scatter plot of the resultant 40 000 random pixels between the two ssm datasets as shown in the figure the density of pixels was the highest around the 1 1 line indicating that the ssm dataset obtained by our method with smops correction stands out with a high correlation against the reference dataset the ubrmse on january 15th which typically represents winter was close to 0 08 m3 m3 while in the other seasons ubrmses were 0 074 m3 m3 0 078 m3 m3 and 0 071 m3 m3 respectively all of which were slightly better than that of winter in summary the daily 1 km ssm corrected with smops was highly consistent with the reference ssm 5 2 limitations and future developments although this study showed high accuracy of the estimated ssm by comparison with the ground in situ measurements two primary limitations with respect to the further improvements of the proposed approach should be addressed the first is the obtaining of consistent lst dataset under all weather conditions the present study utilized the all weather lst data as the main auxiliary to obtain daily 1 km ssm at quasi full spatial coverage because of this the accuracy of all weather lst directly affected the estimated ssm although numerous approaches have been previously developed to obtain lst under cloudy pixels the lst filled using statistical or spatiotemporal interpolation methods arguably represents only an approximation of the theoretical cloud free lst therefore this result does not reflect an estimate of the actual cloudy lst thereby inevitably plaguing the accuracy of the reconstructed lst over cloudy pixels compared to clear sky pixels wu et al 2021 currently it is widely recognized that thermal based lst retrieval can reach relatively high accuracy 1 k over clear sky pixels for most of cases li et al 2013b hence it is of great interest to further improve the accuracy of lst estimates over cloudy pixels in future developments so as to enhance the obtaining of all weather lst and ssm at high spatial resolution to this end it is encouraged to develop more reliable passive microwave based lst retrieval and downscaling algorithms due to the capacity of penetrating through cloud and detecting surface radiation for the microwave missions namely it is expected to be a promising way to obtain all weather lst from the combined use of thermal and passive microwave measurements in future developments except for the issue of obtaining actual lst over cloudy pixels it is well recognized that satellites observe the earth with varying angles for pixels over a vast area like china even for a same image scene due to the directionality of lst the observed lst variation due to angular anisotropy can reach up to 15 k following a various of experiments lagouarde et al 2010 coll et al 2019 as a result this angular anisotropy can significantly decrease the spatial comparability of lst and subsequent lst based applications especially for ssm disaggregation using the integration of coarse satellite images and contained fine resolution observations to address this issue it is encouraged to obtain lst dataset with consistent observing angle e g nadir direction from normalizing lsts from different observation angels the other limitation is the development of relationships between day night lst and ssm over more refined vegetation patches the rationale behind the proposed approach is mostly attributed to the regulating effect of lst difference by vegetation although considerable accuracy can be obtained by the proposed approach it is generally assumed a same moderating effect for a given group of land cover type and ndvi status in the present study this assumption can largely decrease the difficulties for applying the approach in practice to further improve the method it is expected that more detailed crop type classifications or vegetation structure maps can be provided as auxiliary input based on these the relationship between day night lst and ssm can be developed on each crop type with similar ecosystem functions which is expected to be more refined than the present classification except for the primary limitations stated earlier several other issues including the different sensing depths of microwave missions and thermal signals as well as the comprehensive assessments of estimated ssm dataset should be also noted it is traditionally considered that microwave ssm products can reflect only the top layer with a depth of 5 cm while the lst difference can reflect the ssm status within deeper soil columns li et al 2021 ahmadi et al 2022 the main reasons for the different sensing depths can be generally attribute to the diverse abilities of penetration with different wavelengths and the disparate sensitivities of remotely sensed parameters to ssm status except for these it is also noteworthy that significant correlation of water content in different layers can be commonly found ghahremanloo et al 2018 li et al 2021 hence it is generally reasonable to evaluate satellite derived ssm dataset with measurements at top layer either 4 cm for hiwater stations or 10 cm for anhui sites nevertheless this may have affected the assessments of the estimated ssm in the present study moreover given the lack of ground in situ ssm measurements the preliminary evaluation of the estimated daily 1 km ssm dataset was mostly conducted over cropland under humid semi humidity and arid semi arid aridity conditions to better understand the accuracy of the proposed method more comprehensive evaluations of the estimated ssm over different land cover types and climate patterns should be investigated in future studies 6 conclusion this study developed a practical approach to estimate ssm at fine spatial resolution from the synergistic use of optical and microwave remote sensing observations this approach yielded a daily 1 km ssm dataset for 2019 over china based on the blended microwave ssm products cci and smops and reconstructed all weather lst data the evaluation was conducted for 2019 with the total of 92 ssm stations in the anhui province in eastern china and the heihe river basin in northwestern china the results revealed comparable accuracy of the estimated ssm with overall ubrmse of 0 05 m3 m3 for the cci and smops however smops offered significantly better spatial coverage than the cci products which makes it more optimized for obtaining the daily 1 km ssm with quasi full spatial coverage despite promising results several challenges including retrieval of actual lst over cloudy pixels qualification of the sensing depth from different wavelengths and more comprehensive evaluations under different landscapes should be considered in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9176,water scarcity is a critical constraint to the cultivation of medicinal crops establishing irrigation requirements for medicinal plants is crucial for the large scale production of crude drugs in china to evaluate the response of indigowoad root growth to water deficit wd under mulched drip irrigation and determine the optimal deficit irrigation mode for this medicinal crop in hexi corridor s desert oasis two wd levels were applied mild 65 75 fc field capacity and moderate 55 65 fc these treatments were implemented during the vegetative growth vg and fleshy root growth rg stages and sufficient water supply maintained during the other plant stages a total of seven combined treatments were imposed with sufficient water supply 85 75 fc as the control treatment from the 2 year long 2017 2018 field experiment s results 12 indicators of indigowoad root growth yield water consumption and quality attributes were evaluated via weighted fuzzy evaluation and a grey relation coupling model results indicated that with greater irrigation amounts throughout the plant growth period the fuzzy evaluation value of growth yield and water consumption indicators increased whereas their quality indicators decreased the fuzzy evaluation value of yield indicators of v1g0 mild wd treatment during vg was the highest 0 1582 0 1581 while that of growth indicators was also relatively high 0 1524 0 1532 fuzzy evaluation values of growth and yield indicators of v1g1 mild wd during vg and rg exceeded those of v1g2 mild wd during vg and moderate wd during rg but evaluation value of quality indicators was lower for v1g1 0 1457 0 1457 than v1g2 0 1494 15155 based on the weighted grey relation model the comprehensive score of v1g0 was deemed best therefore to ensure both yield and quality the v1g1 is recommended our results can provide a scientific basis for efficient water saving cultivation of indigowoad root in hexi oasis regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords comprehensive evaluation deficit irrigation fuzzy evaluation grey relational analysis indigowoad root data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction indigowoad root isatis tinctoria l is an annual herb species in the isatis genus of the cruciferae family atukuri et al 2021 guo et al 2020 its roots and leaves can be used to treat a variety of diseases thus it is found in most chinese medicine decoction pieces and patent medicines as well as ancient classic prescriptions for treating colds kang et al 2020 luo et al 2019 as a traditional chinese herbal medicine indigowoad root is commonly grown in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china and has become a medicinal food plant bing et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 but due to rising demand for its raw medicinal material wild populations of indigowoad root are being overexploited resulting in grave damage to those natural resources and the ecological environment of indigowoad root hence artificial cultivation of indigowoad root has become the key to alleviating the contradiction between its insufficient supply and excessive demand for it wang et al 2020a 2020b in minle county gansu province located in the central part of the hexi corridor more than 20 varieties of chinese herbs are mainly planted because of the region s unique climate and natural resources favoring the quality of indigowoad root whose cultivated area is extensive at 7333 33 ha earning it the moniker hometown of indigowoad root in china from the ministry of agriculture he et al 2022 yuan et al 2014 however this region is located in the inland northwestern part of china that is characterized frequent droughts and little rain leading to water resource shortages there further the groundwater level is decreasing yearly because of pumping via mechanical wells which threatens the ecological stability and resilience the contradiction between supply and demand for seasonal water is stark the utilization of irrigation water is generally low and water productivity is only 1 31 kg m 3 liu 2013 therefore an efficient water saving irrigation model for medicinal crops is urgently needed under mulched drip irrigation technology integrates drip irrigation and mulch planting techniques with the help of a drip irrigation pivot system to evenly irrigate the crops root zones via pipelines this saves water and suppresses salt increases temperature and moisture augments yield and income and it is considered the best application technology for conserving water and increasing efficiency in northwest china niu et al 2019 wen et al 2022 when crops are rehydrated after incurring moderate drought stress via deficit irrigation for example zhong et al 2019 their corresponding growth or physiological compensation effects are common which not only can save water resources but also stabilize and even increase yield as well as improving the quality of crop products kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2021a therefore the study of under mulched drip irrigation technology combined with the theory of deficit irrigation is of great significance for the efficient cultivation of medicinal plants in recent years more research on optimizing the yield and quality of traditional chinese medicinal materials such as indigowoad root through water deficit wd has been carried out liang et al 2016 liu et al 2011 wu et al 2016 xue et al 2018 the biological yield of indigowoad root s belowground is the key to determining the level of economic yield and its quality is determined by its content of active ingredients although imposing an appropriate wd can limit the growth and development of indigowoad root plants to a certain extent they could reduce the damage caused by water stress through their own physiological and biochemical regulation with compensating or super compensating effects discernible after rehydration thus ensuring the yield was not reduced while increasing the concentration of medicinal active ingredients kleinwÃ¤chter 2013 si et al 2014 wang et al 2021a recently zhou et al 2021 found that moderate or severe wd during the vegetative growth vg of indigowoad root significantly reduced the net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of leaves compared with the control but the economic yield under mild wd during this stage was significantly different from that of the control work by he and wang 2020 showed that all morphological indices of indigowoad root under drought stress were lower than a normal water supply and decreased significantly with increasing stress but the peroxidase pod activity of leaves continually increasing catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod activity initially decreased and then increased and the malondialdehyde mda content fluctuated but did not differ significantly implying strong drought resistance deng et al 2018 found that wd reduced the yield of indigowoad root but the yield under mild wd during the fleshy root maturity rm stage was the highest 7342 05 kg ha 1 whose overall quality was the best correspondingly water use efficiency under mild wd during the seedling growth sg stage was greatest 2 14 kg m 3 tan et al 2008 studied the effects of different moisture on the growth and main active ingredients of indigowoad root and showed that the yield and quality could be better when the field capacity was 45 70 evidently the efficient high quality cultivation of a chinese crude drug can be accomplished by reasonably regulating the water requirement during the growing period of indigowoad root meanwhile the problem of water s scarcity and its uneven spatio temporal distribution in desert oases due to global climate change is becoming increasingly prominent gurel and senel 2012 ye et al 2020 moreover studying the growth adaptation of medicinal crops under wd in arid areas is gaining widespread attention hu et al 2020 shammout et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 accordingly it is now necessary to carry out a targeted study of the optimal water regulation mode for cultivating indigowoad root in the hexi corridor s desert oasis the use of mathematical models is being gradually applied more to the field of water saving irrigation many scholars both in china and abroad have successively established analysis and evaluation models for different crop water saving irrigation schemes by applying the projection pursuit method wang et al 2012 principal component analysis method he et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 yavuz et al 2021 fuzzy evaluation wang et al 2021b xiu et al 2019 or the distance method between superior and inferior solutions lin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 qin et al 2021 all of which have their own characteristics and generated robust application effects in multi factor evaluations yet such studies typically rely on a single evaluation method there are differences in the perspective and bias of obtaining information and the disadvantages of large variation in the data making it difficult to find distribution patterns zhang et al 2021b in addition there is also the problem of the unassigned weighting of participation factors which directly affects the accuracy of the final evaluation results a model that couples fuzzy evaluation and grey relation can combine the affiliation degree of fuzzy value and the grey characteristics of the posture of grey relational analysis to carry out multi level evaluation which should lead to more objective and reasonable evaluation results and inferences the analysis and evaluation of crop deficit irrigation effects are mostly based on experimental observations e g water consumption yield and quality while relatively few studies that have investigated the subject have been reported using mathematical models especially for medicinal crops to this end to address the problems of too many variable indicator items an inconsistent determination of weights and complex measurements involved in deciding which wd mode to implement for indigowoad root under mulched drip irrigation this paper firstly adopted the fuzzy evaluation model to establish a single level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model 2nd level for the growth yield and stage water consumption and other attribute indicators to improve the results accuracy the expert survey method and coefficient of variation cv method were also used to determine the subjective and objective combination of weights of each evaluation indicator next the grey relation method was applied for the comprehensive evaluation at the 1st level based on the evaluation results at the 2nd level in this study we tested the hypothesis that crop productivity and quality are greatly improved under continuous wd applied to multiple stages of medicinal crop in oasis farming areas therefore our study had two objectives i to explore the effects of wd on growth yield water consumption and quality of indigowoad root plants according to single level fuzzy evaluation results with combination weights ii on this basis to identify the optimal deficit irrigation mode by establishing a weighted grey relation analysis gra evaluation model to assess different wd modes of indigowoad root under mulched drip irrigation thereby providing a reference for the efficient cultivation and techniques of medicinal crops in hexi oasis regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental region this experiment was conducted at the yimin irrigation experimental station 38 39 n 100 43 e altitude 1970 m in minle county zhangye city gansu province china fig 1 the site is located in the middle of the hexi corridor where a continental desert steppe climate prevails here the annual average temperature is 6 and the extreme maximum and minimum temperatures are 37 8 and 33 3 respectively annual average sunshine duration is 3000 h with a total of 105 d frost free days on average according to the last 20 years of meteorological data average annual precipitation in the site s area is ca 200 mm and the evaporation is 1900 mm with scarce precipitation and frequent droughts the test plot has light loam of moderate fertility with a ph value of 7 2 the maximum field capacity of the cultivated layer soil is 24 and the soil bulk density is 1 46 g cm 3 the soil organic matter content is 11 3 g kg 1 available phosphorus is 17 6 mg kg 1 available potassium is 192 0 mg kg 1 and alkali hydrolyzed nitrogen 52 4 mg kg 1 table 1 of the cultivated layer 0 20 cm the groundwater level in the test area is relatively deep 20 m hence effects of salinization may be ignored 2 2 experimental design the test species used was the medicinal variety northern indigowoad root 96 purity and sown in two years on 3 may 2017 and 9 may 2018 respectively their corresponding leaves were shoveled and roots dug on 11 october 2017 and 12 october 2018 fig 2 in this experiment the flatten culture mode was adopted and the whole film was covered to reduce the influence of rainfall manual sowing was done using a hole sowing tray on both sides of each drip irrigation pipe in double rows at a spacing of 6 8 cm 10 15 cm equivalent to a seeding rate of 35 0 kg ha 1 and a planting density of 800 000 plants ha 1 one week before sowing the test plot was mechanically tilled 20 30 cm deep any weeds present were removed manually and potassium sulfate compound fertilizer 4500 6000 kg ha 1 was applied once as base fertilizer the test plot s area was 40 m2 10 m 4 m the drip irrigation pipe was controlled by the plot branching method with irrigation controlled by a gate valve and water meter accuracy 0 001 m3 installed at the entrance of each branch pipe the 1 2 m deep plastic sheets were pre buried between the plots to prevent the lateral leakage between the adjacent plots this experiment was a single factor randomized complete block design according to physiological and growth characteristics of the local indigowoad root plants four growing stages are distinguishable 1 seedling growth sg mid may to early june 2 vegetative growth vg mid june to late july 3 fleshy root growth rg early august to early september 4 fleshy root maturity rm mid september to mid october in which the sg and rm were maintained with sufficient water supply and the vg and rg irrigated with different degrees of wd a total of seven water regulation treatments were set up for which an adequate water supply served as the control throughout the growing period and each treatment was replicated three times the specific experimental design is presented in table 2 relevant studies have shown that indigowoad root plants are capable of strong drought tolerance for which a soil moisture content of 70 80 is ideal du et al 2005 because the study region in northwest china is located inland it is characterized by drought high evaporation and low rainfall accordingly a soil moisture content of 75 85 is considered sufficient water supply 65 75 is a mild wd and 55 65 is a moderate wd the experiment s upper and lower wd limits of water regulation are thus more consistent with actual regional conditions the irrigation method implemented was drip irrigation under plastic film the drip irrigation pipe spacing was 60 cm the dripper was a labyrinth channel the inner diameter was 16 mm the dripper spacing was 30 cm the average flow rate of the dripper was 2 0 l h 1 and the anti blockage ability was strong irrigation volume was regulated by the water meter at the hub soil moisture was regulated in the 0 60 cm soil layer by measuring it every 7 days when it fell close to or below the design lower limit irrigation was carried out immediately whose volume was determined according to the experiment s upper limit the specific irrigation times and volumes are shown in fig 4 2 3 test items and calculation methods 2 3 1 meteorological data the automatic weather station at the test site recorded basic meteorological data such as rainfall temperature wind speed relative air humidity and air pressure every 30 min in each growing period of indigowoad root total rainfall during the entire reproductive period of indigowoad root was 186 6 mm in 2017 and 196 5 mm in 2018 and the effective rainfall 5 mm was 101 2 mm in 2017 and 126 0 mm in 2018 average temperatures in 2017 and 2018 were 14 8 and 7 9 respectively with maximum minimum temperatures of 27 4 25 8 2017 and 0 6 6 5 2018 respectively fig 3 2 3 2 growth indicators after indigowoad root entered the rm stage 15 plants similar in size were marked in each plot and their individual height h measured with a steel tape measure accuracy of 0 1 cm at the end of the rm the labeled plants were destructively sampled for each their main root length l was measured with a steel tape measure and their leaf area measured by the weighing method bai et al 2005 leaf area index lai was equal to the product of leaf area per plant m2 and the number of plants per unit of land area plants compared to the area per unit of land m2 2 3 3 water consumption indicators this experiment belongs to the study of crop irrigation system in arid areas the water balance method was used to calculate the water consumption of the indigowoad root to do this the main root water absorption layer of this crop was used as the planned soil wet layer when irrigation was applied and the water storage within this soil layer maintained within the predetermined range of the experiment s design after implanting the treatments the standard drying method was used every 7 days to measure the soil moisture content within 80 cm profile in six layers 0 10 m sampling every 10 cm 20 80 cm sampling every 20 cm for this sampling points were located at the midpoint of the line connecting two randomly selected plants in each plot whose mean values obtained to determine the amount of irrigation water because the root system of indigowoad root is chiefly distributed in the 0 50 cm soil layer the mean value of moisture in the 0 60 cm soil layer was taken as the planned wetting layer soil moisture the calculation of soil moisture consumption by the crop was based on the soil moisture change in the 0 80 cm profile calculation of water consumption during a given growth stage of indigowoad root greaves and wang 2017 kang et al 2002 1 et w i p k c where et is the water consumption mm w is the change in soil water storage in the planned wet layer between the beginning and end of a certain stage and positive means decrease i is the amount of irrigation water during the stage mm p k and c are respectively the precipitation upward flux from groundwater and deep seepage during the stage mm the experimental site is an arid area whose groundwater depth is 20 m and there was no deep seepage because the drip irrigation was applied according to soil texture and sampling data therefore k and c were set to zero values 2 3 4 yield indicators yield y measured by the actual harvest from individual plots the mean of three replicates was used as the yield value for each treatment dry matter of single root dw this was determined by the drying method at the end of rm five plants similar in size were excavated from each plot and taken to the laboratory for cleaning the roots were separated with scissors and the fresh weight of each organ weighed and recorded on a balance then each part was put into a paper bag and promptly put into an oven that had been preheated to 105 60 min later the temperature was reduced to 85 after 10 h the root samples were removed weighed and recorded and the mean value of five plants taken as the final result 2 3 5 quality indicators the contents of indigo dl indirubin dyh and goitrin gyc were determined by high performance liquid chromatography lc 10atvp tokyo japan a detailed description of the determination methods followed can be found in npc 2015 2 4 construction of single level fuzzy evaluation model a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is a sub module derived from fuzzy mathematics theory which can provide an overall evaluation of objects affected by multiple factors because in actual practice or settings the evaluation of a thing object often involves several influencing factors or evaluation indicators an evaluation based on fuzzy mathematical methods is a very effective decision making method these specific steps given below were followed fu 2006 1 determine the factor domain of the evaluation object i e p evaluation indicators 2 u u 1 u 2 u p for the growth indicators of indigowoad root u 1 u p denoted h lai and l respectively and p 3 for yield u 1 u p denoted yield indicators respectively and p 2 for water consumption u 1 u p denoted water consumption indicators during each growth stage respectively and p 4 for quality u 1 u p denoted each quality indicators respectively and p 3 2 determine the comment set 3 v v 1 v 2 v m where v 1 v 2 v m are the different moisture regulation deficit treatments and m 7 3 determine the weight of each factor in general the role played by each factor of the factor set in the comprehensive evaluation is different hence it is necessary to analyze and determine the weight

the cv were used to determine the combination weight of attribute indicator 4 establish a single factor evaluation matrix according to the factor domain and evaluation set of the evaluation object a

evaluation category v j when the evaluation is carried out according to the i th evaluation indicator x i whose size represents the membership degree of the sample before determining the degree of

model gra is a branch of gray system theory which measures the degree of relation between factors based on the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between factors overcoming the limitations of traditional statistical techniques liu et al 2013 the basic process of modeling the evaluation in irrigation systems based on gra consists of these six steps 1 determine the decision matrix x i j suppose the set of decisions to be made is a a 1 a 2 a n the indicator set of each plan is v v 1 v 2 v m and the attribute value of scheme a i to evaluation indicator v j is given by x ij x ij i 1 2 n

determine the normalization matrix of attribute values z n m z i j n m first the mean value of each indicator is derived and then each element of these indicators is divided by its mean value as shown

determining the weight of each attribute indicator the weighting directly affects the decision outcome to incorporate decision makers preference when evaluating an attribute indicator and strive to reduce its subjective arbitrariness the weighting of each attribute indicator should unify subjective and objective aspects and then we can gain complementary advantages thereby imbuing decision making results with more truth stability and reliability in the process of fuzzy evaluation of individual attribute indicator this paper adopted the integrated weighting method i e the expert survey method was used to calculate the subjective weight of each indicator while the objective weight was calculated by the coefficient of variation method then the combination weight per indicator was obtained based on a multiplicative synthesis normalization the evaluation results have high accuracy the subjective weighting sw that relies on expert survey method involves experts in related fields to subjectively judge the importance of each indicator based on their own experience and knowledge after comprehensively analyzing the connotation and indication levels reflected by various indicators

3 0 2 and a4 0 3 0 4 0 3 for objective weighting method ow the cv was used to determine the indicator weight by calculating the degree of difference between the measured data of each indicator to do this formulas 15 and 16 below were used 15 cv jk Ïƒ jk x jk 16 w jk cv jk k 1 n j cv jk where w jk is the weight of the jk indicator cv jk is the cv of the j k indicator Ïƒ jk is the standard deviation of the jk indicator and x jk is the average value of the jk indicator the calculated results are in table 3 combination weighting method cw is a comprehensive integration weighting method based on a multiplication synthesis normalization it was needed to directly multiply the indicator weight obtained by subjective and objective weighting methods using equal preference this was normalized to obtain the comprehensive weight of each indicator using formula 17 the calculated results are in table 3 17 w k w sk w jk k 1 p w sk w jk 3 1 2 evaluation of growth and yield indicators the fuzzy evaluation method was used to evaluate the growth and yield indicators of indigowoad root the experiment measured data was normalized and assigned corresponding weights to obtain the evaluation results of each indicator as seen from table 4 standardized results for h lai l dw and y for the v1g0 were all at high levels being 0 1547 0 1486 0 1532 0 1597 and 0 1575 in 2017 and likewise 0 1517 0 1537 0 1537 0 1597 and 0 1573 in 2018 respectively while under v2g2 the corresponding value were all relatively lower 0 1312 0 1334 0 1313 0 1298 and 0 1280 in 2017 and 0 1315 0 1313 0 1291 0 1297 and 0 1285 in 2018 respectively the h lai l and y values of v1g0 v1g1 and v1g2 were greater than those of corresponding v2g0 v2g1 and v2g2 among them the continuous mild wd treatment v1g1 was higher than the moderate wd treatment v2g2 in terms of single level evaluation values the growth evaluation values gi of ck were the largest in 2017 and 2018 being respectively 0 1532 and 0 1537 followed by those for v1g0 at 0 1524 and 1532 respectively whereas the gi of v2g1 was the smallest 0 1313 and 0 1302 respectively the yield evaluation value yi of v1g0 was the largest in 2017 and 2018 being 0 1582 and 0 1581 respectively followed by the ck at 0 1540 and 1530 respectively whereas the yi of v2g2 was the smallest 0 1286 and 0 1289 respectively under the same wd level during the rg the gi and yi under the mild wd treatment during the vg surpassed those of the moderate wd treatment v1g0 v2g0 v1g1 v2g1 v1g2 v2g2 while the gi and yi of the water treatment under the same wd level during the vg also had similar pattern v1g1 v1g2 v2g0 v2g1 but the gi and yi of the treatments under moderate wd during the vg and the mild or moderate wd during the rg were similar v2g1 v2g2 further as fig 5 shows the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of growth and yield indicators of indigowoad root increased with higher irrigation amount during the entire growing period 3 1 3 evaluation of water consumption indicators the fuzzy evaluation method was used to evaluate the water consumption indices of indigowoad root and the water consumption data for each stage was standardized and weighted to obtain the evaluation value per indicator of each year table 5 as evinced by table 5 the comprehensive evaluation results of water consumption indicators in two consecutive growing seasons 2017 and 2018 showed that the evaluation values of v1g0 were the highest 0 1509 and 0 1496 respectively followed by v2g2 0 1461 and 0 1450 respectively and the lowest were the ck 0 1332 and 0 1340 respectively hence the water consumption of ck was greatest during the entire growing period in this experiment we maintained sufficient water supply during the sg and rm stages and applied different degrees of wd treatments for the vg and rg stages the evaluation values of moderate wd during the vg and mild wd treatment during the rg were less than that of moderate wd treatment v2g1 v2g2 in both vg and rg however the evaluation values of both vg and rg under mild wd were greater than those of vg under mild wd and rg under moderate wd v1g1 v1g2 meanwhile the evaluation value of the v1g2 was smaller than that of the v2g1 and the v1g1 was also smaller than the v2g2 from the perspective of single stage wd the evaluation values of moderate wd treatments during the vg were all lower than those of mild wd treatments i e v2g0 v1g0 and v2g1 v1g1 in addition as illustrated in fig 6 the fuzzy integrated evaluation value of water consumption indicators of indigowoad root decreased as the irrigation amount increased during the entire growing period 3 1 4 evaluation of quality indicators the fuzzy evaluation method was also employed to evaluate the quality indicators of indigowoad root for which the comprehensive evaluation results of each indicator were obtained after standardizing the measured data table 6 from table 6 it is evident that for treatments ck v1g1 and v2g2 the measured values of each quality indicator of indigowoad root decreased significantly with an increasing irrigation amount when omitting the level of wd imposed the standardized results of wd impact on the quality indicators of indigowoad root showed that the quality of indigowoad increased with the magnitude of wd v1g2 v1g1 v1g0 v2g2 v2g1 v2g0 in terms of the single stage wd the quality under mild wd treatment during the vg was slightly higher than that of moderate wd treatment during the same stage v1g0 v2g0 v1g1 v2g1 v1g2 v2g2 the mild wd treatment during the rg was slightly higher than that of adequate water supply treatment during the same stage v1g1 v1g0 v2g1 v2g0 from the fuzzy evaluation of quality indicators evidently the evaluation values of treatments consisting of mild wd during the vg and mild or moderate wd during the rg were higher in 2017 and 2018 highest for v1g2 at 0 1494 and 0 1515 respectively followed by v1g1 at 0 1457 in both years while the v2g0 was the smallest at 0 137 in both years in addition as evidenced by fig 7 the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of the quality indicators of indigowoad root increased as the irrigation amount decreased during the entire growing period 3 1 5 analysis of single level fuzzy evaluation results in summary considered across the treatments gi was ranked as ck v1g0 v1g1 v2g0 v1g2 v2g1 v2g2 in 2017 and 2018 the yi was ranked as v1g0 v1g1 ck v2g0 v1g2 v2g1 v2g2 in both years the water consumption was ranked as v1g0 v2g2 v1g1 v2g1 v1g2 v2g0 ck in both years in terms of quality its ranking was v1g2 v1g1 v2g1 v2g2 ck v1g0 v2g0 in both years these results revealed a differential response of indicators to the water treatments for example the yield of adequate water supply ck was higher but its water consumption and quality were lower under a continuous mild or moderate wd treatment during vg and rg v2g2 and v1g1 the v2g2 significantly reduced water consumption and improved quality but the yield was lowest while v1g1 consumed more water than v2g1 and its yield and quality were relatively higher for the combined treatment of vg and rg with different wd levels v1g0 v1g2 v2g0 and v2g1 v1g0 outperformed v2g0 but v1g2 was better than v2g1 comparing tables 4 5 and 6 although results were generally consistent with the actual measurement results as noted above the response pattern to water regulation and degree of each evaluation indicator were inconsistent hence considering only the impact of a certain aspect of wd on the indicators for a single evaluation the optimal deficit irrigation mode cannot be reliably determined the comprehensiveness was also lacking thus a multi layered comprehensive evaluation model was needed 3 2 comprehensive evaluation of indigowoad root deficit irrigation mode based on gra gra uses the grey relation to describe the strength size and order of the relationship between factors this method overcomes shortcomings caused by the use of conventional mathematical and traditional statistical methods for systematic analysis moreover it is equally applicable to the frequency number of samples or their occurrence presence vs absence requiring fewer calculations and being easier to implement deng 1986 in our study the fuzzy evaluation results of the 2nd level single attribute indicators were used as the evaluation index and gra was introduced to construct a multi level comprehensive evaluation model the individual evaluation results of growth yield water consumption and quality attribute indicators were used as the evaluation indicators to carry out a gra based comprehensive evaluation specifically seven evaluation treatments four attribute indicators and the data of the evaluation indicators can be reorganized and presented as a matrix x x i j 7 4 according to the nature of the evaluation indicator correlation coefficient calculation matrices of different deficit irrigation schemes were obtained by formula 11 then the weight of the corresponding index may be calculated from formula 12 these results are conveyed in table 7 in table 8 are the comprehensive evaluation scores and ranking result of weighted gra of indigowoad root of each treatment in 2017 and 2018 the larger the value of its comprehensive evaluation score s i the better the comprehensive benefit of that treatment different deficit irrigation treatments were sorted according to their normalized size s i evidently the final results of the overall evaluation scores were generally consistent across the two growing seasons the ranking weighted gra scores in 2017 was in descending order v1g0 v1g1 ck v2g0 v1g2 v2g2 and v2g1 and similarly v1g0 v1g1 ck v1g2 v2g0 v2g1 and v2g2 in 2018 the score for ck was 0 1448 in 2017 and 0 1450 in 2018 v1g0 had the highest scores at 0 1502 and 0 1498 respectively followed those for v1g1 whereas v2g1 had the lowest scores 0 1370 and 0 1366 respectively it may be inferred that v1g0 is the optimal mode of moisture regulation based on the analysis and evaluation results from two years the comprehensive evaluation value showed a downward trend with a longer duration or severity of wd if only the quality of indigowoad root is of interest we can use the deficit irrigation model v1g2 with mild wd during the vg and moderate wd during the rg yet if yield is of paramount concern we can use the deficit irrigation model v1g0 with mild wd during the vg which is consistent with the observed yield results however if we want to ensure both yield and quality the deficit irrigation model v1g1 with mild wd during both the vg and rg should be applied 4 discussion 4 1 single level fuzzy integrated evaluation when plants are subjected to drought stress their internal physiological metabolism changes leading to changes in growth status as well ma et al 2018 mahdid et al 2011 michelena and boyer 1982 the deficit irrigation has an essential effect on the growth of indigowoad root wang et al 2017 in this experiment except for treatment v1g0 with mild wd at the vg all the wd treatments inhibited the above ground growth of indigowoad root h and lai were reduced to different degrees and the degree of effect increased with the increase of the magnitude and duration of the wd related studies flynn et al 2021 wang et al 2020 have shown that timely and moderate wd has a significant promoting effect on crop root growth this study showed that mild wd treatment v1g0 and v1g1 at the vg could increase the primary root length which was due to the fact that crop roots were still growing downward during this period and proper drought stress caused roots grow down to obtain sufficient water thus improving its drought resistance ability li et al 2009 however moderate wd v1g2 and v2g2 during the rg of indigowoad root was not conducive to the growth of primary root because root cells were in the rapid proliferation phase during this growth stage and the aggravation of soil wd at this time would inhibit cell division resulting in slow root growth and impeding water absorption thus affecting the synthesis of assimilates and leading to a significant reduction in root length and root biomass liang et al 2016 fuzzy evaluation is a way of processing fuzzy evaluation objects via precise digital means to give a relatively scientific reasonable and practical quantitative evaluation for vague information li 2019 here our fuzzy evaluation of the growth and yield indicators of indigowoad root showed that the gi of ck was the largest while that of v2g1 was the smallest while yi was the largest for v1g0 and the smallest for v2g2 further the gi and yi of indigowoad root increased with a greater irrigation amount during the entire growing period these results are consistent with the evaluation findings of gong et al 2017 for the growth indices of greenhouse grown tomato under wd irrigation the fuzzy evaluation value of water consumption indicators of indigowoad root showed that the v1g0 was the highest and its water consumption should be the least but the least was treatment v2g2 a likely explanation is that the v1g0 plants consumed the least amount of water during the rm stage while the remaining treatments had compensating and even overcompensating effects due to rehydration hence water consumption was significantly higher than that of the v1g0 while the evaluation values of water consumption indicators were lower for v2g1 than v2g2 but those of v1g1 was greater than v2g2 the plausible reason for this finding is related to the amount of stage water consumption mainly because the water consumption under moderate wd during the rg was relatively lower than that under mild wd whereas the water consumption during the rm remained similar further the evaluation value of v2g0 water consumption was smaller than v1g0 s for wd treatments in the same growth stage perhaps due to the fact that during vg although the water consumption performance of indigowoad root plants was inhibited by a certain degree of water stress there was an overcompensation effect after the restoration of water supply at later stage this would have in turn affected the total water consumption of the crop during the entire growing period with respect to crop quality we found that its fuzzy based evaluation value increased with less of an irrigation amount during the growing period for which the v1g2 and v1g1 were relatively higher similar findings were reported by wang et al 2022 this may be because the rg is a pivotal stage for root growth and development within the tolerable degree of water stress although the normal photosynthesis and respiration of plants will be affected to some extent water stress can stimulate signal transduction pathways in medicinal plants and induce the formation of key enzymes in the secondary metabolic synthesis pathways in this way the arising metabolites that accumulate in the plant may get transformed into corresponding secondary metabolites which can also accumulate over time thus increasing the tissue concentration of effective ingredients in the medicinal material gao and liang 2004 huang and guo 2007 su et al 2005 4 2 multi level grey relation integrated evaluation conducting a comprehensive evaluation entails establishing an evaluation index system for the research object a certain method or model is then used to analyze the collected data and make an overall quantitative judgment on the things being evaluated jia et al 2019 in this study based on the single level fuzzy evaluation the gra was introduced to make a comprehensive evaluation of the wd effect upon indigowoad root so that the final evaluation results were accurate and reliable firstly the 11 specific indicators belonging to the four indigowoad root attributes its growth yield water consumption and quality were used as the 2nd layer the cv method and the expert survey method are then used to determine the sw and ow finally the subjective and objective unified weights were obtained a single level fuzzy evaluation model was constructed through which we found that the gi was greatest in ck the yi was largest in v1g0 the stage water consumption evaluation value peaked in v2g2 and the quality value was highest in v1g2 this pattern was similar to findings of preferential selection of drought stress regulation indices for summer maize reported by he et al 2019 that is the response of each indicator to water regulation irrigation treatment differed because the information conveyed by a single index was incomprehensive featuring overlap and non substitutability among indicators evidently when evaluating the biological effects of deficit irrigation upon indigowoad root different categories of indicators should be taken into account to ensure the scientific rigor of that evaluation therefore the single level fuzzy evaluation results of growth yield water consumption and other attribute indicators were used here as evaluation indicators for inclusion in the gra model again for the 1st level comprehensive evaluation the resulting comprehensive score of v1g0 was the highest indicating that the highest irrigation benefit was realized under the mild wd treatment during the vg a conclusion matching that of zhou 2020a namely that crop yields are better under mild wd conditions 4 3 determination of the weights of participating indicators weight refers to the importance of a specific indicator in the system of indicators and is a numerical value that measures the overall effect of each unit s indicator value tian et al 2019 it is extremely important to properly determine the weight vectors of evaluation factors in the comprehensive evaluation process yu et al 2021 currently there are a variety of methods available for determining attribute weights in this paper an expert survey method was adopted to determine the sw of the 2nd layer the weight of each indicator was based on the judgment of nine experts in the field of water saving irrigation although wang et al 2015 and gong et al 2017 used this method to determine the weights of related evaluation indicators for summer corn of furrow irrigation and tomatoes of drip irrigation the evaluation results were nonetheless robust still to avoid a certain degree of inherent bias in the evaluation results due to subjective arbitrariness we used the cv method to determine the ow based on the original data finally the sw and ow were integrated to derive the final weights which not only overcame the shortcomings of a single weight but also ensured that the evaluation results were both reliable and practical zhu et al 2019 for the 1st layer the gra model was coupled on the basis of the evaluation results of the 2nd layer and the respective weights of decision indicators were obtained according to the grey relational coefficients which ensured the robustness of the model admittedly however a shortcoming to this was that the weights were susceptible to different subjective values of the discriminant coefficients in the model guo 2018 in short this study investigated indigowoad root a sought after yet threatened medicinal crop as the trial object clearly the evaluation results of various indicators agreed well with the empirically measured values it can be seen that the fuzzy grey relational analysis coupling model not only achieved the optimization and screening of a deficit irrigation scheme to a certain extent but it also provided the possibility for the rational objective selection of irrigation systems for a medicinal crop we should add that according to the four types of indicators growth yield quality and water consumption the optimal deficit irrigation mode was comprehensively determined this can take into account several economic social and ecological aspects and be used to effectively guide the water management of indigowoad root in hexi corridor s desert oasis among them yield and quality are direct indicators reflecting tangible economic benefits earlier li 2007 had shown that irrigation regulation of indigowoad root plants can significantly increase their net output value by 16 83 when the yield was maximal later in their study of drip irrigation regulated water deficit in oasis potato crops li et al 2021b demonstrated that when both the yield and quality of potato chunks were the highest the ensuring profit was also highest water consumption is clearly an ecological factor of which irrigation water accounts for a relatively large proportion while deficit irrigation can effectively mitigate irrigation waste and ineffective losses of water thereby contributing to alleviating the supply vs demand contradiction of regional available water resources du et al 2015 zhou et al 2020b 5 conclusions based on the experimental data of the medicinal crop indigowoad root in hexi oasis a multi level comprehensive evaluation model was constructed to make a reasonable evaluation of the deficit irrigation benefit for indigowoad root and to determine its optimal irrigation mode the results of single level comprehensive evaluation showed that the fuzzy based evaluation values of growth and yield indicators of v1g1 under mild wd during the vg stage and rg stage were higher than those of v1g2 under mild wd during vg stage and moderate wd during rg stage for two consecutive growing seasons yet the evaluation value for quality indicators of v1g1 0 1457 0 1457 was lower than those of v1g2 0 1494 15155 in addition the evaluation values for water consumption indicators of v1g0 under the mild wd during the vg stage in both growing seasons surpassed those of ck and evaluation value of yield indicators was the highest in v1g0 as well 0 1589 and 0 1588 the ranking of the multi level comprehensive evaluation scores of indigowoad root by the weighted gra model revealed that the best mode was v1g0 i e mild wd treatment during the vg stage was superior for the comprehensive promotion of various indicators of indigowoad root in summary the benefits of the medicinal crop deficit irrigation can be comprehensively evaluated by coupling fuzzy analysis with grey correlation in the proposed multi level model the choice of water saving irrigation mode can also depend on the actual demand in the hexi corridor s desert oasis if only the crop yield is considered the deficit irrigation mode v1g0 can be adopted which is consistent with the actual measured values of yield if only quality is considered the deficit irrigation mode v1g2 can be used if both yield and quality are to be ensured the deficit irrigation mode v1g1 can be applied however the evaluation model also had some limitations for example its weights were based on the grey relational degree and not determined by the actual measurement data via a corresponding weighting method nor were costs benefits single square water efficiency farmers preferences or other economic and social evaluation indicators incorporated into the comprehensive evaluation system and this likely had a certain impact on the evaluation results looking ahead we plan to consider expanding the evaluation model used in this paper given the above caveats in order to provide a sound corresponding scientific reference for the decision making or optimization of this method more broadly in the

9176,water scarcity is a critical constraint to the cultivation of medicinal crops establishing irrigation requirements for medicinal plants is crucial for the large scale production of crude drugs in china to evaluate the response of indigowoad root growth to water deficit wd under mulched drip irrigation and determine the optimal deficit irrigation mode for this medicinal crop in hexi corridor s desert oasis two wd levels were applied mild 65 75 fc field capacity and moderate 55 65 fc these treatments were implemented during the vegetative growth vg and fleshy root growth rg stages and sufficient water supply maintained during the other plant stages a total of seven combined treatments were imposed with sufficient water supply 85 75 fc as the control treatment from the 2 year long 2017 2018 field experiment s results 12 indicators of indigowoad root growth yield water consumption and quality attributes were evaluated via weighted fuzzy evaluation and a grey relation coupling model results indicated that with greater irrigation amounts throughout the plant growth period the fuzzy evaluation value of growth yield and water consumption indicators increased whereas their quality indicators decreased the fuzzy evaluation value of yield indicators of v1g0 mild wd treatment during vg was the highest 0 1582 0 1581 while that of growth indicators was also relatively high 0 1524 0 1532 fuzzy evaluation values of growth and yield indicators of v1g1 mild wd during vg and rg exceeded those of v1g2 mild wd during vg and moderate wd during rg but evaluation value of quality indicators was lower for v1g1 0 1457 0 1457 than v1g2 0 1494 15155 based on the weighted grey relation model the comprehensive score of v1g0 was deemed best therefore to ensure both yield and quality the v1g1 is recommended our results can provide a scientific basis for efficient water saving cultivation of indigowoad root in hexi oasis regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords comprehensive evaluation deficit irrigation fuzzy evaluation grey relational analysis indigowoad root data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction indigowoad root isatis tinctoria l is an annual herb species in the isatis genus of the cruciferae family atukuri et al 2021 guo et al 2020 its roots and leaves can be used to treat a variety of diseases thus it is found in most chinese medicine decoction pieces and patent medicines as well as ancient classic prescriptions for treating colds kang et al 2020 luo et al 2019 as a traditional chinese herbal medicine indigowoad root is commonly grown in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china and has become a medicinal food plant bing et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 but due to rising demand for its raw medicinal material wild populations of indigowoad root are being overexploited resulting in grave damage to those natural resources and the ecological environment of indigowoad root hence artificial cultivation of indigowoad root has become the key to alleviating the contradiction between its insufficient supply and excessive demand for it wang et al 2020a 2020b in minle county gansu province located in the central part of the hexi corridor more than 20 varieties of chinese herbs are mainly planted because of the region s unique climate and natural resources favoring the quality of indigowoad root whose cultivated area is extensive at 7333 33 ha earning it the moniker hometown of indigowoad root in china from the ministry of agriculture he et al 2022 yuan et al 2014 however this region is located in the inland northwestern part of china that is characterized frequent droughts and little rain leading to water resource shortages there further the groundwater level is decreasing yearly because of pumping via mechanical wells which threatens the ecological stability and resilience the contradiction between supply and demand for seasonal water is stark the utilization of irrigation water is generally low and water productivity is only 1 31 kg m 3 liu 2013 therefore an efficient water saving irrigation model for medicinal crops is urgently needed under mulched drip irrigation technology integrates drip irrigation and mulch planting techniques with the help of a drip irrigation pivot system to evenly irrigate the crops root zones via pipelines this saves water and suppresses salt increases temperature and moisture augments yield and income and it is considered the best application technology for conserving water and increasing efficiency in northwest china niu et al 2019 wen et al 2022 when crops are rehydrated after incurring moderate drought stress via deficit irrigation for example zhong et al 2019 their corresponding growth or physiological compensation effects are common which not only can save water resources but also stabilize and even increase yield as well as improving the quality of crop products kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 li et al 2021a zhang et al 2021a therefore the study of under mulched drip irrigation technology combined with the theory of deficit irrigation is of great significance for the efficient cultivation of medicinal plants in recent years more research on optimizing the yield and quality of traditional chinese medicinal materials such as indigowoad root through water deficit wd has been carried out liang et al 2016 liu et al 2011 wu et al 2016 xue et al 2018 the biological yield of indigowoad root s belowground is the key to determining the level of economic yield and its quality is determined by its content of active ingredients although imposing an appropriate wd can limit the growth and development of indigowoad root plants to a certain extent they could reduce the damage caused by water stress through their own physiological and biochemical regulation with compensating or super compensating effects discernible after rehydration thus ensuring the yield was not reduced while increasing the concentration of medicinal active ingredients kleinwÃ¤chter 2013 si et al 2014 wang et al 2021a recently zhou et al 2021 found that moderate or severe wd during the vegetative growth vg of indigowoad root significantly reduced the net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of leaves compared with the control but the economic yield under mild wd during this stage was significantly different from that of the control work by he and wang 2020 showed that all morphological indices of indigowoad root under drought stress were lower than a normal water supply and decreased significantly with increasing stress but the peroxidase pod activity of leaves continually increasing catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod activity initially decreased and then increased and the malondialdehyde mda content fluctuated but did not differ significantly implying strong drought resistance deng et al 2018 found that wd reduced the yield of indigowoad root but the yield under mild wd during the fleshy root maturity rm stage was the highest 7342 05 kg ha 1 whose overall quality was the best correspondingly water use efficiency under mild wd during the seedling growth sg stage was greatest 2 14 kg m 3 tan et al 2008 studied the effects of different moisture on the growth and main active ingredients of indigowoad root and showed that the yield and quality could be better when the field capacity was 45 70 evidently the efficient high quality cultivation of a chinese crude drug can be accomplished by reasonably regulating the water requirement during the growing period of indigowoad root meanwhile the problem of water s scarcity and its uneven spatio temporal distribution in desert oases due to global climate change is becoming increasingly prominent gurel and senel 2012 ye et al 2020 moreover studying the growth adaptation of medicinal crops under wd in arid areas is gaining widespread attention hu et al 2020 shammout et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 accordingly it is now necessary to carry out a targeted study of the optimal water regulation mode for cultivating indigowoad root in the hexi corridor s desert oasis the use of mathematical models is being gradually applied more to the field of water saving irrigation many scholars both in china and abroad have successively established analysis and evaluation models for different crop water saving irrigation schemes by applying the projection pursuit method wang et al 2012 principal component analysis method he et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 yavuz et al 2021 fuzzy evaluation wang et al 2021b xiu et al 2019 or the distance method between superior and inferior solutions lin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 qin et al 2021 all of which have their own characteristics and generated robust application effects in multi factor evaluations yet such studies typically rely on a single evaluation method there are differences in the perspective and bias of obtaining information and the disadvantages of large variation in the data making it difficult to find distribution patterns zhang et al 2021b in addition there is also the problem of the unassigned weighting of participation factors which directly affects the accuracy of the final evaluation results a model that couples fuzzy evaluation and grey relation can combine the affiliation degree of fuzzy value and the grey characteristics of the posture of grey relational analysis to carry out multi level evaluation which should lead to more objective and reasonable evaluation results and inferences the analysis and evaluation of crop deficit irrigation effects are mostly based on experimental observations e g water consumption yield and quality while relatively few studies that have investigated the subject have been reported using mathematical models especially for medicinal crops to this end to address the problems of too many variable indicator items an inconsistent determination of weights and complex measurements involved in deciding which wd mode to implement for indigowoad root under mulched drip irrigation this paper firstly adopted the fuzzy evaluation model to establish a single level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model 2nd level for the growth yield and stage water consumption and other attribute indicators to improve the results accuracy the expert survey method and coefficient of variation cv method were also used to determine the subjective and objective combination of weights of each evaluation indicator next the grey relation method was applied for the comprehensive evaluation at the 1st level based on the evaluation results at the 2nd level in this study we tested the hypothesis that crop productivity and quality are greatly improved under continuous wd applied to multiple stages of medicinal crop in oasis farming areas therefore our study had two objectives i to explore the effects of wd on growth yield water consumption and quality of indigowoad root plants according to single level fuzzy evaluation results with combination weights ii on this basis to identify the optimal deficit irrigation mode by establishing a weighted grey relation analysis gra evaluation model to assess different wd modes of indigowoad root under mulched drip irrigation thereby providing a reference for the efficient cultivation and techniques of medicinal crops in hexi oasis regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental region this experiment was conducted at the yimin irrigation experimental station 38 39 n 100 43 e altitude 1970 m in minle county zhangye city

effects of salinization may be ignored 2 2 experimental design the test species used was the medicinal variety northern indigowoad root 96 purity and sown in two years on 3 may 2017 and 9 may 2018 respectively their corresponding leaves were shoveled and roots dug on 11 october 2017 and 12 october 2018 fig 2 in this experiment the flatten culture mode was adopted and the whole film was covered to reduce the influence of rainfall manual sowing was done using a hole sowing tray on both sides of each drip irrigation pipe in double rows at a spacing of 6 8 cm 10 15 cm equivalent to a seeding rate of 35 0 kg ha 1 and a planting density of 800 000 plants ha 1 one week before sowing the test plot was mechanically tilled 20 30 cm deep any weeds present were removed manually and potassium sulfate compound fertilizer 4500 6000 kg ha 1 was applied once as base fertilizer the test plot s area was 40 m2 10 m 4 m the drip irrigation pipe was controlled by the plot branching method with irrigation controlled by a gate valve and water meter accuracy 0 001 m3 installed at the entrance of each branch pipe the 1 2 m deep plastic sheets were pre buried between the plots to prevent the lateral leakage between the adjacent plots this experiment was a single factor randomized complete block design according to physiological and growth characteristics of the local indigowoad root plants four growing stages are distinguishable 1 seedling growth sg mid may to early june 2 vegetative growth vg mid june to late july 3 fleshy root growth rg early august to early september 4 fleshy root maturity rm mid september to mid october in which the sg and rm were maintained with sufficient water supply and the vg and rg irrigated with different degrees of wd a total of seven water regulation treatments were set up for which an adequate water supply served as the control throughout the growing period and each treatment was replicated three times the specific experimental design is presented in table 2 relevant studies have shown that indigowoad root plants are capable of strong drought tolerance for which a soil moisture content of 70 80 is ideal du et al 2005 because the study region in northwest china is located inland it is characterized by drought high evaporation and low rainfall accordingly a soil moisture content of 75 85 is considered sufficient water supply 65 75 is a mild wd and 55 65 is a moderate wd the experiment s upper and lower wd limits of water regulation are thus more consistent with actual regional conditions the irrigation method implemented was drip irrigation under plastic film the drip irrigation pipe spacing was 60 cm the dripper was a labyrinth channel the inner diameter was 16 mm the dripper spacing was 30 cm the average flow rate of the dripper was 2 0 l h 1 and the anti blockage ability was strong irrigation volume was regulated by the water meter at the hub soil moisture was regulated in the 0 60 cm soil layer by measuring it every 7 days when it fell close to or below the design lower limit irrigation was carried out immediately whose volume was determined according to the experiment s upper limit the specific irrigation times and volumes are shown in fig 4 2 3 test items and calculation methods 2 3 1 meteorological data the automatic weather station at the test site recorded basic meteorological data such as rainfall temperature wind speed relative air humidity and air pressure every 30 min in each growing period of indigowoad root total rainfall during the entire reproductive period of indigowoad root was 186 6 mm in 2017 and 196 5 mm in 2018 and the effective rainfall 5 mm was 101 2 mm in 2017 and 126 0 mm in 2018 average temperatures in 2017 and 2018 were 14 8 and 7 9 respectively with maximum minimum temperatures of 27 4 25 8 2017 and 0 6 6 5 2018 respectively fig 3 2 3 2 growth indicators after indigowoad root entered the rm stage 15 plants similar in size were marked in each plot and their individual height h measured with a steel tape measure accuracy of 0 1 cm at the end of the rm the labeled plants were destructively sampled for each their main root length l was measured with a steel tape measure and their leaf area measured by the weighing method bai et al 2005 leaf area index lai was equal to the product of leaf area per plant m2 and the number of plants per unit of land area plants compared to the area per unit of land m2 2 3 3 water consumption indicators this experiment belongs to the study of crop irrigation system in arid areas the water balance method was used to calculate the water consumption of the indigowoad root to do this the main root water absorption layer of this crop was used as the planned soil wet layer when irrigation was applied and the water storage within this soil layer maintained within the predetermined range of the experiment s design after implanting the treatments the standard drying method was used every 7 days to measure the soil moisture content within 80 cm profile in six layers 0 10 m sampling every 10 cm 20 80 cm sampling every 20 cm for this sampling points were located at the midpoint of the line connecting two randomly selected plants in each plot whose mean values obtained to determine the amount of irrigation water because the root system of indigowoad root is chiefly distributed in the 0 50 cm soil layer the mean value of moisture in the 0 60 cm soil layer was taken as the planned wetting layer soil moisture the calculation of soil moisture consumption by the crop was based on the soil moisture change in the 0 80 cm profile calculation of water consumption during a given growth stage of indigowoad root greaves and wang 2017 kang et al 2002 1 et w i p k c where et is the water consumption mm w is the change in soil water storage in the planned wet layer between the beginning and end of a certain stage and positive means decrease i is the amount of irrigation water during the stage mm p k and c are respectively the precipitation upward flux from groundwater and deep seepage during the stage mm the experimental site is an arid area whose groundwater depth is 20 m and there was no deep seepage because the drip irrigation was applied according to soil texture and sampling data therefore k and c were set to zero values 2 3 4 yield indicators yield y measured by the actual harvest from individual plots the mean of three replicates was used as the yield value for each treatment dry matter of single root dw this was determined by the drying method at the end of rm five plants similar in size were excavated from each plot and taken to the laboratory for cleaning the roots were separated with scissors and the fresh weight of each organ weighed and recorded on a balance then each part was put into a paper bag and promptly put into an oven that had been preheated to 105 60 min later the temperature was reduced to 85 after 10 h the root samples were removed weighed and recorded and the mean value of five plants taken as the final result 2 3 5 quality indicators the contents of indigo dl indirubin dyh and goitrin gyc were determined by high performance liquid chromatography lc 10atvp tokyo japan a detailed description of the determination methods followed can be found in npc 2015 2 4 construction of single level fuzzy evaluation model a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is a sub module derived from fuzzy mathematics theory which can provide an overall evaluation of objects affected by multiple factors because in actual practice or settings the evaluation of a thing object often involves several influencing factors or evaluation indicators an evaluation based on fuzzy mathematical methods is a very effective decision making method these specific steps given

model gra is a branch of gray system theory which measures the degree of relation between factors based on the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between factors overcoming the limitations of traditional statistical techniques liu et al 2013 the basic process of modeling the evaluation in irrigation systems based on gra consists of these six steps 1 determine the decision matrix x i j

determining the weight of each attribute indicator the weighting directly affects the decision outcome to incorporate decision makers preference when evaluating an attribute indicator and strive to reduce its subjective arbitrariness the weighting of each attribute indicator should unify subjective and objective aspects and then we can gain complementary advantages thereby imbuing decision making results with more truth stability and reliability in the process of fuzzy evaluation of individual attribute indicator this paper adopted the integrated weighting method i e the expert survey method was used to calculate the subjective weight of each indicator while the objective weight was calculated by the coefficient of variation method then the combination weight per indicator was obtained based on a multiplicative synthesis normalization the evaluation results have high accuracy the subjective weighting sw that relies on expert survey method involves experts in related fields to subjectively judge the importance of each indicator based on their own experience and knowledge after comprehensively analyzing the connotation and indication levels reflected by various indicators this paper selected the growth h lai and l yield y and dw and water consumption at different growth stages and quality dl dyh gyc for a total of four attributes and 11 indicators in table 3 are the weight vectors for each attribute indicator assigned by nine experts and technicians who have been engaged in water saving irrigation experiments for a long time a1 0 3 0 3 0 4 a2 0 7 0 3 a3 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 2 and a4 0 3 0 4 0 3 for objective weighting method ow the cv was used to determine the indicator weight by calculating the degree of difference between the measured data of each indicator to do this formulas 15 and 16 below were used 15 cv jk Ïƒ jk x jk 16 w jk cv jk k 1 n j cv jk where w jk is the weight of the jk indicator cv jk is the cv of the j k indicator Ïƒ jk is the standard deviation of the jk indicator and x jk is the average value of the jk indicator the calculated results are in table 3 combination weighting method cw is a comprehensive integration weighting method based on a multiplication synthesis normalization it was needed to directly multiply the indicator weight obtained by subjective and objective weighting methods using equal preference this was normalized to obtain the comprehensive weight of each indicator using formula 17 the calculated results are in table 3 17 w k w sk w jk k 1 p w sk w jk 3 1 2 evaluation of growth and yield indicators the fuzzy evaluation method was used to evaluate the growth and yield indicators of indigowoad root the experiment measured data was normalized and assigned corresponding weights to obtain the evaluation results of each indicator as seen from table 4 standardized results for h lai l dw and y for the v1g0 were all at high levels being 0 1547 0 1486 0 1532 0 1597 and 0 1575 in 2017 and likewise 0 1517 0 1537 0 1537 0 1597 and 0 1573 in 2018 respectively while under v2g2 the corresponding value were all relatively lower 0 1312 0 1334 0 1313 0 1298 and 0 1280 in 2017 and 0 1315 0 1313 0 1291 0 1297 and 0 1285 in 2018 respectively the h lai l and y values of v1g0 v1g1 and v1g2 were greater than those of corresponding v2g0 v2g1 and v2g2 among them the continuous mild wd treatment v1g1 was higher than the moderate wd treatment v2g2 in terms of single level evaluation values the growth evaluation values gi of ck were the largest in 2017 and 2018 being respectively 0 1532 and 0 1537 followed by those for v1g0 at 0 1524 and 1532 respectively whereas the gi of v2g1 was the smallest 0 1313 and 0 1302 respectively the yield evaluation value yi of v1g0 was the largest in 2017 and 2018 being 0 1582 and 0 1581 respectively followed by the ck at 0 1540 and 1530 respectively whereas the yi of v2g2 was the smallest 0 1286 and 0 1289 respectively under the same wd level during the rg the gi and yi under the mild wd treatment during the vg surpassed those of the moderate wd treatment v1g0 v2g0 v1g1 v2g1 v1g2 v2g2 while the gi and yi of the water treatment under the same wd level during the vg also had similar pattern v1g1 v1g2 v2g0 v2g1 but the gi and yi of the treatments under moderate wd during the vg and the mild or moderate wd during the rg were similar v2g1 v2g2 further as fig 5 shows the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of growth and yield indicators of indigowoad root increased with higher irrigation amount during the entire growing period 3 1 3 evaluation of water consumption indicators the fuzzy evaluation method was used to evaluate the water consumption indices of indigowoad root and the water consumption data for each stage was standardized and weighted to obtain the evaluation value per indicator of each year table 5 as evinced by table 5 the comprehensive evaluation results of water consumption indicators in two consecutive growing seasons 2017 and 2018 showed that the evaluation values of v1g0 were the highest 0 1509 and 0 1496 respectively followed by v2g2 0 1461 and 0 1450 respectively and the lowest were the ck 0 1332 and 0 1340 respectively hence the water consumption of ck was greatest during the entire growing period in this experiment we maintained sufficient water supply during the sg and rm stages and applied different degrees of wd treatments for the vg and rg stages the evaluation values of moderate wd during the vg and mild wd treatment during the rg were less than that of moderate wd treatment v2g1 v2g2 in both vg and rg however the evaluation values of both vg and rg under mild wd were greater than those of vg under mild wd and rg under moderate wd v1g1 v1g2 meanwhile the evaluation value of the v1g2 was smaller than that of the v2g1 and the v1g1 was also smaller than the v2g2 from the perspective of single stage wd the evaluation values of moderate wd treatments during the vg were all lower than those of mild wd treatments i e v2g0 v1g0 and v2g1 v1g1 in addition as illustrated in fig 6 the fuzzy integrated evaluation value of water consumption indicators of indigowoad root decreased as the irrigation amount increased during the entire growing period 3 1 4 evaluation of quality indicators the fuzzy evaluation method was also employed to evaluate the quality indicators of indigowoad root for which the comprehensive evaluation results of each indicator were obtained after standardizing the measured data table 6 from table 6 it is evident that for treatments ck v1g1 and v2g2 the measured values of each quality indicator of indigowoad root decreased significantly with an increasing irrigation amount when omitting the level of wd imposed the standardized results of wd impact on the quality indicators of indigowoad root showed that the quality of indigowoad increased with the magnitude of wd v1g2 v1g1 v1g0 v2g2 v2g1 v2g0 in terms of the single stage wd the quality under mild wd treatment during the vg was slightly higher than that of moderate wd treatment during the same stage v1g0 v2g0 v1g1 v2g1 v1g2 v2g2 the mild wd treatment during the rg was slightly higher than that of adequate water supply treatment during the same stage v1g1 v1g0 v2g1 v2g0 from the fuzzy evaluation of quality indicators evidently the evaluation values of treatments consisting of mild wd during the vg and mild or moderate wd during the rg were higher in 2017 and 2018 highest for v1g2 at 0 1494 and 0 1515 respectively followed by v1g1 at 0 1457 in both years while the v2g0 was the smallest at 0 137 in both years in addition as evidenced by fig 7 the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of the quality indicators of indigowoad root increased as the irrigation amount decreased during the entire growing period 3 1 5 analysis of single level fuzzy evaluation results in summary considered across the treatments gi was ranked as ck v1g0 v1g1 v2g0 v1g2 v2g1 v2g2 in 2017 and 2018 the yi was ranked as v1g0 v1g1 ck v2g0 v1g2 v2g1 v2g2 in both years the water consumption was ranked as v1g0 v2g2 v1g1 v2g1 v1g2 v2g0 ck in both years in terms of quality its ranking was v1g2 v1g1 v2g1 v2g2 ck v1g0 v2g0 in both years these results revealed a differential response of indicators to the water treatments for example the yield of adequate water supply ck was higher but its water consumption and quality were lower under a continuous mild or moderate wd treatment during vg and rg v2g2 and v1g1 the v2g2 significantly reduced water consumption and improved quality but the yield was lowest while v1g1 consumed more water than v2g1 and its yield and quality were relatively higher for the combined treatment of vg and rg with different wd levels v1g0 v1g2 v2g0 and v2g1 v1g0 outperformed v2g0 but v1g2 was better than v2g1 comparing tables 4 5 and 6 although results were generally consistent with the actual measurement results as noted above the response pattern to water regulation and degree of each evaluation indicator were inconsistent hence considering only the impact of a certain aspect of wd on the indicators for a single evaluation the optimal deficit irrigation mode cannot be reliably determined the comprehensiveness was also lacking thus a multi layered comprehensive evaluation model was needed 3 2 comprehensive evaluation of indigowoad root deficit irrigation mode based on gra gra uses the grey relation to describe the strength size and order of the relationship between factors this method overcomes shortcomings caused by the use of conventional mathematical and traditional statistical methods for systematic analysis moreover it is equally applicable to the frequency number of samples or their occurrence presence vs absence requiring fewer calculations and being easier to implement deng 1986 in our study the fuzzy evaluation results of the 2nd level single attribute indicators were used as the evaluation index and gra was introduced to construct a multi level comprehensive evaluation model the individual evaluation results of growth yield water consumption and quality attribute indicators were used as the evaluation indicators to carry out a gra based comprehensive evaluation specifically seven evaluation treatments four attribute indicators and the data of the evaluation indicators can be reorganized and presented as a matrix x x i j 7 4 according to the nature of the evaluation indicator correlation coefficient calculation matrices of different deficit irrigation schemes were obtained by formula 11 then the weight of the corresponding index may be calculated from formula 12 these results are conveyed in table 7 in table 8 are the comprehensive evaluation scores and ranking result of weighted gra of indigowoad root of each treatment in 2017 and 2018 the larger the value of its comprehensive evaluation score s i the better the comprehensive benefit of that treatment different deficit irrigation treatments were sorted according to their normalized size s i evidently the final results of the overall evaluation scores were generally consistent across the two growing seasons the ranking weighted gra scores in 2017 was in descending order v1g0 v1g1 ck v2g0 v1g2 v2g2 and v2g1 and similarly v1g0 v1g1 ck v1g2 v2g0 v2g1 and v2g2 in 2018 the score for ck was 0 1448 in 2017 and 0 1450 in 2018 v1g0 had the highest scores at 0 1502 and 0 1498 respectively followed those for v1g1 whereas v2g1 had the lowest scores 0 1370 and 0 1366 respectively it may be inferred that v1g0 is the optimal mode of moisture regulation based on the analysis and evaluation results from two years the comprehensive evaluation value showed a downward trend with a longer duration or severity of wd if only the quality of indigowoad root is of interest we can use the deficit irrigation model v1g2 with mild wd during the vg and moderate wd during the rg yet if yield is of paramount concern we can use the deficit irrigation model v1g0 with mild wd during the vg which is consistent with the observed yield results however if we want to ensure both yield and quality the deficit irrigation model v1g1 with mild wd during both the vg and rg should be applied 4 discussion 4 1 single level fuzzy integrated evaluation when plants are subjected to drought stress their internal physiological metabolism changes leading to changes in growth status as well ma et al 2018 mahdid et al 2011 michelena and boyer 1982 the deficit irrigation has an essential effect on the growth of indigowoad root wang et al 2017 in this experiment except for treatment v1g0 with mild wd at the vg all the wd treatments inhibited the above ground growth of indigowoad root h and lai were reduced to different degrees and the degree of effect increased with the increase of the magnitude and duration of the wd related studies flynn et al 2021 wang et al 2020 have shown that timely and moderate wd has a significant promoting effect on crop root growth this study showed that mild wd treatment v1g0 and v1g1 at the vg could increase the primary root length which was due to the fact that crop roots were still growing downward during this period and proper drought stress caused roots grow down to obtain sufficient water thus improving its drought resistance ability li et al 2009 however moderate wd v1g2 and v2g2 during the rg of indigowoad root was not conducive to the growth of primary root because root cells were in the rapid proliferation phase during this growth stage and the aggravation of soil wd at this time would inhibit cell division resulting in slow root growth and impeding water absorption thus affecting the synthesis of assimilates and leading to a significant reduction in root length and root biomass liang et al 2016 fuzzy evaluation is a way of processing fuzzy evaluation objects via precise digital means to give a relatively scientific reasonable and practical quantitative evaluation for vague information li 2019 here our fuzzy evaluation of the growth and yield indicators of indigowoad root showed that the gi of ck was the largest while that of v2g1 was the smallest while yi was the largest for v1g0 and the smallest for v2g2 further the gi and yi of indigowoad root increased with a greater irrigation amount during the entire growing period these results are consistent with the evaluation findings of gong et al 2017 for the growth indices of greenhouse grown tomato under wd irrigation the fuzzy evaluation value of water consumption indicators of indigowoad root showed that the v1g0 was the highest and its water consumption should be the least but the least was treatment v2g2 a likely explanation is that the v1g0 plants consumed the least amount of water during the rm stage while the remaining treatments had compensating and even overcompensating effects due to rehydration hence water consumption was significantly higher than that of the v1g0 while the evaluation values of water consumption indicators were lower for v2g1 than v2g2 but those of v1g1 was greater than v2g2 the plausible reason for this finding is related to the amount of stage water consumption mainly because the water consumption under moderate wd during the rg was relatively lower than that under mild wd whereas the water consumption during the rm remained similar further the evaluation value of v2g0 water consumption was smaller than v1g0 s for wd treatments in the same growth stage perhaps due to the fact that during vg although the water consumption performance of indigowoad root plants was inhibited by a certain degree of water stress there was an overcompensation effect after the restoration of water supply at later stage this would have in turn affected the total water consumption of the crop during the entire growing period with respect to crop quality we found that its fuzzy based evaluation value increased with less of an irrigation amount during the growing period for which the v1g2 and v1g1 were relatively higher similar findings were reported by wang et al 2022 this may be because the rg is a pivotal stage for root growth and development within the tolerable degree of water stress although the normal photosynthesis and respiration of plants will be affected to some extent water stress can stimulate signal transduction pathways in medicinal plants and induce the formation of key enzymes in the secondary metabolic synthesis pathways in this way the arising metabolites that accumulate in the plant may get transformed into corresponding secondary metabolites which can also accumulate over time thus increasing the tissue concentration of effective ingredients in the medicinal material gao and liang 2004 huang and guo 2007 su et al 2005 4 2 multi level grey relation integrated evaluation conducting a comprehensive evaluation entails establishing an evaluation index system for the research object a certain method or model is then used to analyze the collected data and make an overall quantitative judgment on the things being evaluated jia et al 2019 in this study based on the single level fuzzy evaluation the gra was introduced to make a comprehensive evaluation of the wd effect upon indigowoad root so that the final evaluation results were accurate and reliable firstly the 11 specific indicators belonging to the four indigowoad root attributes its growth yield water consumption and quality were used as the 2nd layer the cv method and the expert survey method are then used to determine the sw and ow finally the subjective and objective unified weights were obtained a single level fuzzy evaluation model was constructed through which we found that the gi was greatest in ck the yi was largest in v1g0 the stage water consumption evaluation value peaked in v2g2 and the quality value was highest in v1g2 this pattern was similar to findings of preferential selection of drought stress regulation indices for summer maize reported by he et al 2019 that is the response of each indicator to water regulation irrigation treatment differed because the information conveyed by a single index was incomprehensive featuring overlap and non substitutability among indicators evidently when evaluating the biological effects of deficit irrigation upon indigowoad root different categories of indicators should be taken into account to ensure the scientific rigor of that evaluation therefore the single level fuzzy evaluation results of growth yield water consumption and other attribute indicators were used here as evaluation indicators for inclusion in the gra model again for the 1st level comprehensive evaluation the resulting comprehensive score of v1g0 was the highest indicating that the highest irrigation benefit was realized under the mild wd treatment during the vg a conclusion matching that of zhou 2020a namely that crop yields are better under mild wd conditions 4 3 determination of the weights of participating indicators weight refers to the importance of a specific indicator in the system of indicators and is a numerical value that measures the overall effect of each unit s indicator value tian et al 2019 it is extremely important to properly determine the weight vectors of evaluation factors in the comprehensive evaluation process yu et al 2021 currently there are a variety of methods available for determining attribute weights in this paper an expert survey method was adopted to determine the sw of the 2nd layer the weight of each indicator was based on the judgment of nine experts in the field of water saving irrigation although wang et al 2015 and gong et al 2017 used this method to determine the weights of related evaluation indicators for summer corn of furrow irrigation and tomatoes of drip irrigation the evaluation results were nonetheless robust still to avoid a certain degree of inherent bias in the evaluation results due to subjective arbitrariness we used the cv method to determine the ow based on the original data finally the sw and ow were integrated to derive the final weights which not only overcame the shortcomings of a single weight but also ensured that the evaluation results were both reliable and practical zhu et al 2019 for the 1st layer the gra model was coupled on the basis of the evaluation results of the 2nd layer and the respective weights of decision indicators were obtained according to the grey relational coefficients which ensured the robustness of the model admittedly however a shortcoming to this was that the weights were susceptible to different subjective values of the discriminant coefficients in the model guo 2018 in short this study investigated indigowoad root a sought after yet threatened medicinal crop as the trial object clearly the evaluation results of various indicators agreed well with the empirically measured values it can be seen that the fuzzy grey relational analysis coupling model not only achieved the optimization and screening of a deficit irrigation scheme to a certain extent but it also provided the possibility for the rational objective selection of irrigation systems for a medicinal crop we should add that according to the four types of indicators growth yield quality and water consumption the optimal deficit irrigation mode was comprehensively determined this can take into account several economic social and ecological aspects and be used to effectively guide the water management of indigowoad root in hexi corridor s desert oasis among them yield and quality are direct indicators reflecting tangible economic benefits earlier li 2007 had shown that irrigation regulation of indigowoad root plants can significantly increase their net output value by 16 83 when the yield was maximal later in their study of drip irrigation regulated water deficit in oasis potato crops li et al 2021b demonstrated that when both the yield and quality of potato chunks were the highest the ensuring profit was also highest water consumption is clearly an ecological factor of which irrigation water accounts for a relatively large proportion while deficit irrigation can effectively mitigate irrigation waste and ineffective losses of water thereby contributing to alleviating the supply vs demand contradiction of regional available water resources du et al 2015 zhou et al 2020b 5 conclusions based on the experimental data of the medicinal crop indigowoad root in hexi oasis a multi level comprehensive evaluation model was constructed to make a reasonable evaluation of the deficit irrigation benefit for indigowoad root and to determine its optimal irrigation mode the results of single level comprehensive evaluation showed that the fuzzy based evaluation values of growth and yield indicators of v1g1 under mild wd during the vg stage and rg stage were higher than those of v1g2 under mild wd during vg stage and moderate wd during rg stage for two consecutive growing seasons yet the evaluation value for quality indicators of v1g1 0 1457 0 1457 was lower than those of v1g2 0 1494 15155 in addition the evaluation values for water consumption indicators of v1g0 under the mild wd during the vg stage in both growing seasons surpassed those of ck and evaluation value of yield indicators was the highest in v1g0 as well 0 1589 and 0 1588 the ranking of the multi level comprehensive evaluation scores of indigowoad root by the weighted gra model revealed that the best mode was v1g0 i e mild wd treatment during the vg stage was superior for the comprehensive promotion of various indicators of indigowoad root in summary the benefits of the medicinal crop deficit irrigation can be comprehensively evaluated by coupling fuzzy analysis with grey correlation in the proposed multi level model the choice of water saving irrigation mode can also depend on the actual demand in the hexi corridor s desert oasis if only the crop yield is considered the deficit irrigation mode v1g0 can be adopted which is consistent with the actual measured values of yield if only quality is considered the deficit irrigation mode v1g2 can be used if both yield and quality are to be ensured the deficit irrigation mode v1g1 can be applied however the evaluation model also had some limitations for example its weights were based on the grey relational degree and not determined by the actual measurement data via a corresponding weighting method nor were costs benefits single square water efficiency farmers preferences or other economic and social evaluation indicators incorporated into the comprehensive evaluation system and this likely had a certain impact on the evaluation results looking ahead we plan to consider expanding the evaluation model used in this paper given the above caveats in order to provide a sound corresponding scientific reference for the decision making or optimization of this method more broadly in the

9177,soil moisture affects the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat triticum aestivum l by regulating the spatial distribution of roots therefore appropriate supplemental irrigation si schemes are essential to achieve high yield and high wue of wheat by constructing a reasonable root structure in this study field experiments were conducted the north china plain ncp from 2018 to 2020 based on the soil moisture management at sowing on a consistent basis four si regimes were set up no irrigation after seedling emergence w0 si at jointing w1 si at jointing and anthesis w2 and si at regreening jointing and anthesis w3 the results showed that although the grain yield of wheat increased with the si frequency the wue decreased with increasing si amount si at jointing and anthesis significantly increased wue without reducing or slightly reducing the grain yield the grain yield and wue in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than those of the corresponding treatments in 2019 2020 and the yield of bainong 4199 was higher than that of zhoumai 18 the grain yield and wue in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than those of the corresponding treatments in 2019 2020 the root length density rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased with increasing si frequency but the proportion of rld in the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased the average rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer and grain yield of bainong 4199 were significantly greater than that of zhoumai 18 correlation analysis showed that the grain yield and wue was positively correlated with the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer and reached a very significant level with rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer between rows w2 and w3 in terms of root vigor and the grain filling rate 30 days after anthesis were significantly higher than w1 and w0 and also increased the contribution of post anthesis dry matter to grain resulting in an increase in grain weight these results demonstrated that si at jointing and anthesis could optimize the spatial distribution of roots maintain higher root activity and filling rate at the late stage increase accumulation and translocation of post anthesis dry matter and finally improve the yield and wue therefore we propose that bainong 4199 was the preferred cultivars for this experiment under sufficient soil moisture conditions before sowing si at jointing and anthesis is the optimal irrigation scheme for wheat on the ncp keywords irrigation scheme root spatial distribution dry matter translocation grain yield water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is a major crop on the north china plain ncp the average annual precipitation in this area is 573 4 mm but only 150 mm occurs during the winter wheat growing season and the potential evapotranspiration et of winter wheat is about 300 450 mm fang et al 2010 as the water consumed during the growth period of winter wheat is much higher than the precipitation in the same period supplemental irrigation si during the growth period is required for achieving a high grain yield xu et al 2016 liu et al 2021 xue et al 2021 however multiple irrigation applications during the wheat growing season with a total irrigation amount of 300 400 mm have significantly reduced the groundwater table and the water use efficiency wue is low zaccaria et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 moreover most of the farmland on the ncp uses border irrigation therefore formulating irrigation measures are key to alleviate the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources and improve the yield and wue of wheat the roots of winter wheat are important organs that absorb water and nutrients the root characteristics and its distribution in soil layers affect grain yield and water use of wheat the formation and spatial distribution of root morphology are regulated by the water supply of different soil layers wang et al 2014 man et al 2016 pedersen et al 2010 introduced a root system form parameter to describe the distribution of root length vertically and horizontally in the soil profile when simulating the dynamics of different root densities but the effects of the root vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics on yield and wue were not further studied zhang et al 2015 used root distribution characteristic parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of soil moisture feng et al 2017 believed that root vertical distribution is important to improve the wue and grain yield of wheat therefore the spatial distribution of wheat roots in soil determines the ability to absorb and utilize water and nutrients directly affects the aboveground organogenesis the distribution of assimilates and the final yield li et al 2019 feng et al 2017 the improvement of water use efficiency mainly depends on the development of roots yadav et al 2009 white and kirkegaard 2010 soil water availability to crops depends on the root distribution water uptake ability thorup kristensen and boogaard 1999 jacobsen et al 2009 in production si is used to regulate the soil water content and then affect the temporal and spatial distribution of wheat roots feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 moderate water deficit and soil drought before jointing can increase the root length density rld and promote the root system to penetrate into the deep soil wang et al 2014 feng et al 2017 believed that rehydration after moderate drought stress before jointing could increase the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer and improve the root distribution in the 0 100 cm soil layer soil water deficit from jointing to booting reduced the number of secondary roots and the root dry weight of winter wheat zhang et al 2009 but si only at jointing increased the rld in soil layers deeper than 30 cm li et al 2010 therefore it is feasible to construct a reasonable root system with efficient water use by adjusting the soil water content a lot of studies have attempted to identify si times and frequency reasonable si at the appropriate growth stage of wheat is conducive to improving grain yield and wue while limited irrigation and flood irrigation in the inappropriate growing period will lead to a significant decline in grain yield and wue li et al 2010 tari 2016 at present the research results on the appropriate period and timing of si applied to wheat during the key growing stage are not unified and most studies showed that si at jointing and anthesis is a reasonable scheme that results in high yield and high wue guo et al 2014 feng et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 however some researchers believe that the goals of high yields high efficiency and synergistic improvement can be synergistically achieved by si applied only once at the jointing stage xu et al 2016 2018b the si stages and timing have little effect on grain yield under the condition that the soil water content at the key growth stage of wheat is greater than 60 wang et al 2018 and the effect of increasing the si events on grain yield is also not obvious under the same total irrigation amount zhang et al 2016 at present although the water saving effects of irrigation methods such as regulated deficit irrigation soil water monitoring si and si on demand based on the water requirement of wheat are obvious there are still some technical limitations in the production and application levidow et al 2014 border irrigation is still the commonly used irrigation method on the ncp according to statistics deficit irrigation using border irrigation is more likely to obtain higher wue and grain yield at the same time yu et al 2019 however there are many problems in production such as excessive irrigation frequency and irrigation amount resulting in extreme waste of water resources in this study four si schemes basing on border irrigation were designed to 1 the effects of si regimes on the spatial distribution of roots 2 the response of root vigor dry matter accumulation and redistribution grain yield and wue to si regimes and 3 clarify the relationships between wheat root distribution and grain yield and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was performed from 2018 to 2020 in xinxiang 113 90 e 35 17 n henan province china this experimental area has a temperate continental monsoon climate an annual precipitation of 570 mm 150 mm occurs during the winter wheat growing season from october to june the soil of the experimental field was silty loam and the previous crop was corn zea mays l the soil nutrient content and soil bulk density in the 0 20 cm soil layer in the experimental field before sowing are shown in table 1 the precipitation amount in the whole growth period of wheat was 94 5 mm

jointing w1 si at jointing and anthesis w2 and si at regreening jointing and anthesis w3 an isolation zone with a depth of 0 5 m and a width of 0 8 m was set between the experimental plots to prevent

kg hm 2 and 90 kg hm 2 respectively before sowing before fertilization and seeding rotary tillage and harrowing were conducted after returning the straw of the preceding crop maize to the cropland area topdressing n was applied at a rate of 90 kg hm 2 at the jointing stage wheat was sown on october 10 2018 and october 8 2019 and harvested on june 8 2019 and june 2 2020 respectively a seeding rate of 180 seeds per m 2 and to a depth of 4 5 cm in rows spaced 23 cm apart were used in all treatment regimes additional protective measures were taken to assure the healthy growth of the wheat such as the spraying of herbicides before overwintering and insecticides before anthesis no significant incidence of pests diseases or weeds was observed at any of the treatment sites during the experiment 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 root length density the roots were sampled in each plot at anthesis an auger with an internal diameter of 10 cm and length of 25 cm was used to obtain cores two cores were collected per sample point the center of one core was on the wheat row vertical root the center of the other core was between two rows horizontal root and each core was divided into 20 cm increments to a depth of 60 cm each soil cylinder was placed into the disk the roots in the soil were quickly picked up by using tweezers and then dyed with methyl blue solution for 12 h after

added for extraction for 2 h and the root vigor was measured at 485 nm 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation and remobilization plant samples were collected to determine the dry matter content on two occasions anthesis and maturity thirty consecutive plants were cut manually at ground level in each plot at anthesis and maturity by removing the roots plants were separated into the grain and other

figs 1 and 2 the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer of w0 was significantly lower than that of w3 at the anthesis stage the root distribution in the 20 40 cm soil layer was greatly affected by soil water

layer was significantly higher than that of the other treatments in 2018 2019 the rld of zhoumai 18 in w0 in the 40 60 cm soil layer was significantly lower than that of other treatments while the results in 2019 2020 were just the opposite compared with zhoumai18 the average rld of bainong 4199 in the 0 60 cm soil layer was significantly higher according to the root spatial distribution characteristics on the whole the rld between the growing rows was significantly lower than that on the rows the proportion of rld between the rows at 0 20 cm in w3 was significantly higher than that in w0 the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer of w3 accounted for the highest proportion of the total rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer the proportion of rld on the row of bainong 4199 and zhoumai 18 in 2018 2019 was 79 47 and 53 08 respectively while in 2019 2020 corresponding values was 63 90 and 84 60 the proportion of rld between rows of bainong 4199 and zhoumai 18 in 2018 2019 was 76 62 and 57 11 respectively but corresponding values was 73 41 and 85 98 in 2019 2020 fig 3 3 2 root vigor the root vigor after anthesis showed a lower trend with grain filling process and w2 w1 w0 while w3 increased at the early filling stage and then decreased fig 5 the root vigor in w3 at anthesis was lower than that of other treatments the root vigor increased significantly at 8 days after anthesis daa the root vigor after irrigation reached the maximum at 10 or 15 daa then gradually decreased and there was no significant difference between w3 and w2 at 30 daa which were significantly higher than w1 and w0 and the two varieties showed a similar trend in the two experimental years in 2018 2019 the average root vigor between w3 and w2 of bainong 4199 had no significant difference but w2 of zhoumai 18 was significantly higher than w3 treatment while the average root vigor between w3 and w2 of two wheat varieties had no significant difference in 2019 2020 in comparison with 2018 2019 the root vigor in the 0 20 cm soil layer was lower than that of the corresponding treatments in 2019 2020 3 3 dry matter remobilization after anthesis table 5 shows that different si treatments had significant effects on the redistribution of vegetative organ assimilation and the contribution rate to grains of winter wheat and there were also larger differences between years dmre and cdmr decreased with increasing si amount whereas the dma and cdma increased as the si amount and frequency increased compared with w0 other treatments were significantly lower in the dmre and cdmr but significantly higher in the dma and cdma compared with zhoumai18 bainong4199 was higher in the dmr and dma of w0 and w1 the dmr of bainong 4199 was not significantly different between w3 and w2 and the dmr of zhoumai 18 in w2 was significantly higher than that in w3 3 4 grain filling the grain filling rates are shown in fig 6 the grain filling rates of w3 and w2 were significantly lower than those of w1 and w0 from 0 to 15 daa but higher from 20 to 35 daa the grain filling rate of w3 at 35 daa was not significantly different from that of w2 which was significantly higher than that of w1 and w0 there was a large difference in the grain filling rate among the cultivars in w0 and w1 bainong 4199 reached the peak milking stage at 10 15 daa and then began to decline but in w2 and w3 it reached the peak milking stage at 20 daa in all treatments zhoumai18 reached the peak at 20 25 daa in 2018 2019 the average grain filling rate between w3 and w2 of bainong 4199 had no significant difference but all were significantly higher than w1 and w0 the average grain filling rate between w0 w1 and w2 of zhoumai18 had no significant difference but was lower than w3 the average grain filling rate of both two wheat varieties had no significance difference between w2 and w3 but all are significantly higher than w1 and w0 in 2019 2020 3 5 grain yield and water use efficiency the effects of si during growth stage on yield and wue reached a very significant level p 0 01 through variance analysis table 6 spike number grains per spike grain yield and twc all increased with the increase of the number of si in the growth stage under the condition of consistent water management at the sowing stage the si treatments in the growth period was significantly higher than that of the w0 and the change trend between two experimental years was the same in 2018 2019 the wue of w2 was significantly higher than that of the other treatments and the two varieties showed the same performance the grain yield of bainong4199 and zhoumai18 in w3 reached 10 100 05 kg hm 2 and 9900 05 kg hm 2 respectively and there was no significant difference from w2 but w3 was significantly higher than the other treatments in 2019 2020 grain yield from high to low was w3 w2 w1 w0 the wue and ib of w3 were significantly lower than those of the other treatments the wue of w1 was the highest and the two varieties showed the same performance the grain yield of bainong 4199 was higher than that of zhoumai 18 and grain yield in 2018 2019 was higher than that in 2019 2020 analysis of variance showed that the interaction effects of year variety and water on yield and wue reached a highly significant level p 0 01 3 6 correlation analysis between root distribution and yield and wue the correlation analysis between the root vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics and yield yield compositions and wue was conducted combined with 2 year data fig 7 the results showed that rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer was highly and positively correlated with the grain yield and wue and reached a significant level with the spike number number of grains per spike and twc negative correlations were observed between the rld in the 0 20 cm layer and swc but there were very significant positive correlations with the rld in the 40 60 cm soil layer the root distribution in the 20 40 cm soil layer had no significant correlation with the number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 effects of si on yield and wue the average annual precipitation on the ncp is about 150 mm during the winter wheat growing season and the water deficit in the growth period is about 300 mm multiple si events are required to achieve high and stable yield using the traditional production technique zhou et al 2020 man et al 2016 in this experiment the precipitation during the growth phase of wheat in the two experimental years was less than the average precipitation in the experimental area table 2 there was no si during the sowing stage and each key growing stage after overwintering was under drought stress the comprehensive analysis showed that the grain yield was closely related to the twc of that year the higher the twc the higher the grain yield table 6 however the timing and amount of si are determined by rainfall intensity wen et al 2017 previous studies showed that the results on the stages and timing of si were different liu 2021 xu et al 2018b xu et al 2016 xue et al 2021 but irrespective of the rainfall intensity the grain yield of wheat in the si treatments improved significantly with the increase in the si amount the spike number number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight increased significantly within a certain si range table 6 there was lesser precipitation during the sowing period in 2018 2019 than during 2019 2020 si at sowing was carried out in order to ensure seedling emergence lin et al 2015 believed that the emergence rate of wheat was mainly affected by the soil water content in the 0 10 cm soil layer during the sowing period while the population development and dry matter were greatly affected by the soil water storage before sowing and the si level during the sowing period a previous study demonstrated that soil water stored before sowing contributed to 40 50 of the total evapotranspiration of winter wheat on the ncp zhang et al 2013 after si at sowing compared with si at jointing and anthesis the grain yield increase under si at regreening jointing and anthesis stages was not significant but resulted in a significant decrease in wue therefore si at jointing and anthesis can account for the synergistic improvement of yield and wue table 6 the key water requirement periods of winter wheat are jointing booting and anthesis xu et al 2018b demonstrated that si at jointing or anthesis coordinated pre and post anthesis water use and extended the grain filling duration the precipitation amount before and after sowing reached 61 9 mm in 2019 2020 so there was no si during the sowing period in addition the precipitation after seedling emergence was not concentrated and was low resulting in drought stress in the whole growing period the grain yield was significantly lower than that of the corresponding si treatments in 2018 2019 indicating that the grain yield of winter wheat was closely related to the soil water content on the sowing date table 3 thapa et al 2019 the grain yield was the highest under si at regreening jointing and anthesis but wue and ib decreased significantly xu et al 2015 analyzed the potential impact of drought on winter wheat yield on the huang huai hai plain in the recent 30 years and showed that the key growth stage of water demand is from jointing to heading which is the key stage of si and the yield reduction rate is higher if drought occurs in this period therefore si at jointing and anthesis can significantly improve wue and ib without reducing or slightly reducing yield on the basis of ensuring seedling emergence 4 2 relationship of dry matter remobilization to yield and wue winter wheat has different responses to water stress at different growing stages si at the regreening stage increased the population and biomass and promoted the input of assimilates stored in vegetative organs to grains after anthesis but did not improve water use efficiency li et al 2005 si at jointing and anthesis is conducive to coordinating the relationship between the accumulation of photosynthetic compounds and dry matter remobilization after anthesis so as to improve grain yield and wue guo et al 2015 xu et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 more assimilates in the stem and sheath after anthesis are transported to grains under rehydration after water stress increasing the number of grains per spike and the 1000 grain weight yang et al 2020 which is consistent with the results from 2019 to 2020 in this study si at jointing and anthesis optimized the distribution of pre and post anthesis photosynthetic matter in tissues and organs table 5 maintaining a higher filling rate at the growing late stage and improving wue without reducing or slightly reducing yield especially in the critical period of water demand after jointing a moderate water deficit accelerates crop development and advances the timing of anthesis si at anthesis effectively supplemented soil water and the grain filling period was not terminated in advance to extend the grain filling duration fig 6 this may also be the major cause for the higher grain filling rate and grain weight maintained by si at jointing and anthesis under higher soil water conditions grain yield is always related to grain weight thapa 2019 xu et al 2018b believed that si at the jointing or booting stage mainly coordinated the source sink relationship a higher sink capacity and source supply capacity improved yield and wue 4 3 effects of supplemental irrigation on root distribution more than 80 of wheat roots are mainly concentrated in the arable layer so the plough layer is the main layer from which nutrients and water are absorbed the soil water content seriously affects the growth and development of winter wheat roots and the distribution of roots is closely related to the grain yield many researchers believe that rld is an important target for studying root distribution fang et al 2021 chen et al 2020 in production si measures are used to regulate the soil water content and then affect the temporal and spatial distribution of wheat roots wang et al 2014 feng et al 2017 this study showed that with the increase in irrigation frequency the amount of surface roots increased while the proportion of rld in deep soil layers decreased which is because wheat roots do not need to explore deep soil layers under sufficient water conditions more than 90 of the roots in the si treatment were concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer forming an inverted triangular root structure figs 1 and 2 irrigation timing decreased and the proportion of roots in the deep soil layer increased fig 3 in 2018 2019 the rld of different soil layers of wheat was higher than that in 2019 2020 si applied at sowing can increase the soil water content and ensure the growth of wheat roots in winter producing stronger roots fig 4 a moderate soil water deficit before jointing can increase the shallow rld and promote the roots to penetrate into the deep soil wang et al 2014 and fully utilize the available soil water li et al 2001 thapa et al 2019 in 2019 2020 the soil water content of the w0 treatment was lower after overwintering without si during the sowing period the proportion of the vertical root distribution was larger than other si treatments and the rld of the 40 60 cm soil layer increased si at jointing and anthesis optimized the distribution of roots in different soil layers coordinating the proportion of shallow and deep soil roots and maintaining greater root vigor at the later growing stage figs 4 6 this may be an adaptive behavior of root phenotypic plasticity mi et al 2010 xu et al 2018a at the same time it reflects the complexity of the root system architecture and which is closely related to varieties and soil water li et al 2019 4 4 roles of root distribution in grain yield and wue improvement root growth in the soil layer is crucial in the uptake of soil water guan et al 2015 hochholdinger 2016 white et al 2015 believed that the higher the rld in the soil the larger the contact area between the root and soils and the more soil water was captured to meet its own needs in the middle and late growing stage which is conducive to maintaining a high grain filling rate at the late development stage and improving yield relatively high rld especially the surface roots as the main absorption layer can fully utilize irrigation and precipitation feng et al 2017 in this study the increase in rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer was conducive to the improvement of yield which then increased the water use efficiency rld in the 0 20cm soil layer between rows significantly increased the yield and wue fig 7 previous studies reported that crop water use not only depends on soil water availability but also on the root distribution and water uptake capacity of the roots jacobsen et al 2009 man et al 2016 wang et al 2011 believed that the contribution rate of roots in the 0 40 cm soil layer to grain yield was 78 32 the results of this study confirmed that si at jointing and anthesis increased the surface rld and increased the root vigor and grain filling rate at the growing later stage which may be the reason for the higher grain yield and wue the rld in the 40 60 cm soil layer increased the ability to absorb deep soil water increased and the use efficiency of soil water storage was higher but the correlation with yield was not significant fig 7 the increase in the deep root system was conducive to the absorption of deep soil water but the yield did not increase significantly which does not agree with previous research li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 in 2019 2020 without si after seedling emergence the vertical rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased the horizontal rld decreased and the use efficiency of soil water increased but the grain yield decreased resulting in a decline in wue fig 3 table 6 shallow roots absorb water and nutrients from the upper soil layer and few roots can fully meet the water absorption requirements of the whole plant under the condition of sufficient soil water in addition shallow roots also help to capture precipitation that does not penetrate into the deep soil layer and more deep roots play a more important role under water deficit stress rongsawat et al 2020 si at jointing and anthesis was conducive to optimize the spatial distribution of the roots and to increase the yield and water use efficiency table 6 winter wheat varieties with higher yield had higher wue the grain yield and wue of bainong 4199 were significantly higher than those of zhoumai 18 from 2018 to 2020 table 6 these results proved that high grain yield and wue are closely related to the increase in the average rld of bainong 4199 in the 0 60 cm soil layer especially to the increase in the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer figs 4 and 7 5 conclusion rational irrigation is an important measure to maintain the sustainable development of wheat on the north china plain the timing and frequency of irrigation significantly influenced the grain yield water use efficiency root length density grain filling rate and root vigor on the basis of consistent water management during the sowing period irrigation at jointing and anthesis increased the root length density in the 0 60 cm soil layer and optimized the spatial distribution of roots higher root vigor and a higher filling rate at the later growth stage coordinated assimilation accumulation and redistribution pre and post anthesis compared with other treatments irrigation at jointing and anthesis significantly improved water use efficiency without reducing or slightly reducing the grain yield in addition the selection of winter wheat varieties with higher yield was more conducive to the improvement of water use efficiency the results were obtained on the basis of 2 years so it is necessary to further study the physiological mechanism of improving the grain yield and water use efficiency under the condition of multi point verification of multiple varieties in the future

9177,soil moisture affects the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat triticum aestivum l by regulating the spatial distribution of roots therefore appropriate supplemental irrigation si schemes are essential to achieve high yield and high wue of wheat by constructing a reasonable root structure in this study field experiments were conducted the north china plain ncp from 2018 to 2020 based on the soil moisture management at sowing on a consistent basis four si regimes were set up no irrigation after seedling emergence w0 si at jointing w1 si at jointing and anthesis w2 and si at regreening jointing and anthesis w3 the results showed that although the grain yield of wheat increased with the si frequency the wue decreased with increasing si amount si at jointing and anthesis significantly increased wue without reducing or slightly reducing the grain yield the grain yield and wue in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than those of the corresponding treatments in 2019 2020 and the yield of bainong 4199 was higher than that of zhoumai 18 the grain yield and wue in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than those of the corresponding treatments in 2019 2020 the root length density rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased with increasing si frequency but the proportion of rld in the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased the average rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer and grain yield of bainong 4199 were significantly greater than that of zhoumai 18 correlation analysis showed that the grain yield and wue was positively correlated with the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer and reached a very significant level with rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer between rows w2 and w3 in terms of root vigor and the grain filling rate 30 days after anthesis were significantly higher than w1 and w0 and also increased the contribution of post anthesis dry matter to grain resulting in an increase in grain weight these results demonstrated that si at jointing and anthesis could optimize the spatial distribution of roots maintain higher root activity and filling rate at the late stage increase accumulation and translocation of post anthesis dry matter and finally improve the yield and wue therefore we propose that bainong 4199 was the preferred cultivars for this experiment under sufficient soil moisture conditions before sowing si at jointing and anthesis is the optimal irrigation scheme for wheat on the ncp keywords irrigation scheme root spatial distribution dry matter translocation grain yield water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is a major crop on the north china plain ncp the average annual precipitation in this area is 573 4 mm but only 150 mm occurs during the winter wheat growing season and the potential evapotranspiration et of winter wheat is about 300 450 mm fang et al 2010 as the water consumed during the growth period of winter wheat is much higher than the precipitation in the same period supplemental irrigation si during the growth period is required for achieving a high grain yield xu et al 2016 liu et al 2021 xue et al 2021 however multiple irrigation applications during the wheat growing season with a total irrigation amount of 300 400 mm have significantly reduced the groundwater table and the water use efficiency wue is low zaccaria et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 moreover most of the farmland on the ncp uses border irrigation therefore formulating irrigation measures are key to alleviate the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources and improve the yield and wue of wheat the roots of winter wheat are important organs that absorb water and nutrients the root characteristics and its distribution in soil layers affect grain yield and water use of wheat the formation and spatial distribution of root morphology are regulated by the water supply of different soil layers wang et al 2014 man et al 2016 pedersen et al 2010 introduced a root system form parameter to describe the distribution of root length vertically and horizontally in the soil profile when simulating the dynamics of different root densities but the effects of the root vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics on yield and wue were not further studied zhang et al 2015 used root distribution characteristic parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of soil moisture feng et al 2017 believed that root vertical distribution is important to improve the wue and grain yield of wheat therefore the spatial distribution of wheat roots in soil determines the ability to absorb and utilize water and nutrients directly affects the aboveground organogenesis the distribution of assimilates and the final yield li et al 2019 feng et al 2017 the improvement of water use efficiency mainly depends on the development of roots yadav et al 2009 white and kirkegaard 2010 soil water availability to crops depends on the root distribution water uptake ability thorup kristensen and boogaard 1999 jacobsen et al 2009 in production si is used to regulate the soil water content and then affect the temporal and spatial distribution of wheat roots feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 moderate water deficit and soil drought before jointing can increase the root length density rld and promote the root system to penetrate into the deep soil wang et al 2014 feng et al 2017 believed that rehydration after moderate drought stress before jointing could increase the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer and improve the root distribution in the 0 100 cm soil layer soil water deficit from jointing to booting reduced the number of secondary roots and the root dry weight of winter wheat zhang et al 2009 but si only at jointing increased the rld in soil layers deeper than 30 cm li et al 2010 therefore it is feasible to construct a reasonable root system with efficient water use by adjusting the soil water content a lot of studies have attempted to identify si times and frequency reasonable si at the appropriate growth stage of wheat is conducive to improving grain yield and wue while limited irrigation and flood irrigation in the inappropriate growing period will lead to a significant decline in grain yield and wue li et al 2010 tari 2016 at present the research results on the appropriate period and timing of si applied to wheat during the key growing stage are not unified and most studies showed that si at jointing and anthesis is a reasonable scheme that results in high yield and high wue guo et al 2014 feng et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 however some researchers believe that the goals of high yields high efficiency and synergistic improvement can be synergistically achieved by si applied only once at the jointing stage xu et al 2016 2018b the si stages and timing have little effect on grain yield under the condition that the soil water content at the key growth stage of wheat is greater than 60 wang et al 2018 and the effect of increasing the si events on grain yield is also not obvious under the same total irrigation amount zhang et al 2016 at present although the water saving effects of irrigation methods such as regulated deficit irrigation soil water monitoring si and si on demand based on the water requirement of wheat are obvious there are still some technical limitations in the production and application levidow et al 2014 border irrigation is still the commonly used irrigation method on the ncp according to statistics deficit irrigation using border irrigation is more likely to obtain higher wue and grain yield at the same time yu et al 2019 however there are many problems in production such as excessive irrigation frequency and irrigation amount resulting in extreme waste of water resources in this study four si schemes basing on border irrigation were designed to 1 the effects of si regimes on the spatial distribution of roots 2 the response of root vigor dry matter accumulation and redistribution grain yield and wue to si regimes and 3 clarify the relationships between wheat root distribution and grain yield and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was performed from 2018 to 2020 in xinxiang 113 90 e 35 17 n henan province china this experimental area has a temperate continental monsoon climate an annual precipitation of 570 mm 150 mm occurs during the winter wheat growing season from october to june the soil of the experimental field was silty loam and the previous crop was corn zea mays l the soil

jointing w1 si at jointing and anthesis w2 and si at regreening jointing and anthesis w3 an isolation zone with a depth of 0 5 m and a width of 0 8 m was set between the experimental plots to prevent

area topdressing n was applied at a rate of 90 kg hm 2 at the jointing stage wheat was sown on october 10 2018 and october 8 2019 and harvested on june 8 2019 and june 2 2020 respectively a seeding rate of 180 seeds per m 2 and to a depth of 4 5 cm in rows spaced 23 cm apart were used in all treatment regimes additional protective measures were taken to assure the healthy growth of the wheat such as the spraying of herbicides before overwintering and insecticides before anthesis no significant incidence of pests diseases or weeds was observed at any of the treatment sites during the experiment 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 root length density the roots were sampled in each plot at anthesis an auger with an internal diameter of 10 cm and length of 25 cm was used to obtain cores two cores

added for extraction for 2 h and the root vigor was measured at 485 nm 2 3 3 dry matter accumulation and remobilization plant samples were collected to determine the dry matter content on two occasions anthesis and maturity thirty consecutive plants were cut manually at ground level in each plot at anthesis and maturity by removing the roots plants were separated into the grain and other

figs 1 and 2 the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer of w0 was significantly lower than that of w3 at the anthesis stage the root distribution in the 20 40 cm soil layer was greatly affected by soil water

layer was significantly higher than that of the other treatments in 2018 2019 the rld of zhoumai 18 in w0 in the 40 60 cm soil layer was significantly lower than that of other treatments while the results in 2019 2020 were just the opposite compared with zhoumai18 the average rld of bainong 4199 in the 0 60 cm soil layer was significantly higher according to the root spatial distribution characteristics on the whole the rld between the growing rows was significantly lower than that on the rows the proportion of rld between the rows at 0 20 cm in w3 was significantly higher than that in w0 the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer of w3 accounted for the highest proportion of the total rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer the proportion of rld on the row of bainong 4199 and zhoumai 18 in 2018 2019 was 79 47 and 53 08 respectively while in 2019 2020 corresponding values was 63 90 and 84 60 the proportion of rld between rows of bainong 4199 and zhoumai 18 in 2018 2019 was 76 62 and 57 11 respectively but corresponding values was 73 41 and 85 98 in 2019 2020 fig 3 3 2 root vigor the root vigor after anthesis showed a lower trend with grain filling process and w2 w1 w0 while w3 increased at the early filling stage and then decreased fig 5 the root vigor in w3 at anthesis was lower than that of other treatments the root vigor increased significantly at 8 days after anthesis daa the root vigor after irrigation reached the maximum at 10 or 15 daa then gradually decreased and there was no significant difference between w3 and w2 at 30 daa which were significantly higher than w1 and w0 and the two varieties showed a similar trend in the two experimental years in 2018 2019 the average root vigor between w3 and w2 of bainong 4199 had no significant difference but w2 of zhoumai 18 was significantly higher than w3 treatment while the average root vigor between w3 and w2 of two wheat varieties had no significant difference in 2019 2020 in comparison with 2018 2019 the root vigor in the 0 20 cm soil layer was lower than that of the corresponding treatments in 2019 2020 3 3 dry matter remobilization after anthesis table 5 shows that different si treatments had significant effects on the redistribution of vegetative organ assimilation and the contribution rate to grains of winter wheat and there were also larger differences between years dmre and cdmr decreased with increasing si amount whereas the dma and cdma increased as the si amount and frequency increased compared with w0 other treatments were significantly lower in the dmre and cdmr but significantly higher in the dma and cdma compared with zhoumai18 bainong4199 was higher in the dmr and dma of w0 and w1 the dmr of bainong 4199 was not significantly different between w3 and w2 and the dmr of zhoumai 18 in w2 was significantly higher than that in w3 3 4 grain filling the grain filling rates are shown in fig 6 the grain filling rates of w3 and w2 were significantly lower than those of w1 and w0 from 0 to 15 daa but higher from 20 to 35 daa the grain filling rate of w3 at 35 daa was not significantly different from that of w2 which was significantly higher than that of w1 and w0 there was a large difference in the grain filling rate among the cultivars in w0 and w1 bainong 4199 reached the peak milking stage at 10 15 daa and then began to decline but in w2 and w3 it reached the peak milking stage at 20 daa in all treatments zhoumai18 reached the peak at 20 25 daa in 2018 2019 the average grain filling rate between w3 and w2 of bainong 4199 had no significant difference but all were significantly higher than w1 and w0 the average grain filling rate between w0 w1 and w2 of zhoumai18 had no significant difference but was lower than w3 the average grain filling rate of both two wheat varieties had no significance difference between w2 and w3 but all are significantly higher than w1 and w0 in 2019 2020 3 5 grain yield and water use efficiency the effects of si during growth stage on yield and wue reached a very significant level p 0 01 through variance analysis table 6 spike number grains per spike grain yield and twc all increased with the increase of the number of si in the growth stage under the condition of consistent water management at the sowing stage the si treatments in the growth period was significantly higher than that of the w0 and the change trend between two experimental years was the same in 2018 2019 the wue of w2 was significantly higher than that of the other treatments and the two varieties showed the same performance the grain yield of bainong4199 and zhoumai18 in w3 reached 10 100 05 kg hm 2 and 9900 05 kg hm 2 respectively and there was no significant difference from w2 but w3 was significantly higher than the other treatments in 2019 2020 grain yield from high to low was w3 w2 w1 w0 the wue and ib of w3 were significantly lower than those of the other treatments the wue of w1 was the highest and the two varieties showed the same performance the grain yield of bainong 4199 was higher than that of zhoumai 18 and grain yield in 2018 2019 was higher than that in 2019 2020 analysis of variance showed that the interaction effects of year variety and water on yield and wue reached a highly significant level p 0 01 3 6 correlation analysis between root distribution and yield and wue the correlation analysis between the root vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics and yield yield compositions and wue was conducted combined with 2 year data fig 7 the results showed that rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer was highly and positively correlated with the grain yield and wue and reached a significant level with the spike number number of grains per spike and twc negative correlations were observed between the rld in the 0 20 cm layer and swc but there were very significant positive correlations with the rld in the 40 60 cm soil layer the root distribution in the 20 40 cm soil layer had no significant correlation with the number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 effects of si on yield and wue the average annual precipitation on the ncp is about 150 mm during the winter wheat growing season and the water deficit in the growth period is about 300 mm multiple si events are required to achieve high and stable yield using the traditional production technique zhou et al 2020 man et al 2016 in this experiment the precipitation during the growth phase of wheat in the two experimental years was less than the average precipitation in the experimental area table 2 there was no si during the sowing stage and each key growing stage after overwintering was under drought stress the comprehensive analysis showed that the grain yield was closely related to the twc of that year the higher the twc the higher the grain yield table 6 however the timing and amount of si are determined by rainfall intensity wen et al 2017 previous studies showed that the results on the stages and timing of si were different liu 2021 xu et al 2018b xu et al 2016 xue et al 2021 but irrespective of the rainfall intensity the grain yield of wheat in the si treatments improved significantly with the increase in the si amount the spike number number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight increased significantly within a certain si range table 6 there was lesser precipitation during the sowing period in 2018 2019 than during 2019 2020 si at sowing was carried out in order to ensure seedling emergence lin et al 2015 believed that the emergence rate of wheat was mainly affected by the soil water content in the 0 10 cm soil layer during the sowing period while the population development and dry matter were greatly affected by the soil water storage before sowing and the si level during the sowing period a previous study demonstrated that soil water stored before sowing contributed to 40 50 of the total evapotranspiration of winter wheat on the ncp zhang et al 2013 after si at sowing compared with si at jointing and anthesis the grain yield increase under si at regreening jointing and anthesis stages was not significant but resulted in a significant decrease in wue therefore si at jointing and anthesis can account for the synergistic improvement of yield and wue table 6 the key water requirement periods of winter wheat are jointing booting and anthesis xu et al 2018b demonstrated that si at jointing or anthesis coordinated pre and post anthesis water use and extended the grain filling duration the precipitation amount before and after sowing reached 61 9 mm in 2019 2020 so there was no si during the sowing period in addition the precipitation after seedling emergence was not concentrated and was low resulting in drought stress in the whole growing period the grain yield was significantly lower than that of the corresponding si treatments in 2018 2019 indicating that the grain yield of winter wheat was closely related to the soil water content on the sowing date table 3 thapa et al 2019 the grain yield was the highest under si at regreening jointing and anthesis but wue and ib decreased significantly xu et al 2015 analyzed the potential impact of drought on winter wheat yield on the huang huai hai plain in the recent 30 years and showed that the key growth stage of water demand is from jointing to heading which is the key stage of si and the yield reduction rate is higher if drought occurs in this period therefore si at jointing and anthesis can significantly improve wue and ib without reducing or slightly reducing yield on the basis of ensuring seedling emergence 4 2 relationship of dry matter remobilization to yield and wue winter wheat has different responses to water stress at different growing stages si at the regreening stage increased the population and biomass and promoted the input of assimilates stored in vegetative organs to grains after anthesis but did not improve water use efficiency li et al 2005 si at jointing and anthesis is conducive to coordinating the relationship between the accumulation of photosynthetic compounds and dry matter remobilization after anthesis so as to improve grain yield and wue guo et al 2015 xu et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 more assimilates in the stem and sheath after anthesis are transported to grains under rehydration after water stress increasing the number of grains per spike and the 1000 grain weight yang et al 2020 which is consistent with the results from 2019 to 2020 in this study si at jointing and anthesis optimized the distribution of pre and post anthesis photosynthetic matter in tissues and organs table 5 maintaining a higher filling rate at the growing late stage and improving wue without reducing or slightly reducing yield especially in the critical period of water demand after jointing a moderate water deficit accelerates crop development and advances the timing of anthesis si at anthesis effectively supplemented soil water and the grain filling period was not terminated in advance to extend the grain filling duration fig 6 this may also be the major cause for the higher grain filling rate and grain weight maintained by si at jointing and anthesis under higher soil water conditions grain yield is always related to grain weight thapa 2019 xu et al 2018b believed that si at the jointing or booting stage mainly coordinated the source sink relationship a higher sink capacity and source supply capacity improved yield and wue 4 3 effects of supplemental irrigation on root distribution more than 80 of wheat roots are mainly concentrated in the arable layer so the plough layer is the main layer from which nutrients and water are absorbed the soil water content seriously affects the growth and development of winter wheat roots and the distribution of roots is closely related to the grain yield many researchers believe that rld is an important target for studying root distribution fang et al 2021 chen et al 2020 in production si measures are used to regulate the soil water content and then affect the temporal and spatial distribution of wheat roots wang et al 2014 feng et al 2017 this study showed that with the increase in irrigation frequency the amount of surface roots increased while the proportion of rld in deep soil layers decreased which is because wheat roots do not need to explore deep soil layers under sufficient water conditions more than 90 of the roots in the si treatment were concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer forming an inverted triangular root structure figs 1 and 2 irrigation timing decreased and the proportion of roots in the deep soil layer increased fig 3 in 2018 2019 the rld of different soil layers of wheat was higher than that in 2019 2020 si applied at sowing can increase the soil water content and ensure the growth of wheat roots in winter producing stronger roots fig 4 a moderate soil water deficit before jointing can increase the shallow rld and promote the roots to penetrate into the deep soil wang et al 2014 and fully utilize the available soil water li et al 2001 thapa et al 2019 in 2019 2020 the soil water content of the w0 treatment was lower after overwintering without si during the sowing period the proportion of the vertical root distribution was larger than other si treatments and the rld of the 40 60 cm soil layer increased si at jointing and anthesis optimized the distribution of roots in different soil layers coordinating the proportion of shallow and deep soil roots and maintaining greater root vigor at the later growing stage figs 4 6 this may be an adaptive behavior of root phenotypic plasticity mi et al 2010 xu et al 2018a at the same time it reflects the complexity of the root system architecture and which is closely related to varieties and soil water li et al 2019 4 4 roles of root distribution in grain yield and wue improvement root growth in the soil layer is crucial in the uptake of soil water guan et al 2015 hochholdinger 2016 white et al 2015 believed that the higher the rld in the soil the larger the contact area between the root and soils and the more soil water was captured to meet its own needs in the middle and late growing stage which is conducive to maintaining a high grain filling rate at the late development stage and improving yield relatively high rld especially the surface roots as the main absorption layer can fully utilize irrigation and precipitation feng et al 2017 in this study the increase in rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer was conducive to the improvement of yield which then increased the water use efficiency rld in the 0 20cm soil layer between rows significantly increased the yield and wue fig 7 previous studies reported that crop water use not only depends on soil water availability but also on the root distribution and water uptake capacity of the roots jacobsen et al 2009 man et al 2016 wang et al 2011 believed that the contribution rate of roots in the 0 40 cm soil layer to grain yield was 78 32 the results of this study confirmed that si at jointing and anthesis increased the surface rld and increased the root vigor and grain filling rate at the growing later stage which may be the reason for the higher grain yield and wue the rld in the 40 60 cm soil layer increased the ability to absorb deep soil water increased and the use efficiency of soil water storage was higher but the correlation with yield was not significant fig 7 the increase in the deep root system was conducive to the absorption of deep soil water but the yield did not increase significantly which does not agree with previous research li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 in 2019 2020 without si after seedling emergence the vertical rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased the horizontal rld decreased and the use efficiency of soil water increased but the grain yield decreased resulting in a decline in wue fig 3 table 6 shallow roots absorb water and nutrients from the upper soil layer and few roots can fully meet the water absorption requirements of the whole plant under the condition of sufficient soil water in addition shallow roots also help to capture precipitation that does not penetrate into the deep soil layer and more deep roots play a more important role under water deficit stress rongsawat et al 2020 si at jointing and anthesis was conducive to optimize the spatial distribution of the roots and to increase the yield and water use efficiency table 6 winter wheat varieties with higher yield had higher wue the grain yield and wue of bainong 4199 were significantly higher than those of zhoumai 18 from 2018 to 2020 table 6 these results proved that high grain yield and wue are closely related to the increase in the average rld of bainong 4199 in the 0 60 cm soil layer especially to the increase in the rld in the 0 20 cm soil layer figs 4 and 7 5 conclusion rational irrigation is an important measure to maintain the sustainable development of wheat on the north china plain the timing and frequency of irrigation significantly influenced the grain yield water use efficiency root length density grain filling rate and root vigor on the basis of consistent water management during the sowing period irrigation at jointing and anthesis increased the root length density in the 0 60 cm soil layer and optimized the spatial distribution of roots higher root vigor and a higher filling rate at the later growth stage coordinated assimilation accumulation and redistribution pre and post anthesis compared with other treatments irrigation at jointing and anthesis significantly improved water use efficiency without reducing or slightly reducing the grain yield in addition the selection of winter wheat varieties with higher yield was more conducive to the improvement of water use efficiency the results were obtained on the basis of 2 years so it is necessary to further study the physiological mechanism of improving the grain yield and water use efficiency under the condition of multi point verification of multiple varieties in the future

type with a mean annual temperature of 14 8 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1022 mm the soil type is classified as yellow brown paddy soil with a ph of 6 0 and the soil texture is silty clay loam the soil organic matter available phosphorus and available potassium in the topsoil was 20 15 g kg 20 74 mg kg and 108 75 mg kg respectively yang et al 2019 as an essential cropland site designed by the china climate observing system plan it covers an area of 20 ha and has flat and open croplands on all sides the distance between the observation site and the nearest village is more than 500 m chen et al 2015 the typical cropping systems on the site involves rotations of winter wheat and rice the winter wheat is planted in mid october and harvested in late may whereas rice is transplanted in early june and matures in september local farmers operate cropland following local management practices the winter wheat is not irrigated and the rice field is routinely flooded to maintain 5 10 cm

and soil measurements were recorded using a data logger and then averaged to half hourly data the lai data were obtained from the mod15a2h data 8 day composited 500 m https lpdaac usgs gov products mod15a2hv006 according to the quality flag of the mod15a2h data the original low quality data were excluded and then linearly interpolated to acquire the continuous lai data during the growing seasons this method is widely used in the lai interpolation in other studies liu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 2 3 data processing after collecting the flux meteorological and soil data we used an open source software eddypro v6 2 0 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to control the raw data quality and calculate the half hourly nee latent heat flux and sensible heat flux according to internationally recognized data processing procedures lee and massman 2011 yu et al 2006 the reddyproc r package was used to gap fill the missing data and partition the nee into gpp and re wutzler et al 2018 furthermore et was calculated from the latent heat flux using this r package the daily nee gpp re and et of five winter wheat growing seasons wgs and four rice growing seasons rgs were analyzed basic information of wgs and rgs can be shown in table 1 2 4 brt method a brt based method developed by elith et al 2008 is widely used to quantify the complex non linear relationships between predictor and response variables and plot the partial dependences of these relations brt combines the strengths of regression trees and boosting algorithms with different data types including the missing data and does not need to transform the data distribution or eliminate outliers rojas robles et al 2020 therefore the brt method was selected to analyze the relative contributions of six predictor variables r n t a vpd swc ws

variations in environmental and crop conditions at the site for the duration of the study are provided in fig 2 almost all the variables varied seasonally and the site was characterized by cool and dry winters but warm and wet summers daily mean t a ranged from 6 6 to 36 6 c and displayed a multimodal curve during the year fig 2a compared with the pattern of t a r n had considerable day to day fluctuations fig 2b and the peak in r n preceded that of t a as demonstrated in tables 2 and 3 the daily mean t a and r n of the rgs was clearly higher than those of the wgs fig 2c demonstrates the daily mean vpd in the wgs 3 9 2 8 hpa was lower than that in the rgs 5 0 2 9 hpa due to the lower winter and spring t a tables 2 and 3 the swc and precipitation also had distinct seasonal variations between the wgs and rgs tables 2 and 3 nine times the daily precipitation values were above 50 0 mm d 1 and seven of them occurred between july and september fig 2d in comparison the mean ws of the wgs 1 8 0 9 m s 1 was higher than that of the rgs 1 2 0 5 m s 1 fig 2e the lai represents the growth condition of the crop as shown in fig 2f lai ranged from 0 3 to 5 0 m2 m 2 and had a bimodal curve two peak values of each year occurred in the wgs and rgs respectively generally in one year the first peak value in the wgs was lower than the second one in the rgs 3 2 seasonal variations in nee gpp re and et seasonal variations in nee gpp re and et at the site were associated with crop development fig 3 for nee a positive negative value represents a carbon source sink ecosystem daily nee was close to zero in the early stages of the wgs from october to next february then quickly decreased to its minimum value before increasing and exceeding 0 from may to early june i e the maturing stage fig 3a in the rgs daily nee had a rapid decrease and reached its minimum value after the rice was planted fig 3a and then underwent a steep increase to a value above 0 when the rice entered the maturing stage i e mid september in addition to nee apparent seasonal variations occurred in gpp and re fig 3b c daily gpp increased and peaked from late march to late may in the wgs or from late june to july in the rgs and then decreased at the maturing stage fig 3b re also decreased at the maturing stage of the wgs and rgs although a higher t a occurred at this stage fig 3c furthermore a phase difference existed between the maximum values of gpp and re the maximum gpp usually coincided with the minimum nee but was ahead of the maximum re values for the wgs and rgs fig 3b c overall et followed a similar pattern to gpp seasonally ranging from 0 to 6 77 mm d 1 fig 3d for the wgs et was low in the early growing stage peak water use occurred around april and then decreased until harvest compared with the wgs et rapidly increased from late june to july in the rgs this result was mainly due to the high evaporation of the flood water tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the negative cumulative nee in the wgs and rgs indicating the cultivated land acted as a carbon sink although the daily mean nee in the wgs was lower than that in the rgs tables 2 and 3 the cumulative nee in the wgs 324 35 58 20 gc m 2 a 1 closely resembled the rgs 328 98 34 35 gc m 2 a 1 similar characteristics were observed in the cumulative gpp re and et tables 2 and 3 3 3 controls on nee gpp re and et to further understand the relative importance of different environmental factors on co2 and water fluxes results from the brt analysis are shown in figs 4 and 5 the most important controlling factor of nee was lai in this study the lai contribution to nee reached 57 62 in the wgs fig 4a and 53 30 in the rgs fig 5a in the wgs the response of nee was positive when lai was 0 4 m2 m 2 fig 4b as lai increased the nee started to decrease and finally reached the maximum co2 absorption similar response characteristics occurred in the rgs however there was a tendency of nee toward neutral or positive when lai was 0 8 m2 m 2 fig 5b in addition to lai r n impacted nee contributing 21 62 in the wgs fig 4a and 31 89 in the rgs fig 5a the overall pattern was as follows fig 4c the nee in the wgs began positive and became negative as r n shifted until it reached 23 w m 2 in comparison nee in the rgs was negative when r n rose above 41 w m 2 fig 5c lai and r n were the two most important controllers of gpp fig 4d demonstrates that the lai contribution reached 80 03 and the r n contribution reached 14 32 in the wgs the partial dependence plot indicated the gpp of the wgs changed abruptly after a lai increase until the gpp reached a plateau fig 4e in contrast to the lai response the r n relative influence curve displayed a trend of slowly increasing fig 4f fig 5d demonstrated that in the rgs the contributions of lai and r n to gpp were 57 20 and 27 70 respectively the impact of lai on gpp in the rgs increased rapidly as lai increased however the gpp in the rgs stopped increasing and remained constant when lai approached 3 6 m2 m 2 fig 5e the gpp in the rgs responded to r n when r n was lower than 150 w m 2 and gpp remained constant once r n exceeded 150 w m 2 fig 5f fig 4g demonstrates the largest contribution to re in the wgs was t a 57 18 followed by lai 34 59 in the wgs fig 4h the re did not change significantly with t a when t a was below 0 c or above 24 c and increased drastically with increasing t a when t a ranged from 13 to 24 c fig 4i demonstrates the relative influence curve of lai and displayed an increasing re trend in the wgs once lai was above 2 5 m2 m 2 its effect on re reached a maximum level in the rgs lai and t a were the two most important controllers of re fig 5g in contrast to the lai response in the wgs its influence curve in the rgs firstly increased from 1 to 2 5 m2 m 2 then slightly decreased and finally remained constant when lai was above 2 5 m2 m 2 fig 5h when t a was in the range of 20 30 c its effect on re in the rgs drastically increased fig 5i r n was the most critical controller of et the contribution of r n to et was 85 06 in the wgs fig 4j and 80 16 in the rgs fig 5j fig 4k demonstrates that et increased in parallel with r n in the wgs similar response characteristics occurred in the rgs fig 5k in addition to r n lai posed a limited influence on et in the crop growing seasons which were 6 06 in the wgs fig 4j and 6 37 in the rgs fig 5j in contrast to the r n response the relative influence curve of lai had a slowly increasing trend in the wgs fig 4l in the rgs et did not change significantly with lai when lai was above 1 m2 m 2 fig 5l 4 discussion 4 1 nee and et comparisons with previous studies to compare our results with previous studies the ec based results of nee and et for the wgs and rgs between 14 n and 50 n are listed in table 4 table 4 clearly shows obvious variation in the nee or et at the different sites these variations are attributed to different climate and soil conditions biotic factors crop types and agricultural management practices swain et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 for example the co2 absorption indicated by nee in the wgs at our site was higher than that at the yucheng site 36 83 n 116 57 e in the north china plain this discrepancy may be attributed to the soil type and cropping system the yucheng site has saline alkali soil with lime which reduced the net co2 absorption due to the lime emitting co2 mosharrof et al 2021 furthermore the crops planted in the previous season at yucheng site i e maize was different to our site i e rice in addition the two sites have different local climatic conditions which may also have caused the large differences in nee between the sites compared with other sites the co2 absorption in the wgs at our site was smaller than that of the lonzÃ©e site belgium aubinet et al 2009 and selhausen site germany schmidt et al 2012 and our et results in the wgs were also smaller these may be due to variations in climatic conditions and the duration of the wgs for the rgs the co2 absorption at our site was comparable to that at the cuttack site india bhattacharyya et al 2013 tsukuba site japan saito et al 2005 and cheorwon site korea pastorello et al 2020 but higher than that at the los baÃ±os site philippines alberto et al 2011 table 4 an important reason may be because the los baÃ±os site is in the tropical monsoon climatic region with higher temperatures and vpd alberto et al 2011 furthermore the flooded crop management and aerobic soil condition at the los baÃ±os site are inconsistent with the other sites causing a higher et result than any other sites in table 4 the comparisons also highlight a large spatial variation in the estimated nee or et across the different studies this discrepancy requires further investigation into the influencing factors of nee and et at the spatial scale using additional multi site datasets and geostatistical analysis methods the variation in the nee or et between the wgs and rgs at our site are shown in tables 2 and 3 daily mean nee and et in the wgs were lower than those in the rgs however the cumulative nee or et in the wgs was close to that in the rgs an important reason is the difference in the growing season lengths which were 224 days in the wgs and 117 days in the rgs table 1 4 2 controlling factors on co2 and water fluxes previous studies have indicated that r n is the dominant controlling factor of nee at the half hourly scale baldocchi 2014 patel et al 2021 however recent studies identified the controlling factors of nee might vary at different timescales this suggestion is controversial due to the lack of long term data available montagnani et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for example some studies have indicated that t a and vpd had larger impacts on seasonal variability in the daily nee than r n li et al 2018 novick et al 2016 in comparison our brt analysis found that lai was the dominant controlling factor of nee and gpp for the wgs fig 4 and rgs fig 5 this finding shows a larger impact of biotic factors as the timescale increases from half hourly to daily hayek et al 2018 wu et al 2017 an important reason may be because lai can directly reflect the growth conditions of the crop and the effective areas of canopy photosynthesis thereby affecting canopy photosynthesis rate and aboveground plant respiration gao et al 2017 therefore lai is founded to be the dominant factor controlling the seasonal variations of gpp and nee rather than other environmental variables many current crop models mainly use different environmental variables to simulate crop growth and co2 flux huang et al 2019 our result highlights the importance of accounting for lai when modeling nee gpp and re for rice wheat rotation systems in addition to lai our results indicated that r n remained critical ranking second in explaining the seasonal variation in the nee and gpp figs 4 and 5 several studies have highlighted that photosynthesis rather than respiration strongly dominates nee variations baldocchi 2014 ouyang et al 2014 photosynthesis and respiration are the function of radiation and temperature respectively jia et al 2018 therefore r n and gpp should oscillate synchronously whereas t a and re or gpp change at similar paces figs 4 and 5 however the relative influence of r n on co2 flux varied between the wgs and rgs as for et we found that it was dominantly controlled by r n in the wgs and rgs figs 4j and 5j which suggests the available energy played an important role in modulating et processes at our site liu et al 2019 similar findings have been reported in previous studies alberto et al 2011 han et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 considering the importance of r n in co2 flux and et changes future crop models should be further improved in order to allow the direct use of r n instead of the total radiation as an input variable 4 3 limitations and future work although we attempted to understand the seasonal dynamics of nee gpp re and et in a rice wheat rotation system complex relationships exist between them and their influencing factors for example unfavorable climate events had remarkable impacts on co2 and water fluxes during the main growing period notably the early spring drought and subsequent continuous precipitation events caused a lower gpp during the wgs from 2009 to 2010 fig 2d a reasonable evaluation of these complex relationships under different hydro climatic conditions is required to obtain sufficient long term data this is the focus of the next stage of our research we will also undertake long term measurements of co2 and water fluxes at our site to estimate the pattern and magnitude of nee gpp re and et at different timescales and quantify the annual net carbon and greenhouse gas budget in a rice wheat rotation system in the yangtze huaihe region dai et al 2019 cropland management activities e g irrigation also impact the nee gpp re and et bai et al 2015 gao et al 2018 yang et al 2016 however the impacts of cropland management were not fully realized due to lack of available data furthermore the ec data during the non growing seasons was removed in our study because we need to maintain the observation instruments during this period we therefore hope to collect further detailed data e g in site lai irrigation and soil properties data and utilize the ecosystem model to analyze the impacts of cropland management on nee gpp re and et in different seasons e g the rgs wgs and non growing season in our future work 5 conclusions this study analyzed the seasonal dynamics of co2 and water fluxes we identified the primary controlling factors on these fluxes in a rice wheat rotation system in the yangtze huaihe region using data generated over the long term our results indicate that daily nee gpp re and et show seasonal variations across the whole growing seasons the rice wheat rotation field was potentially a sink for co2 the rice paddy field had higher cumulative values of nee gpp re and et than the wheat field the specific environmental factors and crop development made large contributions to the co2 and water fluxes for instance in both the wgs and rgs lai was the primary controlling factor of nee and gpp while t a and lai displayed essential roles in controlling re however the contributions of the different factors on the co2 flux varied with the growing seasons as for et r n was the most important controller in the wgs and rgs which suggested that et at this site was limited by energy rather than water long term monitoring of co2 and water fluxes can provide basic data for calibrating key parameters in crop models based on model data fusion approaches to improve water use efficiency further work should include the additional of crop management data to analyze the impacts of biotic factors and crop management activities on co2 and water fluxes in the different crops to understand the distinct controlling

and machine learning algorithms in rice wheat rotation systems to fill this knowledge gap a typical rice wheat rotation site with 5 years of ec data was investigated our primary research purposes were 1 to investigate the seasonal variations of nee gpp re and et 2 to identify the primary controlling factors on these fluxes in a rice wheat rotation system this study may contribute to improved understanding of the controlling factors affecting co2 exchange and et in a rice wheat rotation system and provides a valuable reference for regional agricultural water management and climate smart agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted from october 2007 to september 2010 and from october 2016 to june 2018 at the shouxian national climatology site 116 47 e 32 26 n 22 7 m above sea level in anhui province china fig 1 the site was established and maintained by the anhui meteorological administration the climate is a subtropical humid monsoon type with a mean annual temperature of 14 8 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1022 mm the soil type is classified as yellow brown paddy soil with a ph of 6 0 and the soil texture is silty clay loam the soil organic matter available phosphorus and available potassium in the topsoil was 20 15 g kg 20 74 mg kg and 108 75 mg kg respectively yang et al 2019 as an essential cropland site designed by the china climate observing system plan it covers an area of 20 ha and has flat and open croplands on all sides the distance between the observation site and the nearest village is more than 500 m chen et al 2015 the typical cropping systems on the site involves rotations of winter wheat and rice the winter wheat is planted in mid october and harvested in late may whereas rice is transplanted in early june and matures in september local farmers operate cropland following local management practices the winter wheat is not irrigated and the rice field is routinely flooded to maintain 5 10 cm of standing water until 2 weeks before harvest compound fertilizer and urea are mixed and used for the winter wheat at 600 and 450 kg ha 1 and rice at 750 and 600 kg ha 1 2 2 field measurements fluxes in gas energy and momentum at the shouxian site were measured using an ec system including an open path co2 h2o analyzer li 7500a li cor inc lincoln ne usa and a 3 d ultrasonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa both two sensors were installed at 4 m above ground level to automatically measure co2 and h2o fluxes with the sampling frequency of 10 hz and data were recorded using a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa simultaneously meteorological and soil variables were measured using an automatic weather station r n and photosynthetic active radiation were measured at 4 m above ground level using a net radiometer cnr1 kipp zonen corp delft netherlands and quantum sensor li s190sb li cor lincoln ne usa respectively a temperature and humidity probe placed at a height of 4 m measured the t a and relative humidity hmp45c vaisala helsinki finland which was used to calculate the vpd ws was monitored at a height of 4 m 010a campbell scientific inc ut usa rainfall was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge 52203 rm young inc traverse city mi usa soil temperature 107 l campbell scientific inc ut usa and volumetric swc cs616 campbell scientific inc ut usa were measured at 0 1 and 0 2 m below ground level two soil heat flux plats hfp01 hukeflux inc delft netherlands were placed 0 05 m below ground level all meteorological and soil measurements were recorded using a data logger and then averaged to half hourly data the lai data were obtained from the mod15a2h data 8 day composited 500 m https lpdaac usgs gov products mod15a2hv006 according to the quality flag of the mod15a2h data the original low quality data were excluded and then linearly interpolated to acquire the continuous lai data during the growing seasons this method is widely used in the lai interpolation in other studies liu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 2 3 data processing after collecting the flux meteorological and soil data we used an open source software eddypro v6 2 0 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to control the raw data quality and calculate the half hourly nee latent heat flux and sensible heat flux according to internationally recognized data processing procedures lee and massman 2011 yu et al 2006 the reddyproc r package was used to gap fill the missing data and partition the nee into gpp and re wutzler et al 2018 furthermore et was calculated from the latent heat flux using this r package the daily nee gpp re and et of five winter wheat growing seasons wgs and four rice growing seasons rgs were analyzed basic information of wgs and rgs can be shown in table 1 2 4 brt method a brt based method developed by elith et al 2008 is widely used to quantify the complex non linear relationships between predictor and response variables and plot the partial dependences of these relations brt combines the strengths of regression trees and boosting algorithms with different data types including the missing data and does not need to transform the data distribution or eliminate outliers rojas robles et al 2020 therefore the brt method was selected to analyze the relative contributions of six predictor variables r n t a vpd swc ws and lai in controlling each flux nee gpp re and et in the different crop growing seasons a gbm r package ran the brt model with optimal input parameters e g a tree complexity of 8 a learning rate of 0 001 a bag fraction of 0 75 and the family type of gaussian detailed calculation processes were shown in a previous study elith et al 2008 3 results 3 1 environmental and crop conditions seasonal variations in environmental and crop conditions at the site for the duration of the study are provided in fig 2 almost all the variables varied seasonally and the site was characterized by cool and dry winters but warm and wet summers daily mean t a ranged from 6 6 to 36 6 c and displayed a multimodal curve during the year fig 2a compared with the pattern of t a r n had considerable day to day fluctuations fig 2b and the peak in r n preceded that of t a as demonstrated in tables 2 and 3 the daily mean t a and r n of the rgs was clearly higher than those of the wgs fig 2c demonstrates the daily mean vpd in the wgs 3 9 2 8 hpa was lower than that in the rgs 5 0 2 9 hpa due to the lower winter and spring t a tables 2 and 3 the swc and precipitation also had distinct seasonal variations between the wgs and rgs tables 2 and 3 nine times the daily precipitation values were above 50 0 mm d 1 and seven of them occurred between july and september fig 2d in comparison the mean ws of the wgs 1 8 0 9 m s 1 was higher than that of the rgs 1 2 0 5 m s 1 fig 2e the lai represents the growth condition of the crop as shown in fig 2f lai ranged from 0 3 to 5 0 m2 m 2 and had a bimodal curve two peak values of each year occurred in the wgs and rgs respectively generally in one year the first peak value in the wgs was lower than the second one in the rgs 3 2 seasonal variations in nee gpp re and et seasonal variations in nee gpp re and et at the site were associated with crop development fig 3 for nee a positive negative value represents a carbon source sink ecosystem daily nee was close to zero in the early stages of the wgs from october to next february then quickly decreased to its minimum value before increasing and exceeding 0 from may to early june i e the maturing stage fig 3a in the rgs daily nee had a rapid decrease and reached its minimum value after the rice was planted fig 3a and then underwent a steep increase to a value above 0 when the rice entered the maturing stage i e mid september in addition to nee apparent seasonal variations occurred in gpp and re fig 3b c daily gpp increased and peaked from late march to late may in the wgs or from late june to july in the rgs and then decreased at the maturing stage fig 3b re also decreased at the maturing stage of the wgs and rgs although a higher t a occurred at this stage fig 3c furthermore a phase difference existed between the maximum values of gpp and re the maximum gpp usually coincided with the minimum nee but was ahead of the maximum re values for the wgs and rgs fig 3b c overall et followed a similar pattern to gpp seasonally ranging from 0 to 6 77 mm d 1 fig 3d for the wgs et was low in the early growing stage peak water use occurred around april and then decreased until harvest compared with the wgs et rapidly increased from late june to july in the rgs this result was mainly due to the high evaporation of the flood water tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the negative cumulative nee in the wgs and rgs indicating the cultivated land acted as a carbon sink although the daily mean nee in the wgs was lower than that in the rgs tables 2 and 3 the cumulative nee in the wgs 324 35 58 20 gc m 2 a 1 closely resembled the rgs 328 98 34 35 gc m 2 a 1 similar characteristics were observed in the cumulative gpp re and et tables 2 and 3 3 3 controls on nee gpp re and et to further understand the relative importance of different environmental factors on co2 and water fluxes results from the brt analysis are shown in figs 4 and 5 the most important controlling factor of nee was lai in this study the lai contribution to nee reached 57 62 in the wgs fig 4a and 53 30 in the rgs fig 5a in the wgs the response of nee was positive when lai was 0 4 m2 m 2 fig 4b as lai increased the nee started to decrease and finally reached the maximum co2 absorption similar response characteristics occurred in the rgs however there was a tendency of nee toward neutral or positive when lai was 0 8 m2 m 2 fig 5b in addition to lai r n impacted nee contributing 21 62 in the wgs fig 4a and 31 89 in the rgs fig 5a the overall pattern was as follows fig 4c the nee in the wgs began positive and became negative as r n shifted until it reached 23 w m 2 in comparison nee in the rgs was negative when r n rose above 41 w m 2 fig 5c lai and r n were the two most important controllers of gpp fig 4d demonstrates that the lai contribution reached 80 03 and the r n contribution reached 14 32 in the wgs the partial dependence plot indicated the gpp of the wgs changed abruptly after a lai increase until the gpp reached a plateau fig 4e in contrast to the lai response the r n relative influence curve displayed a trend of slowly increasing fig 4f fig 5d demonstrated that in the rgs the contributions of lai and r n to gpp were 57 20 and 27 70 respectively the impact of lai on gpp in the rgs increased rapidly as lai increased however the gpp in the rgs stopped increasing and remained constant when lai approached 3 6 m2 m 2 fig 5e the gpp in the rgs responded to r n when r n was lower than 150 w m 2 and gpp remained constant once r n exceeded 150 w m 2 fig 5f fig 4g demonstrates the largest contribution to re in the wgs was t a 57 18 followed by lai 34 59 in the wgs fig 4h the re did not change significantly with t a when t a was below 0 c or above 24 c and increased drastically with increasing t a when t a ranged from 13 to 24 c fig 4i demonstrates the relative influence curve of lai and displayed an increasing re trend in the wgs once lai was above 2 5 m2 m 2 its effect on re reached a maximum level in the rgs lai and t a were the two most important controllers of re fig 5g in contrast to the lai response in the wgs its influence curve in the rgs firstly increased from 1 to 2 5 m2 m 2 then slightly decreased and finally remained constant when lai was above 2 5 m2 m 2 fig 5h when t a was in the range of 20 30 c its effect on re in the rgs drastically increased fig 5i r n was the most critical controller of et the contribution of r n to et was 85 06 in the wgs fig 4j and 80 16 in the rgs fig 5j fig 4k demonstrates that et increased in parallel with r n in the wgs similar response characteristics occurred in the rgs fig 5k in addition to r n lai posed a limited influence on et in the crop growing seasons which were 6 06 in the wgs fig 4j and 6 37 in the rgs fig 5j in contrast to the r n response the relative influence curve of lai had a slowly increasing trend in the wgs fig 4l in the rgs et did not change significantly with lai when lai was above 1 m2 m 2 fig 5l 4 discussion 4 1 nee and et comparisons with previous studies to compare our results with previous studies the ec based results of nee and et for the wgs and rgs between 14 n and 50 n are listed in table 4 table 4 clearly shows obvious variation in the nee or et at the different sites these variations are attributed to different climate and soil conditions biotic factors crop types and agricultural management practices swain et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 for example the co2 absorption indicated by nee in the wgs at our site was higher than that at the yucheng site 36 83 n 116 57 e in the north china plain this discrepancy may be attributed to the soil type and cropping system the yucheng site has saline alkali soil with lime which reduced the net co2 absorption due to the lime emitting co2 mosharrof et al 2021 furthermore the crops planted in the previous season at yucheng site i e maize was different to our site i e rice in addition the two sites have different local climatic conditions which may also have caused the large differences in nee between the sites compared with other sites the co2 absorption in the wgs at our site was smaller than that of the lonzÃ©e site belgium aubinet et al 2009 and selhausen site germany schmidt et al 2012 and our et results in the wgs were also smaller these may be due to variations in climatic conditions and the duration of the wgs for the rgs the co2 absorption at our site was comparable to that at the cuttack site india bhattacharyya et al 2013 tsukuba site japan saito et al 2005 and cheorwon site korea pastorello et al 2020 but higher than that at the los baÃ±os site philippines alberto et al 2011 table 4 an important reason may be because the los baÃ±os site is in the tropical monsoon climatic region with higher temperatures and vpd alberto et al 2011 furthermore the flooded crop management and aerobic soil condition at the los baÃ±os site are inconsistent with the other sites causing a higher et result than any other sites in table 4 the comparisons also highlight a large spatial variation in the estimated nee or et across the different studies this discrepancy requires further investigation into the influencing factors of nee and et at the spatial scale using additional multi site datasets and geostatistical analysis methods the variation in the nee or et between the wgs and rgs at our site are shown in tables 2 and 3 daily mean nee and et in the wgs were lower than those in the rgs however the cumulative nee or et in the wgs was close to that in the rgs an important reason is the difference in the growing season lengths which were 224 days in the wgs and 117 days in the rgs table 1 4 2 controlling factors on co2 and water fluxes previous studies have indicated that r n is the dominant controlling factor of nee at the half hourly scale baldocchi 2014 patel et al 2021 however recent studies identified the controlling factors of nee might vary at different timescales this suggestion is controversial due to the lack of long term data available montagnani et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for example some studies have indicated that t a and vpd had larger impacts on seasonal variability in the daily nee than r n li et al 2018 novick et al 2016 in comparison our brt analysis found that lai was the dominant controlling factor of nee and gpp for the wgs fig 4 and rgs fig 5 this finding shows a larger impact of biotic factors as the timescale increases from half hourly to daily hayek et al 2018 wu et al 2017 an important reason may be because lai can directly reflect the growth conditions of the crop and the effective areas of canopy photosynthesis thereby affecting canopy photosynthesis rate and aboveground plant respiration gao et al 2017 therefore lai is founded to be the dominant factor controlling the seasonal variations of gpp and nee rather than other environmental variables many current crop models mainly use different environmental variables to simulate crop growth and co2 flux huang et al 2019 our result highlights the importance of accounting for lai when modeling nee gpp and re for rice wheat rotation systems in addition to lai our results indicated that r n remained critical ranking second in explaining the seasonal variation in the nee and gpp figs 4 and 5 several studies have highlighted that photosynthesis rather than respiration strongly dominates nee variations baldocchi 2014 ouyang et al 2014 photosynthesis and respiration are the function of radiation and temperature respectively jia et al 2018 therefore r n and gpp should oscillate synchronously whereas t a and re or gpp change at similar paces figs 4 and 5 however the relative influence of r n on co2 flux varied between the wgs and rgs as for et we found that it was dominantly controlled by r n in the wgs and rgs figs 4j and 5j which suggests the available energy played an important role in modulating et processes at our site liu et al 2019 similar findings have been reported in previous studies alberto et al 2011 han et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 considering the importance of r n in co2 flux and et changes future crop models should be further improved in order to allow the direct use of r n instead of the total radiation as an input variable 4 3 limitations and future work although we attempted to understand the seasonal dynamics of nee gpp re and et in a rice wheat rotation system complex relationships exist between them and their influencing factors for example unfavorable climate events had remarkable impacts on co2 and water fluxes during the main growing period notably the early spring drought and subsequent continuous precipitation events caused a lower gpp during the wgs from 2009 to 2010 fig 2d a reasonable evaluation of these complex relationships under different hydro climatic conditions is required to obtain sufficient long term data this is the focus of the next stage of our research we will also undertake long term measurements of co2 and water fluxes at our site to estimate the pattern and magnitude of nee gpp re and et at different timescales and quantify the annual net carbon and greenhouse gas budget in a rice wheat rotation system in the yangtze huaihe region dai et al 2019 cropland management activities e g irrigation also impact the nee gpp re and et bai et al 2015 gao et al 2018 yang et al 2016 however the impacts of cropland management were not fully realized due to lack of available data furthermore the ec data during the non growing seasons was removed in our study because we need to maintain the observation instruments during this period we therefore hope to collect further detailed data e g in site lai irrigation and soil properties data and utilize the ecosystem model to analyze the impacts of cropland management on nee gpp re and et in different seasons e g the rgs wgs and non growing season in our future work 5 conclusions this study analyzed the seasonal dynamics of co2 and water fluxes we identified the primary controlling factors on these fluxes in a rice wheat rotation system in the yangtze huaihe region using data generated over the long term our results indicate that daily nee gpp re and et show seasonal variations across the whole growing seasons the rice wheat rotation field was potentially a sink for co2 the rice paddy field had higher cumulative values of nee gpp re and et than the wheat field the specific environmental factors and crop development made large contributions to the co2 and water fluxes for instance in both the wgs and rgs lai was the primary controlling factor of nee and gpp while t a and lai displayed essential roles in controlling re however the contributions of the different factors on the co2 flux varied with the growing seasons as for et r n was the most important controller in the wgs and rgs which suggested that et at this site was limited by energy rather than water long term monitoring of co2 and water fluxes can provide basic data for calibrating key parameters in crop models based on model data fusion approaches to improve water use efficiency further work should include the additional of crop management data to analyze the impacts of biotic factors and crop management activities on co2 and water fluxes in the different crops to understand the distinct controlling

9179,quantifying tree water use and its environmental controlling mechanisms are significantly important for understanding of adaptation strategy of trees and plantation management in semiarid and arid regions here tree water consumption and tree conductance of chinese pine pinus tabuliformis plantation were quantified using sap flow measurements environmental variables were measured concurrently during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 results showed that daily daytime and nighttime tree water consumption averaged 27 4 24 7 and 2 7 kg d 1 across two years respectively nighttime tree water consumption accounted for 10 of the daily s which was mainly used for recharging stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration to avoid hydraulic failure daytime tree water consumption was more driven by solar radiation than by vapor pressure deficit moreover daytime tree conductance was 0 9 mm s 1 and significantly decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit and decreasing soil moisture indicating that trees had strict stomatal regulation on tree transpiration scaling up from tree to stand transpiration daytime stand transpiration averaged 1 1 mm d 1 across two years while accumulated stand transpiration was 112 8 mm and 126 8 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively accounting for 33 and 37 of precipitation however soil evaporation occupied 35 and 51 of precipitation in 2019 and 2020 respectively this indicated that most of water in the plantation was consumed by soil evaporation difference between precipitation and sum of daytime stand transpiration canopy interception soil evaporation and change in soil water storage was positive in two years indicating that water budget was balanced these findings indicated that chinese pine trees had strict stomatal regulation on tree transpiration and could recharge stem water storage deficit by nighttime sap flow moreover stand transpiration occupied a small part of the water balance and thus water supply was surplus resulting in maintaining the stability of chinese pine plantation graphical abstract ga1 keywords adaptation strategy plantation management sap flow nighttime tree water consumption transpiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is a limiting factor for tree growth and survival in semiarid and arid regions due to limited water supplies and high evapotranspiration in these regions grossiord et al 2018 eliades et al 2018 the air temperature and drought frequency and severity have already increased in most arid and semiarid regions and would continuously increase in the coming decades matusick et al 2018 andrews et al 2020 consequently the available water for trees in these regions is probably to decrease which would affect the tree ecophysiological processes such as water use and related eco hydrological processes muÃ±oz villers et al 2018 song et al 2021 several studies have shown that drought induced forest dieback and mortality are associated with the high water demand for trees around the world brÃ©da et al 2006 choat et al 2018 song et al 2021 to properly manage forests and water resources it is urgent to evaluate the water use of trees and their responses to environmental drives under climate change scenarios flo et al 2019 tu et al 2019 tree water use is a fundamental factor in the understanding of the ecophysiology of plantations and plays a key role in water balance in the arid and semiarid regions because it is the main component of evapotranspiration tsuruta et al 2019 tu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 therefore accurate quantification of the water use of trees is significant for forest and water resource management han et al 2019 the sap flow technique provides a powerful tool for quantifying tree water use transpiration and elucidating the physiological responses of trees to environmental conditions dix and aubrey 2021 there are multiple sap flow methods employed presently including heat pulse heat balance heat field deformation and thermal dissipation flo et al 2019 each sap flow method has advantages and disadvantages flo et al 2019 dix and aubrey 2021 but the thermal dissipation method is the most commonly applied technique for measurements of tree water use transpiration in ecology and forestry studies due to its low cost and relatively easy sensor assembly and field installation chan and bowling 2017 dix and aubrey 2021 in addition tree water use is affected by environmental variables e g vapor pressure deficit solar radiation wind speed precipitation soil moisture and groundwater level he et al 2020 oogathoo et al 2020 rana et al 2020 hayat et al 2021 tree water use response to the environmental variables is attained by adjustments of stomata which exerts a significant influence on the balance between carbon uptake and water losses that affect the survival and growth of trees in arid and semiarid regions coupel ledru et al 2016 ghimire et al 2018 for example as the vapor pressure deficit of the air increases tree transpiration increases until a certain threshold at which stomata close to keep the water potential above a critical level at which cavitations occur zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2020 additionally soil drying triggers a gradual closure of stomata and a reduction in transpiration rate avoiding embolism and the collapse of conductive tissue hayat et al 2020 under such conditions most trees with dimorphic root systems are likely to take up water from deeper soil layers e g groundwater to maintain transpiration in semiarid and arid regions ellsworth and sternberg 2015 shen et al 2015 therefore determining the effect of environmental variables on tree water use is important to understand the water use strategies of trees and manage plantations in semiarid and arid regions quentin et al 2011 jiao et al 2019 he et al 2020 nighttime water use is an important part of daily water use which is an important water use strategy to adapt to the environment wang et al 2018 han et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 hayat et al 2021 nighttime water use could contribute to the refilling of embolized conduits resulting from daytime transpiration oxygen delivery to xylem parenchyma in the trunks of larger trees prevention of excess leaf turgor at night and enhanced carbon uptake in the early morning hours snyder et al 2003 fricke 2019 zhao et al 2019 wu et al 2020 several studies have reported that the proportion of nighttime water use to daily water use in woody species averaged approximately 12 although values up to 30 60 have also been observed siddiq and cao 2018 dayer et al 2021 wu et al 2020 however there is limited research on the nighttime water use behavior of trees in the semiarid and arid regions which has a disadvantage in understanding the water use strategies of trees in these regions chinese pine pinus tabuliformis is an evergreen coniferous tree species which is naturally distributed widely in water limited regions of northern china song et al 2019 li et al 2020 due to its strong stress resistance this tree species is commonly used for establishing protective forest plantations to reduce wind speed and to enhance sand fixation in the semiarid and arid sandy regions especially in the keerqin sandy land song et al 2020 several studies have reported that pinus sylvestris var mongolica and populus spp plantations had emerged dieback and mortality in extreme drought years in the keerqin sandy land whereas the chinese pine plantations grow very healthy under the same water condition zhu et al 2008 li et al 2020 song et al 2020 water is the key factor affecting tree growth and survival in the keerqin sandy land song et al 2021 however the dynamic of water use of chinese pine and its role in the water budget of the plantations are still fully unknown besides the precipitation has exhibited strong inter annual variations in the keeqin sandy land and the weather condition is continued warming zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020 nevertheless the response of tree water use to environmental variables remains unclear therefore it is necessary to quantify tree water use and its response to environmental variables which contribute to the understanding of the mechanism underlying maintaining the stability of chinese pine plantations and proper plantation management the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the tree water consumption daily daytime and nighttime 2 determine the environmental and stomatal control of tree water use 3 assess the role of stand transpiration on the water budget investigations are carried out in chinese pine plantations in semiarid sandy land 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this experiment was conducted in the zhanggutai region 42 43 n 122 22 e 226 a s l liaoning province china located in the southeastern part of keerqin sandy land which belongs to the semiarid climatic zone the mean annual temperature is approximately 6 7 c mean from 1954 to 2019 and the mean annual precipitation is 477 mm mean for the period of 1954 2010 with more than 70 of precipitation occurring between june and august the mean annual pan evaporation is approximately 1580 mm song et al 2020 the frost free period is approximately 154 days and snow cover last approximately 33 days song et al 2020 the major soil type was arenosols which develop from sandy parent material through wind action zhu et al 2008 the main tree species in the study region included pinus sylvestris var mongolica litv populus xiaozhuanica w y hsu et liang pinus tabuliformis carr and ulmus pumila l the understory of plantations was annual grass and herbs such as potentilla anserine l cleistogenes chinensis maxim keng artemisia frigida willd and setaria viridis l beauv song et al 2019 in the present study the chinese pine plantation was selected in may 2019 and the area of this plantation was approximately 7 0 ha this pine plantation was 48 years old in 2019 and was a mature plantation the tree density was 467 trees ha 1 the mean diameter at breast height dbh was 20 5 cm in 2019 and increased to 20 6 cm in 2020 the mean tree height was 8 1 and 8 2 m in 2019 and 2020 respectively the canopy density and leaf area index lai was 0 75 and 1 21 m2 m 2 respectively 2 2 measurement of meteorological data soil moisture and groundwater level meteorological variables including air temperature t a oc air relative humidity rh and solar radiation r s w m 2 were measured in open areas near the study plot approximately 500 m these measurements were scanned at 60 s intervals and recorded as 10 min averages detailed information on the measurement methods of meteorological variables can be found in song et al 2022 besides the above measurement air temperature ta oc air relative humidity rh solar radiation w m 2 precipitation p mm and wind speed ws m s 1 were also monitored hourly in an automatic weather station near the study plot the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from air temperature and air relative humidity using the following formula campbell and norman 1998 1 v p d 0 611 exp 17 502 t a t a 240 97 1 r h the volumetric soil water content Î¸ was continuously monitored within the plantation with ec 5 sensors decagon inc decagon usa and calibrated against the gravimetric method the five ec 5 sensors were installed at soil depths of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 80 cm and 125 cm at a single location under the canopy of the sampling tree with one sensor per soil depth which represented the soil layers of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 150 cm respectively although there was only one sampling point for measuring soil moisture it was under the canopy of the sampling trees which could reflect the water condition of trees to some extent chang et al 2014 molina et al 2019 in addition the groundwater level gwl was continuously measured in the drilling well within the studied plot by hobo water level logger u20 001 01 onset computer corporation usa and was recorded every 6 h on average 2 3 measurement of sap flux and calculation of tree water consumption and tree conductance in this study eight health trees with different dbh were selected as sample trees for sap flux measurement in the plantation based on the distribution frequency of dbh table 1 the sampling trees were selected with dbhs ranging from 15 5 cm to 25 1 cm in 2019 and these values covered most of the tree diameters 14 cm dbh 26 cm table 1 although only 8 trees were selected to estimate sap flux density in the present study which was lower than the optimal sample size of 15 trees with a coefficient of variation ranging between 10 2 and 15 7 reported by kume et al 2010 it was in the accredited range reported by cai et al 2010 they reported that the sample sizes of trees for sap flux density estimations should be between 5 and 8 for pine species in temperate zones with a coefficient of variation between 9 and 15 and this sample size is widely applied in sap flux measurements for plantation forests around the world liu and biondi 2020 lyu et al 2020 taborski et al 2022 the granier type thermal dissipation probes tdps granier 1987 were applied to continuously measure the sap flux of chinese pine trees during two consecutive growing seasons july june september of 2019 and 2020 the thermal dissipation method is commonly applied to quantify whole tree water use and transpiration due to its simple relatively inexpensive and increasingly robust features flo et al 2019 oogathoo et al 2020 each probe pair was inserted into the sapwood of the sample trees vertically approximately 15 cm apart on the north facing side of the trunk at breast height to minimize radiation effects zhang et al 2015 lyu et al 2020 each probe sensor tdp20 consisted of a pair of probes 20 mm long and 2 mm in diameter and a copper constant thermocouple was placed in each probe the upper probe included a heater that was supplied with a constant power of 0 15 w and the lower probe was unheated for reference liu and biondi 2020 lyu et al 2020 song et al 2022 the sensor was mounted with waterproof silicone and covered with an aluminum box cover to avoid physical damage and thermal influences from radiation xu et al 2020 the temperature difference between the two probes was measured every 10 s and 10 min averages were recorded on a data logger cr1000x campbell scientific inc logan ut usa sap flux density fd can be empirically determined from the measured temperature difference using the following relationship granier 1987 2 f d Î± k Î² in which 3 k Î´ t m Î´ t Î´ t where fd g cm 2 s 1 is sap flux density k is a dimensionless sap flow index and Î± and Î² are fitted parameters empirically determined by granier 1987 to be 0 0119 g cm 2 s 1 and 1 231 respectively however several studies observed that for a given k the granier s parameters could underestimate fd in several conifer tree species and species specific sap flow calibration is needed flo et al 2019 fujime et al 2021 dix and aubrey 2021 song et al 2022 performed sap flow calibration for the chinese pine by comparing gravimetrically induced flows through a stem segment against k measured with tdp sensors and the novel calibration curve showed that Î± and Î² were 0 0133 and 1 024 respectively therefore the novel fitted parameters for the chinese pine Î± 0 0133 and Î² 1 024 were used for the present calculation Î´t oc is the instantaneous temperature difference between the two probes Î´tm represents the Î´t when sap flux density is zero during a day considering the sap flux density may not reach zero every night the daily maximum values of Î´t are not appropriate to represent Î´tm therefore the double regression method was used to determine the Î´tm using the maximum Î´t of successive 7 10 days periods to avoid the underestimation of nocturnal sap flux lu et al 2004 cooper et al 2019 the double regression model was performing a linear regression of local Î´tm values that were determined by a 7 10 days moving window and then local Î´tm below the linear regression line were eliminated and new linear regression was made based on the remaining data points then the new Î´tm was calculated by the new linear regression lu et al 2004 rabbel et al 2016 in order to more accurately quantify the water consumption of the chinese pine trees in the present study the azimuthal and radial variations of sap flux density in six sampling trees were measured in the studied plot from may 5 to june 16 of 2022 except from may 17 to may 28 due to power failure the detailed information for the six sampling trees were shown in table s1 four tdp sensors with a length of 20 mm and 2 mm in diameter were installed in each of three sampling trees at 1 3 m height in four directions i e east south west and north to investigate the azimuthal variation of sap flux density table s1 to extrapolate sap flux density in the north direction fd n using the north sensor as a reference to the four integrated directions averaged over the four directions the correction coefficient ca that accounted for the four integrated directions was calculated by dividing the mean sap flux density in the four directions by sap flux density in the north direction for the three sampling trees as described by shinohara et al 2013 in addition radial profiles of sap flux density were also determined from another three sampling trees table s1 in each sampling tree sap flux density at three sapwood depths 0 10 mm 0 20 mm and 20 40 mm was measured using tdp sensors on the north facing side of the sample trees at a height of 1 3 m to extrapolate sap flux density from the 0 20 mm sapwood depth fdref using 0 20 mm depth sensor as a reference to the entire sapwood area the correction coefficient cr that accounted for both the radial profile of sap flux density and the area of the sapwood annulus sampled at each depth was calculated for the three sample trees as described by delzon et al 2004 in the present study first the sum of the sap flux densities at each depth 0 10 mm 10 20 mm 20 40 mm was calculated during the measurement period second the sap flux density ratio at each depth was calculated by the sum of the sap flux densities at each depth divided by that at a reference depth of 0 20 mm then cr was the sum of the sap flux density ratios at each depth multiplied by the corresponding cross sectional sapwood area sampled at each depth divided by the entire sapwood area delzon et al 2004 however in the present study we did not directly measure the fd at the 10 20 mm sapwood depth fd10 20 it could be calculated from the sap flux density at 0 10 mm fd0 10 and 0 20 mm fd0 20 sapwood depths according to iida and tanaka 2010 as follows 4 f d 10 20 f d 0 20 a f d 0 10 b where a is the proportion of the sapwood area from depths of 0 10 mm to that of 0 20 mm and b is the proportion of the sapwood area from depths of 10 20 mm to that of 0 20 mm for the sampling tree with a sapwood thickness of more than 40 mm table s1 we did not measure the sap flux density at 40 mm sapwood depth in the present study and we assumed it was to be the mean of the sap flux density at 20 40 mm sapwood depth and the sap flux density at heartwood e g 0 given former studies shown that it gradually decreases in the inner xylem for pine species ford et al 2004 molina et al 2016 bodo and arain 2021 it is widely known that the wound created by the insertion of thermal dissipation probes can cause changes to wood s physical and thermal properties resulting in an underestimation of sap flux density particularly in ring porous hardwoods wiedemann et al 2016 molina et al 2019 in the present study the wound effect on the sap flux density was assessed for the sampling trees by the time series of mean daily sap flux density values from the new installation tdp sensors at 0 20 mm sapwood depth in the north direction of the six sampling trees in 2022 table s1 according to the recommendations of wiedemann et al 2016 and molina et al 2019 the correction factor cw for the wound effects was calculated by comparing the mean daily sap flow values from six new installation tdp sensors in 2022 before and after the described wounding effect appeared based on the above the tree water consumption qt then can be calculated as follows 5 q t c a c r c w f d a s where c a is the correction coefficient that extrapolates fd in the north direction to that in the four integrated directions c r is the correction coefficient that extrapolates fd at 0 20 mm sapwood depth to that at the entire sapwood area cw is the correction coefficient for wound effects and it was 1 25 0 0030 0 0024 1 25 a s is the sapwood area cm2 calculated using an exponential regression between as and dbh as 0 31dbh2 12 n 14 r2 0 96 which was established by song et al 2022 according to the results in the fig s1 the sap flux density in four directions had the same diurnal variations but the sap flux density was highest in the east direction followed by in the south and west directions and the lowest value was in the north direction fig s1a moreover the mean sap flux density at the four integrated directions for three sampling trees was 1 199 times that in the north direction during the measurement period fig s1b which indicated that ca was 1 199 in the present study in addition based on fig s2 the sap flux density ratios at sapwood depths of 0 10 mm 10 20 mm 20 40 mm and 40 mm for three sampling trees were 0 53 1 50 0 66 and 0 33 respectively additionally the mean ratios of sapwood area at 0 10 mm 10 20 mm 20 40 mm and 40 mm sapwood depth to total sapwood area were 0 29 0 26 0 41 and 0 04 respectively therefore the cr was 0 831 in the present study we assumed that the mean ca and cr determined respectively from three sampling trees could represent the ca and cr for the 8 measured trees in addition to reveal the water use strategies of the chinese pine trees the daytime qt day and nighttime qt night tree water consumption were calculated in the present study the qt day and qt night were defined as the water consumption that occurred when the rs were more and less than 5 0 w m 2 respectively di et al 2019 wu et al 2020 mean tree conductance gt mm s 1 was calculated from qt day per unit ground projection of the canopy and meteorological variables according to hawthorne and miniat 2018 and grossiord et al 2018 using the expression as follows 6 g t k g q t d a y c v p d where kg is a function of temperature 115 8 0 4236 ta kpa m3 kg 1 which accounts for the temperature effects on the psychometric constant latent heat of vaporization and the specific heat and density of air ewers et al 2001 mcdowell et al 2008 c is the ground projection of the canopy table 1 estimates of tree conductance in this manner assumed that leaf temperature equaled air temperature vpd was relatively homogeneous within the canopy and stem capacitance was minor during the period used for calculations ewers and oren 2000 grossiord et al 2018 in the present study we calculated daily gt when vpd 0 6 kpa to maximize the likelihood of meeting the above assumptions ewers and oren 2000 hawthorne and miniat 2018 2 4 stand transpiration and water balance in this study daytime stand transpiration per unit ground area et mm d 1 was calculated by multiplying the weighted average daytime sap flux density of the sampled trees f davg with the cumulative sapwood area of the plot a c and divided by ground area ap according to jiao et al 2019 and chen et al 2020 7 f d a v g 1 n t r e e q t day i 1 n t r e e a s i 8 e t d a y f d a v g a c a p where n tree is the number of sampling trees n 8 qt dayi is the daytime tree water consumption of sampling tree i the asi is the sapwood area of the sampling tree ac is the cumulative sapwood area of the studied plots 8086 cm2 in 2019 and 8216 cm2 in 2020 whereas ap is the ground surface area for the studied plot 900 m2 the water balance for the chinese pine plantation monthly can be estimated according to the equation as follow 9 p e t d a y e s e i e u Î´ s r whereas p is precipitation mm et day is the daytime stand transpiration mm es is soil evaporation mm eu is the understory transpiration Î´s is the changes in soil water storage mm and r is surface runoff in the present study eu and r can be neglected because of a sparse understory of grasses and low water holding capacity for the sandy soil respectively shen et al 2015 song et al 2020 the canopy interception ei was estimated by the revised analytical model of gash et al 1995 using the forest structure canopy density of 0 75 and average evaporation parameters established by fang et al 2013 for the chinese pine plantation in addition soil evaporation es was measured by a micro lysimeter which is considered an effective method liu et al 2017 song et al 2021 the micro lysimeters were made of pvc material 10 cm in internal diameter and 30 cm in height which was capped with a nylon net at the bottom of the micro lysimeter to allow the free drainage of water liu et al 2017 song et al 2021 five micro lysimeters were installed uniformly in the plot in 2019 the micro lysimeters were weighed using an electronic balance a precision of 0 01 g at the same time every two days i e approximately 19 00 to determine the water loss xu et al 2020 furthermore the changes in soil water storage Î´s at a monthly scale were calculated as follows 10 Î´ s s f s b where sb and sf are the soil water storage across all soil layers 0 150 cm at the beginning stage the first day of each month and the final stage the last day of each month respectively soil water storage s mm was calculated across all soil layers as follows 11 s i 1 n Î¸ i d i whereas Î¸i is the volumetric soil moisture of the ith layer di is the thickness of the ith soil layer mm and n is the number of soil layers measured in the present study n 5 2 5 data analyses in this study significant differences in qt among daily daytime and nighttime qt night qt daily among different months and tree conductance among different months were tested using one way anova besides the regression analysis was applied to analyze the relationship between qt night and qt day ta night vpdnight or wsnight during the measurement period furthermore the exponential threshold model was applied to analyze the relationships between qt day and vpd or rs as below 12 q t d a y Î² 0 1 e Î² 1 x where Î²0 and Î²1 are fitting parameters qt day is daytime tree water consumption and x is corresponding meteorological variables in addition the sigmoidal model was used to investigate the relationship between qt day and daytime Î¸ during the measurement period whereas the regression analysis was applied to analyze the relationship between qt day and daytime gwl during the measurement period the responses of gt to vpd can be described by a linear logarithmic equation oren et al 1999 as follows 13 g t g r m ln v p d where gr and m are the fitted parameters representing the reference value of gt at vpd 1 kpa and the sensitivity of gt to lnvpd respectively additionally the regression analysis was applied to investigate the relationships between gt and Î¸day during the measurement period across two years all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 software package spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 environmental variables the total precipitation during the measurement period of 2019 july september and 2020 june september was 339 7 mm and 341 6 mm respectively accounting for 120 and 95 of precipitation over the same period 283 6 and 361 0 mm fig 1 in addition the volumetric soil moisture Î¸ in the upper layer displayed a quick increase after precipitation events but gradually decrease thereafter due to precipitation and evaporation as a result the Î¸ of shallow layers tended to be highly variable in both years although the Î¸ in the deep soil layer showed similar changes to those in the shallow layers their variability was relatively low fig 1 the weighted average Î¸ across all soil layers ranged from 5 8 to 14 4 during the measurement period with the mean value of 10 7 and 9 4 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 furthermore the groundwater level is elevated when the precipitation was more during the measurement period with the mean value of 5 9 ranging from 5 6 to 6 2 m and 6 0 m ranging from 5 8 to 6 2 m in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 the daily air temperature ta ranged from 10 2 to 30 2 oc during the measurement period with the mean value of 22 5 and 22 4 oc in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 2a the daily vapor pressure deficit vpd averaged 1 0 and 1 2 kpa during the measurement period of 2019 and 2020 respectively ranging from 0 2 to 2 3 kpa across two years fig 2b the daily solar radiation rs varied between 40 8 and 420 7 w m 2 during the measurement period with the mean value of 235 5 and 255 9 wm 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 2c 3 2 sap flux density and daily daytime and nighttime tree water consumption diurnal course of sap flux densities fd during five representative days weighted mean values for eight sampling trees and the corresponding environmental variables are shown in fig 3 on a sunny day the sap flow generally increased from approximately 6 00 am reached a peak value at approximately 11 00 am and gradually decreased thereafter fig 3a daily variations in fd appeared to be related to variations in ta vpd and rs e g fd increased rapidly in the morning as the ta vpd and rs increased and reached a maximum value before ta vpd and rs peaking and fd subsequently decreased fig 3b the daily tree water consumption qt daily and daytime tree water consumption qt day had similar temporal dynamics during the measurement period which was different from the nighttime tree water consumption qt night fig 4a during the measurement period the qt daily and qt day ranged from 1 5 to 48 4 kg d 1 tree 1 and from 1 3 to 42 0 kg d 1 tree 1 respectively with the mean value of 27 4 and 24 7 kg d 1 tree 1 however the qt night only averaged 2 7 kg d 1 tree 1 during the measurement period ranging between 0 2 and 8 7 kg d 1 tree 1 fig 4a in addition the ratio of qt night to qt daily ranged from 0 02 to 0 4 during the measurement period with a mean value of 0 1 fig 4b the qt significantly differed among daytime nighttime and daily in each month during the measurement period fig 5a the maximum monthly mean qt daily and qt day were in june of 2020 with the value of 35 6 and 33 5 kg d 1 tree 1 respectively whereas the minimum monthly mean qt daily and qt day occurred in august of 2020 with the value of 18 1 and 16 2 kg d 1 tree 1 fig 5a however for the qt night the maximum monthly value occurred in september of 2019 4 7 kg d 1 tree 1 while the minimum monthly value was in august of 2020 1 9 kg d 1 tree 1 fig 5a moreover the monthly mean ratio of qt night to qt daily was higher in september of 2019 0 14 whereas it was lowest in june of 2020 0 06 fig 5b 3 3 daytime and nighttime tree water consumption relationships with environmental variables there was a significant and positive relationship between qt night and qt day during the measurement period but the qt day explained only 22 of the variation of qt night fig 6a besides a significant negative relationship between qt night and nighttime air temperature ta night was found during the measurement period fig 6b however no significant relationship between qt night and nighttime vpd vpd night or nighttime wind speed ws night was observed during the measurement period fig 6c and d the qt day displayed an exponentially saturating response to daily vpd and tended to level off at higher values of vpd e g vpd 2 0 kpa during the measurement period fig 7a the vpd explained 42 of the variation in qt day during the measurement period in addition the qt day significantly increased as the rs increased and rs explained 47 of the variation in qt day during the measurement period fig 7b the qt day significantly increased with increasing Î¸ when the Î¸ was less than approximately 8 whereas it was stable when the Î¸ was more than approximately 8 fig 7c the qt day significantly linearly decreased with increasing daytime gwl during the measurement and the gwl only explained 12 of variations in qt day fig 7d 3 4 tree conductance and its relationships with environmental variables the tree conductance gt ranged from 0 5 to 1 6 mm s 1 during the measurement period of 2019 with a mean value of 1 0 mm s 1 fig 8a however the gt averaged 0 8 mm s 1 during the measurement period of 2020 ranging from 0 1 to 1 4 mm s 1 fig 8a additionally the mean monthly gt was highest in september of 2020 with the value of 1 1 mm s 1 whereas it was lowest in july and august of 2020 with the values of 0 6 and 0 7 mm s 1 respectively fig 8b furthermore the gt was significantly negatively correlated with daytime vpd during the measurement period and vpd explained approximately 42 of the variation in gt moreover the ratio of the sensitivity of gt to lnvpd to gr was approximately 0 44 during the measurement period fig 9a additionally the gt significantly linearly increased with increasing daytime Î¸ during the measurement period and the daytime Î¸ could explain 46 of variations in gt during the measurement period fig 9b 3 5 stand transpiration and its role in the water balance of chinese pine plantation the daytime stand transpiration per unit ground area et day ranged from 0 06 to 1 8 mm d 1 during the measurement period of 2019 with a mean value of 1 2 mm d 1 during the measurement period of 2020 the et day averaged 1 0 mm d 1 ranging from 0 07 to 1 9 mm d 1 fig 10 during the measurement period the maximum monthly et occurred in june of 2020 44 9 mm whereas the lowest monthly et day was in august of 2020 22 4 mm table 2 in addition the accumulated et day during the measurement period of 2019 and 2020 was 112 8 mm and 126 8 mm respectively only accounting for 33 and 37 of precipitation over the same period fig 10 and table 2 however the ratio of et day to p was significantly higher in low precipitation months than that in high precipitation months table 2 the maximum monthly ratio of et day to p was 1 86 in june of 2020 whereas the minimum monthly ratio of et day to p was 0 11 in august of 2020 in addition the total soil evaporation was 119 9 soil evaporation every two days with a coefficient of variation of 24 6 for five measuring points and 174 5 mm soil evaporation every two days with a coefficient of variation of 28 7 for five measuring points during the measurement periods of 2019 and 2020 respectively occupying 35 and 51 of precipitation over the same period table 2 furthermore the monthly differences between p and the sum of et day ei es and Î´s were positive during the measurement period except in july of 2020 when the precipitation and soil moisture was low table 2 during the measurement periods of 2019 and 2020 the total differences between p and the sum of et day ei es and Î´s were 81 9 mm and 12 5 mm respectively table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the water use of chinese pine in this study the daily tree water consumption averaged 27 4 kg d 1 ranging from 1 5 to 48 4 kg d 1 which was within the range observed for the other pine species around the world wieser et al 2014 urban et al 2019 for instance bosch et al 2014 reported that daily water uses of pinus elliottii engelm and pinus palustris mill trees ranged from 2 to 142 kg d 1 in a southeastern coastal plain riparian buffer system where the dbh ranged from 12 4 cm to 48 7 cm however the daily tree water consumption in the present study was low compared to the values reported for pinus sylvestris var mongolica trees and populus xiaozhuanica trees with a similar stand density in the study site for instance han et al 2020 reported that the daily tree water consumption was 32 8 kg d 1 for the 35 year old pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation with a density of 560 trees ha 1 and dbh of 20 7 cm during the growing season may october of 2013 song et al 2021 found that the daily tree water consumption was 33 5 kg d 1 during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 for the 14 year old populus xiaozhuanica plantation with a stand density of 433 trees ha 1 and mean dbh of 17 0 cm these indicated that the chinese pine consumed low water compared with other tree species in the study region although the stand age for the chinese pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica and populus xiaozhuanica plantations as mentioned above were different they all belong to middle age plantations additionally jiao 1989 also reported that the transpiration rate for the chinese pine 0 8 mg g 1 min 1 was low compared with the pinus sylvestris var mongolica 0 9 mg g 1 min 1 and poplar 2 9 mg g 1 min 1 with the similar tree age in the study region using the weighing method in the present study the low water consumption for chinese pine trees was likely due to the low average sap flow density and low sapwood area fig 3 moreover we found that the chinese pine trees had higher tree transpiration in june compared with other months fig 5a this may be related to the high growth period which was from may to june jiao 1989 during this period the chinese pine trees would consume more water to improve their high growth in addition we found that nighttime tree water consumption accounted for approximately 10 of daily tree water consumption during the measurement period which was within the range of reported values around the world phillips et al 2010 fricke 2019 zhao et al 2019 dayer et al 2021 for example han et al 2019 reported that the percentage of night time transpiration to daily transpiration of larix principis rupprechtii plantation was about 2 13 in a semi arid continental monsoon climate of gansu xinlong mountain northwestern china eliades et al 2018 reported that nocturnal sap flow was about 18 of the total sap flow in a semi arid pinus brutia forest nighttime sap flow is mainly used for either transpiration or replenishment of the water deficit in the stem wang et al 2018 previous studies had reported that the vapor pressure deficit and wind speed were the main environmental variables affecting tree night water consumption siddiq and cao 2018 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2020 by analyzing the correlation between nighttime water use and the nighttime vpd and wind speed the main function of the night time water use for transpiration or recharge can be illustrated daley and phillips 2006 wang et al 2018 han et al 2019 for example the variation in nighttime water use could not be explained by the nighttime vpd and ws which indicated that the nighttime water use was mainly used for recharge wang et al 2018 han et al 2019 in the present study a lack of significant relationship between et night and vpd night or ws night fig 6c and d indicated that nighttime water use was mainly used for recharging stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration to avoid hydraulic failure this was consistent with previous studies on larix principis rupprechtii in a semi arid continental monsoon climate han et al 2019 and the three co occurring tree species schima superba castanopsis hystrix and michelia macclurei in a low subtropical secondary broadleaf forest wang et al 2018 this was also supported by a significant and positive relationship between et night and et day this was because the water deficit increases as a result of day time transpiration and tree roots absorb the abundant water for transpiration to alleviate plant water stress han et al 2019 in addition we also found that soil moisture in july of 2019 9 7 august of 2019 11 3 and september of 2020 12 5 was higher than that in july of 2020 8 0 august of 2020 8 0 and september of 2019 11 1 respectively fig 2 however the ratio of nighttime tree water consumption to daily tree water consumption was higher in july of 2020 august of 2020 and september of 2019 than that in july of 2019 august of 2019 and september of 2020 respectively especially in september fig 5b this indicated that the contribution of nighttime water use to daily water use increased as the soil moisture decreased which contribute to enhanced nighttime water recharge for avoiding hydraulic failure under prolonged drought fang et al 2018 chen et al 2020 similar to our findings hayat et al 2021 reported that the proportion of nighttime sap flow for salix psammophila could increase during plant acclimatization in response to increasing temperature and water shortages in the southern edge of the mu us desert this was an important adaptation strategy for the survival and growth of chinese pine in a semiarid sandy environment 4 2 environmental and stomatal control of tree transpiration of chinese pine in the present study the daytime tree water consumption significantly increased as air vpd and rs increased during the measurement period and tended to be a level off when vpd was 2 0 kpa fig 7a and b these findings were consistent with those of previous reports for pine species around the world wieser et al 2014 brito et al 2015 ghimire et al 2018 for example urban et al 2019 reported that the sap flow of pinus sylvestris significantly increased with vpd and appeared to level off at high levels of vpd in central siberia ghimire et al 2014 observed that tree transpiration of pinus roxburghii plantation increased sharply with vpd at low levels and tended to level off at higher vpd values in the lesser himalaya of central nepal in the present study tree transpiration to saturate at high vapor pressure deficit was attributed to gradual stomatal closure at higher vpd fig 9a under high vpd conditions stomata need to close sufficiently to avoid hydraulic failure caused by a decrease in leaf water potential that was caused by high tree transpiration rates gao et al 2015 additionally solar radiation explained more variability of daytime tree water consumption than vapor pressure deficit during the measurement period fig 7a and b which indicated that tree transpiration was more controlled by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit on a daily scale this finding was consistent with those of other studies showing that daily tree transpiration was more explained by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit due to more favorable water conditions for trees collins 2015 generally tree transpiration was dictated by solar energy in sufficient water conditions therefore solar radiation played a more important role in controlling tree transpiration than the vapor pressure deficit in the present study possibly because of the high soil moisture level for pine trees fig 1 it is well known that soil water availability was an important factor controlling tree transpiration in semiarid and arid regions and tree transpiration generally increased as the soil moisture increased jiao et al 2019 song et al 2021 however in the present study we found that daytime tree water consumption significantly increased with increasing soil moisture when the daytime volumetric soil moisture was below approximately 8 0 and then level off thereafter fig 7c these results agreed with the findings of wang et al 2019 in larix principis rupprechtii plantation and jiao et al 2019 in robinia pseudoacacia plantation the possible reason for the observed stature pattern in tree transpiration with increasing soil moisture is related to the decrease in gt with decreasing soil moisture fig 9b stomatal conductance is gradually reduced to avoid hydraulic system failure when soil moisture decreases oren et al 1999 grossiord et al 2018 which represented an important mechanism for trees under drought conditions novick et al 2016 in addition a significant negative relationship between daytime tree water consumption and groundwater level was observed during the measurement period but groundwater level only explained a small part 12 of variations in daytime tree water consumption fig 7d this indicated that the groundwater level played a comparatively minor role in controlling tree transpiration compared with the other environmental variables for the chinese pine trees in the keerqin sandy land most of their roots were distributed within 1 5 m but several taproots could reach several meters in depth jiao 1989 song et al 2020 moreover the maximum height of capillary rise for groundwater was approximately 1 0 m in the keerqin sandy land thus the chinese pine could take up water from the capillary fringe or directly from groundwater when the soil water could not meet the transpiration demand in the same study site an isotope deuterium and oxygen analysis in xylem soil precipitation and groundwater indicated that the chinese pine trees obtain a small amount of groundwater when the soil water could not meet the transpiration demand song et al 2020 therefore chinese pine trees might take up water from the capillary fringe or directly from groundwater to alleviate the soil moisture deficiency which is a strategy for coping with drought in semiarid sandy environments shen et al 2015 tree transpiration is regulated by stomata behavior igarashi et al 2015 wang et al 2017 a significantly higher mean gt in july of 2019 august of 2019 and september of 2020 than in july of 2020 august of 2019 and september of 2019 was observed respectively fig 8b indicating that chinese pine trees could significantly reduce tree conductance in response to decreasing soil water availability in addition significant negative relationships between gt and vpd fig 9a indicated control of gt by evaporative demand increased stomatal regulation of water use in response to increased atmospheric vpd plays an important role in conserving water and maintaining water status within limits that avoid catastrophic loss of xylem function quentin et al 2011 wieser et al 2014 besides the ratio of stomatal sensitivity to reference tree conductance for chinese pine 0 44 was low than the theoretical ratio 0 60 derived from a hydraulic model which assumes perfect stomatal regulation of constant leaf water potential concerning vpd oren et al 1999 gu et al 2017 this was because the chinese pine experienced a large range of daytime vpd during the measurement period 0 1 6 3 kpa in the semiarid sandy environment naithani et al 2012 these findings indicate that the chinese pine trees had the ability to strict stomatal regulation on tree transpiration by closing the stomata with decreasing soil water availability and increasing atmospheric vpd fig 9 4 3 role of stand transpiration on the water balance of chinese pine plantation in the present study the accumulated daytime stand transpiration during the measurement period accounted for a small part of the water balance 35 table 2 for the chinese pine plantation although we did not directly measure the canopy interception in the present study the canopy interception estimated by the gash analytical model during the measurement period was 13 of precipitation over the same period table 2 which was comparable to the results from the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation with the similar density 15 5 404 trees ha 1 manual measurement in the study region han et al 2015 however we observed that soil evaporation occupied a large proportion of water balance 43 table 2 for the chinese pine plantation during the measurement period especially in the low precipitation months this indicated that most of the water in the chinese pine plantation was consumed by soil evaporation not by pine trees similar to our findings han et al 2012 reported that the stand transpiration of the 32 year old pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation with a tree density of 404 trees ha 1 accounted for 25 7 of precipitation over the same time whereas it was 63 6 for the understory evapotranspiration e g soil evaporation during 2010 and 2011 in the same study region due to low stand density jiao et al 2018 observed that the water losses by soil evaporation 119 0 mm were greater than by transpiration 35 4 mm in 30 year old robinia pseudoacacia plantation with a tree density of 1300 trees ha 1 during 2015 and 2016 in the semi arid loess plateau china because of low transpiration rate however the finding of the present study was in contrast to the results reported by song et al 2021 who observed that stand transpiration of the 14 year old populus xiaozhuanica plantation with a stand density of 433 trees ha 1 accounted for 46 of water balance during the growing season of 2018 and 2019 in the study site due to high transpiration rate in addition we found that the precipitation exceeded the total sum of canopy interception soil evaporation daytime stand transpiration and change in soil water storage in each month and year during the measurement period except in july of 2020 when the precipitation was only 27 of long term mean monthly precipitation 130 6 mm for july table 2 these results indicated that the water budget was balanced surplus during the measurement period due to low stand transpiration this was also partly supported by song et al 2019 who reported that chinese pines did not suffer obvious water stress during the past 30 years 1985 2014 in the study site indicated by constant basal area increment and tree ring Î´13c 4 4 implication for afforestation and plantation management in the present study chinese pine trees with relatively low transpiration rates could recharge stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration through nighttime sap flow to avoid hydraulic failure under prolonged water stress and exert strong stomatal control on tree transpiration therefore they managed the water consumption conservatively and thus should be the first consideration in the afforestation of ecological reconstruction strategies in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2020 also suggested that chinese pine may be a better choice to replace mongolian pine as the main tree species in plantations of the keerqin sandy land indicated by differences in tree ring growth and xylem hydraulics between mongolian pine and chinese pine besides a small part of the water was consumed by pine trees in the plantation with a stand density of 467 trees ha 1 in the present study and thus the water budget was balanced table 2 therefore the chinese pine plantation could maintain stability in the current water condition in the study region extremely low rainfall about 60 of the long term mean value 283 mm occurred at an interval of 15 years song et al 2020 we assumed that the canopy interception and soil evaporation still accounted for 13 and 43 of precipitation during extremely low rainfall years respectively and changes in soil water storage were approximately equal to zero at the annual scale ferreto et al 2021 in addition the growing season was from may to september 153 days and the precipitation during the growing season was 85 of the long term mean annual precipitation over the same period under such conditions the difference between precipitation 240 6 mm and the sum of canopy interception 31 3 mm stand transpiration 84 2 mm and soil evaporation 103 5 mm was 21 6 mm this indicated that the water budget of the chinese pine plantation still was balanced under extremely low rainfall years these findings indicated that afforestation with low density in semiarid sandy land should be recommended in future afforestation projects in addition the chinese pine plantations with high tree density e g 800 1127 trees ha 1 in the study region should be thinned to reduce water consumption during development contributing to maintaining the long term stability of these plantations under the global change scenario andrews et al 2020 4 5 limitations of this study and suggestions for future study although the water use of chinese pine plantations was quantified in the present study to further reduce the variability of sap flux density among individual trees increased sample sizes should be applied in future studies to further ensure accurate estimations of the water use of chinese pine plantations in addition the correction coefficient for radial and azimuthal variations in sap flux density determined respectively from three sampling trees were applied in the present study three sampling trees might be insufficient to capture tree to tree variations in the correction coefficient therefore more sampling trees should be selected to accurately estimate the correction coefficient for radial and azimuthal variations in sap flux density in future studies although the effect of the wound effects on sap flux density had been corrected in the present study the newly installed tdp sensors and the initially installed tdp sensors were not the same trees thus installing several sets of sensors sequentially in time on the same trees should be applied to further assess the effect of the wound effects on the sap flux density in the chinese pine plantations in future studies wiedemann et al 2016 furthermore to reflect the spatial representativeness of the soil moisture more measuring points should be added to monitor the spatial variability of soil moisture in the chinese pine plantations in future studies 5 conclusions in this study the daily daytime and nighttime tree water consumption of chinese pine trees averaged 27 4 24 7 and 2 7 kg d 1 during the measurement period respectively nighttime tree water consumption accounted for 10 of daily tree water consumption which was mainly used for recharging stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration to avoid hydraulic failure in addition daytime tree water consumption transpiration was more driven by solar radiation than by vapor pressure deficit on a daily scale and it significantly increased with increasing soil moisture and elevating groundwater level and tended to be a level off at Î¸ 8 0 moreover the chinese pine trees had strict stomatal regulations on tree transpiration in the chinese pine plantation most of the water was consumed by soil evaporation not by trees and thus the water budget was balanced therefore chinese pine should be priority selected for afforestation in semiarid sandy land due to managing the water consumption conservatively and the low ratio of stand transpiration to water budget for chinese pine plantation provides some indications for density optimization of plantations in semiarid and arid regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9179,quantifying tree water use and its environmental controlling mechanisms are significantly important for understanding of adaptation strategy of trees and plantation management in semiarid and arid regions here tree water consumption and tree conductance of chinese pine pinus tabuliformis plantation were quantified using sap flow measurements environmental variables were measured concurrently during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 results showed that daily daytime and nighttime tree water consumption averaged 27 4 24 7 and 2 7 kg d 1 across two years respectively nighttime tree water consumption accounted for 10 of the daily s which was mainly used for recharging stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration to avoid hydraulic failure daytime tree water consumption was more driven by solar radiation than by vapor pressure deficit moreover daytime tree conductance was 0 9 mm s 1 and significantly decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit and decreasing soil moisture indicating that trees had strict stomatal regulation on tree transpiration scaling up from tree to stand transpiration daytime stand transpiration averaged 1 1 mm d 1 across two years while accumulated stand transpiration was 112 8 mm and 126 8 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively accounting for 33 and 37 of precipitation however soil evaporation occupied 35 and 51 of precipitation in 2019 and 2020 respectively this indicated that most of water in the plantation was consumed by soil evaporation difference between precipitation and sum of daytime stand transpiration canopy interception soil evaporation and change in soil water storage was positive in two years indicating that water budget was balanced these findings indicated that chinese pine trees had strict stomatal regulation on tree transpiration and could recharge stem water storage deficit by nighttime sap flow moreover stand transpiration occupied a small part of the water balance and thus water supply was surplus resulting in maintaining the stability of chinese pine plantation graphical abstract ga1 keywords adaptation strategy plantation management sap flow nighttime tree water consumption transpiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is a limiting factor for tree growth and survival in semiarid and arid regions due to limited water supplies and high evapotranspiration in these regions grossiord et al 2018 eliades et al 2018 the air temperature and drought frequency and severity have already increased in most arid and semiarid regions and would continuously increase in the coming decades matusick et al 2018 andrews et al 2020 consequently the available water for trees in these regions is probably to decrease which would affect the tree ecophysiological processes such as water use and related eco hydrological processes muÃ±oz villers et al 2018 song et al 2021 several studies have shown that drought induced forest dieback and mortality are associated with the high water demand for trees around the world brÃ©da et al 2006 choat et al 2018 song et al 2021 to properly manage forests and water resources it is urgent to evaluate the water use of trees and their responses to environmental drives under climate change scenarios flo et al 2019 tu et al 2019 tree water use is a fundamental factor in the understanding of the ecophysiology of plantations and plays a key role in water balance in the arid and semiarid regions because it is the main component of evapotranspiration tsuruta et al 2019 tu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 therefore accurate quantification of the water use of trees is significant for forest and water resource management han et al 2019 the sap flow technique provides a powerful tool for quantifying tree water use transpiration and elucidating the physiological responses of trees to environmental conditions dix and aubrey 2021 there are multiple sap flow methods employed presently including heat pulse heat balance heat field deformation and thermal dissipation flo et al 2019 each sap flow method has advantages and disadvantages flo et al 2019 dix and aubrey 2021 but the thermal dissipation method is the most commonly applied technique for measurements of tree water use transpiration in ecology and forestry studies due to its low cost and relatively easy sensor assembly and field installation chan and bowling 2017 dix and aubrey 2021 in addition tree water use is affected by environmental variables e g vapor pressure deficit solar radiation wind speed precipitation soil moisture and groundwater level he et al 2020 oogathoo et al 2020 rana et al 2020 hayat et al 2021 tree water use response to the environmental variables is attained by adjustments of stomata which exerts a significant influence on the balance between carbon uptake and water losses that affect the survival and growth of trees in arid and semiarid regions coupel ledru et al 2016 ghimire et al 2018 for example as the vapor pressure deficit of the air increases tree transpiration increases until a certain threshold at which stomata close to keep the water potential above a critical level at which cavitations occur zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2020 additionally soil drying triggers a gradual closure of stomata and a reduction in transpiration rate avoiding embolism and the collapse of conductive tissue hayat et al 2020 under such conditions most trees with dimorphic root systems are likely to take up water from deeper soil layers e g groundwater to maintain transpiration in semiarid and arid regions ellsworth and sternberg 2015 shen et al 2015 therefore determining the effect of environmental variables on tree water use is important to understand the water use strategies of trees and manage plantations in semiarid and arid regions quentin et al 2011 jiao et al 2019 he et al 2020 nighttime water use is an important part of daily water use which is an important water use strategy to adapt to the environment wang et al 2018 han et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 hayat et al 2021 nighttime water use could contribute to the refilling of embolized conduits resulting from daytime transpiration oxygen delivery to xylem parenchyma in the trunks of larger trees prevention of excess leaf turgor at night and enhanced carbon uptake in the early morning hours snyder et al 2003 fricke 2019 zhao et al 2019 wu et al 2020 several studies have reported that the proportion of nighttime water use to daily water use in woody species averaged approximately 12 although values up to 30 60 have also been observed siddiq and cao 2018 dayer et al 2021 wu et al 2020 however there is limited research on the nighttime water use behavior of trees in the semiarid and arid regions which has a disadvantage in understanding the water use strategies of trees in these regions chinese pine pinus tabuliformis is an evergreen coniferous tree species which is naturally distributed widely in water limited regions of northern china song et al 2019 li et al 2020 due to its strong stress resistance this tree species is commonly used for establishing protective forest plantations to reduce wind speed and to enhance sand fixation in the semiarid and arid sandy regions especially in the keerqin sandy land song et al 2020 several studies have reported that pinus sylvestris var mongolica and populus spp plantations had emerged dieback and mortality in extreme drought years in the keerqin sandy land whereas the chinese pine plantations grow very healthy under the same water condition zhu et al 2008 li et al 2020 song et al 2020 water is the key factor affecting tree growth and survival in the keerqin sandy land song et al 2021 however the dynamic of water use of chinese pine and its role in the water budget of the plantations are still fully unknown besides the precipitation has exhibited strong inter annual variations in the keeqin sandy land and the weather condition is continued warming zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020 nevertheless the response of tree water use to environmental variables remains unclear therefore it is necessary to quantify tree water use and its response to environmental variables which contribute to the understanding of the mechanism underlying maintaining the stability of chinese pine plantations and proper plantation management the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the tree water consumption daily daytime and nighttime 2 determine the environmental and stomatal control of tree water use 3 assess the role of stand transpiration on the water budget investigations are carried out in chinese pine plantations in semiarid sandy land 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this experiment was conducted in the zhanggutai region 42 43 n 122 22 e 226 a s l liaoning province china located in the southeastern part of keerqin sandy land which belongs to the semiarid climatic zone the mean annual temperature is approximately 6 7 c mean from 1954 to 2019 and the mean annual precipitation is 477 mm mean for the period of 1954 2010 with more than 70 of precipitation occurring between june and august the mean annual pan evaporation is approximately 1580 mm song et al 2020 the frost free period is approximately 154 days and snow cover last approximately 33 days song et al 2020 the major soil type was arenosols which develop from sandy parent material through wind action zhu et al 2008 the main tree species in the study region included pinus sylvestris var mongolica litv populus xiaozhuanica w y hsu et liang pinus tabuliformis carr and ulmus pumila l the understory of plantations was annual grass and herbs such as potentilla anserine l cleistogenes chinensis maxim keng artemisia frigida willd and setaria viridis l beauv song et al 2019 in the present study the chinese pine plantation was selected in may 2019 and the area of this plantation was approximately 7 0 ha this pine plantation was 48 years old in 2019 and was a mature plantation the tree density was 467 trees ha 1 the mean diameter at breast height dbh was 20 5 cm in 2019 and increased to 20 6 cm in 2020 the mean tree height was 8 1 and 8 2 m in 2019 and 2020 respectively the canopy density and leaf area index lai was 0 75 and 1 21 m2 m 2 respectively 2 2 measurement of meteorological data soil moisture and groundwater level meteorological variables including air temperature t a oc air relative humidity rh and solar radiation r s w m 2 were measured in open areas near the study plot approximately 500 m these measurements were scanned at 60 s intervals and recorded as 10 min averages detailed information on the measurement methods of meteorological variables can be found in song et al 2022 besides the above measurement air temperature ta oc air relative humidity rh solar radiation w m 2 precipitation p mm and wind speed ws m s 1 were also monitored hourly in an automatic weather station near the study plot the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from air temperature and air relative humidity using the following formula campbell and norman 1998 1 v p d 0 611 exp 17 502 t a t a 240 97 1 r h the volumetric soil water content Î¸ was continuously monitored within the plantation with ec 5 sensors decagon inc decagon usa and calibrated against the gravimetric method the five ec 5 sensors were installed at soil depths of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 80 cm and 125 cm at a single location under the canopy of the sampling tree with one sensor per soil depth which represented the soil layers of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 150 cm respectively although there was only one sampling point for measuring soil moisture it was under the canopy of the sampling trees which could reflect the water condition of trees to some extent chang et al 2014 molina et al 2019 in addition the groundwater level gwl was continuously measured in the drilling well within the studied plot by hobo water level logger u20 001 01 onset computer corporation usa and was recorded every 6 h on average 2 3 measurement of sap flux and calculation of tree water consumption and tree conductance in this study eight health trees with different dbh were selected as sample trees for sap flux measurement in the plantation based on the distribution frequency of dbh table 1 the sampling trees were selected with dbhs ranging from 15 5 cm to 25 1 cm in 2019 and these values covered most of the tree diameters 14 cm dbh 26 cm table 1 although only 8 trees were selected to estimate sap flux density in the present study which was lower than the optimal sample size of 15 trees with a coefficient of variation ranging between 10 2 and 15 7 reported by kume et al 2010 it was in the accredited range reported by cai et al 2010 they reported that the sample sizes of trees for sap flux density estimations should be between 5 and 8 for pine species in temperate zones with a coefficient of variation between 9 and 15 and this sample size is widely applied in sap flux measurements for plantation forests around the world liu and biondi 2020 lyu et al 2020 taborski et al 2022 the granier type thermal dissipation probes tdps granier 1987 were applied to continuously measure the sap flux of chinese pine trees during two consecutive growing seasons july june september of 2019 and 2020 the thermal dissipation method is commonly applied to quantify whole tree water use and transpiration due to its simple relatively inexpensive and increasingly robust features flo et al 2019 oogathoo et al 2020 each probe pair was inserted into the sapwood of the sample trees vertically approximately 15 cm apart on the north facing side of the trunk at breast height to minimize radiation effects zhang et al 2015 lyu et al 2020 each probe sensor tdp20 consisted of a pair of probes 20 mm long and 2 mm in diameter and a copper constant thermocouple was placed in each probe the upper probe included a heater that was supplied with a constant power of 0 15 w and the lower probe was unheated for reference liu and biondi 2020 lyu et al 2020 song et al 2022 the sensor was mounted with waterproof silicone and covered with an aluminum box cover to avoid physical damage and thermal influences from radiation xu et al 2020 the temperature difference between the two probes was measured every 10 s and 10 min averages were recorded on a data logger cr1000x campbell scientific inc logan ut usa sap flux density fd can be empirically determined from the measured temperature difference using the following relationship granier 1987 2 f d Î± k Î² in which 3 k Î´ t m Î´ t Î´ t where fd g cm 2 s 1 is sap flux density k is a dimensionless sap flow index and Î± and Î² are fitted parameters empirically determined by granier 1987 to be 0 0119 g cm 2 s 1 and 1 231 respectively however several studies observed that for a given k the granier s parameters could underestimate fd in several conifer tree species and species specific sap flow calibration is needed flo et al 2019 fujime et al 2021 dix and aubrey 2021 song et al 2022 performed sap flow calibration for the chinese pine by comparing gravimetrically induced flows through a stem segment against k measured with tdp sensors and the novel calibration curve showed that Î± and Î² were 0 0133 and 1 024 respectively therefore the novel fitted parameters for the chinese pine Î± 0 0133 and Î² 1 024 were used for the present calculation Î´t oc is the instantaneous temperature difference between the two probes Î´tm represents the Î´t when sap flux density is zero during a day considering the sap flux density may not reach zero every night the daily maximum values of Î´t are not appropriate to represent Î´tm therefore the double regression method was used to determine the Î´tm using the maximum Î´t of successive 7 10 days periods to avoid the underestimation of nocturnal sap flux lu et al 2004 cooper et al 2019 the double regression model was performing a linear regression of local Î´tm values that were determined by a 7 10 days moving window and then local Î´tm below the linear regression line were eliminated and new linear regression was made based on the remaining data points then the new Î´tm was calculated by the new linear regression lu et al 2004 rabbel et al 2016 in order to more accurately quantify the water consumption of the chinese pine trees in the present study the azimuthal and radial variations of sap flux density in six sampling trees were measured in the studied plot from may 5 to june 16 of 2022 except from may 17 to may 28 due to power failure the detailed information for the six sampling trees were shown in table s1 four tdp sensors with a length of 20 mm and 2 mm in diameter were installed in each of three sampling trees at 1 3 m height in four directions i e east south west and north to investigate the azimuthal variation of sap flux density table s1 to extrapolate sap flux density in the north direction fd n using the north sensor as a reference to the four integrated directions averaged over the four directions the correction coefficient ca that accounted for the four integrated directions was calculated by dividing the mean sap flux density in the four directions by sap flux density in the north direction for the three sampling trees as described by shinohara et al 2013 in addition radial profiles of sap flux density were also determined from another three sampling trees table s1 in each sampling tree sap flux density at three sapwood depths 0 10 mm 0 20 mm and 20 40 mm was measured using tdp sensors on the north facing side of the sample trees at a height of 1 3 m to extrapolate sap flux density from the 0 20 mm sapwood depth fdref using 0 20 mm depth sensor as a reference to the entire sapwood area the correction coefficient cr that accounted for both the radial profile of sap flux density and the area of the sapwood annulus sampled at each depth was calculated for the three sample trees as described by delzon et al 2004 in the present study first the sum of the sap flux densities at each depth 0 10 mm 10 20 mm 20 40 mm was calculated during the measurement period second the sap flux density ratio at each depth was calculated by the sum of the sap flux densities at each depth divided by that at a reference depth of 0 20 mm then cr was the sum of the sap flux density ratios at each depth multiplied by the corresponding cross sectional sapwood area sampled at each depth divided by the entire sapwood area delzon et al 2004 however in the present study we did not directly measure the fd at the 10 20 mm sapwood depth fd10 20 it could be calculated from the sap flux density at 0 10 mm fd0 10 and 0 20 mm fd0 20 sapwood depths according to iida and tanaka 2010 as follows 4 f d 10 20 f d 0 20 a f d 0 10 b where a is the proportion of the sapwood area from depths of 0 10 mm to that of 0 20 mm and b is the proportion of the sapwood area from depths of 10 20 mm to that of 0 20 mm for the sampling tree with a sapwood thickness of more than 40 mm table s1 we did not measure the sap flux density at 40 mm sapwood depth in the present study and we assumed it was to be the mean of the sap flux density at 20 40 mm sapwood depth and the sap flux density at heartwood e g 0 given former studies shown that it gradually decreases in the inner xylem for pine species ford et al 2004 molina et al 2016 bodo and arain 2021 it is widely known that the wound created by the insertion of thermal dissipation probes can cause changes to wood s physical and thermal properties resulting in an underestimation of sap flux density particularly in ring porous hardwoods wiedemann et al 2016 molina et al 2019 in the present study the wound effect on the sap flux density was assessed for the sampling trees by the time series of mean daily sap flux density values from the new installation tdp sensors at 0 20 mm sapwood depth in the north direction of the six sampling trees in 2022 table s1 according to the recommendations of wiedemann et al 2016 and molina et al 2019 the correction factor cw for the wound effects was calculated by comparing the mean daily sap flow values from six new installation tdp sensors in 2022 before and after the described wounding effect appeared based on the above the tree water consumption qt then can be calculated as follows 5 q t c a c r c w f d a s where c a is the correction coefficient that extrapolates fd in the north direction to that in the four integrated directions c r is the correction coefficient that extrapolates fd at 0 20 mm sapwood depth to that at the entire sapwood area cw is the correction coefficient for wound effects and it was 1 25 0 0030 0 0024 1 25 a s is the sapwood area cm2 calculated using an exponential regression between as and dbh as 0 31dbh2 12 n 14 r2 0 96 which was established by song et al 2022 according to the results in the fig s1 the sap flux density in four directions had the same diurnal variations but the sap flux density was highest in the east direction followed by in the south and west directions and the lowest value was in the north direction fig s1a moreover the mean sap flux density at the four integrated directions for three sampling trees was 1 199 times that in the north direction during the measurement period fig s1b which indicated that ca was 1 199 in the present study in addition based on fig s2 the sap flux density ratios at sapwood depths of 0 10 mm 10 20 mm 20 40 mm and 40 mm for three sampling trees were 0 53 1 50 0 66 and 0 33 respectively additionally the mean ratios of sapwood area at 0 10 mm 10 20 mm 20 40 mm and 40 mm sapwood depth to total sapwood area were 0 29 0 26 0 41 and 0 04 respectively therefore the cr was 0 831 in the present study we assumed that the mean ca and cr determined respectively from three sampling trees could represent the ca and cr for the 8 measured trees in addition to reveal the water use strategies of the chinese pine trees the daytime qt day and nighttime qt night tree water consumption were calculated in the present study the qt day and qt night were defined as the water consumption that occurred when the rs were more and less than 5 0 w m 2 respectively di et al 2019 wu et al 2020 mean tree conductance gt mm s 1 was calculated from qt day per unit ground projection of the canopy and meteorological variables according to hawthorne and miniat 2018 and grossiord et al 2018 using the expression as follows 6 g t k g q t d a y c v p d where kg is a function of temperature 115 8 0 4236 ta kpa m3 kg 1 which accounts for the temperature effects on the psychometric constant latent heat of vaporization and the specific heat and density of air ewers et al 2001 mcdowell et al 2008 c is the ground projection of the canopy table 1 estimates of tree conductance in this manner assumed that leaf temperature equaled air temperature vpd was relatively homogeneous within the canopy and stem capacitance was minor during the period used for calculations ewers and oren 2000 grossiord et al 2018 in the present study we calculated daily gt when vpd 0 6 kpa to maximize the likelihood of meeting the above assumptions ewers and oren 2000 hawthorne and miniat 2018 2 4 stand transpiration and water balance in this study daytime stand transpiration per unit ground area et mm d 1 was calculated by multiplying the weighted average daytime sap flux density of the sampled trees f davg with the cumulative sapwood area of the plot a c and divided by ground

the canopy interception ei was estimated by the revised analytical model of gash et al 1995 using the forest structure canopy density of 0 75 and average evaporation parameters established by fang et al 2013 for the chinese pine plantation in addition soil evaporation es was measured by a micro lysimeter which is considered an effective method liu et al 2017 song et al 2021 the micro lysimeters were made of pvc material 10 cm in internal diameter and 30 cm in height which was capped with a nylon net at the bottom of the micro lysimeter to allow the free drainage of water liu et al 2017 song et al 2021 five micro lysimeters were installed uniformly in the plot in 2019 the micro lysimeters were weighed using an electronic balance a precision of 0 01 g at the same time every two days i e approximately 19 00 to determine the water loss xu et al 2020 furthermore the changes in soil water storage Î´s at a monthly scale were calculated as follows 10 Î´ s s f s b where sb and sf are the soil water storage across all soil layers 0 150 cm at the beginning stage the first day of each month and the final stage the last day of each month respectively soil water storage s mm was calculated

qt day is daytime tree water consumption and x is corresponding meteorological variables in addition the sigmoidal model was used to investigate the relationship between qt day and daytime Î¸ during the measurement period whereas the regression analysis was applied to analyze the relationship between qt day and daytime gwl during the measurement period the responses of gt to vpd can be described by a linear logarithmic equation oren et al 1999 as follows 13 g t g r m ln v p d where gr and m are the fitted parameters representing the reference value of gt at vpd 1 kpa and the sensitivity of gt to lnvpd respectively additionally the regression analysis was applied to investigate the relationships between gt and Î¸day during the measurement period across two years all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 software package spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 environmental variables the total precipitation during the measurement period of 2019 july september and 2020 june september was 339 7 mm and 341 6 mm respectively accounting for 120 and 95 of precipitation over the same period 283 6 and 361 0 mm fig 1 in addition the volumetric soil moisture Î¸ in the upper layer displayed a quick increase after precipitation events but gradually decrease thereafter due to precipitation and evaporation as a result the Î¸ of shallow layers tended to be highly variable in both years although the Î¸ in the deep soil layer showed similar changes to those in the shallow layers their variability was relatively low fig 1 the weighted average Î¸ across all soil layers ranged from 5 8 to 14 4 during the measurement period with the mean value of 10 7 and 9 4 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 furthermore the groundwater level is elevated when the precipitation was more during the measurement period with the mean value of 5 9 ranging from 5 6 to 6 2 m and 6 0 m ranging from 5 8 to 6 2 m in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 the daily air temperature ta ranged from 10 2 to 30

value of 235 5 and 255 9 wm 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 2c 3 2 sap flux density and daily daytime and nighttime tree water consumption diurnal course of sap flux densities fd during five representative days weighted mean values for eight sampling trees and the corresponding environmental variables are shown in fig 3 on a sunny day the sap flow generally increased from approximately 6 00 am reached a peak value at approximately 11 00 am and gradually decreased thereafter fig 3a daily variations in fd appeared to be related to variations in ta vpd and rs e g fd increased rapidly in the morning as the ta vpd and rs increased and reached a maximum value before ta vpd and rs peaking and fd subsequently decreased fig 3b the daily tree water consumption qt daily and daytime tree water consumption qt day had similar temporal dynamics during the measurement period which was different from the nighttime tree water consumption qt night fig 4a during the measurement period the qt daily and qt day ranged from 1 5 to 48 4 kg d 1 tree 1 and from 1 3 to 42 0 kg d 1 tree 1 respectively with the mean value of 27 4 and 24 7 kg d 1 tree 1 however the qt night only averaged 2 7 kg d 1 tree 1 during the measurement period ranging between 0 2 and 8 7 kg d 1 tree 1 fig 4a in addition the ratio of qt night to qt daily ranged from 0 02 to 0 4 during the measurement period with a mean value of 0 1 fig 4b the qt significantly differed among daytime nighttime and daily in each month during the measurement period fig 5a the maximum monthly mean qt daily and qt day were in june of 2020 with the value of 35 6 and 33 5 kg d 1 tree 1 respectively whereas the minimum monthly mean qt daily and qt day occurred in august of 2020 with the value of 18 1 and 16 2 kg d 1 tree 1 fig 5a however for the qt night the maximum monthly value occurred in september of 2019 4 7 kg d 1 tree 1 while the minimum monthly value was in august of 2020 1 9 kg d 1 tree 1 fig 5a moreover the monthly mean ratio of qt night to qt daily was higher in september of 2019 0 14 whereas it was lowest in june of 2020 0 06 fig 5b 3 3 daytime and nighttime tree water consumption relationships with environmental variables there was a significant and positive relationship between qt night and qt day during the measurement period but the qt day explained only 22 of the variation of qt night fig 6a besides a significant negative relationship between qt night and nighttime air temperature ta night was found during the measurement period fig 6b however no significant relationship between qt night and nighttime vpd vpd night or nighttime wind speed ws night was observed during the measurement period fig 6c and d the qt day displayed an exponentially saturating response to daily vpd and tended to level off at higher values of vpd e g vpd 2 0 kpa during the measurement period fig 7a the vpd explained 42 of the variation in qt day during the measurement period in addition the qt day significantly increased as the rs increased and rs explained 47 of the variation in qt day during the measurement period fig 7b the qt day significantly increased with increasing Î¸ when the Î¸ was less than approximately 8 whereas it was stable when the Î¸ was more than approximately 8 fig 7c the qt day significantly linearly decreased with increasing daytime gwl during the measurement and the gwl only explained 12 of variations in qt day fig 7d 3 4 tree conductance and its relationships with environmental variables the tree conductance gt ranged from 0 5 to 1 6 mm s 1 during the measurement period of 2019 with a mean value of 1 0 mm s 1 fig 8a however the gt averaged 0 8 mm s 1 during the measurement period of 2020 ranging from 0 1 to 1 4 mm s 1 fig 8a additionally the mean monthly gt was highest in september of 2020 with the value of 1 1 mm s 1 whereas it was lowest in july and august of 2020 with the values of 0 6 and 0 7 mm s 1 respectively fig 8b furthermore the gt was significantly negatively correlated with daytime vpd during the measurement period and vpd explained approximately 42 of the variation in gt moreover the ratio of the sensitivity of gt to lnvpd to gr was approximately 0 44 during the measurement period fig 9a additionally the gt significantly linearly increased with increasing daytime Î¸ during the measurement period and the daytime Î¸ could explain 46 of variations in gt during the measurement period fig 9b 3 5 stand transpiration and its role in the water balance of chinese pine plantation the daytime stand transpiration per unit ground area et day ranged from 0 06 to 1 8 mm d 1 during the measurement period of 2019 with a mean value of 1 2 mm d 1 during the measurement period of 2020 the et day averaged 1 0 mm d 1 ranging from 0 07 to 1 9 mm d 1 fig 10 during the measurement period the maximum monthly et occurred in june of 2020 44 9 mm whereas the lowest monthly et day was in august of 2020 22 4 mm table 2 in addition the accumulated et day during the measurement period of 2019 and 2020 was 112 8 mm and 126 8 mm respectively only accounting for 33 and 37 of precipitation over the same period fig 10 and table 2 however the ratio of et day to p was significantly higher in low precipitation months than that in high precipitation months table 2 the maximum monthly ratio of et day to p was 1 86 in june of 2020 whereas the minimum monthly ratio of et day to p was 0 11 in august of 2020 in addition the total soil evaporation was 119 9 soil evaporation every two days with a coefficient of variation of 24 6 for five measuring points and 174 5 mm soil evaporation every two days with a coefficient of variation of 28 7 for five measuring points during the measurement periods of 2019 and 2020 respectively occupying 35 and 51 of precipitation over the same period table 2 furthermore the monthly differences between p and the sum of et day ei es and Î´s were positive during the measurement period except in july of 2020 when the precipitation and soil moisture was low table 2 during the measurement periods of 2019 and 2020 the total differences between p and the sum of et day ei es and Î´s were 81 9 mm and 12 5 mm respectively table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the water use of chinese pine in this study the daily tree water consumption averaged 27 4 kg d 1 ranging from 1 5 to 48 4 kg d 1 which was within the range observed for the other pine species around the world wieser et al 2014 urban et al 2019 for instance bosch et al 2014 reported that daily water uses of pinus elliottii engelm and pinus palustris mill trees ranged from 2 to 142 kg d 1 in a southeastern coastal plain riparian buffer system where the dbh ranged from 12 4 cm to 48 7 cm however the daily tree water consumption in the present study was low compared to the values reported for pinus sylvestris var mongolica trees and populus xiaozhuanica trees with a similar stand density in the study site for instance han et al 2020 reported that the daily tree water consumption was 32 8 kg d 1 for the 35 year old pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation with a density of 560 trees ha 1 and dbh of 20 7 cm during the growing season may october of 2013 song et al 2021 found that the daily tree water consumption was 33 5 kg d 1 during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 for the 14 year old populus xiaozhuanica plantation with a stand density of 433 trees ha 1 and mean dbh of 17 0 cm these indicated that the chinese pine consumed low water compared with other tree species in the study region although the stand age for the chinese pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica and populus xiaozhuanica plantations as mentioned above were different they all belong to middle age plantations additionally jiao 1989 also reported that the transpiration rate for the chinese pine 0 8 mg g 1 min 1 was low compared with the pinus sylvestris var mongolica 0 9 mg g 1 min 1 and poplar 2 9 mg g 1 min 1 with the similar tree age in the study region using the weighing method in the present study the low water consumption for chinese pine trees was likely due to the low average sap flow density and low sapwood area fig 3 moreover we found that the chinese pine trees had higher tree transpiration in june compared with other months fig 5a this may be related to the high growth period which was from may to june jiao 1989 during this period the chinese pine trees would consume more water to improve their high growth in addition we found that nighttime tree water consumption accounted for approximately 10 of daily tree water consumption during the measurement period which was within the range of reported values around the world phillips et al 2010 fricke 2019 zhao et al 2019 dayer et al 2021 for example han et al 2019 reported that the percentage of night time transpiration to daily transpiration of larix principis rupprechtii plantation was about 2 13 in a semi arid continental monsoon climate of gansu xinlong mountain northwestern china eliades et al 2018 reported that nocturnal sap flow was about 18 of the total sap flow in a semi arid pinus brutia forest nighttime sap flow is mainly used for either transpiration or replenishment of the water deficit in the stem wang et al 2018 previous studies had reported that the vapor pressure deficit and wind speed were the main environmental variables affecting tree night water consumption siddiq and cao 2018 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2020 by analyzing the correlation between nighttime water use and the nighttime vpd and wind speed the main function of the night time water use for transpiration or recharge can be illustrated daley and phillips 2006 wang et al 2018 han et al 2019 for example the variation in nighttime water use could not be explained by the nighttime vpd and ws which indicated that the nighttime water use was mainly used for recharge wang et al 2018 han et al 2019 in the present study a lack of significant relationship between et night and vpd night or ws night fig 6c and d indicated that nighttime water use was mainly used for recharging stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration to avoid hydraulic failure this was consistent with previous studies on larix principis rupprechtii in a semi arid continental monsoon climate han et al 2019 and the three co occurring tree species schima superba castanopsis hystrix and michelia macclurei in a low subtropical secondary broadleaf forest wang et al 2018 this was also supported by a significant and positive relationship between et night and et day this was because the water deficit increases as a result of day time transpiration and tree roots absorb the abundant water for transpiration to alleviate plant water stress han et al 2019 in addition we also found that soil moisture in july of 2019 9 7 august of 2019 11 3 and september of 2020 12 5 was higher than that in july of 2020 8 0 august of 2020 8 0 and september of 2019 11 1 respectively fig 2 however the ratio of nighttime tree water consumption to daily tree water consumption was higher in july of 2020 august of 2020 and september of 2019 than that in july of 2019 august of 2019 and september of 2020 respectively especially in september fig 5b this indicated that the contribution of nighttime water use to daily water use increased as the soil moisture decreased which contribute to enhanced nighttime water recharge for avoiding hydraulic failure under prolonged drought fang et al 2018 chen et al 2020 similar to our findings hayat et al 2021 reported that the proportion of nighttime sap flow for salix psammophila could increase during plant acclimatization in response to increasing temperature and water shortages in the southern edge of the mu us desert this was an important adaptation strategy for the survival and growth of chinese pine in a semiarid sandy environment 4 2 environmental and stomatal control of tree transpiration of chinese pine in the present study the daytime tree water consumption significantly increased as air vpd and rs increased during the measurement period and tended to be a level off when vpd was 2 0 kpa fig 7a and b these findings were consistent with those of previous reports for pine species around the world wieser et al 2014 brito et al 2015 ghimire et al 2018 for example urban et al 2019 reported that the sap flow of pinus sylvestris significantly increased with vpd and appeared to level off at high levels of vpd in central siberia ghimire et al 2014 observed that tree transpiration of pinus roxburghii plantation increased sharply with vpd at low levels and tended to level off at higher vpd values in the lesser himalaya of central nepal in the present study tree transpiration to saturate at high vapor pressure deficit was attributed to gradual stomatal closure at higher vpd fig 9a under high vpd conditions stomata need to close sufficiently to avoid hydraulic failure caused by a decrease in leaf water potential that was caused by high tree transpiration rates gao et al 2015 additionally solar radiation explained more variability of daytime tree water consumption than vapor pressure deficit during the measurement period fig 7a and b which indicated that tree transpiration was more controlled by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit on a daily scale this finding was consistent with those of other studies showing that daily tree transpiration was more explained by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit due to more favorable water conditions for trees collins 2015 generally tree transpiration was dictated by solar energy in sufficient water conditions therefore solar radiation played a more important role in controlling tree transpiration than the vapor pressure deficit in the present study possibly because of the high soil moisture level for pine trees fig 1 it is well known that soil water availability was an important factor controlling tree transpiration in semiarid and arid regions and tree transpiration generally increased as the soil moisture increased jiao et al 2019 song et al 2021 however in the present study we found that daytime tree water consumption significantly increased with increasing soil moisture when the daytime volumetric soil moisture was below approximately 8 0 and then level off thereafter fig 7c these results agreed with the findings of wang et al 2019 in larix principis rupprechtii plantation and jiao et al 2019 in robinia pseudoacacia plantation the possible reason for the observed stature pattern in tree transpiration with increasing soil moisture is related to the decrease in gt with decreasing soil moisture fig 9b stomatal conductance is gradually reduced to avoid hydraulic system failure when soil moisture decreases oren et al 1999 grossiord et al 2018 which represented an important mechanism for trees under drought conditions novick et al 2016 in addition a significant negative relationship between daytime tree water consumption and groundwater level was observed during the measurement period but groundwater level only explained a small part 12 of variations in daytime tree water consumption fig 7d this indicated that the groundwater level played a comparatively minor role in controlling tree transpiration compared with the other environmental variables for the chinese pine trees in the keerqin sandy land most of their roots were distributed within 1 5 m but several taproots could reach several meters in depth jiao 1989 song et al 2020 moreover the maximum height of capillary rise for groundwater was approximately 1 0 m in the keerqin sandy land thus the chinese pine could take up water from the capillary fringe or directly from groundwater when the soil water could not meet the transpiration demand in the same study site an isotope deuterium and oxygen analysis in xylem soil precipitation and groundwater indicated that the chinese pine trees obtain a small amount of groundwater when the soil water could not meet the transpiration demand song et al 2020 therefore chinese pine trees might take up water from the capillary fringe or directly from groundwater to alleviate the soil moisture deficiency which is a strategy for coping with drought in semiarid sandy environments shen et al 2015 tree transpiration is regulated by stomata behavior igarashi et al 2015 wang et al 2017 a significantly higher mean gt in july of 2019 august of 2019 and september of 2020 than in july of 2020 august of 2019 and september of 2019 was observed respectively fig 8b indicating that chinese pine trees could significantly reduce tree conductance in response to decreasing soil water availability in addition significant negative relationships between gt and vpd fig 9a indicated control of gt by evaporative demand increased stomatal regulation of water use in response to increased atmospheric vpd plays an important role in conserving water and maintaining water status within limits that avoid catastrophic loss of xylem function quentin et al 2011 wieser et al 2014 besides the ratio of stomatal sensitivity to reference tree conductance for chinese pine 0 44 was low than the theoretical ratio 0 60 derived from a hydraulic model which assumes perfect stomatal regulation of constant leaf water potential concerning vpd oren et al 1999 gu et al 2017 this was because the chinese pine experienced a large range of daytime vpd during the measurement period 0 1 6 3 kpa in the semiarid sandy environment naithani et al 2012 these findings indicate that the chinese pine trees had the ability to strict stomatal regulation on tree transpiration by closing the stomata with decreasing soil water availability and increasing atmospheric vpd fig 9 4 3 role of stand transpiration on the water balance of chinese pine plantation in the present study the accumulated daytime stand transpiration during the measurement period accounted for a small part of the water balance 35 table 2 for the chinese pine plantation although we did not directly measure the canopy interception in the present study the canopy interception estimated by the gash analytical model during the measurement period was 13 of precipitation over the same period table 2 which was comparable to the results from the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation with the similar density 15 5 404 trees ha 1 manual measurement in the study region han et al 2015 however we observed that soil evaporation occupied a large proportion of water balance 43 table 2 for the chinese pine plantation during the measurement period especially in the low precipitation months this indicated that most of the water in the chinese pine plantation was consumed by soil evaporation not by pine trees similar to our findings han et al 2012 reported that the stand transpiration of the 32 year old pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation with a tree density of 404 trees ha 1 accounted for 25 7 of precipitation over the same time whereas it was 63 6 for the understory evapotranspiration e g soil evaporation during 2010 and 2011 in the same study region due to low stand density jiao et al 2018 observed that the water losses by soil evaporation 119 0 mm were greater than by transpiration 35 4 mm in 30 year old robinia pseudoacacia plantation with a tree density of 1300 trees ha 1 during 2015 and 2016 in the semi arid loess plateau china because of low transpiration rate however the finding of the present study was in contrast to the results reported by song et al 2021 who observed that stand transpiration of the 14 year old populus xiaozhuanica plantation with a stand density of 433 trees ha 1 accounted for 46 of water balance during the growing season of 2018 and 2019 in the study site due to high transpiration rate in addition we found that the precipitation exceeded the total sum of canopy interception soil evaporation daytime stand transpiration and change in soil water storage in each month and year during the measurement period except in july of 2020 when the precipitation was only 27 of long term mean monthly precipitation 130 6 mm for july table 2 these results indicated that the water budget was balanced surplus during the measurement period due to low stand transpiration this was also partly supported by song et al 2019 who reported that chinese pines did not suffer obvious water stress during the past 30 years 1985 2014 in the study site indicated by constant basal area increment and tree ring Î´13c 4 4 implication for afforestation and plantation management in the present study chinese pine trees with relatively low transpiration rates could recharge stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration through nighttime sap flow to avoid hydraulic failure under prolonged water stress and exert strong stomatal control on tree transpiration therefore they managed the water consumption conservatively and thus should be the first consideration in the afforestation of ecological reconstruction strategies in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2020 also suggested that chinese pine may be a better choice to replace mongolian pine as the main tree species in plantations of the keerqin sandy land indicated by differences in tree ring growth and xylem hydraulics between mongolian pine and chinese pine besides a small part of the water was consumed by pine trees in the plantation with a stand density of 467 trees ha 1 in the present study and thus the water budget was balanced table 2 therefore the chinese pine plantation could maintain stability in the current water condition in the study region extremely low rainfall about 60 of the long term mean value 283 mm occurred at an interval of 15 years song et al 2020 we assumed that the canopy interception and soil evaporation still accounted for 13 and 43 of precipitation during extremely low rainfall years respectively and changes in soil water storage were approximately equal to zero at the annual scale ferreto et al 2021 in addition the growing season was from may to september 153 days and the precipitation during the growing season was 85 of the long term mean annual precipitation over the same period under such conditions the difference between precipitation 240 6 mm and the sum of canopy interception 31 3 mm stand transpiration 84 2 mm and soil evaporation 103 5 mm was 21 6 mm this indicated that the water budget of the chinese pine plantation still was balanced under extremely low rainfall years these findings indicated that afforestation with low density in semiarid sandy land should be recommended in future afforestation projects in addition the chinese pine plantations with high tree density e g 800 1127 trees ha 1 in the study region should be thinned to reduce water consumption during development contributing to maintaining the long term stability of these plantations under the global change scenario andrews et al 2020 4 5 limitations of this study and suggestions for future study although the water use of chinese pine plantations was quantified in the present study to further reduce the variability of sap flux density among individual trees increased sample sizes should be applied in future studies to further ensure accurate estimations of the water use of chinese pine plantations in addition the correction coefficient for radial and azimuthal variations in sap flux density determined respectively from three sampling trees were applied in the present study three sampling trees might be insufficient to capture tree to tree variations in the correction coefficient therefore more sampling trees should be selected to accurately estimate the correction coefficient for radial and azimuthal variations in sap flux density in future studies although the effect of the wound effects on sap flux density had been corrected in the present study the newly installed tdp sensors and the initially installed tdp sensors were not the same trees thus installing several sets of sensors sequentially in time on the same trees should be applied to further assess the effect of the wound effects on the sap flux density in the chinese pine plantations in future studies wiedemann et al 2016 furthermore to reflect the spatial representativeness of the soil moisture more measuring points should be added to monitor the spatial variability of soil moisture in the chinese pine plantations in future studies 5 conclusions in this study the daily daytime and nighttime tree water consumption of chinese pine trees averaged 27 4 24 7 and 2 7 kg d 1 during the measurement period respectively nighttime tree water consumption accounted for 10 of daily tree water consumption which was mainly used for recharging stem water storage deficit caused by daytime transpiration to avoid hydraulic failure in addition daytime tree water consumption transpiration was more driven by solar radiation than by vapor pressure deficit on a daily scale and it significantly increased with increasing soil moisture and elevating groundwater level and tended to be a level off at Î¸ 8 0 moreover the chinese pine trees had strict stomatal regulations on tree transpiration in the chinese pine plantation most of the water was consumed by soil evaporation not by trees and thus the water budget was balanced therefore chinese pine should be priority selected for afforestation in semiarid sandy land due to managing the water consumption conservatively and the low ratio of stand transpiration to water budget for chinese pine plantation provides some indications for density optimization of plantations in semiarid and arid regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
