6475,effective management of nonpoint source nps pollutants requires an understanding of their potential surface runoff and baseflow pathways in this study an integrated method was developed for separating baseflow and surface nps pollutants at the watershed scale then the uncertainty of the prediction of baseflow nps pollutants was explored by comparing four hydrographic separation methods the united kingdom institute of hydrology ukih the lyne hollick lh method the eckhardt eck method and the soil and water assessment tool swat three data sources monitoring data swat and the loadest model and two baseflow period assumptions a real case study was performed in a typical catchment the three gorges reservoir area china the results showed that the baseflow annually contributed 30 1 and 23 0 of the total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp load respectively indicating that baseflow was identified as the key means of transport of nps pollutants especially for nps n during the dry season the water quality data source represents the largest uncertainty source in baseflow nps pollutant estimation and the simulated baseflow loads of tn and tp were the largest when loadest and swat were used as water quality data sources respectively the baseflow nps estimations were more uncertain for tn during the non dry season and tp during the dry season the results of this study could provide implications for the prediction and management of nps pollutants at the watershed scale especially for groundwater polluted catchments keywords nonpoint source pollution uncertainty baseflow separation soil and water assessment tool pathway model construction 1 introduction nonpoint source nps pollutants in terms of soil erosion and nutrient loss caused by surface or subsurface flow have been recognized as major threats to aquatic ecosystems leading to the deterioration of water quality and serious eutrophication miller et al 2017 wang et al 2015 effective management of nps pollutants requires an understanding of the potential pathways from which pollutants are delivered from their origins to streams such a task is extremely difficult owing to the spatial and temporal variability of these pathways miller et al 2017 baseflow which comes from groundwater and subsurface water is a vital portion of streamflow in many streams brutsaert and nieber 1977 eckhardt 2005 zhang et al 2017 baseflow also represents an important pathway for nutrients especially for groundwater polluted catchments ouyang 2012 schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 schilling and zhang 2004 and schilling et al 2018 demonstrated that baseflow contributed approximately 67 and 69 of the total no3 n load in the raccoon river in west central iowa and clear creek watershed in east central iowa respectively other studies have also reported the significant contribution of baseflow to water quality deterioration especially for agricultural or urban landscapes miller et al 2017 rivett et al 2011 schilling et al 2018 wang et al 2015 king et al 2015 noted that surface runoff and subsurface flow are two primary pathways for phosphorus export in a typical agricultural catchment however although many studies have quantified the quantity and quality of groundwater determining the contribution of baseflow nps pollutants at the watershed scale is extremely difficult as no effective approaches exist for continuously measuring baseflow nps pollutants due to limited water quality data he et al 2016 lin et al 2007 thus an integrated method for separating baseflow and surface nps pollutants at the watershed scale is needed baseflow nps pollutant estimation typically depends on the observed streamflow and water quality data among gauged watersheds many methods have been developed to separate baseflow from total streamflow including tracer based and nontracer based methods chapman 1999 eckhardt 2005 2008 gustard et al 1992 lott and stewart 2016 lyne and hollick 1979 mccallum et al 2010 the tracer based method can provide realistic results but it is laborious and expensive gonzales et al 2009 lott and stewart 2016 sklash and farvolden 1979 to overcome these disadvantages a variety of nontracer based methods such as digital filtering methods have been developed over recent decades mei and anagnostou 2015 zhang et al 2017 some typical filtering methods such as the smooth minima baseflow separation method of the united kingdom institute of hydrology ukih the lyne hollick lh method and the eckhardt eck method have been widely used for baseflow hydrograph analysis due to their high efficiency and reproducibility eckhardt 2005 gustard et al 1992 lyne and hollick 1979 zhang et al 2017 several studies have compared these separation methods and have noted that these automated methods are highly sensitive to their algorithmic structure and underlying assumptions chapman 1999 eckhardt 2008 partington et al 2012 in addition baseflow can be estimated from physics based models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat especially for ungauged basins these physics based models simulate surface runoff groundwater re evaporation and deep aquifer percolation while baseflow would be generated by integrating these hydrologic processes lee et al 2014 studies have indicated that the choice of automated separation methods and physics based models would result in an uncertain amount of baseflow partington et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 to date no direct approach exists for continuously measuring long term baseflow nps pollutant loads in a large basin one of the most common assumptions is to divide the entire study period into baseflow and nonbaseflow dominant periods which can also be classified as baseflow and surface flow concentrations during each respective period zhu et al 2011 for example some studies have assumed that if the percentage of daily baseflow is equal to or greater than 90 or 80 of the total river flow the water quality could be assumed to be mainly determined by the baseflow contribution schilling and zhang 2004 vanni et al 2001 while the measured pollutant concentration in groundwater was also used to approximate baseflow nps pollutants kim et al 2010 moreover for those ungauged watersheds and those with limited gauging series are also interpolated from statistical methods such as loadest or physics based models thus the qualification of nps pollutant pathways is clearly uncertain due to different hydrological separation methods water quality data sources and baseflow period assumptions to date there have been some studies of uncertainty in certain single step during the process of baseflow nps estimation including uncertainty in filter parameter selection uncertainty in flow and water quality measurement uncertainty in parameter selection and pollutant load calibration and estimation of swat model chen et al 2016 shen et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however few studies have been conducted comprehensively by comparing uncertainties in multiple methods relating to baseflow nps pollutant estimation the objectives of this study are 1 to develop an integrated method for separating baseflow and surface nps pollutants at the watershed scale 2 to explore the uncertainty of separating results by considering different hydrographic separation methods data sources and baseflow water quality assumptions and 3 to propose suggestions for the simulation and management of nps pollutants 2 material and methods the flowchart of the proposed integrated method is shown in fig 1 three steps are considered for the calculation of the baseflow nps pollutant load 1 hydrographic separation based on observed or simulated flow data using different separation methods 2 water quality data interpolation by statistical or physics based methods such as the loadest model or swat model and 3 evaluation of the means of nps transport based on specific baseflow period assumptions to explore the related uncertainty of baseflow nps pollutant estimation a total of four hydrographic separation methods three data sources and two assumptions were used and compared 2 1 watershed description and data collection in this study the daning river watershed 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n which is in the central part of the three gorges reservoir area china was selected as the study area fig 2 the daning river watershed forms a drainage area of approximately 2027 km2 and is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate with approximately 80 of the annual rainfall occurring during the wet season may july certain sporadic rainfall also occurs during the dry season january february november and december due to steep mountainous topography and extensive sloping farmland the daning river watershed is dominated by agricultural nps pollutants nps n and p are the major pollutants as no significant point source pollution exists in this region shen et al 2014 the database used in this study is shown in table 1 specifically the weather data from 2000 to 2015 were collected at 10 rainfall gauges within a 10 km radius of the daning watershed the digital elevation model dem data were prepared using a digital map with a 50 m grid resolution while the land use data were categorized as paddy field 0 3 dry land for agriculture 24 9 grassland 12 5 water bodies 0 4 forest 61 8 and urban land 0 1 detailed information can be found in our previous studies shen et al 2010 2010 2 2 generation of flow and water quality data 2 2 1 monitoring data collection in this study stream flow and water quality were monitored periodically at daily and monthly intervals from 2000 to 2015 respectively at the wuxi hydrological gauge li et al 2018 the stream flow was monitored automatically while the water quality was sampled manually the daning river watershed is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate causing rainstorms to occur often during the wet season moreover the study area has steep mountainous topography and lacks of transportation manual sampling is inconvenient and unsafe during heavy rains thus water quality samples are usually collected avoiding heavy rainfall events and most samples taken in flow conditions that are close to or a little lower than average flows the sampling data may not fully reflect the river pollution situation in high flow conditions owing to the limitation of objective condition details about flow measurement can be found in previous studies yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 while tn and tp were determined by the digestion spectrophotometry method using potassium persulfate as the digestion agent gao et al 2014 xu and milliman 2009 all measurements were based on the state standard monitoring and analyzing methods state environmental protection administration 2002 while strict data control was conducted by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources china available at http www cjh com cn 2 2 2 the setup of swat in this study the swat model and loadest were used for generating the scarce tn and tp data at the daily scale as a physics based model from the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 swat provides the hydrological cycle nutrient balance and sediment loss at the hydrological response unit hru level and reach section in daily monthly or annual steps amin et al 2017 the swat model is based on the water balance equation while the soil conservation service scs curve method was used to compute surface runoff in addition the swat model quantifies n and p cycles though simulating atmospheric deposition decomposition denitrification immobilization mineralization crop uptake and leaching processes specifically organic n and p transport by surface runoff is calculated using a specific loading function mcelroy 1976 while nitrate is assumed to transport with surface water in lateral flow as well as with groundwater flow through percolation more details of swat can be found in neitsch et al 2011 and winchell et al 2013 in this study due to water quality data limitations only available at the monthly step the swat model was calibrated using daily flow and monthly water quality data observations from 2009 to 2014 the calibration and sensitivity analysis were performed using the sufi 2 algorithm of the swat cup software abbaspour 2008 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens was selected to quantify the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated data nash and sutcliffe 1970 the ens value was quantified as 0 50 and 0 59 for the flow and tp simulation respectively indicating a good model performance in the study area to avoid some anomalous values the 95 confidence intervals of the simulated data were used according to the pauta criterion as the simulated pollutants by swat model are often underestimated and overestimated during peak rainfall and dry events respectively collick et al 2015 2 2 3 the setup of loadest one statistical tool namely loadest was also used to interpolate the daily tn and tp data for the study area for loadest eleven built in regression equations between daily flow and water quality data have been incorporated while a minimum of twelve water quality data points are required as the inputs to loadest park and engel 2016 runkel et al 2004 the akaike information criterion aic and the schwarz posterior probability criterion sppc were used for equation selection three statistical indicators such as adjusted maximum likelihood estimation amle maximum likelihood estimation mle and least absolute deviation lad were adopted to calibrate loadest the model performance is also tested by reviewing the concentration load bias bp the ens amle s coefficient of determination r2 values and residuals model error stenback et al 2011 strauch et al 2018 the calibration results are shown in table 2 indicating a good loadest performance in the study area the pauta criterion 3σ was used for deleting unreasonable data points from the loadest results while the observed data and the simulated data of swat and loadest were all used for the following analysis 2 3 baseflow nps pollutant evaluation method 2 3 1 hydrographic separation methods in this study three automated methods including the ukih the lh and the eck methods as well as one physics based model the swat model were used as they are all commonly used tools for baseflow separation specifically the ukih method is based on the identification and linear interpolation of turning points within the daily flow data series gustard et al 1992 to calculate the turning point the daily flow data are divided into blocks of n days n 1 6 a 0 2 where a is the catchment area km2 thus n was quantified as 7 in this study then the minimum values of the flow data within each block were selected as the b i values if 0 9 b i min b i 1 b i 1 then b i is defined as a turning point b f then time series of daily baseflow can be estimated by piecewise linear interpolation of the turning points the details of this method can be found in previous studies piggott et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 the lh filter represents a low pass filter based on the signal analysis theory which assumes that baseflow is the low frequency component of daily streamflow data lyne and hollick 1979 partington et al 2012 the equation is expressed as eckhardt 2005 lyne and hollick 1979 1 q b i α q b i 1 1 α 2 q i q i 1 subject to q b i q i where q b i mm d is the baseflow at the time step i day α 1 d is the filter parameter and q i mm d is the streamflow at the time step i this method is suggested by setting the filter parameter α as 0 925 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the eck filter is a two parameter recursive digital filter based on the key assumption that the outflow from the aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage the filter equation for baseflow is given as eckhardt 2005 2 q b i 1 b f i max a q b i 1 1 a b f i max q i 1 a b f i max subject to q b i q i where a 1 d is the filter parameter recession constant and bfimax dimensionless is the maximum baseflow index the recession constant is determined by the method outlined by eckhardt 2008 which was determined as the slope of streamflow at time step k 1 against streamflow at time step k in recession periods as the maximum baseflow index is normally given because of the stream and its aquifers zhang et al 2017 the bfimax is suggested as 0 80 0 50 and 0 25 for perennial streams with porous aquifers ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and perennial streams with hard rock aquifers respectively eckhardt 2005 according to the geological conditions of the daning river watershed the bfimax was assumed to be 0 8 in this study the baseflow separation of the digital filter method was automatically calculated in this study by the web based hydrograph analysis tool what http engineering purdue edu what lim et al 2005 lott and stewart 2016 to minimize the subjectivity the default filter parameter value a of 0 98 was used lott and stewart 2016 for the calibrated swat model surface runoff evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater processes were simulated while groundwater from shallow aquifers and deep aquifers were then estimated thus the simulated baseflow of swat was derived as the part of the river flow that was contributed by the shallow aquifer to the main channel neitsch et al 2011 in this study for a better comparison the simulated surface runoff of the swat model was deleted from the total river flow in order to obtain separated lateral flow and groundwater flow 2 3 2 pollutant separation methods based on previous studies bowes et al 2005 shore et al 2017 it could be assumed that the water level and water quality of baseflow are relatively stable for a period as no point source pressures exist in the daning watershed baseflow nps pollutants were assumed to be from the groundwater and subsurface that were dominated by the infiltration of regular irrigation induced pollutants and would stay stable throughout the year two key assumptions were made based on our investigations conducted with help from local experts assumption 1 the average concentration of baseflow nps pollutants was calculated using all water quality data points during the dry season assumption 2 some data points during the dry season were excluded if rainfall occurred less than 10 days before the water quality measurement in order to avoid the influence of sporadic rainfall thus the water quality of the baseflow was simulated from three data sources observation swat and loadest and two assumptions shown in table 3 specifically the baseflow tn load of swat was calculated by summing simulated nitrate plus organic n in lateral flow and groundwater flow thus there is an extra scenario for baseflow tn then the contribution of surface runoff and baseflow nps pollutants to the receiving water bodies could be calculated 3 loa d b f c b q b 4 loa d s l o a d t l o a d b subject to l o a d b l o a d t where loa d b l o a d t and loa d s kg d are the pollutant loads in baseflow total river flow and surface runoff respectively c b mg l is the pollutant concentration in the baseflow q b m3 is the separated baseflow and f is a dimensionality conversion coefficient 2 4 analysis of the results based on the assumptions described above a total of 24 and 25 scenarios were obtained for the estimation of baseflow tp and tn loads respectively table 4 in this study the baseflow index bfi which is defined as the baseflow proportion of total streamflow in the daning river watershed gustard et al 1992 lee et al 2018 was calculated for all simulations while the spearman correlation coefficient was also used to evaluate the correlation of the simulated nps with different scenarios in addition the bfi of the swat model was calculated using the simulated flow rather than the monitoring values the uncertainty relating to baseflow nps pollutant estimation was estimated by analyzing the average avg of the simulated results the standard deviations sd minimum value min maximum value max extremes ratio er max min and coefficients of variation cv sd avg for all scenarios the choice of different hydrographic separation methods data sources and baseflow water quality assumptions were then treated as three uncertainty sources and these three groups were compared and ranked using one way analysis of variance one way anova all the statistical analyses were conducted with spss 20 0 statistical software 3 results 3 1 the baseflow separation results the hydrographs of total flow and baseflow that are separated from the three automated hydrographic separation methods and swat are shown in fig 3 using the ukih method the lh method the eck method and the swat model the average annual baseflow during the study period was estimated to be 9 1 103 m3 s 13 9 103 m3 s 13 6 103 m3 s and 11 4 103 m3 s respectively fig 3 indicates that the estimated baseflow varies with the change of runoff which is more obvious for the two digital filtering methods the spearman correlation coefficients of estimated baseflow between the ukih lh eck and total runoff were quantified as 0 771 0 771 and 0 987 respectively which were all significant at the level of 0 01 this finding indicates that the baseflow variability is closely related to the change in total flow and the estimated baseflow by the eck method showed the most significant response the baseflow values estimated by the lh method were slightly higher than those estimated by the eck method in addition the annual bfi values by the lh eck and swat were generally stable over the study period but a sharp change in bfi in terms of a sharp rise and steep fall was observed by using the ukih table 5 shows the statistical characteristics of the annual bfi during the study period calculated by each method the avg of the ukih method was only 0 4 whereas the avg of the other three methods were all over 0 6 indicating a probable underestimation of bfi by using ukih in addition the er sd and cv of ukih were 1 748 0 069 and 0 166 respectively which were the largest among these four methods this finding implies more temporal variability in bfi values by using ukih which could be explained by the fact that if the ukih method is used the baseflow is calculated based on the minimum runoff data points piggott et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 so this method may be less sensitive to local rainstorm events during the day of occurrence table 5 also indicates the er sd and cv values of the eck method are the smallest among these four methods which could be due to the low discrete degree of the separated results of this method the sd values of bfis are both estimated as 0 041 by swat and the lh but the cv and er values obtained from swat are smaller than those obtained by the lh this was because the soil storage and other retention processes were considered by the physics based model so the baseflow derived from swat was less variable during rainfall events collick et al 2015 as shown in table 6 the correlation coefficients of the bfi values between the lh and eck methods were as high as 0 96 and those of bfi values obtained by ukih and the two digital filtering methods are over 0 7 this finding indicates that the separation results of these three methods are similar all significant at the level of 0 01 however the separated results of the swat model showed weak correlation with the other three automated separation methods mainly because the baseflow of swat was estimated by considering multiple hydrological processes such as rainfall evaporation vegetation retention soil moisture content and other factors resulting in an obvious nonlinear hydrological response the complex hydrological response obtained by swat was clearly different from the simple process of the other three automated separation methods to separate the impacts of the hydrological period the temporal variability of baseflow hydrographs and the related bfi during 2010 shown in fig 4 were analyzed the average baseflows are estimated to be 28 2 m3 s 39 2 m3 s 37 3 m3 s 28 0 m3 s respectively using the ukih lh eck and swat models during the dry season the daily mean baseflows were quantified as 21 0 m3 s 20 1 m3 s 17 1 m3 s and 7 3 m3 s respectively this indicates an underestimation of baseflow values by the swat model especially during the dry season the bfi values during the dry season that were obtained by the ukih lh and swat approaches were over 0 9 which were obviously higher than that obtained by the eck method 0 79 due to small proportion of rainfall during this season the river flow was mainly composed of baseflow during the dry season indicating relative less reasonable separation results by the eck during the non dry period march to october the bfi values using the ukih method lh method eck method and swat model were estimated to be 0 419 0 641 0 622 0 540 which are 52 142 175 and 421 higher than those in the dry season respectively fig 4 also shows all the lines are more representative of the observed data based on visual comparison except the line of ukih the ukih line looks like composed of some broken line segments and turning points within this line can be seen from the figure this is because the ukih method interpolates turning points piecewise piggott et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 in contrast the baseflow hydrographs obtained by the other two digital filtering methods are much smoother this agrees with the results of zhang et al 2017 who found that the digital filter methods yield smoother baseflow hydrograph than the ukih method this indicates that the lh method and the eck method reproduce steadier temporal changes of the data series which is more representative of baseflow processes mei and anagnostou 2015 the estimated baseflow during the dry seasons is similar among the three automated separation methods but clearly shows greater differences during the wet season for wet periods the baseflow hydrographs using the digital filtering methods fluctuate greatly with changes in the runoff process in comparison a flat baseflow curve was obtained by the swat model the peak time of the baseflow hydrographs generated by the two digital filtering methods is relatively consistent both of which lag the peak time of runoff however the baseflow peak value obtained by the lh method is slightly higher than that obtained by the eck method the ukih method was less sensitive to rainfall during the flood season because the baseflow is estimated by linear interpolation of the minimal flow within the time series of daily flow data therefore the eck method may not be suitable for baseflow separation during low flow periods and the ukih method is less representative of natural processes than the other digital filtering methods 3 2 the baseflow tn and tp results the simulated baseflow tn and tp loads are shown in table 7 by using monitoring data and the loadest and swat models the average daily tn loads were calculated as 1 28 tons 1 29 tons and 0 29 tons during the dry period and 4 67 tons 4 73 tons and 4 9 tons during the non dry period respectively in addition the average tp load was calculated as 43 1 kg 46 6 kg and 45 2 kg in the dry season and 177 4 kg 167 8 kg and 1287 5 kg in the non dry period respectively by using different data sources the simulated load could be ranked from high to low as follows the loadest monitoring value swat for the nps tn prediction and swat monitoring value the loadest for the nps tp simulation the difference between nps tn and tp estimates could be explained by the fact that water quality samples were usually collected avoiding heavy rainfall events so the monitoring data may not represent the typical water quality during the non dry season typically the nps n is transported in a dissolved form in rainfall runoff process and diluted during high rainfall while the nps p is often attached to soil particles and aggravated with soil erosion processes during high rainfall bowes et al 2003 2005 thus the tp and tn loads might be underestimated and overestimated respectively during the non dry season if monitoring is used for direct nps pollutant calculation or as inputs of loadest the contribution rate cr of baseflow nps tn to the total river load was estimated to be 29 8 based on extra calculation method and no obvious difference could be observed between the baseflow tn and baseflow tp results by using the monitoring data and loadest model as water quality data sources when the swat model was used as the data source the cr of baseflow tn was larger than that of baseflow tp this was consistent with previous studies bowes et al 2003 2005 in which due to lower solubility p tends to accumulate in the surface soil layer by attaching to soil particles and being moved by surface runoff and soil erosion thus the cr of baseflow tp should be smaller than tn and in table 7 some scenarios that could not satisfy this condition have been excluded from later discussion it could be judged that the measured data and the loadest model data might be questionable in baseflow nps estimation compared to swat model using the swat model the annual average cr of baseflow tn and tp is estimated to be 30 1 and 23 0 respectively while the average cr during the dry season is 59 2 and 33 1 for tn and tp which is much larger than that 28 4 and 21 8 during the non dry period this indicated that the baseflow was the key means of transport of nps pollutants during the dry season especially for nps n according to the swat model the cv values of baseflow tn were estimated to be 0 4 and 0 7 from all the reserved scenarios during the dry and non dry period respectively while the cv values of baseflow tp are 1 2 and 1 0 indicating more uncertain results of the baseflow tn in the non dry season and baseflow tp in the dry season 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty of separation results the qualification of nps pathways is largely uncertain due to different water quality data sources hydrological separation methods and baseflow period assumptions in this section the uncertainty relating to baseflow separation were explored the statistical characteristics of the three groups are given by assembling and comparing different scenarios table 8 indicates that if the swat model is used the avg value for the baseflow tn prediction is estimated to be 0 118 which is smaller than that of the monitoring data 0 520 the water quality source represents the largest uncertainty source in baseflow tn estimation using different hydrographic separation methods and baseflow period assumptions the avg values of estimated baseflow nps tn range from 0 132 to 0 391 and 0 289 to 0 310 respectively the cr value of nps tn to the total river load is estimated to be 29 8 which is between the cr values when using assumptions 1 and 2 by using assumptions 1 and 2 those statistical indices are all approximate showing limited impacts of the hydrological period assumption on the baseflow nps tn prediction in addition among the different separation methods the sd cv and er values of the baseflow nps tn are the smallest using the eck method as only two scenarios are reasonable after applying the exclusion process in section 3 1 however if all the eck scenarios are excluded the sd cv and er are the smallest for all the sources which means that if a specific separation method is determined the impacts of the data sources are also limited for estimation of the baseflow tp if the swat model is used the avg value is estimated to be 0 023 which is much smaller than that of the monitoring data 0 469 the water quality source also represents the largest uncertainty source in the baseflow nps tp estimation using different separation methods and hydrological period assumptions the avg values of baseflow tp ranges from 0 026 to 0 304 and from 0 214 to 0 243 respectively for both assumptions the sd and cv values of the estimated baseflow of nps tp are both large with the largest er values suggesting that the hydrological period assumptions have a lesser effect on baseflow tp estimation compared to the other two uncertain sources however compared to the baseflow tn estimation the er and cv values of baseflow tp estimation are much larger indicating that the baseflow tp results are more uncertain than the baseflow tn chen et al 2017 using one way anova the impacts of three uncertainty sources namely water quality data sources hydrographic separation methods and baseflow period assumptions were compared and ranked table 8 shows that the water quality data source was identified as the biggest source of uncertainty p 0 05 resulting from a significant difference in the estimated nps pollutant load between the swat and monitoring data the significance level of hydrologic separation methods is estimated to be 0 157 and 0 120 for baseflow tn and tp prediction and there was no significant difference among these four hydrological separation methods in addition the significance is estimated to be 0 768 and 0 825 for two period assumptions during the baseflow tn and tp predictions respectively 4 2 implications for model construction due to the spatial and temporal variability of these pathways watershed models have been developed as the main tools used to quantify nps pollution at large spatial scales calibration represents one key process for model construction by fitting the simulation against the observation at the watershed outlets which reflects the integrated signals of the hydrological response of the entire basin currently scientists have improved model construction by first calibrating baseflow as a precise description of the groundwater process and then calibrating the parameters relating to total flow he and lu 2016 one prior task is to separate the daily baseflow from the total flow data series by automatic segmentation methods and then use the separated baseflow for model calibration however it was demonstrated herein that the simulated baseflow obtained from various separation methods were different especially during the non dry season thus previous baseflow based calibrations might be questionable as these separated baseflow data were inherently uncertain to attain baseflow data series for model calibration with less uncertainty we suggest the incorporation of tracer based methods such as environmental isotopes with nontracer baseflow separation methods tracer based methods are suggested for an accurate calculation of baseflow nps pollutants as they can provide accurate information though chemical signatures and can be taken as references to assess nontracer baseflow separation methods lott and stewart 2016 zhang et al 2017 environmental isotopes are recommended for hydrograph separation and to identify the transport means of nps pollutants yuan et al 2017 from all these aspects the water quality data source represents the main origin of uncertainty in the methods of evaluation of nps pollutant transport to reduce this uncertainty better targeted and obtaining the best possible data required by the goal is needed for those gauged watersheds in addition enhancing the accuracy of baseflow observation and rainfall process monitoring during wet periods is extremely important for the accurate calculation of baseflow nps pollutants especially for baseflow nps tp predictions in addition if there is rainfall during the dry seasons water quality records should be checked even if the water level did not change substantially zhang et al 2008 those ungauged watersheds and those with limited gauging water quality data at finer scale may be attained from physics based models to overcome the problem of insufficient data some physics based models such as the swat model can provide baseflow separation based on the description of the process of rainfall infiltration and runoff generation he and lu 2016 partington et al 2012 however the simulated baseflow might be overestimated or underestimated due to the simple assumptions and equations of the groundwater module in these physics based models arnold et al 2000 thus integrating the watershed model with groundwater models such as modflow can improve baseflow nps pollutant estimations e g kim et al 2008 4 3 implications for nps management typically surface flow and baseflow represent two important pathways of nps pollutants from their origins to nearby water bodies miller et al 2017 wang et al 2015 thus the effective management of nps requires a full understanding of the pathways by which pollutants are delivered to streams miller et al 2017 the results of this study indicate that baseflow is an extremely important pathway of nps pollutants that cannot be neglected especially for nitrogen during the dry season in the watershed we examined this result is consistent with previous studies particularly for the watersheds with high bfi or heavy groundwater contamination ouyang 2012 schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2011 for example zhu et al 2011 found that approximately 75 of the no3 n export and approximately 65 of tn export occurred in the baseflow of the appalachian mountains wang et al 2015 showed that the baseflow contributed to 40 3 of the no3 n loading in the rice agriculture catchments in subtropical china however in the past more attention has been paid to the management of surface runoff based nps pollutants by intercepting surface flow or the amount of soil erosion gao et al 2014 this practice might be questionable because the water quality may still be poor without proper management of baseflow nps even if the nps pollutants transported by surface runoff are well managed rivett et al 2011 schilling and zhang 2004 an integrated watershed management approach is suggested by considering both surface runoff and baseflow pathways gao et al 2014 for regions with heavy groundwater contamination nps pollutant management should pay even more attention to strategies for reducing baseflow transport routes such as effective aquifer management e g dinnes et al 2002 buffer zones he and lu 2016 drainage control systems and infiltration techniques dinnes et al 2002 hamel et al 2013 5 conclusions in this study an integrated method was developed for separating baseflow and surface nps pollution at the watershed scale the uncertainty relating to baseflow nps pollutant prediction was also explored by comparing four hydrological separation methods three data sources and two baseflow period assumptions the results indicated that the separated baseflow of the three automated methods are similar and show weak correlations with the swat results the simulated baseflow tn and tp loading was the largest when loadest and swat were used as the data sources the water quality data source represents the largest uncertainty in the baseflow nps pollutant estimation but if a specific separation method is determined the impacts of data sources are also limited baseflow was identified as the key transport manner of nps pollutants especially for nps n during the dry season the simulated tn and tp were more uncertain during the non dry season and the dry season respectively and the baseflow tp results were even more uncertain than the baseflow tn the results of this study could provide implications for the prediction and management of nps pollution at the watershed scale especially for groundwater polluted catchments however due to the limitation of water quality data the loadest and swat models only serve as supplementary tools in this study more water quality data should be collected and incorporated to reduce the prediction uncertainty in addition studies should be conducted in other catchments to provide further support for these conclusions furthermore future tracer based studies are suggested for a precise baseflow separation to explore the mechanism of baseflow nps pollution

6475,effective management of nonpoint source nps pollutants requires an understanding of their potential surface runoff and baseflow pathways in this study an integrated method was developed for separating baseflow and surface nps pollutants at the watershed scale then the uncertainty of the prediction of baseflow nps pollutants was explored by comparing four hydrographic separation methods the united kingdom institute of hydrology ukih the lyne hollick lh method the eckhardt eck method and the soil and water assessment tool swat three data sources monitoring data swat and the loadest model and two baseflow period assumptions a real case study was performed in a typical catchment the three gorges reservoir area china the results showed that the baseflow annually contributed 30 1 and 23 0 of the total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp load respectively indicating that baseflow was identified as the key means of transport of nps pollutants especially for nps n during the dry season the water quality data source represents the largest uncertainty source in baseflow nps pollutant estimation and the simulated baseflow loads of tn and tp were the largest when loadest and swat were used as water quality data sources respectively the baseflow nps estimations were more uncertain for tn during the non dry season and tp during the dry season the results of this study could provide implications for the prediction and management of nps pollutants at the watershed scale especially for groundwater polluted catchments keywords nonpoint source pollution uncertainty baseflow separation soil and water assessment tool pathway model construction 1 introduction nonpoint source nps pollutants in terms of soil erosion and nutrient loss caused by surface or subsurface flow have been recognized as major threats to aquatic ecosystems leading to the deterioration of water quality and serious eutrophication miller et al 2017 wang et al 2015 effective management of nps pollutants requires an understanding of the potential pathways from which pollutants are delivered from their origins to streams such a task is extremely difficult owing to the spatial and temporal variability of these pathways miller et al 2017 baseflow which comes from groundwater and subsurface water is a vital portion of streamflow in many streams brutsaert and nieber 1977 eckhardt 2005 zhang et al 2017 baseflow also represents an important pathway for nutrients especially for groundwater polluted catchments ouyang 2012 schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 schilling and zhang 2004 and schilling et al 2018 demonstrated that baseflow contributed approximately 67 and 69 of the total no3 n load in the raccoon river in west central iowa and clear creek watershed in east central iowa respectively other studies have also reported the significant contribution of baseflow to water quality deterioration especially for agricultural or urban landscapes miller et al 2017 rivett et al 2011 schilling et al 2018 wang et al 2015 king et al 2015 noted that surface runoff and subsurface flow are two primary pathways for phosphorus export in a typical agricultural catchment however although many studies have quantified the quantity and quality of groundwater determining the contribution of baseflow nps pollutants at the watershed scale is extremely difficult as no effective approaches exist for continuously measuring baseflow nps pollutants due to limited water quality data he et al 2016 lin et al 2007 thus an integrated method for separating baseflow and surface nps pollutants at the watershed scale is needed baseflow nps pollutant estimation typically depends on the observed streamflow and water quality data among gauged watersheds many methods have been developed to separate baseflow from total streamflow including tracer based and nontracer based methods chapman 1999 eckhardt 2005 2008 gustard et al 1992 lott and stewart 2016 lyne and hollick 1979 mccallum et al 2010 the tracer based method can provide realistic results but it is laborious and expensive gonzales et al 2009 lott and stewart 2016 sklash and farvolden 1979 to overcome these disadvantages a variety of nontracer based methods such as digital filtering methods have been developed over recent decades mei and anagnostou 2015 zhang et al 2017 some typical filtering methods such as the smooth minima baseflow separation method of the united kingdom institute of hydrology ukih the lyne hollick lh method and the eckhardt eck method have been widely used for baseflow hydrograph analysis due to their high efficiency and reproducibility eckhardt 2005 gustard et al 1992 lyne and hollick 1979 zhang et al 2017 several studies have compared these separation methods and have noted that these automated methods are highly sensitive to their algorithmic structure and underlying assumptions chapman 1999 eckhardt 2008 partington et al 2012 in addition baseflow can be estimated from physics based models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat especially for ungauged basins these physics based models simulate surface runoff groundwater re evaporation and deep aquifer percolation while baseflow would be generated by integrating these hydrologic processes lee et al 2014 studies have indicated that the choice of automated separation methods and physics based models would result in an uncertain amount of baseflow partington et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 to date no direct approach exists for continuously measuring long term baseflow nps pollutant loads in a large basin one of the most common assumptions is to divide the entire study period into baseflow and nonbaseflow dominant periods which can also be classified as baseflow and surface flow concentrations during each respective period zhu et al 2011 for example some studies have assumed that if the percentage of daily baseflow is equal to or greater than 90 or 80 of the total river flow the water quality could be assumed to be mainly determined by the baseflow contribution schilling and zhang 2004 vanni et al 2001 while the measured pollutant concentration in groundwater was also used to approximate baseflow nps pollutants kim et al 2010 moreover for those ungauged watersheds and those with limited gauging series are also interpolated from statistical methods such as loadest or physics based models thus the qualification of nps pollutant pathways is clearly uncertain due to different hydrological separation methods water quality data sources and baseflow period assumptions to date there have been some studies of uncertainty in certain single step during the process of baseflow nps estimation including uncertainty in filter parameter selection uncertainty in flow and water quality measurement uncertainty in parameter selection and pollutant load calibration and estimation of swat model chen et al 2016 shen et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however few studies have been conducted comprehensively by comparing uncertainties in multiple methods relating to baseflow nps pollutant estimation the objectives of this study are 1 to develop an integrated method for separating baseflow and surface nps pollutants at the watershed scale 2 to explore the uncertainty of separating results by considering different hydrographic separation methods data sources and baseflow water quality assumptions and 3 to propose suggestions for the simulation and management of nps pollutants 2 material and methods the flowchart of the proposed integrated method is shown in fig 1 three steps are considered for the calculation of the baseflow nps pollutant load 1 hydrographic separation based on observed or simulated flow data using different separation methods 2 water quality data interpolation by statistical or physics based methods such as the loadest model or swat model and 3 evaluation of the means of nps transport based on specific baseflow period assumptions to explore the related uncertainty of baseflow nps pollutant estimation a total of four hydrographic separation methods three data sources and two assumptions were used and compared 2 1 watershed description and data collection in this study the daning river watershed 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n which is in the central part of the three gorges reservoir area china was selected as the study area fig 2 the daning river watershed forms a drainage area of approximately 2027 km2 and is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate with approximately 80 of the annual rainfall occurring during the wet season may july certain sporadic rainfall also occurs during the dry season january february november and december due to steep mountainous topography and extensive sloping farmland the daning river watershed is dominated by agricultural nps pollutants nps n and p are the major pollutants as no significant point source pollution exists in this region shen et al 2014 the database used in this study is shown in table 1 specifically the weather data from 2000 to 2015 were collected at 10 rainfall gauges within a 10 km radius of the daning watershed the digital elevation model dem data were prepared using a digital map with a 50 m grid resolution while the land use data were categorized as paddy field 0 3 dry land for agriculture 24 9 grassland 12 5 water bodies 0 4 forest 61 8 and urban land 0 1 detailed information can be found in our previous studies shen et al 2010 2010 2 2 generation of flow and water quality data 2 2 1 monitoring data collection in this study stream flow and water quality were monitored periodically at daily and monthly intervals from 2000 to 2015 respectively at the wuxi hydrological gauge li et al 2018 the stream flow was monitored automatically while the water quality was sampled manually the daning river watershed is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate causing rainstorms to occur often during the wet season moreover the study area has steep mountainous topography and lacks of transportation manual sampling is inconvenient and unsafe during heavy rains thus water quality samples are usually collected avoiding heavy rainfall events and most samples taken in flow conditions that are close to or a little lower than average flows the sampling data may not fully reflect the river pollution situation in high flow conditions owing to the limitation of objective condition details about flow measurement can be found in previous studies yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 while tn and tp were determined by the digestion spectrophotometry method using potassium persulfate as the digestion agent gao et al 2014 xu and milliman 2009 all measurements were based on the state standard monitoring and analyzing methods state environmental protection administration 2002 while strict data control was conducted by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources china available at http www cjh com cn 2 2 2 the setup of swat in this study the swat model and loadest were used for generating the scarce tn and tp data at the daily scale as a physics based model from the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 swat provides the hydrological cycle nutrient balance and sediment loss at the hydrological response unit hru level and reach section in daily monthly or annual steps amin et al 2017 the swat model is based on the water balance equation while the soil conservation service scs curve method was used to compute surface runoff in addition the swat model quantifies n and p cycles though simulating atmospheric deposition decomposition denitrification immobilization mineralization crop uptake and leaching processes specifically organic n and p transport by surface runoff is calculated using a specific loading function mcelroy 1976 while nitrate is assumed to transport with surface water in lateral flow as well as with groundwater flow through percolation more details of swat can be found in neitsch et al 2011 and winchell et al 2013 in this study due to water quality data limitations only available at the monthly step the swat model was calibrated using daily flow and monthly water quality data observations from 2009 to 2014 the calibration and sensitivity analysis were performed using the sufi 2 algorithm of the swat cup software abbaspour 2008 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens was selected to quantify the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated data nash and sutcliffe 1970 the ens value was quantified as 0 50 and 0 59 for the flow and tp simulation respectively indicating a good model performance in the study area to avoid some anomalous values the 95 confidence intervals of the simulated data were used according to the pauta criterion as the simulated pollutants by swat model are often underestimated and overestimated during peak rainfall and dry events respectively collick et al 2015 2 2 3 the setup of loadest one statistical tool namely loadest was also used to interpolate the daily tn and tp data for the study area for loadest eleven built in regression equations between daily flow and water quality data have been incorporated while a minimum of twelve water quality data points are required as the inputs to loadest park and engel 2016 runkel et al 2004 the akaike information criterion aic and the schwarz posterior probability criterion sppc were used for equation selection three statistical indicators such as adjusted maximum likelihood estimation amle maximum likelihood estimation mle and least absolute deviation lad were adopted to calibrate loadest the model performance is also tested by reviewing the concentration load bias bp the ens amle s coefficient of determination r2 values and residuals model error stenback et al 2011 strauch et al 2018 the calibration results are shown in table 2 indicating a good loadest performance in the study area the pauta criterion 3σ was used for deleting unreasonable data points from the loadest results while the observed data and the simulated data of swat and loadest were all used for the following analysis 2 3 baseflow nps pollutant evaluation method 2 3 1 hydrographic separation methods in this study three automated methods including the ukih the lh and the eck methods as well as one physics based model the swat model were used as they are all commonly used tools for baseflow separation specifically the ukih method is based on the identification and linear interpolation of turning points within the daily flow data series gustard et al 1992 to calculate the turning point the daily flow data are divided into blocks of n days n 1 6 a 0 2 where a is the catchment area km2 thus n was quantified as 7 in this study then the minimum values of the flow data within each block were selected as the b i values if 0 9 b i min b i 1 b i 1 then b i is defined as a turning point b f then time series of daily baseflow can be estimated by piecewise linear interpolation of the turning points the details of this method can be found in previous studies piggott et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 the lh filter represents a low pass filter based on the signal analysis theory which assumes that baseflow is the low frequency component of daily streamflow data lyne and hollick 1979 partington et al 2012 the equation is expressed as eckhardt 2005 lyne and hollick 1979 1 q b i α q b i 1 1 α 2 q i q i 1 subject to q b i q i where q b i mm d is the baseflow at the time step i day α 1 d is the filter parameter and q i mm d is the streamflow at the time step i this method is suggested by setting the filter parameter α as 0 925 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the eck filter is a two parameter recursive digital filter based on the key assumption that the outflow from the aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage the filter equation for baseflow is given as eckhardt 2005 2 q b i 1 b f i max a q b i 1 1 a b f i max q i 1 a b f i max subject to q b i q i where a 1 d is the filter parameter recession constant and bfimax dimensionless is the maximum baseflow index the recession constant is determined by the method outlined by eckhardt 2008 which was determined as the slope of streamflow at time step k 1 against streamflow at time step k in recession periods as the maximum baseflow index is normally given because of the stream and its aquifers zhang et al 2017 the bfimax is suggested as 0 80 0 50 and 0 25 for perennial streams with porous aquifers ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and perennial streams with hard rock aquifers respectively eckhardt 2005 according to the geological conditions of the daning river watershed the bfimax was assumed to be 0 8 in this study the baseflow separation of the digital filter method was automatically calculated in this study by the web based hydrograph analysis tool what http engineering purdue edu what lim et al 2005 lott and stewart 2016 to minimize the subjectivity the default filter parameter value a of 0 98 was used lott and stewart 2016 for the calibrated swat model surface runoff evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater processes were simulated while groundwater from shallow aquifers and deep aquifers were then estimated thus the simulated baseflow of swat was derived as the part of the river flow that was contributed by the shallow aquifer to the main channel neitsch et al 2011 in this study for a better comparison the simulated surface runoff of the swat model was deleted from the total river flow in order to obtain separated lateral flow and groundwater flow 2 3 2 pollutant separation methods based on previous studies bowes et al 2005 shore et al 2017 it could be assumed that the water level and water quality of baseflow are relatively stable for a period as no point source pressures exist in the daning watershed baseflow nps pollutants were assumed to be from the groundwater and subsurface that were dominated by the infiltration of regular irrigation induced pollutants and would stay stable throughout the year two key assumptions were made based on our investigations conducted with help from local experts assumption 1 the average concentration of baseflow nps pollutants was calculated using all water quality data points during the dry season assumption 2 some data points during the dry season were excluded if rainfall occurred less than 10 days before the water quality measurement in order to avoid the influence of sporadic rainfall thus the water quality of the baseflow was simulated from three data sources observation swat and loadest and two assumptions shown in table 3 specifically the baseflow tn load of swat was calculated by summing simulated nitrate plus organic n in lateral flow and groundwater flow thus there is an extra scenario for baseflow tn then the contribution of surface runoff and baseflow nps pollutants to the receiving water bodies could be calculated 3 loa d b f c b q b 4 loa d s l o a d t l o a d b subject to l o a d b l o a d t where loa d b l o a d t and loa d s kg d are the pollutant loads in baseflow total river flow and surface runoff respectively c b mg l is the pollutant concentration in the baseflow q b m3 is the separated baseflow and f is a dimensionality conversion coefficient 2 4 analysis of the results based on the assumptions described above a total of 24 and 25 scenarios were obtained for the estimation of baseflow tp and tn loads respectively table 4 in this study the baseflow index bfi which is defined as the baseflow proportion of total streamflow in the daning river watershed gustard et al 1992 lee et al 2018 was calculated for all simulations while the spearman correlation coefficient was also used to evaluate the correlation of the simulated nps with different scenarios in addition the bfi of the swat model was calculated using the simulated flow rather than the monitoring values the uncertainty relating to baseflow nps pollutant estimation was estimated by analyzing the average avg of the simulated results the standard deviations sd minimum value min maximum value max extremes ratio er max min and coefficients of variation cv sd avg for all scenarios the choice of different hydrographic separation methods data sources and baseflow water quality assumptions were then treated as three uncertainty sources and these three groups were compared and ranked using one way analysis of variance one way anova all the statistical analyses were conducted with spss 20 0 statistical software 3 results 3 1 the baseflow separation results the hydrographs of total flow and baseflow that are separated from the three automated hydrographic separation methods and swat are shown in fig 3 using the ukih method the lh method the eck method and the swat model the average annual baseflow during the study period was estimated to be 9 1 103 m3 s 13 9 103 m3 s 13 6 103 m3 s and 11 4 103 m3 s respectively fig 3 indicates that the estimated baseflow varies with the change of runoff which is more obvious for the two digital filtering methods the spearman correlation coefficients of estimated baseflow between the ukih lh eck and total runoff were quantified as 0 771 0 771 and 0 987 respectively which were all significant at the level of 0 01 this finding indicates that the baseflow variability is closely related to the change in total flow and the estimated baseflow by the eck method showed the most significant response the baseflow values estimated by the lh method were slightly higher than those estimated by the eck method in addition the annual bfi values by the lh eck and swat were generally stable over the study period but a sharp change in bfi in terms of a sharp rise and steep fall was observed by using the ukih table 5 shows the statistical characteristics of the annual bfi during the study period calculated by each method the avg of the ukih method was only 0 4 whereas the avg of the other three methods were all over 0 6 indicating a probable underestimation of bfi by using ukih in addition the er sd and cv of ukih were 1 748 0 069 and 0 166 respectively which were the largest among these four methods this finding implies more temporal variability in bfi values by using ukih which could be explained by the fact that if the ukih method is used the baseflow is calculated based on the minimum runoff data points piggott et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 so this method may be less sensitive to local rainstorm events during the day of occurrence table 5 also indicates the er sd and cv values of the eck method are the smallest among these four methods which could be due to the low discrete degree of the separated results of this method the sd values of bfis are both estimated as 0 041 by swat and the lh but the cv and er values obtained from swat are smaller than those obtained by the lh this was because the soil storage and other retention processes were considered by the physics based model so the baseflow derived from swat was less variable during rainfall events collick et al 2015 as shown in table 6 the correlation coefficients of the bfi values between the lh and eck methods were as high as 0 96 and those of bfi values obtained by ukih and the two digital filtering methods are over 0 7 this finding indicates that the separation results of these three methods are similar all significant at the level of 0 01 however the separated results of the swat model showed weak correlation with the other three automated separation methods mainly because the baseflow of swat was estimated by considering multiple hydrological processes such as rainfall evaporation vegetation retention soil moisture content and other factors resulting in an obvious nonlinear hydrological response the complex hydrological response obtained by swat was clearly different from the simple process of the other three automated separation methods to separate the impacts of the hydrological period the temporal variability of baseflow hydrographs and the related bfi during 2010 shown in fig 4 were analyzed the average baseflows are estimated to be 28 2 m3 s 39 2 m3 s 37 3 m3 s 28 0 m3 s respectively using the ukih lh eck and swat models during the dry season the daily mean baseflows were quantified as 21 0 m3 s 20 1 m3 s 17 1 m3 s and 7 3 m3 s respectively this indicates an underestimation of baseflow values by the swat model especially during the dry season the bfi values during the dry season that were obtained by the ukih lh and swat approaches were over 0 9 which were obviously higher than that obtained by the eck method 0 79 due to small proportion of rainfall during this season the river flow was mainly composed of baseflow during the dry season indicating relative less reasonable separation results by the eck during the non dry period march to october the bfi values using the ukih method lh method eck method and swat model were estimated to be 0 419 0 641 0 622 0 540 which are 52 142 175 and 421 higher than those in the dry season respectively fig 4 also shows all the lines are more representative of the observed data based on visual comparison except the line of ukih the ukih line looks like composed of some broken line segments and turning points within this line can be seen from the figure this is because the ukih method interpolates turning points piecewise piggott et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 in contrast the baseflow hydrographs obtained by the other two digital filtering methods are much smoother this agrees with the results of zhang et al 2017 who found that the digital filter methods yield smoother baseflow hydrograph than the ukih method this indicates that the lh method and the eck method reproduce steadier temporal changes of the data series which is more representative of baseflow processes mei and anagnostou 2015 the estimated baseflow during the dry seasons is similar among the three automated separation methods but clearly shows greater differences during the wet season for wet periods the baseflow hydrographs using the digital filtering methods fluctuate greatly with changes in the runoff process in comparison a flat baseflow curve was obtained by the swat model the peak time of the baseflow hydrographs generated by the two digital filtering methods is relatively consistent both of which lag the peak time of runoff however the baseflow peak value obtained by the lh method is slightly higher than that obtained by the eck method the ukih method was less sensitive to rainfall during the flood season because the baseflow is estimated by linear interpolation of the minimal flow within the time series of daily flow data therefore the eck method may not be suitable for baseflow separation during low flow periods and the ukih method is less representative of natural processes than the other digital filtering methods 3 2 the baseflow tn and tp results the simulated baseflow tn and tp loads are shown in table 7 by using monitoring data and the loadest and swat models the average daily tn loads were calculated as 1 28 tons 1 29 tons and 0 29 tons during the dry period and 4 67 tons 4 73 tons and 4 9 tons during the non dry period respectively in addition the average tp load was calculated as 43 1 kg 46 6 kg and 45 2 kg in the dry season and 177 4 kg 167 8 kg and 1287 5 kg in the non dry period respectively by using different data sources the simulated load could be ranked from high to low as follows the loadest monitoring value swat for the nps tn prediction and swat monitoring value the loadest for the nps tp simulation the difference between nps tn and tp estimates could be explained by the fact that water quality samples were usually collected avoiding heavy rainfall events so the monitoring data may not represent the typical water quality during the non dry season typically the nps n is transported in a dissolved form in rainfall runoff process and diluted during high rainfall while the nps p is often attached to soil particles and aggravated with soil erosion processes during high rainfall bowes et al 2003 2005 thus the tp and tn loads might be underestimated and overestimated respectively during the non dry season if monitoring is used for direct nps pollutant calculation or as inputs of loadest the contribution rate cr of baseflow nps tn to the total river load was estimated to be 29 8 based on extra calculation method and no obvious difference could be observed between the baseflow tn and baseflow tp results by using the monitoring data and loadest model as water quality data sources when the swat model was used as the data source the cr of baseflow tn was larger than that of baseflow tp this was consistent with previous studies bowes et al 2003 2005 in which due to lower solubility p tends to accumulate in the surface soil layer by attaching to soil particles and being moved by surface runoff and soil erosion thus the cr of baseflow tp should be smaller than tn and in table 7 some scenarios that could not satisfy this condition have been excluded from later discussion it could be judged that the measured data and the loadest model data might be questionable in baseflow nps estimation compared to swat model using the swat model the annual average cr of baseflow tn and tp is estimated to be 30 1 and 23 0 respectively while the average cr during the dry season is 59 2 and 33 1 for tn and tp which is much larger than that 28 4 and 21 8 during the non dry period this indicated that the baseflow was the key means of transport of nps pollutants during the dry season especially for nps n according to the swat model the cv values of baseflow tn were estimated to be 0 4 and 0 7 from all the reserved scenarios during the dry and non dry period respectively while the cv values of baseflow tp are 1 2 and 1 0 indicating more uncertain results of the baseflow tn in the non dry season and baseflow tp in the dry season 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty of separation results the qualification of nps pathways is largely uncertain due to different water quality data sources hydrological separation methods and baseflow period assumptions in this section the uncertainty relating to baseflow separation were explored the statistical characteristics of the three groups are given by assembling and comparing different scenarios table 8 indicates that if the swat model is used the avg value for the baseflow tn prediction is estimated to be 0 118 which is smaller than that of the monitoring data 0 520 the water quality source represents the largest uncertainty source in baseflow tn estimation using different hydrographic separation methods and baseflow period assumptions the avg values of estimated baseflow nps tn range from 0 132 to 0 391 and 0 289 to 0 310 respectively the cr value of nps tn to the total river load is estimated to be 29 8 which is between the cr values when using assumptions 1 and 2 by using assumptions 1 and 2 those statistical indices are all approximate showing limited impacts of the hydrological period assumption on the baseflow nps tn prediction in addition among the different separation methods the sd cv and er values of the baseflow nps tn are the smallest using the eck method as only two scenarios are reasonable after applying the exclusion process in section 3 1 however if all the eck scenarios are excluded the sd cv and er are the smallest for all the sources which means that if a specific separation method is determined the impacts of the data sources are also limited for estimation of the baseflow tp if the swat model is used the avg value is estimated to be 0 023 which is much smaller than that of the monitoring data 0 469 the water quality source also represents the largest uncertainty source in the baseflow nps tp estimation using different separation methods and hydrological period assumptions the avg values of baseflow tp ranges from 0 026 to 0 304 and from 0 214 to 0 243 respectively for both assumptions the sd and cv values of the estimated baseflow of nps tp are both large with the largest er values suggesting that the hydrological period assumptions have a lesser effect on baseflow tp estimation compared to the other two uncertain sources however compared to the baseflow tn estimation the er and cv values of baseflow tp estimation are much larger indicating that the baseflow tp results are more uncertain than the baseflow tn chen et al 2017 using one way anova the impacts of three uncertainty sources namely water quality data sources hydrographic separation methods and baseflow period assumptions were compared and ranked table 8 shows that the water quality data source was identified as the biggest source of uncertainty p 0 05 resulting from a significant difference in the estimated nps pollutant load between the swat and monitoring data the significance level of hydrologic separation methods is estimated to be 0 157 and 0 120 for baseflow tn and tp prediction and there was no significant difference among these four hydrological separation methods in addition the significance is estimated to be 0 768 and 0 825 for two period assumptions during the baseflow tn and tp predictions respectively 4 2 implications for model construction due to the spatial and temporal variability of these pathways watershed models have been developed as the main tools used to quantify nps pollution at large spatial scales calibration represents one key process for model construction by fitting the simulation against the observation at the watershed outlets which reflects the integrated signals of the hydrological response of the entire basin currently scientists have improved model construction by first calibrating baseflow as a precise description of the groundwater process and then calibrating the parameters relating to total flow he and lu 2016 one prior task is to separate the daily baseflow from the total flow data series by automatic segmentation methods and then use the separated baseflow for model calibration however it was demonstrated herein that the simulated baseflow obtained from various separation methods were different especially during the non dry season thus previous baseflow based calibrations might be questionable as these separated baseflow data were inherently uncertain to attain baseflow data series for model calibration with less uncertainty we suggest the incorporation of tracer based methods such as environmental isotopes with nontracer baseflow separation methods tracer based methods are suggested for an accurate calculation of baseflow nps pollutants as they can provide accurate information though chemical signatures and can be taken as references to assess nontracer baseflow separation methods lott and stewart 2016 zhang et al 2017 environmental isotopes are recommended for hydrograph separation and to identify the transport means of nps pollutants yuan et al 2017 from all these aspects the water quality data source represents the main origin of uncertainty in the methods of evaluation of nps pollutant transport to reduce this uncertainty better targeted and obtaining the best possible data required by the goal is needed for those gauged watersheds in addition enhancing the accuracy of baseflow observation and rainfall process monitoring during wet periods is extremely important for the accurate calculation of baseflow nps pollutants especially for baseflow nps tp predictions in addition if there is rainfall during the dry seasons water quality records should be checked even if the water level did not change substantially zhang et al 2008 those ungauged watersheds and those with limited gauging water quality data at finer scale may be attained from physics based models to overcome the problem of insufficient data some physics based models such as the swat model can provide baseflow separation based on the description of the process of rainfall infiltration and runoff generation he and lu 2016 partington et al 2012 however the simulated baseflow might be overestimated or underestimated due to the simple assumptions and equations of the groundwater module in these physics based models arnold et al 2000 thus integrating the watershed model with groundwater models such as modflow can improve baseflow nps pollutant estimations e g kim et al 2008 4 3 implications for nps management typically surface flow and baseflow represent two important pathways of nps pollutants from their origins to nearby water bodies miller et al 2017 wang et al 2015 thus the effective management of nps requires a full understanding of the pathways by which pollutants are delivered to streams miller et al 2017 the results of this study indicate that baseflow is an extremely important pathway of nps pollutants that cannot be neglected especially for nitrogen during the dry season in the watershed we examined this result is consistent with previous studies particularly for the watersheds with high bfi or heavy groundwater contamination ouyang 2012 schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2011 for example zhu et al 2011 found that approximately 75 of the no3 n export and approximately 65 of tn export occurred in the baseflow of the appalachian mountains wang et al 2015 showed that the baseflow contributed to 40 3 of the no3 n loading in the rice agriculture catchments in subtropical china however in the past more attention has been paid to the management of surface runoff based nps pollutants by intercepting surface flow or the amount of soil erosion gao et al 2014 this practice might be questionable because the water quality may still be poor without proper management of baseflow nps even if the nps pollutants transported by surface runoff are well managed rivett et al 2011 schilling and zhang 2004 an integrated watershed management approach is suggested by considering both surface runoff and baseflow pathways gao et al 2014 for regions with heavy groundwater contamination nps pollutant management should pay even more attention to strategies for reducing baseflow transport routes such as effective aquifer management e g dinnes et al 2002 buffer zones he and lu 2016 drainage control systems and infiltration techniques dinnes et al 2002 hamel et al 2013 5 conclusions in this study an integrated method was developed for separating baseflow and surface nps pollution at the watershed scale the uncertainty relating to baseflow nps pollutant prediction was also explored by comparing four hydrological separation methods three data sources and two baseflow period assumptions the results indicated that the separated baseflow of the three automated methods are similar and show weak correlations with the swat results the simulated baseflow tn and tp loading was the largest when loadest and swat were used as the data sources the water quality data source represents the largest uncertainty in the baseflow nps pollutant estimation but if a specific separation method is determined the impacts of data sources are also limited baseflow was identified as the key transport manner of nps pollutants especially for nps n during the dry season the simulated tn and tp were more uncertain during the non dry season and the dry season respectively and the baseflow tp results were even more uncertain than the baseflow tn the results of this study could provide implications for the prediction and management of nps pollution at the watershed scale especially for groundwater polluted catchments however due to the limitation of water quality data the loadest and swat models only serve as supplementary tools in this study more water quality data should be collected and incorporated to reduce the prediction uncertainty in addition studies should be conducted in other catchments to provide further support for these conclusions furthermore future tracer based studies are suggested for a precise baseflow separation to explore the mechanism of baseflow nps pollution

6476,the freeze thaw cycle in the active soil layer plays a crucial role in cold region hydrological processes yet the effect of vertical water migration caused by the soil frost on shallow groundwater remains poorly quantified the shallow groundwater level gwl soil frost depth and main environmental controls were monitored in a humid alpine meadow on the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau from 2012 to 2017 gwl fluctuated with two seasonal maxima and minima during soil frost centric year from november to october gwl declined remarkably from the strong peak 3 9 0 2 m mean s d in mid january to the strong minimum 4 8 0 1 m in mid may and then increased to the second peak 4 2 0 2 m in late august this seasonal variability in gwl was mainly attributed to the freeze thaw processes of the lower layer soil frost from november to late june both at a 45 day delay respectively the clear increasing gwl from mid november to mid january was probably related to the melted upper layer soil frost which was detained in subsoil layers because of the high thermal isolating effect in topsoil mattic epipedon dense organic rich turf and the associated negative subsoil profile temperature gradient from mid may to late august the seasonal n type in gwl was thus hysteretically determined by the soil freeze thaw processes and the related subsoil profile temperature gradient annually gwl was significantly correlated with air temperature r2 0 88 p 0 003 n 6 suggesting the shallow groundwater recharges would be weakened under the warming scenario annual gwl was not directly connected with annual precipitation p 0 81 likely owing to the high water holding capacity of the topsoil mattic epipedon and the similarity between precipitation input and evapotranspiration loss this critical buffering function of the topsoil mattic epipedon in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling regional water dynamics in humid alpine meadows keywords shallow groundwater table soil frost freeze thaw processes mattic epipedon qinghai tibetan plateau 1 introduction alpine ecosystems are referred to as watersheds ecological safeguards and as water towers for the lowlands due to their critical role in surface runoffs and aquifer recharges bayard et al 2005 körner 2003 mcclymont et al 2010 the dynamics of extensive permafrost and active layer can substantially influence hydrological processes and biological activities ge et al 2011 hinzman et al 1991 wang et al 2009 thereby significantly impact water resource availability and ecosystem multifunction gurtz et al 2003 smith et al 2007 wright et al 2009 the active layer where soil water freezes and thaws seasonally and most alpine biochemical procedures take place is the supra permafrost zone in the top few meters near the ground surface ge et al 2011 this layer generally plays a much more active function than permafrost in shallow groundwater fluctuations and then regional water budgets under ongoing global warming barnett et al 2005 hinzman et al 1991 wang et al 2009 full knowledge of the seasonal and interannual variations of shallow groundwater table and its connectivity with soil water movement in the active layer allow us to understand the important hydrological processes in alpine areas and thus to estimate the potential influence on lowland water availability barberá et al 2018 dai et al 2019 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 however the lack of long term field observations on groundwater fluctuations presents a major obstacle in attempting to validate the numerical models which have been widely simulated water transfer to address these issues in cold zones ge et al 2008 ireson et al 2013 kang et al 2010 besides the high spatial heterogeneity in topography and vegetation yang et al 2012 alpine shallow groundwater seasonal behavior is also closely related to permafrost soil frost spring snowmelt and intense precipitation bayard and stähli 2006 mcclymont et al 2010 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 wright et al 2009 soil freeze thaw processes and the associated phase transitions between liquid water and solid ice play an important role in soil heat conductivity and water permeability hinzman et al 1991 kane and stein 1983 yi et al 2014 thus in regulating the vertical redistribution of soil water as well as the recharges and discharges of shallow groundwater daniel and staricka 2000 ge et al 2011 wright et al 2009 the vertical soil moisture migration can transfer surface water to the aquifer during the warm season and vice versa daniel and staricka 2000 sugimoto et al 2003 moreover the lower evapotranspiration rate could result in the longer residence time of precipitation input and thus the increasing subsoil moisture which could act as an additional water source for moisture vertical migration along the subsoil profiles sugimoto et al 2003 nonetheless the limited connectivity between surface water and subsoil moisture has been reported globally good et al 2015 specifically the mattic epipedon me is an extremely resilient dense turf and consists of felty fine dead and living roots in alpine meadows li et al 2015 yang et al 2014 the upper layer me has a distinct higher water retention capacity and lower thermal conductivity than the underlying layer mineral soil hinzman et al 1991 nyberg et al 2001 yang et al 2014 and then might act as a hinder for linking precipitation with subsoil moisture dai et al 2019 however the connectivity between soil moisture vertical migrations and shallow groundwater fluctuations and the associated hydrological processes have not been fully clarified in cold areas ireson et al 2013 the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp has been experiencing a much faster rate of warming than the global averages over recent decades kang et al 2010 and hydrological processes as well as the water reservoir function for the lowlands could thus be substantially influenced cao et al 2006 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 with increasing winter baseflows and spring floods at high altitudes cao et al 2006 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 short term field manipulative experiments and numerical simulations have shown that the magnitude and temporal variability in water budgets are coupled with rainfall glaciers active layer thickness topography and vegetation types biskop et al 2016 yang et al 2012 yao et al 2012 rodell et al 2018 wang et al 2009 related long term observational data are of importance for understanding these fundamental hydrological processes yet are still insufficient over qtp in this study we presented a 6 year 2012 2017 field dataset of shallow groundwater level gwl soil frost depth and main environmental variables in a humid alpine meadow to 1 quantify the seasonal and interannual variability of the shallow groundwater table and 2 identify the dominated environmental controls on gwl to speculate its potential response to climate change we focused in particular on understanding the hydrological connectivity between the shallow groundwater and precipitation in alpine meadows 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description the study was conducted at haibei national field research station for alpine grassland ecosystem hereafter haibei station 37 37 n 101 19 e 3200 m a s l situated on the northeastern qtp the mean annual air temperature t a is 1 7 c with monthly t a ranging from 15 0 c in january to 10 1 c in july the annual precipitation averages 570 0 mm and about 80 of precipitation is concentrated in plant growing season between may and september falling as rain the accumulative days and mean depths of snow cover are about 20 days and 3 0 cm respectively annual pan evaporation is 1191 4 mm the vegetation is dominated by kobresia humilis and elymus nutans and is thus classified as alpine meadow with a 96 3 root concentration depth of about 30 cm more detailed plant characteristics could be found in li et al 2015 the alpine meadow soil is a silt loam of approximately 60 80 cm thickness a lower coarse sandy loam containing rock fragments occurs below 90 cm the topsoil mattic epipedon me is recognized as the mattic diagnostic epipedon in chinese soil taxonomy with a thickness of about 10 30 cm me is quite porous with high water holding capacity and low heat conductivity yang et al 2014 variations in physical properties and calculated hydraulic conductivity along soil profile are shown in table 1 from northeast to southwest the topography of the alpine catchment consists of northern mountain snowpack 4200 4300 m alpine scree 4000 4200 m alpine forbs meadow 3600 4000 m alpine deciduous potentilla fruticosa shrubland 3400 3600 m and alpine kobresia humilis meadow 3200 3400 m fig 1 the catchment is surrounded by the undulating ridges the snowpack melts periodically in late spring and summer and accumulates from october the upper and lower boundary of the unstable patchy permafrost is estimated to be about 7 8 m and 9 18 m respectively li et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the groundwater monitoring well is located in the alpine kobresia humilis meadow between two little streams both of which are at a minimal distance of 200 m from the well the two streams have a maximal depth of 40 cm in late summer and freeze completely in winter and they converge about 400 m south of the well fig 1 2 2 data collection the routine meteorological variables were recorded by the own weather station at haibei station air temperature t a was measured by a temperature probe hmp155 vaisala finland at 1 min intervals and stored in a data logger every one hour soil temperature at 160 cm t s160 and 320 cm t s320 in a borehole was monitored manually by a mercury thermometer precipitation pan evapotranspiration et p and soil frost depth were observed by a rain gauge an evaporation pan 20 cm diameter and frost tube 3 cm diameter respectively note that the lower layer and upper layer soil frost depth is the tube ice front and rear position which means the freezing and thawing depth of soil frost respectively all of these data were measured conventionally at 20 00 beijing standard time each day soil temperature t s and unfrozen volumetric soil water content swc were measured synthetically with coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometry hydra probe ii stevens usa which was installed horizontally at 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 cm below ground the measured soil water content at these depths was widely assumed to apply to soil depths in the ranges 0 5 5 10 10 15 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm respectively the soil water storage sws was obtained by integrating the observed soil water content data and corresponding soil depths we then classified the layers 0 40 cm 40 100 cm as the topsoil and subsoil layers respectively because the majority of plant roots and soil organic matter were concentrated in the topsoil layer table 1 t s and swc were measured at 30 min intervals and stored on a cr800 campbell usa data logger these observations have been conducted since august 2014 the temporal contours of t s and swc from 5 cm to 100 cm were mapped by linear interpolation in orginpro 2015 originlab usa generally the soil temperature gradient δt s δh at a given soil depth h can represent the direction and magnitude of soil heat fluxes at a certain duration according to the law of mass conservation the first order derivative δsws δt of soil water storage sws with time serials t can be simply estimated soil water migration across a given interface 1 δ t s δ h t s h 1 t s h 2 h 1 h 2 2 δ s w s δ t 1 2 sw s i 1 s w s i t i 1 t i sw s i s w s i 1 t i t i 1 where t sh1 and t sh2 are the soil temperatures at soil depths h 1 and h 2 respectively swsi 1 swsi and swsi 1 are the soil water storage of a given depth at time ti 1 ti and ti 1 respectively a closed groundwater monitoring well with a diameter of 11 5 cm and a depth of 10 m was located about 240 m south of the weather station this well was sealed by cement at the ground to prevent surface leakage and secured by 11 0 cm steel well cap the groundwater level was measured by two pressure transducers u20 onset usa from may 2011 to july 2014 ltc solinst ltd canada since july 2014 one transducer was used to measure pressure under the groundwater and the other was used for barometric compensation below the ground 2 m in the well meanwhile the ltc transducer can monitor groundwater temperature t w and electrical conductivity which was normalized to specific conductivity at 25 c the data were recorded at 30 min intervals and collected every 6 months the modis evapotranspiration et m was derived from an 8 day composite et product mod16a2 the spatial resolution was 1 km 1 km and the selected area was centered on the weather station et m data were obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center ornl daac http daac ornl gov modis modis html et gaps were filled by a temporal linear interpolation method 2 3 statistical analysis to match the 8 day temporal resolution of modis evapotranspiration all data were averaged or summed precipitation and pan evapotranspiration at the same 8 day interval subsequent analysis was based on the soil frost centric year beginning at the occurrence of soil frost rather than the calendar year specifically november 9 16 when the soil frost occurred was taken as the beginning of one year for example the duration from november 9 in 2011 to november 8 in 2012 was referred to as 2012 to reduce uncertainties caused by year to year weather fluctuations the seasonal variations in groundwater level soil frost and other environmental variables were balanced for the same 8 day intervals during the 6 years in the case of leap years 2012 and 2016 we assumed they had a negligible effect and applied the same 8 day date serials as those of a normal year to identify the key environmental controls on dependent variables forward stepwise linear regression bivariate correlation or general linear model were employed linear or nonlinear curve fitting was adopted to detect the seasonal relationship between groundwater level and soil frost depth the sample data number n determination coefficient r 2 and significance level p was reported to evaluate the model performance statistical analyses were performed in orginpro 2015 because of the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of the mineral subsoil there was generally a time lag between subsoil water migration and shallow groundwater fluctuation dai et al 2019 hinzman et al 1991 the delay days between changes in groundwater level and soil frost depth was detected by a similar cross correlation method based on averaged daily data firstly the window of an increasing or decreasing event in the lower or upper layer soil frost was selected the bivariate correlation was conducted between the selected soil frost data and the corresponding groundwater level data with the same onset date the same correlation analysis was then carried out successively each time shifting the same length dataset of groundwater level forward by 1 day step to represent a steadily increasing delay the delay yielding the greatest determination coefficient r 2 was considered as the most representative of the lag day between the freeze thaw in soil frost and decrease increase in groundwater level 3 results 3 1 soil frost depth and environmental variables the lower layer soil frost commenced in early november and peaked at 206 15 cm mean s d the same below in late march and then the lower and upper layer soil frost began thawing almost simultaneously fig 2 note that the correlation analysis between freezing depth of the lower layer soil frost and thawing depth of the upper layer showed that the freezing rate from early november to early february was very similar to the thawing rate from late march to late june slope 1 01 r 2 0 99 p 0 001 n 12 suggesting an equivalent thermal driver during the two stages at this humid site the forward stepwise linear regression analysis of soil frost with soil temperature and moisture showed that the freezing depth of the lower layer was mostly correlated with the 320 cm soil temperature t s320 r 2 0 92 n 19 while the thawing depths of the lower layer r 2 0 99 n 12 and upper layer r 2 0 98 n 12 were both mainly determined by the 5 cm soil temperature t s5 the soil frost centric year air temperature t a averaged 0 31 c ranging from 0 74 c in 2012 to 0 07 c in 2017 fig 2 the mean t s320 was 3 5 c with a slow decrease rate 0 035 c d 1 from late september to mid june and a high increase rate 0 051 c d 1 probably caused by the presence of soil frost and associated higher thermal conductivity of ice than water fig 2 the annual precipitation averaged 500 0 mm varying from 379 0 mm in 2012 to 625 0 mm in 2014 fig 3 linear regression analysis showed that both annual t a p 0 12 and annual precipitation p 0 14 exhibited a non significant increasing trend during the 6 years the annual pan evaporation et p and annual modis evapotranspiration et m averaged 1167 4 mm and 587 9 mm respectively there was little correlation p 0 18 among precipitation et p and et m at an annual scale the soil water storage sws of the topsoil 0 40 cm and subsoil 40 100 cm layers averaged 90 5 6 0 mm and 190 0 2 5 mm during the soil frost free season from july to october respectively fig 4 a the swc at 100 cm soil depth swc 100 was almost constant at its lowest value during the unfrozen period reflecting the weak water retention below this sandy soil the contour map of soil temperature t s indicated upwards and downwards soil heat transport during the soil frost and frost free season respectively fig 4b 3 2 groundwater table fluctuations the seasonal groundwater level gwl was clearly characterized by a similar n shaped pattern with two maxima and two minima fig 5 and it could be split into two stages 1 a rapid decreasing then increasing period from mid january to late august and 2 a gradual decrease and increase from late august to mid january fig 5 the values of the first and second gwl minima averaged 4 8 0 1 m and 4 3 0 3 m in mid may and mid november noting that a large value means a lower groundwater table respectively the first and second peaks averaged 3 9 0 2 m and 4 2 0 2 m in mid january and late august respectively the rate of the two increasing gwl events was a little similar with 0 57 cm d 1 from mid may to late august and 0 50 cm d 1 from mid november to mid january fig 5 the seasonal t w and groundwater conductivity averaged 3 0 0 3 c and 700 7 25 8 μs cm 1 exhibiting sinusoidal and triple peaked patterns respectively interestingly the first peak in gwl coincided with the maximum groundwater temperature t w whereas the second peak in gwl corresponded to the minimum t w both with a 20 day delay fig 5 changes in groundwater conductivity were opposite to those of gwl from late december to late june but followed those of gwl during july fig 5 indicating that groundwater was recharged from different sources during these two increasing events the annual gwl showed a weak increasing trend r 2 0 43 p 0 09 n 6 with a rate of 6 7 cm a 1 suggesting a possible reduction in groundwater recharges 3 3 environmental controls on groundwater table the derivatives of subsoil water storage swt 40 100 and soil temperature depth gradient from 320 cm to 5 cm showed that the seasonal variations of gwl mostly coincided with the soil temperature depth gradient from january to october but followed changes in subsoil water migration during the other months fig 6 during soil frost periods the seasonal variations of gwl were mainly controlled by the lower layer soil frost depth fig 7 with a 42 day delay during the freezing period and a 50 day delay during the thawing period the slope of 0 47 cm cm 1 between thickening soil frost and decreasing gwl indicated that upward moisture migration just accounted for half of the groundwater drainages during the freezing process fig 7a while the slope of 2 04 cm cm 1 suggested that thawing soil frost was not the only significant contributor to the groundwater recharges fig 7b the upper layer soil frost thawing depth probably contributed to the increasing groundwater table from mid november to mid january figs 6 and 8 consequently the seasonal fluctuations of groundwater table were predominately driven by the soil frost freeze thaw processes and the related soil temperature depth gradients the bivariate correlation analysis showed that the annual gwl were significantly correlated with annual t a and annual et m fig 9 however the general linear model of annual gwl with t a and et m showed that only the effect of t a p 0 05 not et m p 0 48 was significant table s1 furthermore the non significant 0 09 p 0 83 n 6 correlation between annual gwl and annual monthly t a suggested that the effect of air temperature on the shallow groundwater was much complex table s2 in addition annual gwl did not correlate with annual precipitation r 2 0 p 0 81 n 6 fig s1 which indicated that there was little direct connection between the shallow groundwater fluctuation and precipitation input in the humid meadow 4 discussion the seasonal variations in groundwater table coincided with the soil frost freeze thaw seasonal cycle figs 7 and 8 which was typical of cold regions bayard and stähli 2006 ge et al 2011 sugimoto et al 2003 wang et al 2009 wright et al 2009 the delay of 1 5 months 42 day during freezing and 50 day during thawing was also consistent with the lag between the dates of maximum temperatures in the surface soil t s5 mid august and deep soil t s320 late september implying that the soil profile temperature gradient and the invoking water potential gradient might be the dominated drivers of soil moisture vertical migration during the soil frost season at high latitudes fig 6 ireson et al 2013 4 1 rapid seasonal variations of groundwater table the groundwater table decreased from mid january to mid may and then increased until late august figs 5 and 6 this initial decreasing trend was mainly caused by the thickening lower layer soil frost with a 42 day delay fig 7 a similarly delayed response was also observed in other corresponding studies but with varying lag days ge et al 2011 gurtz et al 2003 ireson et al 2013 the three fundamental drivers of water migration during the freezing thawing processes are the soil temperature gradient the water matrix potential and the unfrozen water content bayard and stähli 2006 bing et al 2015 the sufficiently moist conditions in this humid site could support the soil moisture to continuously move upwards from shallow groundwater towards the freezing front fig 4b during the soil freezing process kane and stein 1983 smith et al 2007 sugimoto et al 2003 yi et al 2014 this upward moisture movement was thus driven mostly by the combinations of the negative soil thermal gradient bing et al 2015 wang et al 2009 and the low capillary retention of the deep sandy soil layer table 1 gurtz et al 2003 the increasing groundwater conductivity arising from the evaporitic concentration in solute partially confirmed the upwards movement of water barberá et al 2018 bing et al 2015 however the increase rate of lower layer soil frost thickness was about half of the decrease rate in gwl fig 7 indicating that the two main processes of groundwater drainages lateral outflows and upward migrations ireson et al 2013 might play equivalent roles during this period of groundwater recession in our sites this groundwater recruitment from mid may to late august was also hysteretically consistent with the melted lower layer soil frost and the subsequent deep soil infiltration from june to september dai et al 2019 with about 50 day delay the thawed soil frost temporally creates soil macropores and thereby increases soil permeability daniel and staricka 2000 together with melted soil frost dai et al 2019 which can yield a rise in groundwater table ge et al 2011 wang et al 2009 simple calculations based on the distance the difference between soil frost depth and groundwater table and delay days showed that the downward rate of moisture movement was about 5 0 cm d 1 consistent with typical unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in alpine regions hinzman et al 1991 yi et al 2014 the rate of thawing lower layer soil frost was also half of the increasing rate of gwl fig 7b reflecting that the downwards melted soil frost was not the only source to this groundwater recharge gurtz et al 2003 precipitation could not be a potential contributor because the corresponding precipitation input 354 4 mm was only a little more than the modis evapotranspiration loss 337 8 mm and the relatively strong evapotranspiration fig 3 additionally resulted in reduced transmissivity and increased flow resistance mcclymont et al 2010 the lateral subsoil flow within the recharge mound induced by infiltration at the base of glaciers and snowpack bayard and stähli 2006 ge et al 2008 and the interflow produced by a saturated shallow thawed active soil layer with large spatial variable frost tables and bedrock topography mcclymont et al 2010 wang et al 2009 wright et al 2009 might provide other potential processes for groundwater recruitment bayard et al 2005 daniel and staricka 2000 gurtz et al 2003 nyberg et al 2001 the increase of groundwater conductivity after july partly confirmed this speculation because the lateral flow and interflow could be highly mineralized following its transport through mineral subsoil barberá et al 2018 dragon and marciniak 2010 hence the vertical moisture migration induced by lower layer soil freeze thaw processes was the primary but not the only determinant of the rapid seasonal variations of groundwater table from mid january to late august the opposing seasonal patterns of groundwater conductivity versus groundwater table fig 5 caused by evaporitic concentration and mineral subsoil transfer provide additional evidence to the tight exchanges between subsoil moisture and shallow groundwater 4 2 gradual seasonal variations of groundwater table the groundwater table decreased gradually from late august to mid november and then increased gradually from mid november to mid january the slow decrease was mainly caused by gradual outflows consistent with the autumn runoff recession period in the qinghai tibetan plateau wang et al 2009 the transient 2 month increase might result from the melted upper layer soil frost fig 8 this increase in groundwater table could be regarded as an indicator of aquifer recharge bayard and stähli 2006 and was in line with the recently inferred increase in winter baseflow in other cold regions gurtz et al 2003 smith et al 2007 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 sugimoto et al 2003 the water from the thawing upper layer soil frost was detained in the subsoil and transported downwards until the soil depth thermal gradient was positive hinzman et al 1991 sugimoto et al 2003 the 5 month detention of water in the subsoil from may to september was probably caused by the buffering function of the topsoil mattic epipedon which could store rainfall in the organic topsoil and afford subsequent evapotranspiration before lower mineral soil moisture was consumed bayard et al 2005 nyberg et al 2001 yang et al 2014 similarly the low seasonal variation in the stable isotopic composition of subsoil water provided additional evidence for this limited exchange between subsoil moisture and precipitation from april to september sugimoto et al 2003 the relatively stable total subsoil water storage sws 218 8 3 4 mm during july and august declined sws 1 0 40 ln day 1 77 222 76 r2 0 98 n 66 from september to november before the subsoil became frozen as shown by the shaded area in fig 6 further indicated the close relationship between subsoil water drainage and groundwater recharge moreover this speculation was also confirmed by the obvious deep soil infiltration measured by a large weighing lysimeter from october and november at the same site dai et al 2019 in addition the increasing groundwater temperature also provided another piece of evidence for the downwards percolation of relatively warm water fig 5 nevertheless the decrease rate in thawing upper layer soil frost 0 16 mm d 1 was lower than the increase rate of gwl 0 37 mm d 1 fig 8 reflecting that this downward water movement only accounted for half of the variations in gwl the upgradient movement of groundwater much directly driven by the precipitation and thawing frozen soil frost in upland alpine shrublands and screes fig 1 could represent other groundwater sources yang et al 2012 interestingly our speculation that the decrease subsoil water storage resulting in the increasing groundwater table also suggested that the lag days was about 1 5 months which agreed well with the delays in groundwater fluctuations caused by the lower layer soil frost fig 7 4 3 interannual variations of groundwater table annual gwl did not correlate with t s320 p 0 45 or the maximum depth of soil frost p 0 48 indicating that the internal redistribution of seasonal moisture between groundwater and vadose zone did not substantially influence the interannual groundwater budgets ireson et al 2013 the negative correlation between annual gwl and annual t a fig 9 suggested that groundwater recharge would be weakened under future warmer scenarios one reasonable assumption for this negative feedback could be that the warmer air temperature could advance the timing of upland snowpack and glacier thaw bayard et al 2005 gurtz et al 2003 wright et al 2009 however the upgradient meltwater and consequent surface runoff would occur as an early spring flood and could not replenish the shallow groundwater system due to the impeded water infiltration into the frozen subsoil bayard and stähli 2006 dai et al 2019 daniel and staricka 2000 hinzman et al 1991 additionally the warmer air temperature stimulates surface evapotranspiration at this humid site fig s2 which also could inhibit the soil water downward movement meanwhile the latest thawing date of the upper layer soil frost occurred on april 22 in 2017 was coincident with the maximum gwl 4 97 m compared with 4 73 0 04 m in other 5 years perhaps providing the single piece of observational evidence for the above assumption decreasing groundwater recharge and increasing surface runoff might not substantially impact the yearly outflow but instead would stimulate the seasonal variability was consistent with the findings of low variability in annual stream discharge while much spring floods over the qinghai tibetan plateau cao et al 2006 rodell et al 2018 smith et al 2007 the high early spring flooding would probably intensify the regional water availability imbalance because the highest demand downstream generally occurs in summer and autumn barnett et al 2005 there was little direct linkage between the shallow groundwater table and precipitation in this humid alpine meadow fig s1 which yields observational evidence for this weak hydrologic connectivity derived from stable isotope techniques good et al 2015 this poor link might be attributed to the following two aspects firstly the similar seasonal pattern of evapotranspiration loss and precipitation input fig 3 and thus the equivalent magnitude of annual evapotranspiration 587 9 mm and annual precipitation input 500 2 mm suggested that precipitation could not enter into subsoil and was almost returned to the atmosphere which was also consistent with the field observation by the eddy covariance method in the same area zhang et al 2018 and in other cold areas iwata et al 2012 secondly and much importantly the dense turf mattic epipedon with the higher water holding capacity and the lower thermal conductivity bayard et al 2005 yang et al 2014 due to the distinct stratification of organic matter contents along soil profile table 1 could concentrate precipitation into the topsoil and afford subsequent evapotranspiration hinzman et al 1991 and prevent rainfall to yield deep soil seepage dai et al 2019 thus likely leading to weak direct exchanges between shallow groundwater and precipitation input in the alpine meadow meanwhile the non significant correlation between the maximum annual soil frost depth p 0 69 n 6 and annual subsoil water storage p 0 35 n 3 with corresponding precipitation also partly supported this low direct connectivity this poor linkage finding probably caused by mattic epipedon confirmed that the ecological function of water retention was more evident than water yield in alpine meadows yang et al 2012 however the alpine meadows have suffered widespread serious degradation with extensive loss of me in recent decades across qtp li et al 2015 without the ecological function in higher water holding capacity and lower thermal conductivity of me soil water retention would be greatly weakened and the streamflow would be impacted directly by precipitation and thus be much more variable in seasonal variability biskop et al 2016 wang et al 2009 therefore the distinct hydrological and thermal buffering role of me should be taken into account in future hydrological studies in alpine meadows note that our findings do not discount the indirect connectivity between groundwater and precipitation in the alpine meadow for example half of the shallow groundwater was probably replenished by the upgradient lateral subsurface flow of the recharge mound from infiltration of glaciers and snowpack which was controlled directly by precipitation yang et al 2012 5 conclusions our results qualitatively demonstrated that the seasonal variations of the shallow groundwater table were principally controlled by soil frost freeze thaw processes the increasing and decreasing slope of shallow groundwater table and soil frost depth was not equal to unity suggesting that there were other significant recharge sources and discharge outflows in the groundwater seasonal variability precipitation input was entirely depleted by evapotranspiration loss reflecting a low direct hydrological connectivity between precipitation and groundwater in the alpine meadow the year to year variations in groundwater table were negatively correlated with air temperature implying the reduced groundwater recharge and much seasonal fluctuation in water yields to the lowlands the buffering function of organic topsoil mattic epipedon with higher water holding capacity and lower thermal conductivity than mineral subsoil should be fully considered in simulating the hydrological process and accessing the regional water budgets in humid alpine meadows author contributions f zhang h li

6476,the freeze thaw cycle in the active soil layer plays a crucial role in cold region hydrological processes yet the effect of vertical water migration caused by the soil frost on shallow groundwater remains poorly quantified the shallow groundwater level gwl soil frost depth and main environmental controls were monitored in a humid alpine meadow on the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau from 2012 to 2017 gwl fluctuated with two seasonal maxima and minima during soil frost centric year from november to october gwl declined remarkably from the strong peak 3 9 0 2 m mean s d in mid january to the strong minimum 4 8 0 1 m in mid may and then increased to the second peak 4 2 0 2 m in late august this seasonal variability in gwl was mainly attributed to the freeze thaw processes of the lower layer soil frost from november to late june both at a 45 day delay respectively the clear increasing gwl from mid november to mid january was probably related to the melted upper layer soil frost which was detained in subsoil layers because of the high thermal isolating effect in topsoil mattic epipedon dense organic rich turf and the associated negative subsoil profile temperature gradient from mid may to late august the seasonal n type in gwl was thus hysteretically determined by the soil freeze thaw processes and the related subsoil profile temperature gradient annually gwl was significantly correlated with air temperature r2 0 88 p 0 003 n 6 suggesting the shallow groundwater recharges would be weakened under the warming scenario annual gwl was not directly connected with annual precipitation p 0 81 likely owing to the high water holding capacity of the topsoil mattic epipedon and the similarity between precipitation input and evapotranspiration loss this critical buffering function of the topsoil mattic epipedon in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling regional water dynamics in humid alpine meadows keywords shallow groundwater table soil frost freeze thaw processes mattic epipedon qinghai tibetan plateau 1 introduction alpine ecosystems are referred to as watersheds ecological safeguards and as water towers for the lowlands due to their critical role in surface runoffs and aquifer recharges bayard et al 2005 körner 2003 mcclymont et al 2010 the dynamics of extensive permafrost and active layer can substantially influence hydrological processes and biological activities ge et al 2011 hinzman et al 1991 wang et al 2009 thereby significantly impact water resource availability and ecosystem multifunction gurtz et al 2003 smith et al 2007 wright et al 2009 the active layer where soil water freezes and thaws seasonally and most alpine biochemical procedures take place is the supra permafrost zone in the top few meters near the ground surface ge et al 2011 this layer generally plays a much more active function than permafrost in shallow groundwater fluctuations and then regional water budgets under ongoing global warming barnett et al 2005 hinzman et al 1991 wang et al 2009 full knowledge of the seasonal and interannual variations of shallow groundwater table and its connectivity with soil water movement in the active layer allow us to understand the important hydrological processes in alpine areas and thus to estimate the potential influence on lowland water availability barberá et al 2018 dai et al 2019 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 however the lack of long term field observations on groundwater fluctuations presents a major obstacle in attempting to validate the numerical models which have been widely simulated water transfer to address these issues in cold zones ge et al 2008 ireson et al 2013 kang et al 2010 besides the high spatial heterogeneity in topography and vegetation yang et al 2012 alpine shallow groundwater seasonal behavior is also closely related to permafrost soil frost spring snowmelt and intense precipitation bayard and stähli 2006 mcclymont et al 2010 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 wright et al 2009 soil freeze thaw processes and the associated phase transitions between liquid water and solid ice play an important role in soil heat conductivity and water permeability hinzman et al 1991 kane and stein 1983 yi et al 2014 thus in regulating the vertical redistribution of soil water as well as the recharges and discharges of shallow groundwater daniel and staricka 2000 ge et al 2011 wright et al 2009 the vertical soil moisture migration can transfer surface water to the aquifer during the warm season and vice versa daniel and staricka 2000 sugimoto et al 2003 moreover the lower evapotranspiration rate could result in the longer residence time of precipitation input and thus the increasing subsoil moisture which could act as an additional water source for moisture vertical migration along the subsoil profiles sugimoto et al 2003 nonetheless the limited connectivity between surface water and subsoil moisture has been reported globally good et al 2015 specifically the mattic epipedon me is an extremely resilient dense turf and consists of felty fine dead and living roots in alpine meadows li et al 2015 yang et al 2014 the upper layer me has a distinct higher water retention capacity and lower thermal conductivity than the underlying layer mineral soil hinzman et al 1991 nyberg et al 2001 yang et al 2014 and then might act as a hinder for linking precipitation with subsoil moisture dai et al 2019 however the connectivity between soil moisture vertical migrations and shallow groundwater fluctuations and the associated hydrological processes have not been fully clarified in cold areas ireson et al 2013 the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp has been experiencing a much faster rate of warming than the global averages over recent decades kang et al 2010 and hydrological processes as well as the water reservoir function for the lowlands could thus be substantially influenced cao et al 2006 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 with increasing winter baseflows and spring floods at high altitudes cao et al 2006 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 short term field manipulative experiments and numerical simulations have shown that the magnitude and temporal variability in water budgets are coupled with rainfall glaciers active layer thickness topography and vegetation types biskop et al 2016 yang et al 2012 yao et al 2012 rodell et al 2018 wang et al 2009 related long term observational data are of importance for understanding these fundamental hydrological processes yet are still insufficient over qtp in this study we presented a 6 year 2012 2017 field dataset of shallow groundwater level gwl soil frost depth and main environmental variables in a humid alpine meadow to 1 quantify the seasonal and interannual variability of the shallow groundwater table and 2 identify the dominated environmental controls on gwl to speculate its potential response to climate change we focused in particular on understanding the hydrological connectivity between the shallow groundwater and precipitation in alpine meadows 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description the study was conducted at haibei national field research station for alpine grassland ecosystem hereafter haibei station 37 37 n 101 19 e 3200 m a s l situated on the northeastern qtp the mean annual air temperature t a is 1 7 c with monthly t a ranging from 15 0 c in january to 10 1 c in july the annual precipitation averages 570 0 mm and about 80 of precipitation is concentrated in plant growing season between may and september falling as rain the accumulative days and mean depths of snow cover are about 20 days and 3 0 cm respectively annual pan evaporation is 1191 4 mm the vegetation is dominated by kobresia humilis and elymus nutans and is thus classified as alpine meadow with a 96 3 root concentration depth of about 30 cm more detailed plant characteristics could be found in li et al 2015 the alpine meadow soil is a silt loam of approximately 60 80 cm thickness a lower coarse sandy loam containing rock fragments occurs below 90 cm the topsoil mattic epipedon me is recognized as the mattic diagnostic epipedon in chinese soil taxonomy with a thickness of about 10 30 cm me is quite porous with high water holding capacity and low heat conductivity yang et al 2014 variations in physical properties and calculated hydraulic conductivity along soil profile are shown in table 1 from northeast to southwest the topography of the alpine catchment consists of northern mountain snowpack 4200 4300 m alpine scree 4000 4200 m alpine forbs meadow 3600 4000 m alpine deciduous potentilla fruticosa shrubland 3400 3600 m and alpine kobresia humilis meadow 3200 3400 m fig 1 the catchment is surrounded by the undulating ridges the snowpack melts periodically in late spring and summer and accumulates from october the upper and lower boundary of the unstable patchy permafrost is estimated to be about 7 8 m and 9 18 m respectively li et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the groundwater monitoring well is located in the alpine kobresia humilis meadow between two little streams both of which are at a minimal distance of 200 m from the well the two streams have a maximal depth of 40 cm in late summer and freeze completely in winter and they converge about 400 m south of the well fig 1 2 2 data collection the routine meteorological variables were recorded by the own weather station at haibei station air temperature t a was measured by a temperature probe hmp155 vaisala finland at 1 min intervals and stored in a data logger every one hour soil temperature at 160 cm t s160 and 320 cm t s320 in a borehole was monitored manually by a mercury thermometer precipitation pan evapotranspiration et p and soil frost depth were observed by a rain gauge an evaporation pan 20 cm diameter and frost tube 3 cm diameter respectively note that the lower layer and upper layer soil frost depth is the tube ice front and rear position which means the freezing and thawing depth of soil frost respectively all of these data were measured conventionally at 20 00 beijing standard time each day soil temperature t s and unfrozen volumetric soil water content swc were measured synthetically with coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometry hydra probe ii stevens usa which was installed horizontally at 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 cm below ground the measured soil water content at these depths was widely assumed to apply to soil depths in the ranges 0 5 5 10 10 15 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm respectively the soil water storage sws was obtained by integrating the observed soil water content data and corresponding soil depths we then classified the layers 0 40 cm 40 100 cm as the topsoil and subsoil layers respectively because the majority of plant roots and soil organic matter were concentrated in the topsoil layer table 1 t s and swc were measured at 30 min intervals and stored on a cr800 campbell usa data logger these observations have been conducted since august 2014 the temporal contours of t s and swc from 5 cm to 100 cm were mapped by linear interpolation in orginpro 2015 originlab usa generally the soil temperature gradient δt s δh at a given soil depth h can represent the direction and magnitude of soil heat fluxes at a certain duration according to the law of mass conservation the first order derivative δsws δt of soil water storage sws with time serials t can be simply estimated soil water migration across a given interface 1 δ t s δ h t s h 1 t s h 2 h 1 h 2 2 δ s w s δ t 1 2 sw s i 1 s w s i t i 1 t i sw s i s w s i 1 t i t i 1 where t sh1 and t sh2 are the soil temperatures at soil depths h 1 and h 2 respectively swsi 1 swsi and swsi 1 are the soil water storage of a given depth at time ti 1 ti and ti 1 respectively a closed groundwater monitoring well with a diameter of 11 5 cm and a depth of 10 m was located about 240 m south of the weather station this well was sealed by cement at the ground to prevent surface leakage and secured by 11 0 cm steel well cap the groundwater level was measured by two pressure transducers u20 onset usa from may 2011 to july 2014 ltc solinst ltd canada since july 2014 one transducer was used to measure pressure under the groundwater and the other was used for barometric compensation below the ground 2 m in the well meanwhile the ltc transducer can monitor groundwater temperature t w and electrical conductivity which was normalized to specific conductivity at 25 c the data were recorded at 30 min intervals and collected every 6 months the modis evapotranspiration et m was derived from an 8 day composite et product mod16a2 the spatial resolution was 1 km 1 km and the selected area was centered on the weather station et m data were obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center ornl daac http daac ornl gov modis modis html et gaps were filled by a temporal linear interpolation method 2 3 statistical analysis to match the 8 day temporal resolution of modis evapotranspiration all data were averaged or summed precipitation and pan evapotranspiration at the same 8 day interval subsequent analysis was based on the soil frost centric year beginning at the occurrence of soil frost rather than the calendar year specifically november 9 16 when the soil frost occurred was taken as the beginning of one year for example the duration from november 9 in 2011 to november 8 in 2012 was referred to as 2012 to reduce uncertainties caused by year to year weather fluctuations the seasonal variations in groundwater level soil frost and other environmental variables were balanced for the same 8 day intervals during the 6 years in the case of leap years 2012 and 2016 we assumed they had a negligible effect and applied the same 8 day date serials as those of a normal year to identify the key environmental controls on dependent variables forward stepwise linear regression bivariate correlation or general linear model were employed linear or nonlinear curve fitting was adopted to detect the seasonal relationship between groundwater level and soil frost depth the sample data number n determination coefficient r 2 and significance level p was reported to evaluate the model performance statistical analyses were performed in orginpro 2015 because of the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of the mineral subsoil there was generally a time lag between subsoil water migration and shallow groundwater fluctuation dai et al 2019 hinzman et al 1991 the delay days between changes in groundwater level and soil frost depth was detected by a similar cross correlation method based on averaged daily data firstly the window of an increasing or decreasing event in the lower or upper layer soil frost was selected the bivariate correlation was conducted between the selected soil frost data and the corresponding groundwater level data with the same onset date the same correlation analysis was then carried out successively each time shifting the same length dataset of groundwater level forward by 1 day step to represent a steadily increasing delay the delay yielding the greatest determination coefficient r 2 was considered as the most representative of the lag day between the freeze thaw in soil frost and decrease increase in groundwater level 3 results 3 1 soil frost depth and environmental variables the lower layer soil frost commenced in early november and peaked at 206 15 cm mean s d the same below in late march and then the lower and upper layer soil frost began thawing almost simultaneously fig 2 note that the correlation analysis between freezing depth of the lower layer soil frost and thawing depth of the upper layer showed that the freezing rate from early november to early february was very similar to the thawing rate from late march to late june slope 1 01 r 2 0 99 p 0 001 n 12 suggesting an equivalent thermal driver during the two stages at this humid site the forward stepwise linear regression analysis of soil frost with soil temperature and moisture showed that the freezing depth of the lower layer was mostly correlated with the 320 cm soil temperature t s320 r 2 0 92 n 19 while the thawing depths of the lower layer r 2 0 99 n 12 and upper layer r 2 0 98 n 12 were both mainly determined by the 5 cm soil temperature t s5 the soil frost centric year air temperature t a averaged 0 31 c ranging from 0 74 c in 2012 to 0 07 c in 2017 fig 2 the mean t s320 was 3 5 c with a slow decrease rate 0 035 c d 1 from late september to mid june and a high increase rate 0 051 c d 1 probably caused by the presence of soil frost and associated higher thermal conductivity of ice than water fig 2 the annual precipitation averaged 500 0 mm varying from 379 0 mm in 2012 to 625 0 mm in 2014 fig 3 linear regression analysis showed that both annual t a p 0 12 and annual precipitation p 0 14 exhibited a non significant increasing trend during the 6 years the annual pan evaporation et p and annual modis evapotranspiration et m averaged 1167 4 mm and 587 9 mm respectively there was little correlation p 0 18 among precipitation et p and et m at an annual scale the soil water storage sws of the topsoil 0 40 cm and subsoil 40 100 cm layers averaged 90 5 6 0 mm and 190 0 2 5 mm during the soil frost free season from july to october respectively fig 4 a the swc at 100 cm soil depth swc 100 was almost constant at its lowest value during the unfrozen period reflecting the weak water retention below this sandy soil the contour map of soil temperature t s indicated upwards and downwards soil heat transport during the soil frost and frost free season respectively fig 4b 3 2 groundwater table fluctuations the seasonal groundwater level gwl was clearly characterized by a similar n shaped pattern with two maxima and two minima fig 5 and it could be split into two stages 1 a rapid decreasing then increasing period from mid january to late august and 2 a gradual decrease and increase from late august to mid january fig 5 the values of the first and second gwl minima averaged 4 8 0 1 m and 4 3 0 3 m in mid may and mid november noting that a large value means a lower groundwater table respectively the first and second peaks averaged 3 9 0 2 m and 4 2 0 2 m in mid january and late august respectively the rate of the two increasing gwl events was a little similar with 0 57 cm d 1 from mid may to late august and 0 50 cm d 1 from mid november to mid january fig 5 the seasonal t w and groundwater conductivity averaged 3 0 0 3 c and 700 7 25 8 μs cm 1 exhibiting sinusoidal and triple peaked patterns respectively interestingly the first peak in gwl coincided with the maximum groundwater temperature t w whereas the second peak in gwl corresponded to the minimum t w both with a 20 day delay fig 5 changes in groundwater conductivity were opposite to those of gwl from late december to late june but followed those of gwl during july fig 5 indicating that groundwater was recharged from different sources during these two increasing events the annual gwl showed a weak increasing trend r 2 0 43 p 0 09 n 6 with a rate of 6 7 cm a 1 suggesting a possible reduction in groundwater recharges 3 3 environmental controls on groundwater table the derivatives of subsoil water storage swt 40 100 and soil temperature depth gradient from 320 cm to 5 cm showed that the seasonal variations of gwl mostly coincided with the soil temperature depth gradient from january to october but followed changes in subsoil water migration during the other months fig 6 during soil frost periods the seasonal variations of gwl were mainly controlled by the lower layer soil frost depth fig 7 with a 42 day delay during the freezing period and a 50 day delay during the thawing period the slope of 0 47 cm cm 1 between thickening soil frost and decreasing gwl indicated that upward moisture migration just accounted for half of the groundwater drainages during the freezing process fig 7a while the slope of 2 04 cm cm 1 suggested that thawing soil frost was not the only significant contributor to the groundwater recharges fig 7b the upper layer soil frost thawing depth probably contributed to the increasing groundwater table from mid november to mid january figs 6 and 8 consequently the seasonal fluctuations of groundwater table were predominately driven by the soil frost freeze thaw processes and the related soil temperature depth gradients the bivariate correlation analysis showed that the annual gwl were significantly correlated with annual t a and annual et m fig 9 however the general linear model of annual gwl with t a and et m showed that only the effect of t a p 0 05 not et m p 0 48 was significant table s1 furthermore the non significant 0 09 p 0 83 n 6 correlation between annual gwl and annual monthly t a suggested that the effect of air temperature on the shallow groundwater was much complex table s2 in addition annual gwl did not correlate with annual precipitation r 2 0 p 0 81 n 6 fig s1 which indicated that there was little direct connection between the shallow groundwater fluctuation and precipitation input in the humid meadow 4 discussion the seasonal variations in groundwater table coincided with the soil frost freeze thaw seasonal cycle figs 7 and 8 which was typical of cold regions bayard and stähli 2006 ge et al 2011 sugimoto et al 2003 wang et al 2009 wright et al 2009 the delay of 1 5 months 42 day during freezing and 50 day during thawing was also consistent with the lag between the dates of maximum temperatures in the surface soil t s5 mid august and deep soil t s320 late september implying that the soil profile temperature gradient and the invoking water potential gradient might be the dominated drivers of soil moisture vertical migration during the soil frost season at high latitudes fig 6 ireson et al 2013 4 1 rapid seasonal variations of groundwater table the groundwater table decreased from mid january to mid may and then increased until late august figs 5 and 6 this initial decreasing trend was mainly caused by the thickening lower layer soil frost with a 42 day delay fig 7 a similarly delayed response was also observed in other corresponding studies but with varying lag days ge et al 2011 gurtz et al 2003 ireson et al 2013 the three fundamental drivers of water migration during the freezing thawing processes are the soil temperature gradient the water matrix potential and the unfrozen water content bayard and stähli 2006 bing et al 2015 the sufficiently moist conditions in this humid site could support the soil moisture to continuously move upwards from shallow groundwater towards the freezing front fig 4b during the soil freezing process kane and stein 1983 smith et al 2007 sugimoto et al 2003 yi et al 2014 this upward moisture movement was thus driven mostly by the combinations of the negative soil thermal gradient bing et al 2015 wang et al 2009 and the low capillary retention of the deep sandy soil layer table 1 gurtz et al 2003 the increasing groundwater conductivity arising from the evaporitic concentration in solute partially confirmed the upwards movement of water barberá et al 2018 bing et al 2015 however the increase rate of lower layer soil frost thickness was about half of the decrease rate in gwl fig 7 indicating that the two main processes of groundwater drainages lateral outflows and upward migrations ireson et al 2013 might play equivalent roles during this period of groundwater recession in our sites this groundwater recruitment from mid may to late august was also hysteretically consistent with the melted lower layer soil frost and the subsequent deep soil infiltration from june to september dai et al 2019 with about 50 day delay the thawed soil frost temporally creates soil macropores and thereby increases soil permeability daniel and staricka 2000 together with melted soil frost dai et al 2019 which can yield a rise in groundwater table ge et al 2011 wang et al 2009 simple calculations based on the distance the difference between soil frost depth and groundwater table and delay days showed that the downward rate of moisture movement was about 5 0 cm d 1 consistent with typical unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in alpine regions hinzman et al 1991 yi et al 2014 the rate of thawing lower layer soil frost was also half of the increasing rate of gwl fig 7b reflecting that the downwards melted soil frost was not the only source to this groundwater recharge gurtz et al 2003 precipitation could not be a potential contributor because the corresponding precipitation input 354 4 mm was only a little more than the modis evapotranspiration loss 337 8 mm and the relatively strong evapotranspiration fig 3 additionally resulted in reduced transmissivity and increased flow resistance mcclymont et al 2010 the lateral subsoil flow within the recharge mound induced by infiltration at the base of glaciers and snowpack bayard and stähli 2006 ge et al 2008 and the interflow produced by a saturated shallow thawed active soil layer with large spatial variable frost tables and bedrock topography mcclymont et al 2010 wang et al 2009 wright et al 2009 might provide other potential processes for groundwater recruitment bayard et al 2005 daniel and staricka 2000 gurtz et al 2003 nyberg et al 2001 the increase of groundwater conductivity after july partly confirmed this speculation because the lateral flow and interflow could be highly mineralized following its transport through mineral subsoil barberá et al 2018 dragon and marciniak 2010 hence the vertical moisture migration induced by lower layer soil freeze thaw processes was the primary but not the only determinant of the rapid seasonal variations of groundwater table from mid january to late august the opposing seasonal patterns of groundwater conductivity versus groundwater table fig 5 caused by evaporitic concentration and mineral subsoil transfer provide additional evidence to the tight exchanges between subsoil moisture and shallow groundwater 4 2 gradual seasonal variations of groundwater table the groundwater table decreased gradually from late august to mid november and then increased gradually from mid november to mid january the slow decrease was mainly caused by gradual outflows consistent with the autumn runoff recession period in the qinghai tibetan plateau wang et al 2009 the transient 2 month increase might result from the melted upper layer soil frost fig 8 this increase in groundwater table could be regarded as an indicator of aquifer recharge bayard and stähli 2006 and was in line with the recently inferred increase in winter baseflow in other cold regions gurtz et al 2003 smith et al 2007 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 sugimoto et al 2003 the water from the thawing upper layer soil frost was detained in the subsoil and transported downwards until the soil depth thermal gradient was positive hinzman et al 1991 sugimoto et al 2003 the 5 month detention of water in the subsoil from may to september was probably caused by the buffering function of the topsoil mattic epipedon which could store rainfall in the organic topsoil and afford subsequent evapotranspiration before lower mineral soil moisture was consumed bayard et al 2005 nyberg et al 2001 yang et al 2014 similarly the low seasonal variation in the stable isotopic composition of subsoil water provided additional evidence for this limited exchange between subsoil moisture and precipitation from april to september sugimoto et al 2003 the relatively stable total subsoil water storage sws 218 8 3 4 mm during july and august declined sws 1 0 40 ln day 1 77 222 76 r2 0 98 n 66 from september to november before the subsoil became frozen as shown by the shaded area in fig 6 further indicated the close relationship between subsoil water drainage and groundwater recharge moreover this speculation was also confirmed by the obvious deep soil infiltration measured by a large weighing lysimeter from october and november at the same site dai et al 2019 in addition the increasing groundwater temperature also provided another piece of evidence for the downwards percolation of relatively warm water fig 5 nevertheless the decrease rate in thawing upper layer soil frost 0 16 mm d 1 was lower than the increase rate of gwl 0 37 mm d 1 fig 8 reflecting that this downward water movement only accounted for half of the variations in gwl the upgradient movement of groundwater much directly driven by the precipitation and thawing frozen soil frost in upland alpine shrublands and screes fig 1 could represent other groundwater sources yang et al 2012 interestingly our speculation that the decrease subsoil water storage resulting in the increasing groundwater table also suggested that the lag days was about 1 5 months which agreed well with the delays in groundwater fluctuations caused by the lower layer soil frost fig 7 4 3 interannual variations of groundwater table annual gwl did not correlate with t s320 p 0 45 or the maximum depth of soil frost p 0 48 indicating that the internal redistribution of seasonal moisture between groundwater and vadose zone did not substantially influence the interannual groundwater budgets ireson et al 2013 the negative correlation between annual gwl and annual t a fig 9 suggested that groundwater recharge would be weakened under future warmer scenarios one reasonable assumption for this negative feedback could be that the warmer air temperature could advance the timing of upland snowpack and glacier thaw bayard et al 2005 gurtz et al 2003 wright et al 2009 however the upgradient meltwater and consequent surface runoff would occur as an early spring flood and could not replenish the shallow groundwater system due to the impeded water infiltration into the frozen subsoil bayard and stähli 2006 dai et al 2019 daniel and staricka 2000 hinzman et al 1991 additionally the warmer air temperature stimulates surface evapotranspiration at this humid site fig s2 which also could inhibit the soil water downward movement meanwhile the latest thawing date of the upper layer soil frost occurred on april 22 in 2017 was coincident with the maximum gwl 4 97 m compared with 4 73 0 04 m in other 5 years perhaps providing the single piece of observational evidence for the above assumption decreasing groundwater recharge and increasing surface runoff might not substantially impact the yearly outflow but instead would stimulate the seasonal variability was consistent with the findings of low variability in annual stream discharge while much spring floods over the qinghai tibetan plateau cao et al 2006 rodell et al 2018 smith et al 2007 the high early spring flooding would probably intensify the regional water availability imbalance because the highest demand downstream generally occurs in summer and autumn barnett et al 2005 there was little direct linkage between the shallow groundwater table and precipitation in this humid alpine meadow fig s1 which yields observational evidence for this weak hydrologic connectivity derived from stable isotope techniques good et al 2015 this poor link might be attributed to the following two aspects firstly the similar seasonal pattern of evapotranspiration loss and precipitation input fig 3 and thus the equivalent magnitude of annual evapotranspiration 587 9 mm and annual precipitation input 500 2 mm suggested that precipitation could not enter into subsoil and was almost returned to the atmosphere which was also consistent with the field observation by the eddy covariance method in the same area zhang et al 2018 and in other cold areas iwata et al 2012 secondly and much importantly the dense turf mattic epipedon with the higher water holding capacity and the lower thermal conductivity bayard et al 2005 yang et al 2014 due to the distinct stratification of organic matter contents along soil profile table 1 could concentrate precipitation into the topsoil and afford subsequent evapotranspiration hinzman et al 1991 and prevent rainfall to yield deep soil seepage dai et al 2019 thus likely leading to weak direct exchanges between shallow groundwater and precipitation input in the alpine meadow meanwhile the non significant correlation between the maximum annual soil frost depth p 0 69 n 6 and annual subsoil water storage p 0 35 n 3 with corresponding precipitation also partly supported this low direct connectivity this poor linkage finding probably caused by mattic epipedon confirmed that the ecological function of water retention was more evident than water yield in alpine meadows yang et al 2012 however the alpine meadows have suffered widespread serious degradation with extensive loss of me in recent decades across qtp li et al 2015 without the ecological function in higher water holding capacity and lower thermal conductivity of me soil water retention would be greatly weakened and the streamflow would be impacted directly by precipitation and thus be much more variable in seasonal variability biskop et al 2016 wang et al 2009 therefore the distinct hydrological and thermal buffering role of me should be taken into account in future hydrological studies in alpine meadows note that our findings do not discount the indirect connectivity between groundwater and precipitation in the alpine meadow for example half of the shallow groundwater was probably replenished by the upgradient lateral subsurface flow of the recharge mound from infiltration of glaciers and snowpack which was controlled directly by precipitation yang et al 2012 5 conclusions our results qualitatively demonstrated that the seasonal variations of the shallow groundwater table were principally controlled by soil frost freeze thaw processes the increasing and decreasing slope of shallow groundwater table and soil frost depth was not equal to unity suggesting that there were other significant recharge sources and discharge outflows in the groundwater seasonal variability precipitation input was entirely depleted by evapotranspiration loss reflecting a low direct hydrological connectivity between precipitation and groundwater in the alpine meadow the year to year variations in groundwater table were negatively correlated with air temperature implying the reduced groundwater recharge and much seasonal fluctuation in water yields to the lowlands the buffering function of organic topsoil mattic epipedon with higher water holding capacity and lower thermal conductivity than mineral subsoil should be fully considered in simulating the hydrological process and accessing the regional water budgets in humid alpine meadows author contributions f zhang h li

6477,climate change and human activities have induced alterations to hydrological processes the quantification of their impacts on streamflow is a challenge especially at the seasonal scale due to seasonality of climate variables and human activities in this study the decomposition method based on budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale for quantifying the climate and direct human impacts on annual and seasonal streamflow changes in huifa river basin by defining prechange period 1953 1974 and postchange period 1975 2005 the results are further verified by the monthly abcd model both climate change and direct human activities are found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale with 68 of the change contributed by direct human activities at the seasonal scale the direct human induced declines in streamflow account for 67 and 39 of the total changes for energy limited and water limited seasons respectively whereas the impact of direct human activities is more pronounced during the irrigation season due to water withdrawal for irrigation in addition the decomposition results are analyzed for each month in the energy limited season to reveal the effects of precipitation and operation rules of ponds and reservoirs during the flood season keywords climate change human activities streamflow budyko type equation abcd model reservoir operation 1 introduction climate change and human activities are two major drivers that alter hydrological cycle and have exerted global scale impacts on environment with significant implications for water resources management jaramillo and destouni 2014 2015 kundzewicz et al 2008 milly et al 2008 vogel 2011 climate change including precipitation and potential evaporation causes significant alterations in streamflow and evapotranspiration dooge 1992 human activities can influence the streamflow directly by disturbing the hydrological processes such as land use change dam construction reservoir operation surface water and groundwater withdrawals and return flows or indirectly by affecting the climate variables such as elevated co2 and o3 concentrations urban heat island irrigation and crop evapotranspiration arrigoni et al 2010 mclaughlin et al 2007 rossi et al 2009 wang and cai 2010 significant changing trends have been detected in streamflow for many rivers around the world jiang et al 2015 vaze et al 2011 xu et al 2014 the research interests of quantifying the contribution of climate change and human activities on streamflow have increased in past decades due to the important roles of streamflow in water uses for agriculture domestic industry hydropower generation and navigation many studies have been focused on quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow based on streamflow elasticity distributed or conceptual hydrological models the elasticity method initially proposed by schaake 1990 uses elasticity coefficients to represent the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in precipitation and then has been improved by many scholars the elasticity of streamflow to various climate variables have been quantified such as precipitation niemann and eltahir 2005 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 sun et al 2013 temperature fu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 relative humidity dooge et al 1999 and potential evaporation liu et al 2013 tang and lettenmaier 2012 for example yang and yang 2011 derived climate elasticity of streamflow to precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and net radiation the elasticity coefficients have been estimated by a nonparametric method ma et al 2010 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 or a budyko equation arora 2002 dooge et al 1999 xu et al 2014 the challenge of elasticity method is to explicitly compute the elasticity coefficients of streamflow to human activities sun et al 2014 for the method based on hydrological models the impact of one specific contributor climate or human on streamflow is evaluated by changing the parameter for the contributor while fixing other parameters bao et al 2012 dey and mishra 2017 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2013 the hydrological models used for this purpose include the swat soil water assessment tool li et al 2009 mango et al 2011 zhang 2013 dtvgm distributed time variant gain model wang et al 2009 gbhm geomorphology based hydrological model ma et al 2010 and vic variable infiltration capacity model liu et al 2013 xu et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 proposed the decomposition method based on a conceptual hydrologic model i e budyko equation for quantifying the contributions of climate change and direct human activities to mean annual streamflow explicitly the decomposition method has been recently applied and extended to watersheds in china jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2014 previous studies are mostly focused on separating the attribution of climate change and human activities to annual streamflow changes however few attempts were devoted to streamflow at a shorter time scale such as seasonal or monthly scale such studies are essential due to the intra annual variations of hydro climatic variables and human activities such as rainfall seasonality intense water withdrawals during irrigation periods and reservoir operations during flood season bao et al 2012 zhang and wang 2014 liang et al 2015 this paper aims to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to intra annual streamflow changes at seasonal scale the decomposition method based on budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale by introducing a seasonal aridity index chen et al 2013 the proposed framework is then employed to the huifa river basin in china which has suffered from climate change and human interferences during the past decades the impacts of intra annual human activities e g water withdrawal for irrigation water storage and release by ponds and reservoirs on streamflow are quantified moreover the quantification results are compared with the simulation of a monthly water balance model i e abcd model 2 methodology 2 1 decomposition method based on extended budyko type model the semi empirical equation proposed by budyko 1974 is a nonparametric model for long term water balance donohue et al 2010 to incorporate the seasonal effects on water balance the water storage dynamics needs to be considered that is watershed storage can be depleted in the water limited seasons and replenished by infiltrated precipitation in the energy limited seasons therefore the water storage change needs to be subtracted from precipitation for accounting the available water supply which is defined as effective precipitation p δs chen et al 2013 wang 2012 correspondingly the seasonal aridity index is defined as the ratio of seasonal potential evaporation to seasonal effective precipitation and the seasonal evaporation ratio is defined as the ratio between seasonal evaporation and seasonal effective precipitation considering that the seasonal aridity index for a given watershed may be a positive value a shift along the horizontal axis is introduced to characterize the nonzero lower bound the modified budyko type equation choudhury 1999 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008a is used to model the dependence of seasonal evaporation ratio on seasonal aridity index chen et al 2013 1 e p δ s 1 e p p δ s φ n 1 n where e ep and p are seasonal values for evaporation potential evaporation and precipitation respectively δs is seasonal water storage change including soil water and groundwater storage changes n is the parameter representing the effects of other factors such as vegetation soil and topography on the partition of precipitation that determines the shape of the budyko curve and φ is the lower bound for seasonal aridity index by utilizing the decomposition method proposed by wang and hejazi 2011 the climate induced and direct human induced changes in streamflow are quantified at the seasonal scale in this method the climate change or variability refers to the alterations of effective precipitation and potential evaporation which can be due to natural climate variability global climate change and the regional and local climate effects due to human activities the direct human impact represents the change of effective precipitation portioning into evaporation and streamflow under given climate conditions it does not include the indirect human impacts that affect the streamflow through disturbing the climate variability wang and hejazi 2011 the schematic of the decomposition method is shown in fig 1 to evaluate the change the study period is split into two sub periods namely the prechange and postchange periods the prechange period is the baseline and climate change and direct human activities may contribute to streamflow change in the postchange period at the seasonal scale the budyko equation quantifies the partitioning of precipitation into runoff evaporation and water storage change the proposed decomposition method assumes that for a watershed without direct human impact if climate e p p δ s is changed to a drier or wetter condition due to climate change or variability the evaporation ratio e p p δ s will also change to a new state but still follow the original budyko curve as the prechange period this assumption is considered reasonable because the shape of budyko type curve is largely dependent on the physical properties of watersheds such as soil properties vegetation characteristics and topography wang and wu 2013 yang et al 2007 and these properties especially the natural vegetation dynamics co evolve with the climate variability and change through evaporation and water storage jones 2011 sivapalan 2006 therefore the movement of a watershed along the horizontal direction i e change of e p p δ s is driven by climate change or variability the movement along the vertical direction i e change of e p p δ s due to change of e can be attributed to both climate and direct human impacts as shown in fig 1 a watershed shifts over time from point a e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 e 1 p 1 δ s 1 in the prechange period to point b e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 e 1 p 1 δ s 1 in the postchange period if only affected by climate change or variability the watershed will evolve from point a to c e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the original budyko curve where point c is a hypothetical point that has the same climate condition as point b therefore climate change induces both horizontal and vertical changes i e from e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the horizontal direction and from e 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the vertical direction whereas direct human impacts move watersheds along the vertical direction from e 2 p 2 δ s 2 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 the direct human induced change of streamflow δqh is computed by 2 δ q h p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 where δqh is the direct human induced streamflow change in the postchange period then the climate induced change of streamflow δqc is the remaining component calculated by subtracting the human induced change from the total streamflow change δq 3 δ q c δ q δ q h where δq is the difference in streamflow between the postchange q2 and prechange q1 periods 4 δ q q 2 q 1 where q1 and q2 are observed streamflow during the prechange and postchange periods respectively given the time series of precipitation streamflow and meteorological data the decomposition method is implemented with the following steps 1 the monthly ep is calculated using penman monteith pm equation allen et al 1998 2 given the monthly precipitation and potential evaporation the actual evaporation and water storage change are estimated for the prechange and postchange periods using the abcd model details on the abcd model and its extension are explained in sections 2 2 3 the monthly data from step 1 and step 2 are aggregated to seasonal and annual averages and the corresponding evaporation ratio and aridity index i e e 1 p 1 δ s 1 and e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 for the prechange period and e 2 p 2 δ s 2 and e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 for the postchange period are computed 4 the parameters of φ and n in eq 1 are calibrated to e 1 p 1 δ s 1 and e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 for the prechange period that is different budyko curves are fitted for the annual scale irrigation season energy limited season and water limited season respectively 5 in the postchange period the evaporation ratio due to climate change only e 2 p 2 δ s 2 is calculated based on the calibrated parameters φ and n in step 4 and seasonal aridity index e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 in step 3 6 the climate and direct human induced changes in streamflow can be computed by eqs 2 4 to deal with the uncertainty of ep estimation the hargreaves and samani hs method hargreaves and samani 1985 is also applied for estimating ep the quantification results by repeating steps 1 6 are presented in sections 4 4 and 4 5 2 2 monthly abcd model the monthly abcd model takes precipitation and potential evaporation as input captures the dynamics of soil moisture and groundwater and produces streamflow as output thomas 1981 in the abcd model the equation for quantifying the partitioning of the sum of precipitation and initial storage can be derived from the generalized proportionality relation of scs curve number method wang and tang 2014 this model has been used in many studies e g alley 1984 fernandez et al 2000 and the details of the model can be found in previous studies such as alley 1984 and sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 the model includes four parameters i e a b c and d parameter a 0 a 1 reflects the propensity of runoff to occur before the soil is fully saturated thomas 1981 parameter b is an upper limit of the sum of evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage parameter c is the fraction of streamflow from groundwater discharge and parameter d is the coefficient for groundwater storage discharge relation these four parameters as well as the initial soil water storage between 0 and b were subject to calibration and the initial groundwater storage was determined by the method proposed by alley 1984 in addition to these processes considered in the abcd model this study applied the degree day model to take into account the effects of snow storage and snowmelt if the daily mean air temperature is below 0 c the precipitation either by snow or rainfall is assumed to be temporarily stored as ice snow pack on the ground rather than converting to stream flows braithwaite and zhang 2000 wu et al 2011 otherwise the ice snowmelt occurs which may provide additional inputs to the streamflow the amount of ice snowmelt is calculated by empirically relating to the mean daily air temperature hock 2003 2005 yang 2015 and the melt amount is added to precipitation in the abcd model rather than directly discharged into the water body given the time series of precipitation and potential evaporation the model was calibrated to the measured streamflow with the help of a genetic algorithm an objective function o is used for evaluating the model performance which is defined on the basis of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 5 o λ 1 n s e 1 λ 1 r 2 where λ is the weighting factor taken as 0 5 the smaller the value of o the better the model performance in this study the abcd model is applied mainly with two purposes first the model parameters are calibrated to the measured streamflow in both prechange and postchange periods the monthly actual evaporation and water storage change can be solved numerically at the same time using the calibrated parameters and derived model equations sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 which are further used to calculate the seasonal evaporation ratio and seasonal aridity index for both periods in the budyko decomposition method second to validate the proposed budyko decomposition method the abcd model was applied for quantifying the climate and human impacts on streamflow change as a comparison in this case the prechange period is the benchmark and the streamflow in the postchange period under climate change impact only qsim2 is produced using the calibrated parameters from the prechange period and the climate conditions in the postchange period the human induced streamflow change in the postchange period δqh can be calculated by 6 δ q h q 2 q s i m 2 the climate induced change in streamflow for the postchange period can be computed by eqs 3 and 4 all data are initially generated on a monthly basis and further aggregated to obtain the seasonal and annual averages 2 3 seasonality identification considering the seasonal variation of climate variables watershed properties and human activities bao et al 2012 yang et al 2008b the energy limited and water limited seasons within one hydrological year need to be identified chen et al 2013 proposed a method to define the energy limited and water limited months by introducing the monthly aridity index am to define fixed energy limited and water limited months over the entire period for the study region the mean monthly aridity index is used 7 a m e pm p m δ s m where e pm p m δ s m are averaged monthly potential evaporation precipitation and storage change respectively the energy limited and water limited months are differentiated by a threshold value of a m 1 months with a m 1 are identified as water limited and months with a m 1 are identified as energy limited the two seasons are defined by aggregating the identified energy limited and water limited months 3 study area and data 3 1 study area this study is focused on the huifa river basin fig 2 which is located in the south area of jilin province china the huifa river is a major tributary of the second songhua river with a total length of 268 km it originates from the longgang mountain ranges and flows northeast into the second songhua river the total basin area is about 12 411 km2 with 43 of forest and 35 of farmland in 2012 the area has a semi humid climate featured with distinguished seasons the mean annual precipitation is about 720 mm with more than 70 of precipitation occurring during the flood season from july to september the mean annual air temperature is about 5 5 c december to february are the coldest months with a mean monthly temperature of 12 5 c and july is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 22 6 c precipitation mainly occurs as snow from november to february and ice snowmelt normally starts in march in the past few decades the huifa river basin has suffered from significant anthropogenic influences and becomes one of the heavily urbanized areas in jilin province specifically many water conservation projects have been constructed to meet the water demand for domestic use and irrigation under the pressures of population growth and irrigation there are one large scale reservoir hundreds of small to medium scale reservoirs and countless ponds in the study area and the total storage capacity is about 9 5 108 m3 the total drainage area of all water conservation projects is about 7500 km2 covering up to 64 of the total area zhang et al 2012 3 2 data daily precipitation data at nine rain gauge stations were provided by the hydrological bureau of jilin province and the spatial averages were used daily streamflow data at the downstream wudaogou hydrological station was collected from the songliao water resources commission ministry of water resources meteorological conditions including relative humidity wind speed sunshine duration and mean minimum and maximum air temperatures on a daily basis at three meteorological stations were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and the spatial averages were further computed all data cover a period from 1953 to 2005 the locations of all the stations are shown in fig 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 trend of hydro meteorological series and breakpoint the nonparametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is implemented to detect the trend of annual precipitation streamflow and potential evaporation from 1953 to 2005 as shown in table 1 the annual streamflow presents a significant decreasing trend that passes the trend test at the 0 01 significance level precipitation and potential evaporation also show some degree of decreasing trend but not significant fig 3 presents the annual and 5 year moving averages of streamflow precipitation and potential evaporation the variation trend is consistent with the mann kendall test showing a changing rate of 2 11 mm year 1 35 mm year and 0 38 mm year on average for streamflow precipitation and potential evaporation respectively the cumulative double mass method searcy and hardison 1960 xue et al 2017 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 are used to identify the breakpoint of streamflow for determining the prechange and postchange periods fig 4 shows the relationship between cumulative annual streamflow versus cumulative annual precipitation it is apparent that the year 1975 can be identified as a breakpoint since the correlations before and after the point are significantly different with the slopes of regression lines being 0 30 and 0 26 respectively meanwhile the pettitt test proved the same breakpoint in 1975 at a significance level of 0 02 the breakpoint determined in this study is in accordance with the year suggested by zhang 2013 for the same study region in addition a large number of water conservation projects in the study region were constructed during 1960s 1970s indicating an emergence of human activities during that period once the breakpoint is detected the overall time series is split into two sub periods the prechange period from 1953 to 1974 and the postchange period from 1975 to 2005 4 2 fitting results of budyko type model according to the definition of energy limited and water limited months explained in section 2 3 the energy limited and water limited seasons in this study region are identified as july to september and october to june respectively in addition an irrigation period is defined as may to july due to water withdrawal for irrigation therefore there are water limited season october to april irrigation season may to july and energy limited season july to september in this study fig 5 plots the correlations of evaporation ratio versus aridity index for the prechange and postchange periods for annual scale irrigation season energy limited season and water limited season respectively the two parameters n and φ in the seasonal budyko type model eq 1 are calibrated to the plots of the prechange period for each season the calibrated values of n and φ as well as the corresponding r2 and rmse between the plots and fitted curves are summarized in table 2 results show that rmse ranges from 0 01 to 0 04 and r2 are 0 89 0 76 and 0 99 for annual scale irrigation season and energy limited season indicating a reasonable performance of the fitting curves it can be seen that for all seasons the plots for the postchange period are generally distributed on the upper side of the fitting curves indicating an enhancement of the evaporation ratio e p δ s and an reduction of streamflow due to direct human interferences similar result has been reported by jaramillo and destouni 2015 about a flow regulation and irrigation related increase in the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation at a global scale 4 3 parameter estimation of abcd model as explained in section 2 2 the abcd model is applied with two main purposes in this study one is to generate the actual evaporation and water storage change for the prechange and postchange periods for the budyko decomposition method and the other is to quantify the impacts of climate change and human impact on streamflow change as a verification of the budyko decomposition method for this parameters of the abcd model are calibrated for both the prechange and postchange periods thus the corresponding actual evaporation and water storage change can be estimated at the same time as derived by sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 either period is further divided into a calibration period and a validation period that is from 1953 to 1966 calibration and 1967 to 1974 validation for the prechange period and from 1975 to 1999 calibration and 2000 to 2005 validation for the postchange period the optimized values of model parameters and initial soil water storage are summarized in table 3 fig 6 displays the simulated and observed monthly streamflow the performance of the model is generally satisfactory as shown in table 4 nse and r2 ranges from 0 75 to 0 86 and 0 71 to 0 87 respectively indicating a fairly satisfactory fitting condition thus the model is sufficiently reliable for estimating the hydrological variables for the budyko decomposition method as well as for quantifying the relative impacts of climate change and human impacts on streamflow 4 4 quantification of climate and direct human impacts on streamflow the proposed decomposition method based on budyko type model is applied to quantify the impacts of climate change and direct human activities on annual and seasonal streamflow changes and the quantification results are further compared with the abcd model fig 7 a d presents the quantification results for annual scale irrigation season energy limited season and water limited season respectively each contains the results from two ep estimates to account for the uncertainty of ep and the propagated effect of carrying the abcd model estimates to the budyko decomposition method for a specific ep the results generated by the budyko type model and abcd model agree well both climate variability and direct human activity contributed to the decrease of streamflow at the annual scale at the seasonal scale direct human activities were found to cause a streamflow decrease for all seasons whereas climate change led to a streamflow decrease for energy limited and water limited seasons and a streamflow increase for the irrigation period although the budyko decomposition method and abcd model suggested the same ways increase or decrease of climate variability and direct human activities in influencing the streamflow change there were still differences in terms of magnitude the differences were particularly significant for the irrigation period with the absolute differences calculated at 3 5 mm month by averaging two ep methods for both climate induced and direct human induced changes such systematic discrepancy can be attributed to the different calculation procedures and different model structures of the two methods for example the abcd model computes the surface runoff and base flow independently whereas the budyko method only computes the total runoff the contribution of climate change to streamflow change for all seasons can be explained by the changes in effective precipitation and potential evaporation from prechange to postchange periods for example the climate induced increase in streamflow during irrigation season is associated with the increased effective precipitation and decreased potential evaporation the human induced streamflow decrease in irrigation season is primarily due to water withdrawals for irrigation in the energy limited season the human interference causes a streamflow decrease by 6 0 mm month on average this can be primarily attributed to the constructed ponds and reservoirs for directly storing water during flood seasons moreover the stored water potentially signifies higher probability for evaporation due to the larger water surface area jaramillo and destouni 2015 maarten et al 2011 the impact of direct human activities on streamflow change in the water limited season is relatively small the decrease in streamflow is primarily due to water withdrawal for domestic use note that the quantification results based on two different ep estimates showed consistent ways increase or decrease in influencing the streamflow change and the magnitude of change are similar except for the irrigation season therefore it can be concluded from the quantification results that human activities play a dominant role in reducing streamflow especially during the irrigation and energy limited seasons 4 5 effects of intensive human activities on streamflow in energy limited season the human interferences during the energy limited season are influential due to flood control facilities and reservoir operations the operation rules for ponds and reservoirs in each month are illustrated in fig 8 correspondingly the monthly quantification results from the abcd model are shown in fig 9 the estimated climate induced streamflow changes by averaging two ep results are 22 4 mm 19 8 mm and 13 6 mm for july august and september respectively such climate induced changes are basically resulted from the changes in effective precipitation and potential evaporation human activities during this period can be divided into several stages according to operation rules for flood control ponds are either empty or with a minimum water level before the flood season i e the end of water limited season reservoirs generally need to remain a water level below the flood limited water level flwl during the entire flood season to maintain adequate storage capacity for flood prevention li et al 2010 during the early stage of the flood season approximately in late july runoff is largely stored in ponds and reservoirs until the water level reaches flwl these filling processes are the primary cause of human induced streamflow decrease in july during the middle stage of the flood season i e august human activities were found to induce an increase in streamflow on average by 4 0 mm month this can be explained with two possible reasons first the storage in ponds becomes full quickly in the early filling stage since the storage capacities are usually small and then inflows will be spilled and high inflows may even break the ponds cao et al 2011 peng et al 2016 second the reservoirs will store water at the water rising stage temporarily to alleviate the flood damage risk then the carry over storage i e the amount above flwl will be released during the flood recession period at the late stage of the flood season i e late august and september pond storage reaches the storage capacity while reservoirs store water to the normal water level for future water use causing a streamflow decrease by 3 8 mm on average in september this provides useful implications for water conservation under the cascade development at the end of flood season the downstream reservoirs can store water in advance under the premise of acceptable flood risk since the streamflow from upstream may be reduced due to water storage by the upstream reservoirs 4 6 potential effects of other possible drivers on streamflow change this study showed the dominating effects of reservoir operation and irrigation water withdrawals on the water cycles however there are uncertainties on other possible drivers of change on evaporation ratio and streamflow changes in forest biomass and vegetation dynamics were among the most influential processes that alter the partitioning of precipitation donohue et al 2012 jaramillo et al 2018 sun et al 2005 yang et al 2008b the forest clear cutting could reduce evapotranspiration and increase runoff whereas

vegetation feedbacks including the increase in evapotranspiration due to increased leaf area and rooting depth bond and midgley 2012 piao et al 2007 and the decrease in evapotranspiration induced by a water saving response due to reduced stomata conductance betts et al 2007 milly and dunne 2016 swann et al 2016 studies in china have reported significant impacts of land use cover changes on evaporation variations depending on the corresponding changes of land use cover types liu et al 2008 qiu et al 2011 xu et al 2013 however this may not apply to the huifa river basin which had experienced little human induced land cover change during the study period zhang 2013 since the coupled human climate and hydrological processes are complicated and interacted separation of climate change and human impacts on streamflow remains a challenge further considerations could be given to quantify the impacts of specific human activities such as land use change water withdrawal and return flow 5 conclusions quantifying the relative impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes at the seasonal monthly scale is essential due to the intra annual variations of climate variables and human activities in this study the decomposition method based on the budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale given the simplicity of the proposed method it is feasible to separate the climate and direct human contributions to seasonal streamflow changes independently with less data required and a lower simulation burden the seasonal decomposition method can be easily applied to any watersheds if precipitation potential evaporation actual evaporation and runoff data are available the proposed decomposition method is applied to the huifa river basin in china and the quantification results of the budyko type method are verified with the monthly abcd model both climate change and direct human activities were found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale at the seasonal scale direct human activities accounted for 67 and 39 on average of the streamflow decrease in the energy limited and water limited seasons respectively whereas the effect was even pronounced during the irrigation season due to irrigated water withdrawal the monthly attribution analysis further showed that the operation rules of ponds and reservoirs are influential in altering the streamflow during all stages of flood season the findings in this study highlight the responses of streamflow as a consequence of intra annual variations of climate variability and direct

6477,climate change and human activities have induced alterations to hydrological processes the quantification of their impacts on streamflow is a challenge especially at the seasonal scale due to seasonality of climate variables and human activities in this study the decomposition method based on budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale for quantifying the climate and direct human impacts on annual and seasonal streamflow changes in huifa river basin by defining prechange period 1953 1974 and postchange period 1975 2005 the results are further verified by the monthly abcd model both climate change and direct human activities are found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale with 68 of the change contributed by direct human activities at the seasonal scale the direct human induced declines in streamflow account for 67 and 39 of the total changes for energy limited and water limited seasons respectively whereas the impact of direct human activities is more pronounced during the irrigation season due to water withdrawal for irrigation in addition the decomposition results are analyzed for each month in the energy limited season to reveal the effects of precipitation and operation rules of ponds and reservoirs during the flood season keywords climate change human activities streamflow budyko type equation abcd model reservoir operation 1 introduction climate change and human activities are two major drivers that alter hydrological cycle and have exerted global scale impacts on environment with significant implications for water resources management jaramillo and destouni 2014 2015 kundzewicz et al 2008 milly et al 2008 vogel 2011 climate change including precipitation and potential evaporation causes significant alterations in streamflow and evapotranspiration dooge 1992 human activities can influence the streamflow directly by disturbing the hydrological processes such as land use change dam construction reservoir operation surface water and groundwater withdrawals and return flows or indirectly by affecting the climate variables such as elevated co2 and o3 concentrations urban heat island irrigation and crop evapotranspiration arrigoni et al 2010 mclaughlin et al 2007 rossi et al 2009 wang and cai 2010 significant changing trends have been detected in streamflow for many rivers around the world jiang et al 2015 vaze et al 2011 xu et al 2014 the research interests of quantifying the contribution of climate change and human activities on streamflow have increased in past decades due to the important roles of streamflow in water uses for agriculture domestic industry hydropower generation and navigation many studies have been focused on quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow based on streamflow elasticity distributed or conceptual hydrological models the elasticity method initially proposed by schaake 1990 uses elasticity coefficients to represent the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in precipitation and then has been improved by many scholars the elasticity of streamflow to various climate variables have been quantified such as precipitation niemann and eltahir 2005 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 sun et al 2013 temperature fu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 relative humidity dooge et al 1999 and potential evaporation liu et al 2013 tang and lettenmaier 2012 for example yang and yang 2011 derived climate elasticity of streamflow to precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and net radiation the elasticity coefficients have been estimated by a nonparametric method ma et al 2010 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 or a budyko equation arora 2002 dooge et al 1999 xu et al 2014 the challenge of elasticity method is to explicitly compute the elasticity coefficients of streamflow to human activities sun et al 2014 for the method based on hydrological models the impact of one specific contributor climate or human on streamflow is evaluated by changing the parameter for the contributor while fixing other parameters bao et al 2012 dey and mishra 2017 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2013 the hydrological models used for this purpose include the swat soil water assessment tool li et al 2009 mango et al 2011 zhang 2013 dtvgm distributed time variant gain model wang et al 2009 gbhm geomorphology based hydrological model ma et al 2010 and vic variable infiltration capacity model liu et al 2013 xu et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 proposed the decomposition method based on a conceptual hydrologic model i e budyko equation for quantifying the contributions of climate change and direct human activities to mean annual streamflow explicitly the decomposition method has been recently applied and extended to watersheds in china jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2014 previous studies are mostly focused on separating the attribution of climate change and human activities to annual streamflow changes however few attempts were devoted to streamflow at a shorter time scale such as seasonal or monthly scale such studies are essential due to the intra annual variations of hydro climatic variables and human activities such as rainfall seasonality intense water withdrawals during irrigation periods and reservoir operations during flood season bao et al 2012 zhang and wang 2014 liang et al 2015 this paper aims to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to intra annual streamflow changes at seasonal scale the decomposition method based on budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale by introducing a seasonal aridity index chen et al 2013 the proposed framework is then employed to the huifa river basin in china which has suffered from climate change and human interferences during the past decades the impacts of intra annual human activities e g water withdrawal for irrigation water storage and release by ponds and reservoirs on streamflow are quantified moreover the quantification results are compared with the simulation of a monthly water balance model i e abcd model 2 methodology 2 1 decomposition method based on extended budyko type model the semi empirical equation proposed by budyko 1974 is a nonparametric model for long term water balance donohue et al 2010 to incorporate the seasonal effects on water balance the water storage dynamics needs to be considered that is watershed storage can be depleted in the water limited seasons and replenished by infiltrated precipitation in the energy limited seasons therefore the water storage change needs to be subtracted from precipitation for accounting the available water supply which is defined as effective precipitation p δs chen et al 2013 wang 2012 correspondingly the seasonal aridity index is defined as the ratio of seasonal potential evaporation to seasonal effective precipitation and the seasonal evaporation ratio is defined as the ratio between seasonal evaporation and seasonal effective precipitation considering that the seasonal aridity index for a given watershed may be a positive value a shift along the horizontal axis is introduced to characterize the nonzero lower bound the modified budyko type equation choudhury 1999 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008a is used to model the dependence of seasonal evaporation ratio on seasonal aridity index chen et al 2013 1 e p δ s 1 e p p δ s φ n 1 n where e ep and p are seasonal values for evaporation potential evaporation and precipitation respectively δs is seasonal water storage change including soil water and groundwater storage changes n is the parameter representing the effects of other factors such as vegetation soil and topography on the partition of precipitation that determines the shape of the budyko curve and φ is the lower bound for seasonal aridity index by utilizing the decomposition method proposed by wang and hejazi 2011 the climate induced and direct human induced changes in streamflow are quantified at the seasonal scale in this method the climate change or variability refers to the alterations of effective precipitation and potential evaporation which can be due to natural climate variability global climate change and the regional and local climate effects due to human activities the direct human impact represents the change of effective precipitation portioning into evaporation and streamflow under given climate conditions it does not include the indirect human impacts that affect the streamflow through disturbing the climate variability wang and hejazi 2011 the schematic of the decomposition method is shown in fig 1 to evaluate the change the study period is split into two sub periods namely the prechange and postchange periods the prechange period is the baseline and climate change and direct human activities may contribute to streamflow change in the postchange period at the seasonal scale the budyko equation quantifies the partitioning of precipitation into runoff evaporation and water storage change the proposed decomposition method assumes that for a watershed without direct human impact if climate e p p δ s is changed to a drier or wetter condition due to climate change or variability the evaporation ratio e p p δ s will also change to a new state but still follow the original budyko curve as the prechange period this assumption is considered reasonable because the shape of budyko type curve is largely dependent on the physical properties of watersheds such as soil properties vegetation characteristics and topography wang and wu 2013 yang et al 2007 and these properties especially the natural vegetation dynamics co evolve with the climate variability and change through evaporation and water storage jones 2011 sivapalan 2006 therefore the movement of a watershed along the horizontal direction i e change of e p p δ s is driven by climate change or variability the movement along the vertical direction i e change of e p p δ s due to change of e can be attributed to both climate and direct human impacts as shown in fig 1 a watershed shifts over time from point a e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 e 1 p 1 δ s 1 in the prechange period to point b e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 e 1 p 1 δ s 1 in the postchange period if only affected by climate change or variability the watershed will evolve from point a to c e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the original budyko curve where point c is a hypothetical point that has the same climate condition as point b therefore climate change induces both horizontal and vertical changes i e from e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the horizontal direction and from e 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the vertical direction whereas direct human impacts move watersheds along the vertical direction from e 2 p 2 δ s 2 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 the direct human induced change of streamflow δqh is computed by 2 δ q h p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 where δqh is the direct human induced streamflow change in the postchange period then the climate induced change of streamflow δqc is the remaining component calculated by subtracting the human induced change from the total streamflow change δq 3 δ q c δ q δ q h where δq is the difference in streamflow between the postchange q2 and prechange q1 periods 4 δ q q 2 q 1 where q1 and q2 are observed streamflow during the prechange and postchange periods respectively given the time series of precipitation streamflow and meteorological data the decomposition method is implemented with the following steps 1 the monthly ep is calculated using penman monteith pm equation allen et al 1998 2 given the monthly precipitation and potential evaporation the actual evaporation and water storage change are estimated for the prechange and postchange periods using the abcd model details on the abcd model and its extension are explained in sections 2 2 3 the monthly data from step 1 and step 2 are aggregated to seasonal and annual averages and the corresponding evaporation ratio and aridity index i e e 1 p 1 δ s 1 and e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 for the prechange period and e 2 p 2 δ s 2 and e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 for the postchange period are computed 4 the parameters of φ and n in eq 1 are calibrated to e 1 p 1 δ s 1 and e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 for the prechange period that is different budyko curves are fitted for the annual scale irrigation season energy limited season and water limited season respectively 5 in the postchange period the evaporation ratio due to climate change only e 2 p 2 δ s 2 is calculated based on the calibrated parameters φ and n in step 4 and seasonal aridity index e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 in step 3 6 the climate and direct human induced changes in streamflow can be computed by eqs 2 4 to deal with the uncertainty of ep estimation the hargreaves and samani hs method hargreaves and samani 1985 is also applied for estimating ep the quantification results by repeating steps 1 6 are presented in sections 4 4 and 4 5 2 2 monthly abcd model the monthly abcd model takes precipitation and potential evaporation as input captures the dynamics of soil moisture and groundwater and produces streamflow as output thomas 1981 in the abcd model the equation for quantifying the partitioning of the sum of precipitation and initial storage can be derived from the generalized proportionality relation of scs curve number method wang and tang 2014 this model has been used in many studies e g alley 1984 fernandez et al 2000 and the details of the model can be found in previous studies such as alley 1984 and sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 the model includes four parameters i e a b c and d parameter a 0 a 1 reflects the propensity of runoff to occur before the soil is fully saturated thomas 1981 parameter b is an upper limit of the sum of evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage parameter c is the fraction of streamflow from groundwater discharge and parameter d is the coefficient for groundwater storage discharge relation these four parameters as well as the initial soil water storage between 0 and b were subject to calibration and the initial groundwater storage was determined by the method proposed by alley 1984 in addition to these processes considered in the abcd model this study applied the degree day model to take into account the effects of snow storage and snowmelt if the daily mean air temperature is below 0 c the precipitation either by snow or rainfall is assumed to be temporarily stored as ice snow pack on the ground rather than converting to stream flows braithwaite and zhang 2000 wu et al 2011 otherwise the ice snowmelt occurs which may provide additional inputs to the streamflow the amount of ice snowmelt is calculated by empirically relating to the mean daily air temperature hock 2003 2005 yang 2015 and the melt amount is added to precipitation in the abcd model rather than directly discharged into the water body given the time series of precipitation and potential evaporation the model was calibrated to the measured streamflow with the help of a genetic algorithm an objective function o is used for evaluating the model performance which is defined on the basis of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 5 o λ 1 n s e 1 λ 1 r 2 where λ is the weighting factor taken as 0 5 the smaller the value of o the better the model performance in this study the abcd model is applied mainly with two purposes first the model parameters are calibrated to the measured streamflow in both prechange and postchange periods the monthly actual evaporation and water storage change can be solved numerically at the same time using the calibrated parameters and derived model equations sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 which are further used to calculate the seasonal evaporation ratio and seasonal aridity index for both periods in the budyko decomposition method second to validate the proposed budyko decomposition method the abcd model was applied for quantifying the climate and human impacts on streamflow change as a comparison in this case the prechange period is the benchmark and the streamflow in the postchange period under climate change impact only qsim2 is produced using the calibrated parameters from the prechange period and the climate conditions in the postchange period the human induced streamflow change in the postchange period δqh can be calculated by 6 δ q h q 2 q s i m 2 the climate induced change in streamflow for the postchange period can be computed by eqs 3 and 4 all data are initially generated on a monthly basis and further aggregated to obtain the seasonal and annual averages 2 3 seasonality identification considering the seasonal variation of climate variables watershed properties and human activities bao et al 2012 yang et al 2008b the energy limited and water limited seasons within one hydrological year need to be identified chen et al 2013 proposed a method to define the energy limited and water limited months by introducing the monthly aridity index am to define fixed energy limited and water limited months over the entire period for the study region the mean monthly aridity index is used 7 a m e pm p m δ s m where e pm p m δ s m are averaged monthly potential evaporation precipitation and storage change respectively the energy limited and water limited months are differentiated by a threshold value of a m 1 months with a m 1 are identified as water limited and months with a m 1 are identified as energy limited the two seasons are defined by aggregating the identified energy limited and water limited months 3 study area and data 3 1 study area this study is focused on the huifa river basin fig 2 which is located in the south area of jilin province china the huifa river is a major tributary of the second songhua river with a total length of 268 km it originates from the longgang mountain ranges and flows northeast into the second songhua river the total basin area is about 12 411 km2 with 43 of forest and 35 of farmland in 2012 the area has a semi humid climate featured with distinguished seasons the mean annual precipitation is about 720 mm with more than 70 of precipitation occurring during the flood season from july to september the mean annual air temperature is about 5 5 c december to february are the coldest months with a mean monthly temperature of 12 5 c and july is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 22 6 c precipitation mainly occurs as snow from november to february and ice snowmelt normally starts in march in the past few decades the huifa river basin has suffered from significant anthropogenic influences and becomes one of the heavily urbanized areas in jilin province specifically many water conservation projects have been constructed to meet the water demand for domestic use and irrigation under the pressures of population growth and irrigation there are one large scale reservoir hundreds of small to medium scale reservoirs and countless ponds in the study area and the total storage capacity is about 9 5 108 m3 the total drainage area of all water conservation projects is about 7500 km2 covering up to 64 of the total area zhang et al 2012 3 2 data daily precipitation data at nine rain gauge stations were provided by the hydrological bureau of jilin province and the spatial averages were used daily streamflow data at the downstream wudaogou hydrological station was collected from the songliao water resources commission ministry of water resources meteorological conditions including relative humidity wind speed sunshine duration and mean minimum and maximum air temperatures on a daily basis at three meteorological stations were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and the spatial averages were further computed all data cover a period from 1953 to 2005 the locations of all the stations are shown in fig 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 trend of hydro meteorological series and breakpoint the nonparametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is implemented to detect the trend of annual precipitation streamflow and potential evaporation from 1953 to 2005 as shown in table 1 the annual streamflow presents a significant decreasing trend that passes the trend test at the 0 01 significance level precipitation and potential evaporation also show some degree of decreasing trend but not significant fig 3 presents the annual and 5 year moving averages of streamflow precipitation and potential evaporation the variation trend is consistent with the mann kendall test showing a changing rate of 2 11 mm year 1 35 mm year and 0 38 mm year on average for streamflow precipitation and potential evaporation respectively the cumulative double mass method searcy and hardison 1960 xue et al 2017 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 are used to identify the breakpoint of streamflow for determining the prechange and postchange periods fig 4 shows the relationship between cumulative annual streamflow versus cumulative annual precipitation it is apparent that the year 1975 can be identified as a breakpoint since the correlations before and after the point are significantly different with the slopes of regression lines being 0 30 and 0 26 respectively meanwhile the pettitt test proved the same breakpoint in 1975 at a significance level of 0 02 the breakpoint determined in this study is in accordance with the year suggested by zhang 2013 for the same study region in addition a large number of water conservation projects in the study region were constructed during 1960s 1970s indicating an emergence of human activities during that period once the breakpoint is detected the overall time series is split into two sub periods the prechange period from 1953 to 1974 and the postchange period from 1975 to 2005 4 2 fitting results of budyko type model according to the definition of energy limited and water limited months explained in section 2 3 the energy limited and water limited seasons in this study region are identified as july to september and october to june respectively in addition an irrigation period is defined as may to july due to water withdrawal for irrigation therefore there are water limited season october to april irrigation season may to july and energy limited season july to september in this study fig 5 plots the correlations of evaporation ratio versus aridity index for the prechange and postchange periods for annual scale irrigation season energy limited season and water limited season respectively the two parameters n and φ in the seasonal budyko type model eq 1 are calibrated to the plots of the prechange period for each season the calibrated values of n and φ as well as the corresponding r2 and rmse between the plots and fitted curves are summarized in table 2 results show that rmse ranges from 0 01 to 0 04 and r2 are 0 89 0 76 and 0 99 for annual scale irrigation season and energy limited season indicating a reasonable performance of the fitting curves it can be seen that for all seasons the plots for the postchange period are generally distributed on the upper side of the fitting curves indicating an enhancement of the evaporation ratio e p δ s and an reduction of streamflow due to direct human interferences similar result has been reported by jaramillo and destouni 2015 about a flow regulation and irrigation related increase in the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation at a global scale 4 3 parameter estimation of abcd model as explained in section 2 2 the abcd model is applied with two main purposes in this study one is to generate the actual evaporation and water storage change for the prechange and postchange periods for the budyko decomposition method and the other is to quantify the impacts of climate change and human impact on streamflow change as a verification of the budyko decomposition method for this parameters of the abcd model are calibrated for both the prechange and postchange periods thus the corresponding actual evaporation and water storage change can be estimated at the same time as derived by sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 either period is further divided into a calibration period and a validation period that is from 1953 to 1966 calibration and 1967 to 1974 validation for the prechange period and from 1975 to 1999 calibration and 2000 to 2005 validation for the postchange period the optimized values of model parameters and initial soil water storage are summarized in table 3 fig 6 displays the simulated and observed monthly streamflow the performance of the model is generally satisfactory as shown in table 4 nse and r2 ranges from 0 75 to 0 86 and 0 71 to 0 87 respectively indicating a fairly satisfactory fitting condition thus the model is sufficiently reliable for estimating the hydrological variables for the budyko decomposition method as well as for quantifying the relative impacts of climate change and human impacts on streamflow 4 4 quantification of climate and direct human impacts on streamflow the proposed decomposition method based on budyko type model is applied to quantify the impacts of climate change and direct human activities on annual and seasonal streamflow changes and the quantification results are further compared with the abcd model fig 7 a d presents the quantification results for annual scale irrigation season energy limited season and water limited season respectively each contains the results from two ep estimates to account for the uncertainty of ep and the propagated effect of carrying the abcd model estimates to the budyko decomposition method for a specific ep the results generated by the budyko type model and abcd model agree well both climate variability and direct human activity contributed to the decrease of streamflow at the annual scale at the seasonal scale direct human activities were found to cause a streamflow decrease for all seasons whereas climate change led to a streamflow decrease for energy limited and water limited seasons and a streamflow increase for the irrigation period although the budyko decomposition method and abcd model suggested the same ways increase or decrease of climate variability and direct human activities in influencing the streamflow change there were still differences in terms of magnitude the differences were particularly significant for the irrigation period with the absolute differences calculated at 3 5 mm month by averaging two ep methods for both climate induced and direct human induced changes such systematic discrepancy can be attributed to the different calculation procedures and different model structures of the two methods for example the abcd model computes the surface runoff and base flow independently whereas the budyko method only computes the total runoff the contribution of climate change to streamflow change for all seasons can be explained by the changes in effective precipitation and potential evaporation from prechange to postchange periods for example the climate induced increase in streamflow during irrigation season is associated with the increased effective precipitation and decreased potential evaporation the human induced streamflow decrease in irrigation season is primarily due to water withdrawals for irrigation in the energy limited season the human interference causes a streamflow decrease by 6 0 mm month on average this can be primarily attributed to the constructed ponds and reservoirs for directly storing water during flood seasons moreover the stored water potentially signifies higher probability for evaporation due to the larger water surface area jaramillo and destouni 2015 maarten et al 2011 the impact of direct human activities on streamflow change in the water limited season is relatively small the decrease in streamflow is primarily due to water withdrawal for domestic use note that the quantification results based on two different ep estimates showed consistent ways increase or decrease in influencing the streamflow change and the magnitude of change are similar except for the irrigation season therefore it can be concluded from the quantification results that human activities play a dominant role in reducing streamflow especially during the irrigation and energy limited seasons 4 5 effects of intensive human activities on streamflow in energy limited season the human interferences during the energy limited season are influential due to flood control facilities and reservoir operations the operation rules for ponds and reservoirs in each month are illustrated in fig 8 correspondingly the monthly quantification results from the abcd model are shown in fig 9 the estimated climate induced streamflow changes by averaging two ep results are 22 4 mm 19 8 mm and 13 6 mm for july august and september respectively such climate induced changes are basically resulted from the changes in effective precipitation and potential evaporation human activities during this period can be divided into several stages according to operation rules for flood control ponds are either empty or with a minimum water level before the flood season i e the end of water limited season reservoirs generally need to remain a water level below the flood limited water level flwl during the entire flood season to maintain adequate storage capacity for flood prevention li et al 2010 during the early stage of the flood season approximately in late july runoff is largely stored in ponds and reservoirs until the water level reaches flwl these filling processes are the primary cause of human induced streamflow decrease in july during the middle stage of the flood season i e august human activities were found to induce an increase in streamflow on average by 4 0 mm month this can be explained with two possible reasons first the storage in ponds becomes full quickly in the early filling stage since the storage capacities are usually small and then inflows will be spilled and high inflows may even break the ponds cao et al 2011 peng et al 2016 second the reservoirs will store water at the water rising stage temporarily to alleviate the flood damage risk then the carry over storage i e the amount above flwl will be released during the flood recession period at the late stage of the flood season i e late august and september pond storage reaches the storage capacity while reservoirs store water to the normal water level for future water use causing a streamflow decrease by 3 8 mm on average in september this provides useful implications for water conservation under the cascade development at the end of flood season the downstream reservoirs can store water in advance under the premise of acceptable flood risk since the streamflow from upstream may be reduced due to water storage by the upstream reservoirs 4 6 potential effects of other possible drivers on streamflow change this study showed the dominating effects of reservoir operation and irrigation water withdrawals on the water cycles however there are uncertainties on other possible drivers of change on evaporation ratio and streamflow changes in forest biomass and vegetation dynamics were among the most influential processes that alter the partitioning of precipitation donohue et al 2012 jaramillo et al 2018 sun et al 2005 yang et al 2008b the forest clear cutting could reduce evapotranspiration and increase runoff whereas reforestation or regrowth has resulted in an opposite effect andréassian 2004 sørensen et al 2009 studies have found the elevated carbon dioxide co2 driven changes on hydrological cycle via forest or vegetation feedbacks including the increase in evapotranspiration due to increased leaf area and rooting depth bond and midgley 2012 piao et al 2007 and the decrease in evapotranspiration induced by a water saving response due to reduced stomata conductance betts et al 2007 milly and dunne 2016 swann et al 2016 studies in china have reported significant impacts of land use cover changes on evaporation variations depending on the corresponding changes of land use cover types liu et al 2008 qiu et al 2011 xu et al 2013 however this may not apply to the huifa river basin which had experienced little human induced land cover change during the study period zhang 2013 since the coupled human climate and hydrological processes are complicated and interacted separation of climate change and human impacts on streamflow remains a challenge further considerations could be given to quantify the impacts of specific human activities such as land use change water withdrawal and return flow 5 conclusions quantifying the relative impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes at the seasonal monthly scale is essential due to the intra annual variations of climate variables and human activities in this study the decomposition method based on the budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale given the simplicity of the proposed method it is feasible to separate the climate and direct human contributions to seasonal streamflow changes independently with less data required and a lower simulation burden the seasonal decomposition method can be easily applied to any watersheds if precipitation potential evaporation actual evaporation and runoff data are available the proposed decomposition method is applied to the huifa river basin in china and the quantification results of the budyko type method are verified with the monthly abcd model both climate change and direct human activities were found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale at the seasonal scale direct human activities accounted for 67 and 39 on average of the streamflow decrease in the energy limited and water limited seasons respectively whereas the effect was even pronounced during the irrigation season due to irrigated water withdrawal the monthly attribution analysis further showed that the operation rules of ponds and reservoirs are influential in altering the streamflow during all stages of flood season the findings in this study highlight the responses of streamflow as a consequence of intra annual variations of climate variability and direct human activities which needs to be thoughtfully considered in water planning and allocation for maintaining a sustainable water resources acknowledgements this research is supported by the national

6478,in the last few decades the northern region of iraq has been severely impacted by climate change which has created long term drought water shortage and casual flood events dam construction in suitable sites is a primary water management strategy to solve flood and drought dam site selection depends on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria such as geology soil type and altitude in

slope rainfall data 2000 2011 water discharge land use cover road network and material used for dam construction two mathematical models namely ahp and fuzzy logic were applied in this study the best model was selected by using location and cluster based accuracy assessment depending on the proposed dam site i e bekhme dam results showed that fuzzy logic is more accurate than ahp in terms of the surface area of suitable lands identified the ahp model determined 13 446 900 m2 as a highly suitable area whereas the fuzzy model identified 3 409 200 m2 from the total area of 69 347 700 m2 finally this study identified four sites for intermediate and large dams in the study area the total water capacities of proposed dam 1 dam 2 dam 3 and dam 4 are about 81 5 239 3 374 6 and 646 5 million m3 respectively when the dam height is 60 m the proposed methods can be easily replicated to other areas for similar applications the finding reveals that ahp model is distributed and scattered in the whole study area whereas the fuzzy model is more suitable for clustered areas keywords dam site suitability remote sensing gis multi criteria decision analysis fuzzy ahp 1 introduction water demand is increasing because of climate change and rapid population growth schewe et al 2014 iraq is an agricultural country wherein the demand for water has been growing for more agricultural production to guarantee food security the main source of irrigation water is rivers proper location of dams in rivers could control floods skalak et al 2013 and provide hydropower energy for surrounding residential areas the need to constructing dam has been increasing to meet the required of drinking water supply irrigation water resource productivity drought control system and the influence of this construction can be social environmental and economic altinbilek 2002 dam site selection is one of the main problems in the water resources management upper zap river is one of the important rivers in the north of iraq this river provides water for irrigation and water supply however the major problem with this river is that there are no dams built on it the problem of having no dams on this river could effect on urban flooding water shortage and reducing the important water of irrigation gis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda are efficient tools for spatial analysis and decision making malczewski 2004 islam et al 2018 el shirbeny et al 2018 decision analysis involves a set of systematic procedures to assess complex decision problem malczewski 1999 which is usually evaluated by various individuals including managers decision makers stakeholders and interest group members who often display unique preferences for criteria used in the evaluation accordingly multi criteria decision making mcdm and gis are integrated to increase the analysis capabilities for site suitability abdulkareem et al 2018a b althuwaynee et al 2012 2014 gis is used to in detail analyze the spatial decision context whereas mcdm is applied to compare alternatives abdullahi et al 2014 a few critical aspects of mcdm are having a restricted set of substitutes and an overtly distinct set of alternatives thereby necessitating information on the decision maker s choices and having a focus on outcomes chakhar et al 2003 when solving an mcdm an individual must know the significance or weight of the unsubstantial attributes as well as the assessments of the alternatives with respect to the attributes the most recognized mcdm methods are simple additive weight ideal point method analytical hierarchy process ahp and fuzzy logic a lot of research has been done on dam site selection methods and affected factors safavian and amani 2015 forzieri et al 2008 yasser et al 2013 minatour et al 2015 abushandi and alatawi 2015 tsiko and haile 2011 thanoon and ahmed 2013 ahmad et al 2013 qureshi 2015 also there are many papers have been published on dam site selection and hydropower energy site selection fitzgerald et al 2012 larentis et al 2010 rajeev and mahesha 2018 jamali et al 2014 rojanamon et al 2009 a previous study found that the commonly used ahp method is human subjective and that the results could be easily biased chan and kumar 2007 to overcome this problem fuzzy logic was suggested in this research for suitable dam site selection in specific fuzzy logic has the ability to deal with vague control rules expressed by human language molina et al 2017 chung et al 2017 fuzzy logic is an efficient method when it comes to dealing with unclear features li et al 2017 this technique requires a degree of importance for gis layers that can be expressed by values between 0 and 1 i e 1 for the most important suitable land and 0 for the least important one van et al 1996 ahp introduces the concept of hierarchical thinking but some uncertain variables i e expert weightage may confuse decision making emamgholi et al 2015 the traditional ahp requires crisp judgments however a decision maker may feel more confident to provide fuzzy judgments than crisp comparisons because of the complexity and uncertainty involved in real world decision problems fuzzy decision making is a powerful paradigm of dealing with human expert knowledge this method has been used to solve or support spatial reasoning problems in different contexts such as locating convenience stores and selecting other sites ahamed et al 2000 burrough et al 1992 lewis et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 sicat et al 2005 stoms et al 2002 however ahp is limited by the difficulty in obtaining ideas and is predisposed to human subjectivity previous studies suggested alternative techniques for suitability application such as fuzzy logic keshavarzi et al 2010 fuzzy logic site selection is commonly used when uncertain elements are present and when a site cannot be specified charabi et al 2011 markowski et al 1977 liu et al 2016 the present study aims to identify appropriate areas for the construction of dams by using remote sensing gis and mcdm technique due to the requirement of the reservoir s capacity in the region dam sites suitability has been proposed along the greater zab river ahp and fuzzy logic were applied to select suitable sites for constructing dams on the selected river in the study area the proposed dams are also characterized 2 study area the greater zab is an approximately 437 km long river that flows through turkey and iraq fig 1 a the river rises in turkey near lake van and connects with the tigris in iraq south of mosul city awchi 2014 it supplies 28 7 of the water in the tigris al ansari et al 2014 approximately 300 km of the river s course is located within iraq rainfall and snowmelt are the primary sources of water in the river and its tributaries and the resulting dischargehighly fluctuates throughout the year al ansari et al 2014 fig 1b shows the annual rainfall map of the study area the great zab which originates in turkey generates 13 18 km3 at its confluence with the tigris 62 of the total area of this river basin of 25810 km2 is in iraq fao of the tigris tributaries the greater zab river has the largest water yield the headwaters of this river originate from the ararat mountains in turkey at an altitude of 4 636 m asl the headwater topography features steep slopes and several tributaries and wadis including khazir rubari shin rukuchuk and rubat mawaran rivers flow into the greater zab river 3 methodology the overall methodology of this research is shown in fig 2 to find suitable sites for dam construction various types of data were collected from different sources satellite imagery landsat 8 oli was downloaded from the usgs website which has 30 m spatial resolution images taken on august 2014 were pre processed processed and then post processed to produce the land use and land cover map of the study area in this study envi software was used to produce land use and land cover map while arcgis software was used to produce other maps digital elevation model dem 30 m 30 m was extracted from aster gdm in raster formats and the data were mosaicked the dem data was acquired on 17 october 2011 dem was used to extract the drainage network elevation and slope of the study area the topography of the study area is complex in terms of relief variation geological soil and tectonic maps of northern iraq were obtained from the ministry of industry and minerals iraq geology survey the geological map was updated in 2014 and its scale is 1 250 000 the scales of the soil and tectonic maps are both 1 1 000 000 the main roads of the region were extracted from the base map of duhok governorate prepared by joint humanitarian information center and the scale of this map is 1 100 000 climate data were obtained from the meteorological department of kurdistan region government in iraq the annual rainfall data from 2000 to 2011 were also procured the study area covers 25 climatological stations annual discharge data were provided by the department of dams and reservoirs of kurdistan region government in iraq criteria with direct influence on the land suitability of dam site selection were selected these criteria include geological formation soil tectonic fault elevation slope rainfall river discharge materials for earth dam construction and urban and rural areas and roads two mcdm models namely ahp and fuzzy logic were used to determine the land suitability for dam site selection the model with the highest accuracy was compared on the basis of the proposed dam bekhme dam in the study area subsequently four suitable sites were identified and proposed for dam construction in addition the length and water storage of each dam were calculated finally the dam site was ranked according to the length and water storage of each dam 3 1 data used based on the literature review this study selected 12 criteria fig 3 for the determination of suitable areas for dam construction rainfall slope river discharge soil texture geology distance from urban and rural areas distance from fault and tectonic lines distance from the main road and distance from the available material for dam construction hydrological parameters such as stream network flow accumulation altitude and slope were derived from the dem using arcgis 10 3 software the altitude map was derived from the dem of the study area the elevation ranged from 180 m to 3600 m above sea level the slope map was extracted from the dem lewis et al 2014 and is classified into five percentage classes according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nation fao lewis et al 2014 the classes were generated according to the defined interval in five zones namely 2 2 8 8 15 15 30 and 30 slope steepness is an important consideration when assigning and implementing dam sites lewis et al 2014 the study area is characterized by gentle slopes on the southwest part while steep slopes and deep valleys on the north and northeast parts the study area displays five types of land cover bare soil urban rural water and vegetation fig 4 land cover which is an important criterion in dam site selection was derived from the landsat image in this study maximum likelihood ml classifier was used to classify the landsat data with a classification accuracy of 91 field surveyed data were used as training and testing to evaluate the classification accuracy of the land cover map which is extracted from the landsat images noori et al 2018 in this study 70 ground control points gcps were used as training data and 30 gcps as testing data ml classifier has shown high accuracies especially in mapping land use land cover ajaj et al 2017 previous research showed that the distance from urban areas influences dam site selection to prevent possible hazards dams must be located as far as possible from residential areas distances less than 2500 m are considered inappropriate and regions with longer distances achieve higher rates ghazal et al 2015 the distance from rural areas must be considered to avoid hard reaching regions in the construction phase proximity to a rural area is an easiness index in measuring the manpower necessary for barrage construction in general sites far from village incur additional costs during the dam construction phase forzieri et al 2008 on the basis of the literature the layer was categorized into five classes rainfall stations are dispersed all over the study area thereby providing a means for the suitable estimation of rainfall distribution rainfall point measurements represent yearly values within 2000 2011 the kriging interpolation method is employed to estimate rainfall in areas without rainfall point measurements chen et al 2008 eq 1 was used to perform kriging interpolation 1 z s o i 1 n λ i z s i where z s i is the measured value λi is an unknown weight for the measured value z s o is the prediction value and n is the number of measured values the maximum and minimum amounts of rainfall can be found in the northern and southern part of the study area respectively the study area has following characteristics sand gypsum soils gravel stony and rough and rock protuberances buringh 1960 hameed 2013 fig 5 a shows soil types of the study area the study area is situated within the imbricate high folded and low folded zone and zagros suture zone all of which classified under the unstable shelf of the arabian plate sissakian 2013 sharbazheri et al 2009 fig 5 b represent the geological formation of the region the material for earth dam construction was extracted from the geological map it is available at reasonable distances from the greater zab river composed of loose gravel and clay materials usable for the construction of an earth fill dam body and of the impervious core and suitable for the large scale production of concrete aggregates the construction materials should be available near the dam site to save transportation cost this information can be obtained from the geological map shells needed for the construction of an earth fill dam can be easily obtained from the abundant alluvial deposits present on the river bed and in the flood plain of the greater zab river and its tributary the clay material was extracted from both layers of claystone comprising the injana formation and the old alluvial deposits found in the study area the abundance of loose gravel and sandy alluvial materials in the study area ensures the availability of inert materials necessary for the manufacture of high quality concrete the great quantity of sand within the flood plain deposits and the nearby beds of the wadis also help avoid any crushing processes for the production of fine and intermediate inert fractions special structures of basin geology can be found in most parts of the greater zab basin a site with fault lines along stream must be eliminated from listed potential dam sites forzieri et al 2008 the dams must be located at least 100 m from the fault this distance is used as a basis in rating areas with longer distance from the faults ghazal et al 2015 the main zagros thrust fault of the zagros suture zone also runs within the extreme northern and northeastern part of the study area causing the complicated structure framework of the involved area jabbar and sissakian 2010 thus areas near tectonic lines have lower inner layer weights compared with those far from tectonic lines lemos 1988 sites with faults and tectonic lines along streams must be eliminated from potential dam sites forzieri et al 2008 ameen 1992 the distance from road communications network is an important consideration when selecting dam sites dam sites should be near roads to reduce transportation cost ghazal et al 2015 water discharge is an important factor in dam site selection sites with a large amount of water discharge have high potential to be selected because they increase the hydropower of dams the kriging interpolation technique is used to map mean annual river discharges sauquet 2006 in the present study six discharge stations were used to interpolate the annual river discharge along the greater zab river sub criteria should be considered to realize a precise evaluation from this concept each main criterion in this study has sub criteria table 1 all aforementioned main criteria and subcriteria were used to evaluate the suitable sites for dam construction 3 2 ahp ahp is a commonly used mcdm tool ahp has been employed in a wide variety of applications in different fields including site suitability drobne et al 2009 chakhar et al 2003 different factors have different levels of importance in potential dam site selection chezgi et al 2016 therefore the importance of each parameter was identified for instance geology is the main consideration in dam site selection but the level of importance of different geological factors varies geological formations are a more important consideration in dam site selection than the distance from a fault line we have used a weighted linear combination in the present study drobne et al 2009 step 1 determination of weights the relative importance of different criteria is a piece of important information for decision makers mcdm is influenced by factors of different importance levels thus the importance of each factor is weighed and ranked in defining the decision maker s preferences drobne et al 2009 an mce module is used in weighing criteria in this study pairwise comparison or ahp developed by saaty 1980 was used pairwise comparison compares each factor against all other factors to calculate the weights of factors in saaty s method the main eigenvector of the square reciprocal matrix of pairwise comparison is employed between two criteria drobne et al 2009 this method compares the importance of two criteria for a given object table 2 shows the explanation of the rating between two factors by nine points continuous scale drobne et al 2009 saaty 1980 step 2 pairwise comparison consistency pairwise comparison accuracy is measured by calculating the consistency ratio cr eq 2 which is used to evaluate the relative weight of each factor the cr is a ratio between the consistency index ci and the random index ri the comparison between criteria is acceptable when cr less than 10 otherwise the cr lets for the re evaluation of comparison 2 c r c i r i depending on the matrix order the ri can be found from the specific table prepared by 53 table 3 shows ri value according to the number of factors the ci calculated using eq 3 3 c i λ max n n 1 where λmax weight1 s1 weight2 s2 weight3 s3 n number of criteria after calculating the ci the cr equation is applied if the result is less than 10 then the weight was assigned step 3 geometric mean the geometric mean is a special type of average where the numbers are multiplied as percentages derived from values together and then root is applied for the numbers as described in eq 4 dong et al 2010 4 g e o m e t r i c m e a n g m x 1 x 2 x 3 x n n where n represents the number of returns in the series and x i s a variable in this research the geometric mean formula was used after collecting the questionnaire related to the ahp matrices from six expert s feedback questionnaires the geometric mean was calculated for each factor from the matrices with crs less than 10 table 4 shows the geometric mean for the final weight for each main criterion table 5 shows the final weightage of criteria furthermore the geometric mean formula was applied for sub criteria 3 3 application of the fuzzy logic model zadeh 1965 proposed fuzzy logic based on fuzzy set theory the fuzzy approach is applied in land suitability mapping where pixels on any causal factor layer are considered a suitable area pixel values could range from 0 i e not suitable to 1 i e suitable pixel values must lie in the range of 0 to 1 but the choice of values has no practical constraint the values reflect the degree of membership of a set according to subjective judgment bonham 1994 or can be derived by various functions representing the reality in this study the linear functions are used eastman 2003 in the present case fuzzy membership values were assigned as recommended by saaty 1980 table 2 fuzzy logic is preferred for land suitability evaluation because fuzzy approaches estimate land use suitability on a continuous scale elaalem 2012 tables 6 and 7 show the relative importance of the factors according to the class interval and class type respectively land suitability based on fuzzy logic helps overcome vagueness and uncertainty the application of fuzzy logic in site suitability evaluation has four steps elaalem 2012 step 1 normalization or standardization of land characteristics using fuzzy set models fuzzy logic membership helps in determining the suitability or unsuitability of a site this step assigns values from 0 i e not likely or unsuitable to 1 i e most likely or suitable elaalem 2012 thus higher fuzzy membership value means better site suitability understanding the four types of membership and choosing the one that best fits the analysis criteria are important when assigning fuzzy membership values the membership function in a fuzzy system has several types such as linear small large and gaussian in this study the linear membership function is used to normalize the parameters because it depends on input parameters if the input parameters are chaotic e g time series the gaussian type of membership function is suggested otherwise the linear type is recommended qiu et al 2014 large or small values are assigned with high fuzzy membership fuzzy membership decreases at a constant rate a triangular membership function is specified by the following three parameters a b c 5 t r i a n g u l a t i o n x a b c 0 x a x a b a a x b c x c b b x c 0 c x step 2 generation of the criterion map layers in fuzzy logic an alternative scaling approach where linguistic variables represent both quantitative and qualitative criteria is offered the study by marks et al 1995 provides an example of a qualitative variable that is expressed as a linguistic variable in a quantitative criterion e g return on resources the terms very low low medium high and very high should be defined for representation by a linguistic variable these terms are represented by fuzzy sets that are defined on the present quantitative scale in this study the linear membership function was used to normalize the parameters because it depends on input parameters if the input parameter is not chaotic the linear membership function is suggested elaalem 2012 this step assigns values from 0 i e not likely or unsuitable to 1 i e most likely or suitable the range between 0 to 1 membership function corresponds to the intensity of importance of each criterion which is determined on the basis of the literature and expert opinion step 3 generation of the overall land suitability map layers several reclassified surfaces with values ranging from 0 to 1 are generated by assigning the appropriate fuzzy membership value for data criteria clinton et al 2010 in the next step the fuzzy logic model is applied this step is similar to weighted site selection a site selection type that allows users to rank raster cells and assign a relative importance value to each layer because it compares the different reclassified surfaces this step is completed by selecting a type of fuzzy overlay the boolean operations were used to integrate all factors by logical operators such as and and or operations and is intersection operator and it is a very restrictive or risk averse operator the mission of and distinguish because of an area will be excluded from the suitability maps if any single criteria fails to meet its threshold on the other hand or is a union operator in which there is a risk involved and an entire area could be chosen as long as a single criterion meets its threshold romano et al 2015 in this study and fuzzy overlay type is used because of its suitability for finding locations that meet all criteria qiu et al 2014 cheng and thompson 2016 3 4 accuracy assessment to evaluate the results obtained from the ahp and fuzzy models a segmentation accuracy assessment was used and modified for dam site selection clinton et al 2010 the method is based on the number of suitable pixels i e segment identified by the model and the summation of distances from suitable pixels to the reference point first the reference point was identified and located on the map of the suitable site for dam construction as determined by experts i e the proposed dam is bekhme dam then three buffers with distances of 250 500 and 1000 m were created around the reference point spatial tools in gis were used to estimate the statistics of the suitable pixels inside these buffers i e the total number of pixels the number of suitable pixels and distance from the pixels to the reference point these statistics then were used to calculate the two accuracy measurement which is described by eq 6 6 a c c u r a c y o f s u i t a b l e p i x e l s n n n number of high suitable pixels 7 a c c u r a c y o f d i s t a n c e f r o m r e f e r e n c e m a x d i s t a n c e f r o m r e f e r e n c e m a x m i n 8 o v e r a l l a c c u r c a y a c c u r a c y o f s u i t a b l e p i x e l s a c c u r a c y o f d i s t a n c e f r o m r e f e r e n c e 2 first the accuracy of suitable pixels was calculated using the number of suitable pixels found in each buffer to the total number of pixels contained in the buffer area then the accuracy of distances from suitable pixels to the reference points i e bekhme dam was estimated using eq 7 which required the maximum and minimum distances from suitable pixels to the reference point in both models based on these two accuracy measures the overall accuracy was calculated using eq 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 identification of suitable sites for dams by the ahp model after setting the conditioning factors in gis questionnaires were prepared for experts based on the factors determined and their classes were identified from the literature review the experts provided feedback about the factors and their contribution in selecting suitable sites for dam construction in the study area then the weights of each factor were calculated using the geometric mean method in gis to determine the final weight of each factor the factors were then reclassified based on their weights and prepared using the raster calculator to generate a suitability map that describes the locations for constructing dams the suitability map produced using the ahp model is shown in fig 6 a this map shows the suitable areas in green color and non suitable areas in gray color the suitable areas were almost distributed in the entire study area however the most suitable areas were found in the middle of the study area the overall area of highly suitable lands for constructing dams was 13 446 900 m2 therefore a field visit is required to identify the final location of the dams the suitability map produced in gis by the ahp model shows that suitable sites are not clustered in a single area but distributed into different locations in the study area the finding indicates that some of the conditioning factors largely influence the selection of suitable sites and are distributed in the study area and not clustered the final weights of factors show that the geology formation was the most influenced factor for dam site suitability while the distance from road factor has the lowest influence on dam site suitability table 5 this is because ahp uses the weights of these factors ultimately leading to higher weightage only some of the sites identified as suitable by the ahp model were near urban areas these sites needed further investigations and analysis to determine their possibility of constructing dams 4 2 application of fuzzy model the suitability map produced by the fuzzy method is presented in fig 6 b this map shows the locations of suitable and non suitable areas for dam construction in the study areas the map shows that most of the suitable areas are in the middle and north parts of the study area the southern part of the study area contains no suitable sites for dam construction and thus should be ignored in the field visit the overall surface area of the highly suitable lands is estimated to be 3 409 200 m2 these results indicate that the middle part of the study area is suitable for the first suitable location of dams however field visit is required to confirm the final location for dam construction field visit enables the selection of the best locations in consideration of other factors e g population that are not used in the model and may change the suitability map produced by the fuzzy model shows the spatial distribution of the suitable areas and their patterns in the study area most of the suitable areas are clustered into groups and are not randomly scattered into different directions this finding indicates that suitable areas determined to have the same characteristics and are homogenous this information makes the final selection of decision makers easier and more accurate in other words a decision maker can easily identify the suitable areas for dam construction decision makers also need to view the suitable locations in the field to determine the final sites for dam construction this procedure is important because changes may occur in the sites and because other factors such as the need for the hydropower or the amount of irrigation water are not considered in the model 4 3 models comparison in this study two models such as ahp and fuzzy logic were used ahp was used because of its proven benefits in decision making that can be obtained through pairwise comparison on the other hand fuzzy approach was used because of its ability to omit the crisp boundaries in the modeling process in terms of the surface area of the suitable lands identified the ahp model produced 13 446 900 m2 as highly suitable area whereas the fuzzy model identified 3 409 200 m2 area as highly suitable for constructing dams this result indicates that the results generated by the fuzzy model are more reasonable and accurate than the results generated by the ahp model this result can be ascribed to the fact that fuzzy analysis models the uncertainties in the layers used in the ahp model the hard boundaries between the factors and within each class of each factor are directly modeled this result is also consistent with previous results that fuzzy could produce better results than ahp the nature of the fuzzy system and it s dealing with uncertainties between class boundaries render this approach more logical than the ahp approach in addition the fuzzy approach does not require specific weights for each class and thus produces results that are not biased toward one factor this characteristic is obvious in the ahp model in that the results are more distributed and scattered in the whole study area which indicates the absence of bias toward certain factors and almost to the geology factor has the highest weight among the factors the accuracy of the results produced from both models is presented in the next section 4 4 accuracy assessment table 8 shows the overall accuracy of site suitability determined by the ahp and fuzzy models the overall accuracies indicate that the fuzzy model is more accurate than the ahp model and that it is consistent in the three buffers fig 7 a this finding ensures that the fuzzy model produces a suitability map that is more accurate than ahp based on the location of the reference point the accuracy assessment mechanism evaluates the performance of ahp by using three buffering zones with varying distances to calculate the distance from suitable pixels to the reference point i e bekhm dam as illustrated in fig 7 b on the other hand the results of ahp method demonstrated that the number of pixels are scattered and spread in different regions fig 7 b on the contrary the pixels in fuzzy model are mostly clustered 4 5 characteristics of proposed dams on the basis of the suitability maps of dam location obtained from the fuzzy model the layers of drainage network contour line and triangulated irregular network tin were generated from aster digital elevation model in this research the proposed dams are medium and large sized dam location was selected in accordance with the site suitability of dam layer that obtained from fuzzy model in addition the height and volume were calculated from the tin using 3d spatial tools of arcgis software dam s length was computed from the section dam profile which is extracted from the digital elevation model using arcgis 3d spatial tools the location and number of proposed dams in the study area are presented in fig 8 the dams should be located on the water drainage the southern part of the study area has gentle slopes which are plan with depthless water drainage by contrast the northern part is almost mountains and hilly with the deep water drainage dam 1 is situated upstream of the drainage dam 1 2 3 and 4 are located successively according to the order of the drainage a site with narrow drainage is preferred to minimize the structures cost sites of the dam should be located in a way that the water can be controlled over a monsoon dams may be situated near habitation the water in dams reservoirs could either be used for irrigate surrounding areas or transmit to the southern part of the study area through the water drainage network to provide additional irrigation during drought proposed sites for dam construction were obtained from the suitability map with medium and large size the height length storage capacity and basin area of the selected dams were considered appropriate locations for the dams were searched using drainage networks and contour lines per 5 m interval the storage capacity of the dam was estimated using the triangular irregular network layer via arcgis 10 3 tools the factors that effects dam size are storage capacity and height of dam robinson 2006 table 9 shows that dams can be classified as small medium or large the present study identified only intermediate and large potential dams table 9 illustrates the different types of dam according to size and height the storage capacity of dam 1 2 3 4 are shown in fig 9 table 10 illustrates the geometric characteristics of the proposed dam sites dam 1 is located at 36 54 15 n 44 00 42 e with an elevation of 490 meters above sea level dam 2 is located at 36 45 11 n 44 16 53 e with an elevation of 400 meters dam 3 is located at 36 42 08 n 44 16 11 e with an elevation of 500 meters dam 4 is situated at 36 27 59 n 43 51 30 e with an elevation of 290 meters and the storage capacity around 646 5 million m3 at the height of 60 m the location of dams 1 2 3 and 4 were selected in highly suitable areas for constructing dams among the four dams dam 4 can store the largest amount of water the storage capacity of dam 4 is 646 5 million m3 at 60 m height whereas that of dam 3 is only 374 6 million m3 at 60 m height of the dam proposed by a group of experts in 1988 table 10 dam 3 has the shortest length among the four dams which making it more economic than the others fig 9 shows the storage volumetric capacity of dam 1 2 3 and 4 table 10 shows the capacity of the reservoirs and their elevations of dam heights for dam 1 2 3 and 4 the suitable area for dam construction in the greater zab basin was estimated from the available data however other criteria such as population and socioeconomic status should be considered but these criteria were unavailable for use in this study finally the ranking of dam sites were done according to length storage capacity and cost i e dam 3 is the first and the second third and fourth were dam 4 dam 1 and dam 2 respectively 4 6 discussion in recent decades the application of remote sensing and gis techniques are very popular in hydrology remote sensing based techniques provide valuable datasets to examine hydrological variables and morphological changes over large regions at different spatial and temporal scales e g aster dem satellite image therefore by using the capability of remote sensing and gis technology to prepare a detailed hydrological impact analysis of the proposed dam sites to play a vital role in the analysis of any watersheds therefore the remote sensing contributed to providing a way of compiling data in less time overcoming some old problems difficult access the uncertainty of subjectivity that hamper mapping georeferenced features with greater precision in a more effective way furthermore suitability of dam site contributes to the upgrading of hydrological variables including surface and groundwater storage area for flood control power requirements irrigation water supply rainfall runoff evaporation it is important to compare the results of both the models ahp and fuzzy for dam site suitability in order to identify the similarities and differences if we compare both maps produced by ahp and fuzzy it is clear that maps produced by ahp show the suitable area as scattered regions whereas the fuzzy model showed clustered areas as suitable in the map produced by ahp one can observe that the suitable areas can be found almost in all parts of the study area this could be attributed due to the benefits obtained through pairwise comparison whereas in the map produced by fuzzy logic the suitable areas are only found in the middle part and some parts in the north of the study area this can be explained as the fuzzy logic approach is suitable for spatial and natural phenomena because of omitting the crisp boundaries in addition it is obvious to observe that the fuzzy model generated results more accurate and logical than the ahp model the reason for this could be because the fuzzy analysis modelled the uncertainties in the layers used in the ahp model the hard boundaries between the factors and within each class of each factor are directly modelled this is consistent with the literature wherein researchers have indicated that fuzzy logic could produce better results than the ahp the nature of the fuzzy system and it s dealing with uncertainty between the classes boundaries made this approach more logical than the ahp approach 5 conclusion finding a suitable location for dam construction is important remote sensing and gis are popular tools used for such purposes remote sensing provides data about the study area whereas gis merits spatial analysis and modeling for producing suitability sites a method to evaluate the conditioning factors contributing to the suitability level of a dam location is required in the literature decision making based on ahp and fuzzy logic are commonly used in this study the conditioning factors of dam suitability were generated from various types of remote sensing and field data then both ahp and fuzzy logic based decision making were applied the weights resulting from the decision making models were used in gis and suitability maps were produced the ahp model produced 13 446 900 m2 as highly suitable area whereas the fuzzy model identified 3 409 200 m2 as a highly suitable area for constructing dams from the total area of 69 347 700 m2 this finding is obvious in the ahp model and the results are more distributed and scattered in the whole study area this outcome indicates that this model is unbiased toward certain factors and almost to the geology factor has the highest weight among the factors conversely the fuzzy model showed the suitable area as clustered areas both models were then evaluated and compared using a new technique the overall accuracy rates of ahp for three buffers with distances of 250 500 and 1000 m around the reference point were 80 69 and 29 whereas those of fuzzy were 82 71 and 32 respectively the overall accuracies indicate that the fuzzy logic is more accurate than ahp model and this finding is consistent with the three buffers finally the final dams located in the study area were characterized using the digital elevation model gathered from the aster sensor the location of 1st dam 2nd dam 3rd dam and 4th dam were selected in highly suitable areas for constructing dams and the 4th dam was deemed the best site for water harvesting among the four dams dam 4 can store the largest amount of water the storage capacity of dam 4 is 646 5 million m3 at 60 m height whereas that of dam 3 is only 374 6 million m3 at 60 m height of the dam proposed by a group of experts in 1988 dam 3 has the shortest length among the four dams making it more economic than the others this study attempted to apply and compare two different approaches fuzzy logic and ahp for dam site suitability assessment the result of this research can provide some guidelines for other researchers in this field and it will be easy for them to select the most suitable approach for dam site selection dam site selection can be realized by using either ahp or fuzzy models with or without weights this method increases the efficiency and flexibility of the

6478,in the last few decades the northern region of iraq has been severely impacted by climate change which has created long term drought water shortage and casual flood events dam construction in suitable sites is a primary water management strategy to solve flood and drought dam site selection depends on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria such as geology soil type and altitude in this study appropriate areas of dam site selection for water management were identified using remote sensing geographic information system gis and multi criteria decision making techniques in addition the proposed method of site suitability was evaluated by comparing it with the traditional analytic hierarchy process ahp a new validation method to evaluate the accuracy of ahp and fuzzy logic according to the preselected location of a dam was previously suggested in the study area bekhme dam by the local government remote sensing data landsat imageries and aster dem and field reference maps were used to derive 12 conditioning factors needed to produce a suitability map for construction the criteria considered were geological formation soil type fault line tectonic line altitude slope rainfall data 2000 2011 water discharge land use cover road network and material used for dam construction two mathematical models namely ahp and fuzzy logic were applied in this study the best model was selected by using location and cluster based accuracy assessment depending on the proposed dam site i e bekhme dam results showed that fuzzy logic is more accurate than ahp in terms of the surface area of suitable lands identified the ahp model determined 13 446 900 m2 as a highly suitable area whereas the fuzzy model identified 3 409 200 m2 from the total area of 69 347 700 m2 finally this study identified four sites for intermediate and large dams in the study area the total water capacities of proposed dam 1 dam 2 dam 3 and dam 4 are about 81 5 239 3 374 6 and 646 5 million m3 respectively when the dam height is 60 m the proposed methods can be easily replicated to other areas for similar applications the finding reveals that ahp model is distributed and scattered in the whole study area whereas the fuzzy model is more suitable for clustered areas keywords dam site suitability remote sensing gis multi criteria decision analysis fuzzy ahp 1 introduction water demand is increasing because of climate change and rapid population growth schewe et al 2014 iraq is an agricultural country wherein the demand for water has been growing for more agricultural production to guarantee food security the main source of irrigation water is rivers proper location of dams in rivers could control floods skalak et al 2013 and provide hydropower energy for surrounding residential areas the need to constructing dam has been increasing to meet the required of drinking water supply irrigation water resource productivity drought control system and the influence of this construction can be social environmental and economic altinbilek 2002 dam site selection is one of the main problems in the water resources management upper zap river is one of the important rivers in the north of iraq this river provides water for irrigation and water supply however the major problem with this river is that there are no dams built on it the problem of having no dams on this river could effect on urban flooding water shortage and reducing the important water of irrigation gis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda are efficient tools for spatial analysis and decision making malczewski 2004 islam et al 2018 el shirbeny et al 2018 decision analysis involves a set of systematic procedures to assess complex decision problem malczewski 1999 which is usually evaluated by various individuals including managers decision makers stakeholders and interest group members who often display unique preferences for criteria used in the evaluation accordingly multi criteria decision making mcdm and gis are integrated to increase the analysis capabilities for site suitability abdulkareem et al 2018a b althuwaynee et al 2012 2014 gis is used to in detail analyze the spatial decision context whereas mcdm is applied to compare alternatives abdullahi et al 2014 a few critical aspects of mcdm are having a restricted set of substitutes and an overtly distinct set of alternatives thereby necessitating information on the decision maker s choices and having a focus on outcomes chakhar et al 2003 when solving an mcdm an individual must know the significance or weight of the unsubstantial attributes as well as the assessments of the alternatives with respect to the attributes the most recognized mcdm methods are simple additive weight ideal point method analytical hierarchy process ahp and fuzzy logic a lot of research has been done on dam site selection methods and affected factors safavian and amani 2015 forzieri et al 2008 yasser et al 2013 minatour et al 2015 abushandi and alatawi 2015 tsiko and haile 2011 thanoon and ahmed 2013 ahmad et al 2013 qureshi 2015 also there are many papers have been published on dam site selection and hydropower energy site selection fitzgerald et al 2012 larentis et al 2010 rajeev and mahesha 2018 jamali et al 2014 rojanamon et al 2009 a previous study found that the commonly used ahp method is human subjective and that the results could be easily biased chan and kumar 2007 to overcome this problem fuzzy logic was suggested in this research for suitable dam site selection in specific fuzzy logic has the ability to deal with vague control rules expressed by human language molina et al 2017 chung et al 2017 fuzzy logic is an efficient method when it comes to dealing with unclear features li et al 2017 this technique requires a degree of importance for gis layers that can be expressed by values between 0 and 1 i e 1 for the most important suitable land and 0 for the least important one van et al 1996 ahp introduces the concept of hierarchical thinking but some uncertain variables i e expert weightage may confuse decision making emamgholi et al 2015 the traditional ahp requires crisp judgments however a decision maker may feel more confident to provide fuzzy judgments than crisp comparisons because of the complexity and uncertainty involved in real world decision problems fuzzy decision making is a powerful paradigm of dealing with human expert knowledge this method has been used to solve or support spatial reasoning problems in different contexts such as locating convenience stores and selecting other sites ahamed et al 2000 burrough et al 1992 lewis et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 sicat et al 2005 stoms et al 2002 however ahp is limited by the difficulty in obtaining ideas and is predisposed to human subjectivity previous studies suggested alternative techniques for suitability application such as fuzzy logic keshavarzi et al 2010 fuzzy logic site selection is commonly used when uncertain elements are present and when a site cannot be specified charabi et al 2011 markowski et al 1977 liu et al 2016 the present study aims to identify appropriate areas for the construction of dams by using remote sensing gis and mcdm technique due to the requirement of the reservoir s capacity in the region dam sites suitability has been proposed along the greater zab river ahp and fuzzy logic were applied to select suitable sites for constructing dams on the selected river in the study area the proposed dams are also characterized 2 study area the greater zab is an approximately 437 km long river that flows through turkey and iraq fig 1 a the river rises in turkey near lake van and connects with the tigris in iraq south of mosul city awchi 2014 it supplies 28 7 of the water in the tigris al ansari et al 2014 approximately 300 km of the river s course is located within iraq rainfall and snowmelt are the primary sources of water in the river and its tributaries and the resulting dischargehighly fluctuates throughout the year al ansari et al 2014 fig 1b shows the annual rainfall map of the study area the great zab which originates in turkey

the headwaters of this river originate from the ararat mountains in turkey at an altitude of 4 636 m asl the headwater topography features steep slopes and several tributaries and wadis including khazir rubari shin rukuchuk and rubat mawaran rivers flow into the greater zab river 3 methodology the overall methodology of this research is shown in fig 2 to find suitable sites for dam construction various types of data were collected from different sources satellite imagery landsat 8 oli was downloaded from the usgs website which has 30 m spatial resolution images taken on august 2014 were pre processed processed and then post processed to produce the land use and land cover map of the study area in this study envi software was used to produce land use and land cover map while arcgis software was used to produce other maps digital elevation model dem 30 m 30 m was extracted from aster gdm in raster formats and the data were mosaicked the dem data was acquired on 17 october 2011 dem was used to extract the drainage network elevation and slope of the study area the topography of the study area is complex in terms of relief variation geological soil and tectonic maps of northern iraq were obtained from the ministry of industry and minerals iraq geology survey the geological map was updated in 2014 and its scale is 1 250 000 the scales of the soil and tectonic maps are both 1 1 000 000 the main roads of the region were extracted from the base map of duhok governorate prepared by joint humanitarian information center and the scale of this map is 1 100 000 climate data were obtained from the meteorological department of kurdistan region government in iraq the annual rainfall data from 2000 to 2011 were also procured the study area covers 25 climatological stations annual discharge data were provided by the department of dams and reservoirs of kurdistan region government in iraq criteria with direct influence on the land suitability of dam site selection were selected these criteria include geological formation soil tectonic fault elevation slope rainfall river discharge materials for earth dam construction and urban and rural areas and roads two mcdm models namely ahp and fuzzy logic were used to determine the land suitability for dam site selection the model with the highest accuracy was compared on the basis of the proposed dam bekhme dam in the study area subsequently four suitable sites were identified and proposed for dam construction in addition the length and water storage of each dam were calculated finally the dam site was ranked according to the length and water storage of each dam 3 1 data used based on the literature review this study selected 12 criteria fig 3 for the determination of suitable areas for dam construction rainfall slope river discharge soil texture geology distance from urban and rural areas distance from fault and tectonic lines distance from the main road and distance from the available material for dam construction hydrological parameters such as stream network flow accumulation altitude and slope were derived from the dem using arcgis 10 3 software the altitude map was derived from the dem of the study area the elevation ranged from 180 m to 3600 m above sea level the slope map was extracted from the dem lewis et al 2014 and is classified into five percentage classes according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nation fao lewis et al 2014 the classes were generated according to the defined interval in five zones namely 2 2 8 8 15 15 30 and 30 slope steepness is an important consideration when assigning and implementing dam sites lewis et al 2014 the study area is characterized by gentle slopes on the southwest part while steep slopes and deep valleys on the north and northeast parts the study area displays five types of land cover bare soil urban rural water and vegetation fig 4 land cover which is an important criterion in dam site selection was derived from the landsat image in this study maximum likelihood ml classifier was used to classify the landsat data with a classification accuracy of 91 field surveyed data were used as training and testing to evaluate the classification accuracy of the land cover map which is extracted from the landsat images noori et al 2018 in this study 70 ground control points gcps were used as training data and 30 gcps as testing data ml classifier has shown high accuracies especially in mapping land use land cover ajaj et al 2017 previous research showed that the distance from urban areas influences dam site selection to prevent possible hazards dams must be located as far as possible from residential areas distances less than 2500 m are considered inappropriate and regions with longer distances achieve higher rates ghazal et al 2015 the distance from rural areas must be considered to avoid hard reaching regions in the construction phase proximity to a rural area is an easiness index in measuring the manpower necessary for barrage construction in general sites far from village incur additional costs during the dam construction phase forzieri et al 2008 on the basis of the literature the layer was categorized into five classes rainfall stations are dispersed all over the study area thereby providing a means for the suitable estimation of rainfall distribution rainfall point measurements represent yearly values within 2000 2011 the kriging interpolation method is employed to estimate rainfall in areas without rainfall point measurements chen et al 2008 eq 1 was used to perform kriging interpolation 1 z s o i 1 n λ i z s i where z s i is the measured value λi is an unknown weight for the measured value z s o is the prediction value and n is the number of measured values the maximum and minimum amounts of rainfall can be found in the northern and southern part of the study area respectively the study area has following characteristics sand gypsum soils gravel stony and rough and rock protuberances buringh 1960 hameed 2013 fig 5 a shows soil types of the study area the study area is situated within the imbricate high folded and low folded zone and zagros suture zone all of which classified under the unstable shelf of the arabian plate sissakian 2013 sharbazheri et al 2009 fig 5 b represent the geological formation of the region the material for earth dam construction was extracted from the geological map it is available at reasonable distances from the greater zab river composed of loose gravel and clay materials usable for the construction of an earth fill dam body and of the impervious core and suitable for the large scale production of concrete aggregates the construction materials should be available near the dam site to save transportation cost this information can be obtained from the geological map shells needed for the construction of an earth fill dam can be easily obtained from the abundant alluvial deposits present on the river bed and in the flood plain of the greater zab river and its tributary the clay material was extracted from both layers of claystone comprising the injana formation and the old alluvial deposits found in the study area the abundance of loose gravel and sandy alluvial materials in the study area ensures the availability of inert materials necessary for the manufacture of high quality concrete the great quantity of sand within the flood plain deposits and the nearby beds of the wadis also help avoid any crushing processes for the production of fine and intermediate inert fractions special structures of basin geology can be found in most parts of the greater zab basin a site with fault lines along stream must be eliminated from listed potential dam sites forzieri et al 2008 the dams must be located at least 100 m from the fault this distance is used as a basis in rating areas with longer distance from the faults ghazal et al 2015 the main zagros thrust fault of the zagros suture zone also runs within the extreme northern and northeastern part of the study area causing the complicated structure framework of the involved area jabbar and sissakian 2010 thus areas near tectonic lines have lower inner layer weights compared with those far from tectonic lines lemos 1988 sites with faults and tectonic lines along streams must be eliminated from potential dam sites forzieri et al 2008 ameen 1992 the distance from road communications network is an important consideration when selecting dam sites dam sites should be near roads to reduce transportation cost ghazal et al 2015 water discharge is an important factor in dam site selection sites with a large amount of water discharge have high potential to be selected because they increase the hydropower of dams the kriging interpolation technique is used to map mean annual river discharges sauquet 2006 in the present study six discharge stations were used to interpolate the annual river discharge along the greater zab river sub criteria should be considered to realize a precise evaluation from this concept each main criterion in this study has sub criteria table 1 all aforementioned main criteria and subcriteria were used to evaluate the suitable sites for dam construction 3 2 ahp ahp is a commonly used mcdm tool ahp has been employed in a wide variety of applications in different fields including site suitability drobne et al 2009 chakhar et al 2003 different factors have different levels of importance in potential dam site selection chezgi et al 2016 therefore the importance of each parameter was identified for instance geology is the main consideration in dam site selection but the level of importance of different geological factors varies geological formations are a more important consideration in dam site selection than the distance from a fault line we have used a weighted linear combination in the present study drobne et al 2009 step 1 determination of weights the relative importance of different criteria is a piece of important information for decision makers mcdm is influenced by factors of different importance levels thus the importance of each factor is weighed and ranked in defining the decision maker s preferences drobne et al 2009 an mce module is used in weighing criteria in this study pairwise comparison or ahp developed by saaty 1980 was used pairwise comparison compares each factor against all other factors to calculate the weights of factors in saaty s method the main eigenvector of the square reciprocal matrix of pairwise comparison is employed between two criteria drobne et al 2009 this method compares the importance of two criteria for a given object table 2 shows the explanation of the rating between two factors by nine points continuous scale drobne et al 2009 saaty 1980 step 2 pairwise comparison consistency pairwise comparison accuracy is measured by calculating the consistency ratio cr eq 2 which is used to evaluate the relative weight of each factor the cr is a ratio between the consistency index ci and the random index ri the comparison between criteria is acceptable when cr less than 10 otherwise the cr lets for the re evaluation of comparison 2 c r c i r i depending on the matrix order the ri can be found from the specific table prepared by 53 table 3 shows ri value according to the number of factors the ci calculated using eq 3 3 c i λ max n n 1 where λmax weight1 s1 weight2 s2 weight3 s3 n number of criteria after calculating the ci the cr equation is applied if the result is less than 10 then the weight was assigned step 3 geometric mean the geometric mean is a special type of average where the numbers are multiplied as percentages derived from values together and then root is applied for the numbers as described in eq 4 dong et al 2010 4 g e o m e t r i c m e a n g m x 1 x 2 x 3 x n n where n represents the number of returns in the series and x i s a variable in this research the geometric mean formula was used after collecting the questionnaire related to the ahp matrices from six expert s feedback questionnaires the geometric mean was calculated for each factor from the matrices with crs less than 10 table 4 shows the geometric mean for the final weight for each main criterion table 5 shows the final weightage of criteria furthermore the geometric mean formula was applied for sub criteria 3 3 application of the fuzzy logic model zadeh 1965 proposed fuzzy logic based on fuzzy set theory the fuzzy approach is applied in land suitability mapping where pixels on any causal factor layer are considered a suitable area pixel values could range from 0 i e not suitable to 1 i e suitable pixel values must lie in the range of 0 to 1 but the choice of values has no practical constraint the values reflect the degree of membership of a set according to subjective judgment bonham 1994 or can be derived by various functions representing the reality in this study the linear functions are used eastman 2003 in the present case fuzzy membership values were assigned as recommended by saaty 1980 table 2 fuzzy logic is preferred for land suitability evaluation because fuzzy approaches estimate land use suitability on a continuous scale elaalem 2012 tables 6 and 7 show the relative importance of the factors according to the class interval and class type respectively land suitability based on fuzzy logic helps overcome vagueness and uncertainty the application of fuzzy logic in site suitability evaluation has four steps elaalem 2012 step 1 normalization or standardization of land characteristics using fuzzy set models fuzzy logic membership helps in determining the suitability or unsuitability of a site this step assigns values from 0 i e not likely or unsuitable to 1 i e most likely or suitable elaalem 2012 thus higher fuzzy membership value means better site suitability understanding the four types of membership and choosing the one that best fits the analysis criteria are important when assigning fuzzy membership values the membership function in a fuzzy system has several types such as linear small large and gaussian in this study the linear membership function is used to normalize the parameters because it depends on input parameters if the input parameters are chaotic e g time series the gaussian type of membership function is suggested otherwise the linear type is recommended qiu et al 2014 large or small values are assigned with high fuzzy membership fuzzy membership decreases at a constant rate a triangular membership function is specified by the following three parameters a b c 5 t r i a n g u l a t i o n x a b c 0 x a x a b a a x b c x c b b x c 0 c x step 2 generation of the criterion map layers in fuzzy logic an alternative scaling approach where linguistic variables represent both quantitative and qualitative criteria is offered the study by marks et al 1995 provides an example of a qualitative variable that is expressed as a linguistic variable in a quantitative criterion e g return on resources the terms very low low medium high and very high should be defined for representation by a linguistic variable these terms are represented by fuzzy sets that are defined on the present quantitative scale in this study the linear membership function was used to normalize the parameters because it depends on input parameters if the input parameter is not chaotic the linear membership function is suggested elaalem 2012 this step assigns values from 0 i e not likely or unsuitable to 1 i e most likely or suitable the range between 0 to 1 membership function corresponds to the intensity of importance of each criterion which is determined on the basis of the literature and expert opinion step 3 generation of the overall land suitability map layers several reclassified surfaces with values ranging from 0 to 1 are generated by assigning the appropriate fuzzy membership value for data criteria clinton et al 2010 in the next step the fuzzy logic model is applied this step is similar to weighted site selection a site selection type that allows users to rank raster cells and assign a relative importance value to each layer because it compares the different reclassified surfaces this step is completed by selecting a type of fuzzy overlay the boolean operations were used to integrate all factors by logical operators such as and and or operations and is intersection operator and it is a very restrictive or risk averse operator the mission of and distinguish because of an area will be excluded from the suitability maps if any single criteria fails to meet its threshold on the other hand or is a union operator in which there is a risk involved and an entire area could be chosen as long as a single criterion meets its threshold romano et al 2015 in this study and fuzzy overlay type is used because of its suitability for finding locations that meet all criteria qiu et al 2014 cheng and thompson 2016 3 4 accuracy assessment to evaluate the results obtained from the ahp and fuzzy models a segmentation accuracy assessment was used and modified for dam site selection clinton et al 2010 the method is based on the number of suitable pixels i e segment identified by the model and the summation of distances from suitable pixels to the reference point first the reference point was identified and located on the map of the suitable site for dam construction as determined by experts i e the proposed dam is bekhme dam then three buffers with distances of 250 500 and 1000 m were created around the reference point spatial tools in gis were used to estimate the statistics of the suitable pixels inside these buffers i e the total number of pixels the number of suitable pixels and distance from the pixels to the reference point these statistics then were used to calculate the two accuracy measurement which is described by eq 6 6 a c c u r a c y o f s u i t a b l e p i x e l s n n n number of high suitable pixels 7 a c c u r a c y o f d i s t a n c e f r o m r e f e r e n c e m a x d i s t a n c e f r o m r e f e r e n c e m a x m i n 8 o v e r a l l a c c u r c a y a c c u r a c y o f s u i t a b l e p i x e l s a c c u r a c y o f d i s t a n c e f r o m r e f e r e n c e 2 first the accuracy of suitable pixels was calculated using the number of suitable pixels found in each buffer to the total number of pixels contained in the buffer area then the accuracy of distances from suitable pixels to the reference points i e bekhme dam was estimated using eq 7 which required the maximum and minimum distances from suitable pixels to the reference point in both models based on these two accuracy measures the overall accuracy was calculated using eq 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 identification of suitable sites for dams by the ahp model after setting the conditioning factors in gis questionnaires were prepared for experts based on the factors determined and their classes were identified from the literature review the experts provided feedback about the factors and their contribution in selecting suitable sites for dam construction in the study area then the weights of each factor were calculated using the geometric mean method in gis to determine the final weight of each factor the factors were then reclassified based on their weights and prepared using the raster calculator to generate a suitability map that describes the locations for constructing dams the suitability map produced using the ahp model is shown in fig 6 a this map shows the suitable areas in green color and non suitable areas in gray color the suitable areas were almost distributed in the entire study area however the most suitable areas were found in the middle of the study area the overall area of highly suitable lands for constructing dams was 13 446 900 m2 therefore a field visit is required to identify the final location of the dams the suitability map produced in gis by the ahp model shows that suitable sites are not clustered in a single area but distributed into different locations in the study area the finding indicates that some of the conditioning factors largely influence the selection of suitable sites and are distributed in the study area and not clustered the final weights of factors show that the geology formation was the most influenced factor for dam site suitability while the distance from road factor has the lowest influence on dam site suitability table 5 this is because ahp uses the weights of these factors ultimately leading to higher weightage only some of the sites identified as suitable by the ahp model were near urban areas these sites needed further investigations and analysis to determine their possibility of constructing dams 4 2 application of fuzzy model the suitability map produced by the fuzzy method is presented in fig 6 b this map shows the locations of suitable and non suitable areas for dam construction in the study areas the map shows that most of the suitable areas are in the middle and north parts of the study area the southern part of the study area contains no suitable sites for dam construction and thus should be ignored in the field visit the overall surface area of the highly suitable lands is estimated to be 3 409 200 m2 these results indicate that the middle part of the study area is suitable for the first suitable location of dams however field visit is required to confirm the final location for dam construction field visit enables the selection of the best locations in consideration of other factors e g population that are not used in the model and may change the suitability map produced by the fuzzy model shows the spatial distribution of the suitable areas and their patterns in the study area most of the suitable areas are clustered into groups and are not randomly scattered into different directions this finding indicates that suitable areas determined to have the same characteristics and are homogenous this information makes the final selection of decision makers easier and more accurate in other words a decision maker can easily identify the suitable areas for dam construction decision makers also need to view the suitable locations in the field to determine the final sites for dam construction this procedure is important because changes may occur in the sites and because other factors such as the need for the hydropower or the amount of irrigation water are not considered in the model 4 3 models comparison in this study two models such as ahp and fuzzy logic were used ahp was used because of its proven benefits in decision making that can be obtained through pairwise comparison on the other hand fuzzy approach was used because of its ability to omit the crisp boundaries in the modeling process in terms of the surface area of the suitable lands identified the ahp model produced 13 446 900 m2 as highly suitable area whereas the fuzzy model identified 3 409 200 m2 area as highly suitable for constructing dams this result indicates that the results generated by the fuzzy model are more reasonable and accurate than the results generated by the ahp model this result can be ascribed to the fact that fuzzy analysis models the uncertainties in the layers used in the ahp model the hard boundaries between the factors and within each class of each factor are directly modeled this result is also consistent with previous results that fuzzy could produce better results than ahp the nature of the fuzzy system and it s dealing with uncertainties between class boundaries render this approach more logical than the ahp approach in addition the fuzzy approach does not require specific weights for each class and thus produces results that are not biased toward one factor this characteristic is obvious in the ahp model in that the results are more distributed and scattered in the whole study area which indicates the absence of bias toward certain factors and almost to the geology factor has the highest weight among the factors the accuracy of the results produced from both models is presented in the next section 4 4 accuracy assessment table 8 shows the overall accuracy of site suitability determined by the ahp and fuzzy models the overall accuracies indicate that the fuzzy model is more accurate than the ahp model and that it is consistent in the three buffers fig 7 a this finding ensures that the fuzzy model produces a suitability map that is more accurate than ahp based on the location of the reference point the accuracy assessment mechanism evaluates the performance of ahp by using three buffering zones with varying distances to calculate the distance from suitable pixels to the reference point i e bekhm dam as illustrated in fig 7 b on the other hand the results of ahp method demonstrated that the number of pixels are scattered and spread in different regions fig 7 b on the contrary the pixels in fuzzy model are mostly clustered 4 5 characteristics of proposed dams on the basis of the suitability maps of dam location obtained from the fuzzy model the layers of drainage network contour line and triangulated irregular network tin were generated from aster digital elevation model in this research the proposed dams are medium and large sized dam location was selected in accordance with the site suitability of dam layer that obtained from fuzzy model in addition the height and volume were calculated from the tin using 3d spatial tools of arcgis software dam s length was computed from the section dam profile which is extracted from the digital elevation model using arcgis 3d spatial tools the location and number of proposed dams in the study area are presented in fig 8 the dams should be located on the water drainage the southern part of the study area has gentle slopes which are plan with depthless water drainage by contrast the northern part is almost mountains and hilly with the deep water drainage dam 1 is situated upstream of the drainage dam 1 2 3 and 4 are located successively according to the order of the drainage a site with narrow drainage is preferred to minimize the structures cost sites of the dam should be located in a way that the water can be controlled over a monsoon dams may be situated near habitation the water in dams reservoirs could either be used for irrigate surrounding areas or transmit to the southern part of the study area through the water drainage network to provide additional irrigation during drought proposed sites for dam construction were obtained from the suitability map with medium and large size the height length storage capacity and basin area of the selected dams were considered appropriate locations for the dams were searched using drainage networks and contour lines per 5 m interval the storage capacity of the dam was estimated using the triangular irregular network layer via arcgis 10 3 tools the factors that effects dam size are storage capacity and height of dam robinson 2006 table 9 shows that dams can be classified as small medium or large the present study identified only intermediate and large potential dams table 9 illustrates the different types of dam according to size and height the storage capacity of dam 1 2 3 4 are shown in fig 9 table 10 illustrates the geometric characteristics of the proposed dam sites dam 1 is located at 36 54 15 n 44 00 42 e with an elevation of 490 meters above sea level dam 2 is located at 36 45 11 n 44 16 53 e with an elevation of 400 meters dam 3 is located at 36 42 08 n 44 16 11 e with an elevation of 500 meters dam 4 is situated at 36 27 59 n 43 51 30 e with an elevation of 290 meters and the storage capacity around 646 5 million m3 at the height of 60 m the location of dams 1 2 3 and 4 were selected in highly suitable areas for constructing dams among the four dams dam 4 can store the largest amount of water the storage capacity of dam 4 is 646 5 million m3 at 60 m height whereas that of dam 3 is only 374 6 million m3 at 60 m height of the dam proposed by a group of experts in 1988 table 10 dam 3 has the shortest length among the four dams which making it more economic than the others fig 9 shows the storage volumetric capacity of dam 1 2 3 and 4 table 10 shows the capacity of the reservoirs and their elevations of dam heights for dam 1 2 3 and 4 the suitable area for dam construction in the greater zab basin was estimated from the available data however other criteria such as population and socioeconomic status should be considered but these criteria were unavailable for use in this study finally the ranking of dam sites were done according to length storage capacity and cost i e dam 3 is the first and the second third and fourth were dam 4 dam 1 and dam 2 respectively 4 6 discussion in recent decades the application of remote sensing and gis techniques are very popular in hydrology remote sensing based techniques provide valuable datasets to examine hydrological variables and morphological changes over large regions at different spatial and temporal scales e g aster dem satellite image therefore by using the capability of remote sensing and gis technology to prepare a detailed hydrological impact analysis of the proposed dam sites to play a vital role in the analysis of any watersheds therefore the remote sensing contributed to providing a way of compiling data in less time overcoming some old problems difficult access the uncertainty of subjectivity that hamper mapping georeferenced features with greater precision in a more effective way furthermore suitability of dam site contributes to the upgrading of hydrological variables including surface and groundwater storage area for flood control power requirements irrigation water supply rainfall runoff evaporation it is important to compare the results of both the models ahp and fuzzy for dam site suitability in order to identify the similarities and differences if we compare both maps produced by ahp and fuzzy it is clear that maps produced by ahp show the suitable area as scattered regions whereas the fuzzy model showed clustered areas as suitable in the map produced by ahp one can observe that the suitable areas can be found almost in all parts of the study area this could be attributed due to the benefits obtained through pairwise comparison whereas in the map produced by fuzzy logic the suitable areas are only found in the middle part and some parts in the north of the study area this can be explained as the fuzzy logic approach is suitable for spatial and natural phenomena because of omitting the crisp boundaries in addition it is obvious to observe that the fuzzy model generated results more accurate and logical than the ahp model the reason for this could be because the fuzzy analysis modelled the uncertainties in the layers used in the ahp model the hard boundaries between the factors and within each class of each factor are directly modelled this is consistent with the literature wherein researchers have indicated that fuzzy logic could produce better results than the ahp the nature of the fuzzy system and it s dealing with uncertainty between the classes boundaries made this approach more logical than the ahp approach 5 conclusion finding a suitable location for dam construction is important remote sensing and gis are popular tools used for such purposes remote sensing provides data about the study area whereas gis merits spatial analysis and modeling for producing suitability sites a method to evaluate the conditioning factors contributing to the suitability level of a dam location is required in the literature decision making based on ahp and fuzzy logic are commonly used in this study the conditioning factors of dam suitability were generated from various types of remote sensing and field data then both ahp and fuzzy logic based decision making were applied the weights resulting from the decision making models were used in gis and suitability maps were produced the ahp model produced 13 446 900 m2 as highly suitable area whereas the fuzzy model identified 3 409 200 m2 as a highly suitable area for constructing dams from the total area of 69 347 700 m2 this finding is obvious in the ahp model and the results are more distributed and scattered in the whole study area this outcome indicates that this model is unbiased toward certain factors and almost to the geology factor has the highest weight among the factors conversely the fuzzy model showed the suitable area as clustered areas both models were then evaluated and compared using a new technique the overall accuracy rates of ahp for three buffers with distances of 250 500 and 1000 m around the reference point were 80 69 and 29 whereas those of fuzzy were 82 71 and 32 respectively the overall accuracies indicate that the fuzzy logic is more accurate than ahp model and this finding is consistent with the three buffers finally the final dams located in the study area were characterized using the digital elevation model gathered from the aster sensor the location of 1st dam 2nd dam 3rd dam and 4th dam were selected in highly suitable areas for constructing dams and the 4th dam was deemed the best site for water harvesting among the four dams dam 4 can store the largest amount of water the storage capacity of dam 4 is 646 5 million m3 at 60 m height whereas that of dam 3 is only 374 6 million m3 at 60 m height of the dam proposed by a group of experts in 1988 dam 3 has the shortest length among the four dams making it more economic than the others this study attempted to apply and compare two different approaches fuzzy logic and ahp for dam site suitability assessment the result of this research can provide some guidelines for other researchers in this field and it will be easy for them to select the most suitable approach for dam site selection dam site selection can be realized by using either ahp or fuzzy models with or without weights this method increases the efficiency and flexibility of the

6479,grassland restored by re vegetated shrub is an important ecosystem in desert steppe of northwest china yet little is understood about the underlying eco hydrological mechanisms for maintaining the stability of the re vegetated ecosystem based on the conversion relationships among throughfall interception loss and stemflow we developed a method to analyze the dynamic responses of rainfall partitioning by vegetation canopies to precipitation variation and the driving mechanisms for stemflow of two morphological distinct shrubs unhealthy and healthy c intermedia during the 21 rainfall events 0 15 mm in the period from 2016 to 2017 we found that the stemflow increased in a low value stepwise manner with the increasing rainfall depth and eventually became scattered therefore the response of stemflow to gross precipitation was divided into three stages by rainfall depth initiation 0 2 mm transition 2 6 mm and scattered 6 15 mm a significantly negative linear relationship was observed between throughfall and interception loss while the relationships of interception loss stemflow and throughfall stemflow exhibited a more complex nonlinear way with relatively weaker correlations rainfall depth and canopy area were two main factors driving the partitioning relationships non precipitation meteorological factors were dominant in the 0 2 mm rainfall events while rainfall factors were determinant in the 6 15 mm events morphological factors exerted more influences on the partitioning relationships for healthy c intermedia overall the conversion between throughfall and interception loss was the majority of dynamic rainfall partitioning therefore low and unstable stemflow was usually inevitable the results indicate that the precipitation threshold for stemflow generation should be a range value instead of a specific value and the rebuilt analysis roadmaps are essential for investigating stemflow using the thorough conversion relationships and the stepped approach keywords caragana intermedia throughfall stemflow interception loss dynamic rainfall partitioning relationship desert steppe 1 introduction interception loss throughfall and stemflow are the three components of precipitation partitioning by vegetation canopies throughfall accounts for most of the gross precipitation while stemflow only serves as the dropped input of water at the base of stems previous studies have indicated that the dynamic rainfall partitioning relationships i e conversion relationships among throughfall stemflow and interception loss can be attributed to distinct underlying physical mechanisms and statistical law for instance the precipitation intercepted by canopy will be lost through evaporation in most cases where the rainfall is borderline the threshold for stemflow production i e the canopy water storage capacity levia and germer 2015 carlyle moses 2004 whereas a certain amount of precipitation can be partitioned into throughfall instead of stemflow when the rainfall is much beyond the canopy water storage capacity especially under high rainfall intensities carlyle moses and price 2006 in general as rainfall increases the percentage of interception loss decreases while throughfall and stemflow rapidly increase before stalling at higher values zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 overall the conversion reflects the dynamic partitioning relationships among interception loss throughfall and stemflow canopy rainfall partitioning determines the water input in dryland ecosystems thus it plays a significantly hydrological role in the generation of stemflow and plant survival levia et al 2010 fan et al 2015 levia and frost 2003 swaffer et al 2014 stemflow is highly species and region specific and can be influenced by several factors involved with rainfall characteristics and plant traits crockford and richardson 2000 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 specifically these factors include the amount of precipitation li et al 2008 rainfall intensity germer et al 2010 canopy structure as well as biological traits at the branch stem and leaf levels wang et al 2013 given this levia and germer 2015 suggested the development of a common metric to increase cross site comparability of stemflow studies despite the facts that numerous studies have addressed species or region specific issues the investigation hits a brick wall due to research limitations 1 previous studies on the relationships among throughfall stemflow and interception loss demonstrated that the hydrological mechanisms underpinning these processes were closely related however most studies mainly focused on the stemflow mechanisms which are insufficient in revealing the overall relationships among stemflow interception loss and throughfall levia and germer 2015 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 2014 yuan et al 2016 2 secondly significant differences in rainfall depth ranges for the partitioning laws and factors influencing canopy rainfall partitioning exist the rainfall partitioning rule based on whole rainfall events sometimes conceals in statistics the specificity of the rule in small or larger rainfall ranges rainfall partitioning mechanisms during small rainfall events are more interesting for researchers in arid regions however complex mechanisms with regard to small rainfall events have not been comprehensively researched zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 for instance the precipitation threshold for stemflow production of many arid shrubs is less than 3 0 mm llorens and domingo 2007 in light rainfall events in general lower than 5 mm air temperature humidity wind speed and other non precipitation factors are likely to significantly influence the canopy water storage capacity zhang et al 2014 levia and germer 2015 and subsequently affect stemflow initiation through the conversion relationship with interception loss however compared with precipitation factors the effects of non precipitation meteorological factors on stemflow interception loss and throughfall of xerophytic shrubs need further investigations levia and germer 2015 zhang et al 2018 van stan et al 2016 therefore it is urgent to carry out comprehensive studies on stemflow incorporating with the whole conversion relationship finer zoning of precipitation precipitation and non precipitation meteorological factors and morphological factors in this study a revegetated shrubland of caragana intermedia in the desert steppe of northwest china was studied this region has suffered severe droughts and degradation of native grassland vegetation due to increased shrub growth yang et al 2015 song et al 2014 this systematic study of canopy hydrological processes of c intermedia and their driving mechanisms especially the evolution of stemflow is of theoretical and practical importance in the better understanding of the eco hydrological system as well as the adaptive management in the degraded shrubland in this study the partitioning relationships among throughfall stemflow and interception loss were studied by analyzing 21 rainfall events 0 15 mm occurred in the period from 2016 to 2017 to evaluate their responses to dynamic changes in precipitation and explore the driven mechanisms underpinned by the meteorological and morphological factors the main objectives of the present study were 1 to understand the overall dynamic partitioning patterns with regard to stemflow interception loss and throughfall and the variation in response to different rainfall amounts 2 to determine the driving mechanisms of rainfall partitioning and 3 to understand the eco hydrological mechanisms of stemflow generation within the framework of the overall dynamic partitioning relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area is located in the semi arid desert steppe of yanchi county in the ningxia hui autonomous region of china 37 47 37 57 n 107 22 107 33 e el1392m 1426 m the mean annual temperature of the study region is 8 1 c while the annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 350 mm approximately 62 of the total rainfall occurs between july and september the sunshine duration is 3124 h year 1 with an evaporation rate of 2897 mm year 1 the frost free period is known to last about 165 days the soil types are mainly composed of sandy limestone and aeolian sandy soil which are characterized by poor capacities for water and nutrient retention and vulnerability to wind erosion the region is a typical transition zone between the maowusu sandy land and the loess plateau it is more heterogeneous in climate soil and plants within this region than that of the adjacent areas however this zone has suffered severe environmental degradation due to anthropogenic activities among which overgrazing in the grassland took the primary responsibility yang et al 2015 song et al 2014 c intermedia has been planted since the 1970s to restore sandy grassland currently the total area of the c intermedia shrubland is more than 2000 km2 and shrubs planted before the 1990s have matured or aged owing to serious soil droughts and shrub decay yang et al 2015 song et al 2014 the shrubland exists as two landscapes banded plantation artificial shrubland and scattered natural shrubland fig 1 unhealthy c intermedia is distributed in the banded plantation artificial shrubland while healthy c intermedia is distributed in the scattered natural shrubland in general healthy c intermedia individuals are tall with abundant foliage and good growth unhealthy c intermedia individuals are short with sparse foliage and low annual growth rate 2 2 shrub selection and measurements a 100 m 100 m sampling plot was selected at the banded plantation artificial shrubland and the scattered natural shrubland respectively and then six unhealthy and six healthy c intermedia shrubs were selected randomly from the above plots respectively figs 1 and 2 table 2e in supplementary material presents the quantified morphological characteristics of the selected shrubs eight morphological factors at the shrub scale were considered the total number of branches stnb and average branch length sabl were estimated for all twigs except those sprouting from the base the average base diameter of branches sadb was calculated as the average of the diameters of all stem bases measured with vernier calipers average branch angle saba was the averaged angle for all branches determined by a protractor canopy height sch was measured at the center of the canopy canopy projection area scpa was calculated by measuring the east west and north south diameters through the center of the fullest part of the canopy the calculation of canopy base area scba was similar to the scpa however only the base of the canopy was considered canopy volume scv was estimated as the product of the area and height 2 3 stemflow and throughfall measurements stemflow collection methods were adopted from zhang et al 2015 as shown in fig 1e the stemflow volume was measured for each individual stem after each rainfall event and subsequently consolidated for a single shrub by using the projection area ratio eq 1 throughfall collectors were installed beneath the shrub canopy and were equidistant in four directions 0 90 180 and 270 eight to twelve collectors were placed depending on the size of the shrub the average numbers of collectors in one square meter area was 3 0 for both healthy and unhealthy c intermedia shrubs in this study 21 rainfall events lower than 15 mm from 2016 to 2017 were selected the volumes l of the collected stemflow and throughfall were measured manually by using a counting cup 0 1 ml in the measurement resolution at the end of each rainfall event the stemflow percentage was calculated as 1 ysf i n v ysfi c a i scpa i n c a i x r d 100 where ysf is the stemflow percentage of the individual shrub vysfi is the stemflow volume l of the ith individual branch n is the number of branches measured in the shrub cai is the ith branch canopy area m2 scpa is the shrub canopy area m2 and xrd is rainfall depth mm given the irregularity of crown shape for the branch we adopted a method of isolated branch projection imaging and vectorization calculation at the end of the 2 year measurement period the marked branches were cut and the projection images of branch crowns were collected by a digital camera in the field after the images were vectorized with photoshop the ca of the branch was directly extracted the throughfall percentage was calculated as 2 ytf i 1 n v yt f i n f a x r d 100 where ytf is the throughfall percentage of the individual shrub vytfi is the throughfall volume l for each collector n is the number of throughfall collectors under each shrub canopy fa is the opening area m2 of the funnel used in the experiments and xrd is rainfall depth mm the canopy interception loss percentage yri for each rainfall event was calculated as 3 yri 100 y t f y s f where ytf is the throughfall percentage and ysf is the stemflow percentage 2 4 meteorological variables the automatic weather station with a delta t logger delta t devices ltd u k was installed in an open area adjacent to the study plots meteorological variables were automatically measured and recorded at 30 min intervals by the weather station tables 1e and 3e the meteorological data presented here are daily averages individual rainfall event was identified by the criterion that a continuous rain free period should be longer than 4 hrs the meteorological variables measured in this study included rainfall depth xrd mm rainfall intensity xri mm h 1 rainfall duration xrt h atmospheric temperature xat c relative atmospheric humidity xah dew point temperature xdp c wind speed xws m s 1 solar radiation intensity xsr w m 2 and reference crop evapotranspiration xet mm h 1 an auto output value from the weather station based on the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the values presented in this study were daily averages in this study non precipitation meteorological factors were averaged for the entire day of the rainfall event in contrast to averaging just during the rainfall event levia and germer 2015 because the light rainfall events in the region were intermittent and short lasting with trace amounts of water produced therefore weather conditions before and after the events could influence canopy hydrological processes such as interception loss by evaporation carlyle moses 2004 in addition the potential significance of meteorological factors might weaken statistically owing to the similarity in weather conditions during different rainfall events such as high humidity and low temperature in general 2 5 statistical analyses the t test and non parametric tests mann whitney tests were used to determine statistically significant differences α 0 05 in the percentages of stemflow throughfall and interception loss of unhealthy and healthy c intermedia linear or nonlinear regressions were used to determine the partitioning relationships among stemflow throughfall and interception loss as well as their respective responses to rainfall depth multiple linear regressions based on meteorological and morphological factors were used to determine the mechanisms of rainfall partitioning statistical analyses were performed using spss 20 0 statistical software spss inc chicago usa to disentangle the relative importance of each group of factors precipitation non precipitation meteorological and morphological factors independently or in combination variation partition was employed based on stemflow interception loss and throughfall stemflow interception loss and throughfall as the response variables were applied to partition of variation and seven fractions were got a variation explained by precipitation factors independent of non precipitation meteorological and morphological factors b variation explained by non precipitation meteorological factors independent of precipitation and morphological explanation factors c variation explained by morphological factors independent of precipitation and non precipitation meteorological factors d e f and g indicates a common explanation between different variables respectively these analyses were conducted using the vegan library in r software canoco 4 5 microcomputer power ithaca usa was used for determination of multivariate relationships between response variables e g throughfall stemflow and interception loss and explaining variable e g morphological factors precipitation factors and non precipitation meteorological factors firstly detrended correspondence analysis dca showed that response data were linear and had a gradient length so a linear method was recommended secondly redundancy analysis rda was performed to correlate each response variable with explanatory variables in addition forward selection was performed to test which parameter had a significant influence on stemflow throughfall and interception loss statistical significance was kept at p 0 05 for all analyses zhang et al 2011 for the biplot resulted from the rda analysis the axes in rda biplot indicate a linear combination of different explanatory variables that can best explain the variation of dependent variables the vectors denote different explanatory variables and response variables the angles between vectors represent their correlations the position of point relative to axes means individual sample scores on the first two ordination axes and the distances between points mean similarity of different samples the projection of a point onto a vector indicates the weight value of individual sample on some explanatory or response variable borcard et al 2011 3 results 3 1 rainfall partitioning fig 3 shows the depths of individual rainfall events stemflow throughfall interception loss and rainfall intensity during the 21 small rainfall events the stemflow depth for unhealthy c intermedia ranged from 0 0 to 2 3 mm with an average value of 0 7 mm accounting for 0 0 18 9 of the individual rainfall events fig 3a the values of stemflow for healthy c intermedia ranged from 0 0 to 2 6 mm with an average value of 0 6 mm accounting for 0 2 18 1 of the rainfall events fig 3b the interception loss for unhealthy c intermedia ranged from 0 1 to 1 3 mm with an average value of 0 5 mm accounting for 1 2 47 4 of the individual rainfall events fig 3a while the corresponding values for healthy c intermedia were 0 1 3 0 mm and 0 9 82 3 respectively average value of 1 0 mm the throughfall depth for unhealthy c intermedia ranged from 0 2 to 13 2 mm with an average value of 4 9 mm accounting for 51 8 88 9 of individual rainfall events fig 3a the values for healthy c intermedia were 0 1 12 0 mm and 7 9 83 9 respectively average value of 4 5 mm fig 4 shows the percentages of stemflow throughfall and interception loss during rainfall partitioning there was no significant difference in the stemflow percentages between unhealthy 8 0 and healthy c intermedia 8 2 p 0 05 however significant differences were found for interception loss and throughfall the averaged percentages of interception loss for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia were 15 3 and 26 4 p 0 05 respectively and the corresponding values for throughfall were 76 7 and 65 4 p 0 05 respectively 3 2 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall depth significant relationships were found between rainfall depth and stemflow interception loss and throughfall percentages of individual shrubs during each rainfall event figs 5 and 6 all of the values of p were less than 0 01 although all of r2 value were less than 0 6 the response of throughfall to rainfall depth was weaker than that of interception loss and their variations were inverse especially for healthy c intermedia interestingly the values of stemflow percentage increased with the rainfall depth in a low value stepwise manner the lowest values of stemflow percentage nearly zero were randomly concentrated in the 0 2 mm rainfall events while the values were highly variable in the 6 15 mm events the pattern in unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 54p 0 001 was more obvious than healthy c intermedia r2 0 22p 0 001 however a precise precipitation threshold for stemflow production could not be deduced overall the variation in stemflow percentage in response to rainfall depth was divided into three stages initiation 0 2 mm transition 2 6 mm and scattered 6 15 mm the stemflow percentage during the initiation stage ranged from 0 1 to 12 6 and 0 1 8 7 for healthy and unhealthy c intermedia respectively the corresponding values were 2 4 15 7 and 2 9 12 2 and 1 9 24 3 and 7 1 26 0 for the transition and scattered stages respectively the absolute variation in stemflow steadily increased from the initiation to the scattered stage for both healthy and unhealthy c intermedia by contrast the highest variations in interception loss 63 2 and 50 6 and throughfall 56 9 and 51 0 occurred during the initiation stage 3 3 partitioning relationship among throughfall stemflow and interception loss as shown in figs 7 and 8 a significant negative linear relationship was observed between throughfall and interception loss r2 0 80 p 0 001 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 90 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia the sum of throughfall and interception loss at the individual sampling scale was no less than 75 of the rainfall amount however the relationship between throughfall and stemflow was not distinct r2 0 10 p 0 002 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 22 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia a more significant and complex negative logarithmic relationship was observed between interception loss and stemflow r2 0 35 p 0 001 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 42 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia linear regressions between throughfall stemflow and interception loss were performed based on the three stages of stemflow table 4e the overall significant relationship between throughfall and interception loss did not change no significant relationships for stemflow were observed at the transition stage significant relationships between stemflow and interception loss were observed at the initiation stage for both shrub types r2 0 16 p 0 032 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 49 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia and at the scattered stage only for healthy c intermedia r2 0 09 p 0 044 additionally significant relationships between stemflow and throughfall were indicated at the initiation stage for healthy c intermedia r2 0 32 p 0 001 and at the scattered stage for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 29 p 0 001 therefore the three stages of stemflow variation could be redefined by the dynamic partitioning relationships among stemflow throughfall and interception firstly the relationships among stemflow interception loss and throughfall were statistically significant at the initiation stage but not at the transition stage secondly the relationship between stemflow and throughfall was rebuilt at the scattered stage while that between interception loss and throughfall was weakened 3 4 meteorological and morphological factors affecting stemflow interception loss and throughfall when rainfall depth region and grouping of shrub individuals were not considered variation partition results fig 9 showed that the pure effect of precipitation factor on stemflow interception loss and throughfall was 10 9 45 1 and 40 7 respectively the pure effect of non precipitation meteorological factors on stemflow interception loss and throughfall was 2 8 12 7 and 11 0 respectively the pure effect of morphological factors on stemflow interception loss and throughfall was 26 7 16 8 and 22 0 respectively the common explanation between different variables were negligible for stemflow interception loss and throughfall precipitation had a primary effect on interception loss and throughfall whereas morphological factors were crucial in explaining the variation in stemflow in addition we used forward selection based on rda for all of driving factors to obtain the significant variables for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively table 1 xrd and scpa were the first two most significant variables for both unhealthy and healthy c intermedia precipitation dominated the explanation of variance among the multi factors for both unhealthy and healthy c intermedia although individual morphological factor showed a low percentage of the explained variance all of the factors explained about 20 7 of the variance totally which indicated the non negligible role of morphological factors in determining stemflow interception loss and throughfall for healthy c intermedia however for unhealthy c intermedia non precipitation meteorological factors exerted more influences 11 8 compared to that in healthy c intermedia 8 3 fig 10 shows the whole relationships among multiple variables and individual samples based on the rda analysis for both unhealthy and healthy c intermedia ytf and ysf were positively correlated with xrd at the initiation stage red solid circles while yri was negatively correlated with xrd at the scattered stage black solid circles for healthy c intermedia interception loss exhibited positive correlations with most of the morphological variables and the non precipitation meteorological furthermore all the results derived from the multiple linear regression within 0 15 mm rainfall depth table 5e the variation partitioning fig 9 and the rda analysis table 1 and fig 10 were consistent with each other 3 5 factors affecting stemflow interception loss and throughfall at different stages of stemflow variation step wise multiple regression analysis was conducted for the three stages of stemflow variation the results table 2 indicated a progressive change in explanatory variables for stemflow interception loss and throughfall from the initiation to the scattered stages as indicated in table 5e explanatory factors exerting contrary effects on throughfall and interception loss were the same during the initiation and scattered stages as shown in table 2 at the initiation stage the factors were xat and xrt for unhealthy c intermedia and xdp xrd and scv for healthy c intermedia at the scattered stage the factors were xrd and xri for unhealthy c intermedia and xws for healthy c intermedia however the effect of explanatory factors at the transition stage was based on the significant correlation among different factors such as xah and xet r 0 78 p 0 01 additionally a progressive shift in the explanatory variables i e from non precipitation factors at the initiation stage to precipitation factors at the scattered stage was observed especially for unhealthy c intermedia in conjunction with the results presented in table 4e it can be concluded that the dynamic partitioning between stemflow and interception loss primarily occurred during the initiation stage when the rainfall amount was 2 mm and the percentage of interception loss was 71 based on the regression analysis accuracy 49 fig 11 or 40 based on actual observations fig 11 the stable initiation of stemflow could be achieved however a common factor driven mechanism for partitioning into interception loss and stemflow could not be established significant effects of xdp at the initiation stage and scpa at the transition stage on stemflow were observed for healthy c intermedia whereas xah showed significant effects at the initiation stage for unhealthy c intermedia for stemflow table 2 xws and xdp were significant factors during the initiation stages of unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively whereas xri and scpa were significant during the transition and scattered stages for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively morphological factors scpa sch sadb and sabl were more important for healthy c intermedia however the meteorological factors were mainly responsible for the rainfall partitioning in unhealthy c intermedia xrd xri and xat the degree of variation explained by morphological factors steadily increased with the increasing rainfall depth for throughfall and interception loss 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during the whole rainfall events 0 15 mm a significantly dynamic partitioning relationship between interception loss and throughfall resulted in a low and unstable stemflow that was largely explained by xrd and scpa in general the throughfall and interception loss percentages summed up to greater than 80 which is consistent with the previous studies in arid and semi arid regions zhang et al 2015 serrato and diaz 1998 whitford et al 1997 domingo et al 1998 martinez meza and whitford 1996 in this study the specific values were 91 9 and 92 1 for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively the overall precipitation partitioning was strongly constrained by the allocation of rainfall into the components of throughfall and interception loss which consequently resulted in a low and unstable stemflow averaging near 8 0 similar stemflow percentages were determined in several other studies zhang et al 2015 li et al 2008 yang et al 2008 jian et al 2014 suggesting that stemflow in arid and semi arid regions might represent a minor and concomitant canopy hydrological process in agreement with the results of several previous studies li et al 2008 germer et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2013 xrd and scpa the two most important factors worked against each other to drive partitioning into interception loss and throughfall tables 5e and 1 xrd and scpa were the primary factors in determining the stemflow for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively while all the factors that had significant impacts on stemflow for unhealthy c intermedia were meteorological factors morphological factors are known to have a significant and complex influence on stemflow production yuan et al 2016 navar 1993 martinez meza and whitford 1996 wang et al 2013 just as the results of variation partitioning showed in fig 9 however in this study morphological degradation diminished the influence of these factors on stemflow here morphological degradation of c intermedia was characterized by larger canopy gaps smaller canopy area and relatively homogeneous structure among individual shrubs zhai et al 2015 yang et al 2015 the statistical analyses demonstrate that contrary to healthy c intermedia fewer differences among individual shrubs of unhealthy c intermedia can compensate for the potential contribution of morphological factors to the stemflow 4 2 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during initiation stage 0 2 mm although the causality of partitioning into interception loss and stemflow was observed at the stemflow initiation stage a stable and credible precipitation threshold for stemflow production could not be derived possibly owing to the variability in non precipitation meteorological factors several previous studies have investigated the precipitation threshold for stemflow production and found that the critical rainfall depth was usually less than 3 mm zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 llorens and domingo 2007 our results showed that the minimum percentage of stemflow were randomly distributed within the 0 2 mm range of rainfall depths suggesting that the rainfall depth factor might not necessarily be responsible for the stemflow generation figs 5 and 6 and the relationship between stemflow and interception loss within this rainfall depth range 0 2 mm revealed that the initiation of stemflow may be determined by a maximum interception loss of 40 for healthy c intermedia fig 11 r2 0 49 p 0 001 n 33 as a causality between interception loss and stemflow price and carlyle moses 2003 staelens et al 2008 considered the uncertainty about precipitation threshold for stemflow production during trace rainfall events a range value of rainfall depth would be better rather than a specific value according to previous studies non precipitation meteorological factors such as xws xat xah and xdp could significantly affect the canopy water storage capacity stemflow production and other canopy hydrological processes levia and germer 2015 zhang et al 2018 these include the effects of preferential stemflow in wind driven rainfall wind speeds zhang et al 2014 andré et al 2008 air temperature and humidity on interception loss through evaporation carlyle moses 2004 zhang et al 2015 concluded that non precipitation meteorological factors were not significantly correlate with rainfall partitioning in the rainfall range of 0 30 mm but might be significant with interception loss the effects of non precipitation meteorological factors on interception loss were primarily established in the 0 2 mm range 4 3 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during transition stage 2 6 mm no significant relationships were observed between stemflow and interception loss or between stemflow and throughfall at the transition stage therefore it could be regarded as an independent stemflow production stage firstly free throughfall the primary type in this stage carlyle moses and price 2006 had no direct partitioning relationships with stemflow secondly a certain amount of the stemflow averaged about 2 will turn to vapour by evaporation which was nearly equal to the upper value of stable stemflow initiation therefore the conversion between stemflow and interception loss might have been completed before this stage fig 11 finally stemflow could be produced preferentially before the canopy was partially saturated with the holding water crockford et al 1996 without a significant conversion of the three partitioning components into each other these changes in relationships and mechanisms explain the potential independence of stemflow production during this stage although the relationship between interception loss and stemflow was not significant scpa exerted contrary influences on interception loss positive and stemflow negative for healthy c intermedia since scpa is related to plant size larger plants may give rise to a lower stemflow zhang et al 2014 levia et al 2010 garcia estringana et al 2010 or higher interception loss due to higher canopy water storage levia and germer 2015 however the effects of scpa might be countered by the interaction of other significant factors e g sch sadb scba and xah leading to a non significant relationship between interception loss and stemflow 4 4 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during scattered stage 6 15 mm the dynamic partitioning between stemflow and throughfall was re established during the stemflow scattered stage the variability in morphological factors and their influence on meteorological factors might have resulted in the scattered patterns of stemflow a few previous studies have indicated that stemflow percentages rapidly increased and subsequently stabilized around an upper value for a similar rainfall depth interval zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however in this study the data of stemflow showed a scattered distribution instead of converging to a stable value at the individual shrub scale similarly the scattered pattern of stemflow have also been observed at both shrub zhang et al 2015 and branch zhang et al 2016 scales especially when the rainfall depth was less than 15 mm the variability in morphological factors and their influences on meteorological factors might result in the scattered patterns of stemflow we hypothesize that the scattered patterns of stemflow in this interval reflected a unique process that occurred flowing the rapid increase of stemflow and followed by a tendency of convergence which was driven by the interaction of multiple factors firstly the change in the relative influence from meteorological to morphological factors magnified the sampling effects variation in morphological factors of individual shrubs secondly the random combination of meteorological xri and morphological factors sch and stnb without a negative feedback constraint for unhealthy c intermedia table 7e and the positive feedback of morphological factors scpa sch and sadb for healthy c intermedia tables 6e and 1 explain the scattered stemflow in addition xri might be partially responsible for the relationships between stemflow and throughfall in the interval since the dynamic partitioning between stemflow and throughfall would occur when the canopy was well saturated especially under higher rainfall intensity carlyle moses and price 2006 however the determinate but weak relationship constraint r 2 0 29 p 0 01 could not change the scattered pattern because rainfall intensity was only a minor factor 5 conclusions this study analyzed stemflow by incorporating the overall dynamic partitioning relationships among stemflow throughfall and interception loss and a stepped approach was utilized to characterize inter storm stemflow new insights from this study include 1 low and unstable stemflow might result from significant and preferential dynamic partitioning between throughfall and interception loss except for the scenarios of higher throughfall and interception loss percentages in general 2 stemflow responds to the increases in rainfall depth in a low value stepwise manner 3 in terms of the relative importance non precipitation meteorological factors are more important to light rainfall events while precipitation meteorological factors are more important to larger rainfall events and 4 a hydrological precipitation threshold for stemflow cannot be extrapolated by regression and the threshold should be a range value instead of a specific value we suggest that the quantification of uncertainties and various methods for precipitation partitioning should be introduced in modeling plant hydrological processes in the arid area also the whole conversion relationships among stemflow interception and throughfall should be taken into consideration in the current ecohydrological models to

6479,grassland restored by re vegetated shrub is an important ecosystem in desert steppe of northwest china yet little is understood about the underlying eco hydrological mechanisms for maintaining the stability of the re vegetated ecosystem based on the conversion relationships among throughfall interception loss and stemflow we developed a method to analyze the dynamic responses of rainfall partitioning by vegetation canopies to precipitation variation and the driving mechanisms for stemflow of two morphological distinct shrubs unhealthy and healthy c intermedia during the 21 rainfall events 0 15 mm in the period from 2016 to 2017 we found that the stemflow increased in a low value stepwise manner with the increasing rainfall depth and eventually became scattered therefore the response of stemflow to gross precipitation was divided into three stages by rainfall depth initiation 0 2 mm transition 2 6 mm and scattered 6 15 mm a significantly negative linear relationship was observed between throughfall and interception loss while the relationships of interception loss stemflow and throughfall stemflow exhibited a more complex nonlinear way with relatively weaker correlations rainfall depth and canopy area were two main factors driving the partitioning relationships non precipitation meteorological factors were dominant in the 0 2 mm rainfall events while rainfall factors were determinant in the 6 15 mm events morphological factors exerted more influences on the partitioning relationships for healthy c intermedia overall the conversion between throughfall and interception loss was the majority of dynamic rainfall partitioning therefore low and unstable stemflow was usually inevitable the results indicate that the precipitation threshold for stemflow generation should be a range value instead of a specific value and the rebuilt analysis roadmaps are essential for investigating stemflow using the thorough conversion relationships and the stepped approach keywords caragana intermedia throughfall stemflow interception loss dynamic rainfall partitioning relationship desert steppe 1 introduction interception loss throughfall and stemflow are the three components of precipitation partitioning by vegetation canopies throughfall accounts for most of the gross precipitation while stemflow only serves as the dropped input of water at the base of stems previous studies have indicated that the dynamic rainfall partitioning relationships i e conversion relationships among throughfall stemflow and interception loss can be attributed to distinct underlying physical mechanisms and statistical law for instance the precipitation intercepted by canopy will be lost through evaporation in most cases where the rainfall is borderline the threshold for stemflow production i e the canopy water storage capacity levia and germer 2015 carlyle moses 2004 whereas a certain amount of precipitation can be partitioned into throughfall instead of stemflow when the rainfall is much beyond the canopy water storage capacity especially under high rainfall intensities carlyle moses and price 2006 in general as rainfall increases the percentage of interception loss decreases while throughfall and stemflow rapidly increase before stalling at higher values zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 overall the conversion reflects the dynamic partitioning relationships among interception loss throughfall and stemflow canopy rainfall partitioning determines the water input in dryland ecosystems thus it plays a significantly hydrological role in the generation of stemflow and plant survival levia et al 2010 fan et al 2015 levia and frost 2003 swaffer et al 2014 stemflow is highly species and region specific and can be influenced by several factors involved with rainfall characteristics and plant traits crockford and richardson 2000 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 specifically these factors include the amount of precipitation li et al 2008 rainfall intensity germer et al 2010 canopy structure as well as biological traits at the branch stem and leaf levels wang et al 2013 given this levia and germer 2015 suggested the development of a common metric to increase cross site comparability of stemflow studies despite the facts that numerous studies have addressed species or region specific issues the investigation hits a brick wall due to research limitations 1 previous studies on the relationships among throughfall stemflow and interception loss demonstrated that the hydrological mechanisms underpinning these processes were closely related however most studies mainly focused on the stemflow mechanisms which are insufficient in revealing the overall relationships among stemflow interception loss and throughfall levia and germer 2015 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 2014 yuan et al 2016 2 secondly significant differences in rainfall depth ranges for the partitioning laws and factors influencing canopy rainfall partitioning exist the rainfall partitioning rule based on whole rainfall events sometimes conceals in statistics the specificity of the rule in small or larger rainfall ranges rainfall partitioning mechanisms during small rainfall events are more interesting for researchers in arid regions however complex mechanisms with regard to small rainfall events have not been comprehensively researched zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 for instance the precipitation threshold for stemflow production of many arid shrubs is less than 3 0 mm llorens and domingo 2007 in light rainfall events in general lower than 5 mm air temperature humidity wind speed and other non precipitation factors are likely to significantly influence the canopy water storage capacity zhang et al 2014 levia and germer 2015 and subsequently affect stemflow initiation through the conversion relationship with interception loss however compared with precipitation factors the effects of non precipitation meteorological factors on stemflow interception loss and throughfall of xerophytic shrubs need further investigations levia and germer 2015 zhang et al 2018 van stan et al 2016 therefore it is urgent to carry out comprehensive studies on stemflow incorporating with the whole conversion relationship finer zoning of precipitation precipitation and non precipitation meteorological factors and morphological factors in this study a revegetated shrubland of caragana intermedia in the desert steppe of northwest china was studied this region has suffered severe droughts and degradation of native grassland vegetation due to increased shrub growth yang et al 2015 song et al 2014 this systematic study of canopy hydrological processes of c intermedia and their driving mechanisms especially the evolution of stemflow is of theoretical and practical importance in the better understanding of the eco hydrological system as well as the adaptive management in the degraded shrubland in this study the partitioning relationships among throughfall stemflow and interception loss were studied by analyzing 21 rainfall events 0 15 mm occurred in the period from 2016 to 2017 to evaluate their responses to dynamic changes in precipitation and explore the driven mechanisms underpinned by the meteorological and morphological factors the main objectives of the present study were 1 to understand the overall dynamic partitioning patterns with regard to stemflow interception loss and throughfall and the variation in response to different rainfall amounts 2 to determine the driving mechanisms of rainfall partitioning and 3 to understand the eco hydrological mechanisms of stemflow generation within the framework of the overall dynamic partitioning relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area is located in the semi arid desert steppe of yanchi county in the ningxia hui autonomous region of china 37 47 37 57 n 107 22 107 33 e el1392m 1426 m the mean annual temperature of the study region is 8 1 c while the annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 350 mm approximately 62 of the total rainfall occurs between july and september the sunshine duration is 3124 h year 1 with an evaporation rate of 2897 mm year 1 the frost free period is known to last about 165 days the soil types are mainly composed of sandy limestone and aeolian sandy soil which are characterized by poor capacities for water and nutrient retention and vulnerability to wind erosion the region is a typical transition zone between the maowusu sandy land and the loess plateau it is more heterogeneous in climate soil and plants within this region than that of the adjacent areas however this zone has suffered severe environmental degradation due to anthropogenic activities among which overgrazing in the grassland took the primary responsibility yang et al 2015 song et al 2014 c intermedia has been planted since the 1970s to restore sandy grassland currently the total area of the c intermedia shrubland is more than 2000 km2 and shrubs planted before the 1990s have matured or aged owing to serious soil droughts and shrub decay yang et al 2015 song et al 2014 the shrubland exists as two landscapes banded plantation artificial shrubland and scattered natural shrubland fig 1 unhealthy c intermedia is distributed in the banded plantation artificial shrubland while healthy c intermedia is distributed in the scattered natural shrubland in general healthy c intermedia individuals are tall with abundant foliage and good growth unhealthy c intermedia individuals are short with sparse foliage and low annual growth rate 2 2 shrub selection and measurements a 100 m 100 m sampling plot was selected at the banded plantation artificial shrubland and the scattered natural shrubland respectively and then six unhealthy and six healthy c intermedia shrubs were selected randomly from the above plots respectively figs 1 and 2 table 2e in supplementary material presents the quantified morphological characteristics of the selected shrubs eight morphological factors at the shrub scale were considered the total number of branches stnb and average branch length sabl were estimated for all twigs except those sprouting from the base the average base diameter of branches sadb was calculated as the average of the diameters of all stem bases measured with vernier calipers average branch angle saba was the averaged angle for all branches determined by a protractor canopy height sch was measured at the center of the canopy canopy projection area scpa was calculated by measuring the east west and north south diameters through the center of the fullest part of the canopy the calculation of canopy base area scba was similar to the scpa however only the base of the canopy was considered canopy volume scv was estimated as the product of the area and height 2 3 stemflow and throughfall measurements stemflow collection methods were adopted from zhang et al 2015 as shown in fig 1e the stemflow volume was measured for each individual stem after each rainfall event and subsequently consolidated for a single shrub by using the projection area ratio eq 1 throughfall collectors were installed beneath the shrub canopy and were equidistant in four directions 0 90 180 and 270 eight to twelve collectors were placed depending on the size of the shrub the average numbers of collectors in one square meter area was 3 0 for both healthy and unhealthy c intermedia shrubs in this study 21 rainfall events lower than 15 mm from 2016 to 2017 were selected the volumes l of the collected stemflow and throughfall were measured manually by using a counting cup 0 1 ml in the measurement resolution at the end of each rainfall event the stemflow percentage was calculated as 1 ysf i n v ysfi c a i scpa i n c a i x r d 100 where ysf is the stemflow percentage of the individual shrub vysfi is the stemflow volume l of the ith individual branch n is the number of branches measured in the shrub cai is the ith branch canopy area m2 scpa is the shrub canopy area m2 and xrd is rainfall depth mm given the irregularity of crown shape for the branch we adopted a method of isolated branch projection imaging and vectorization calculation at the end of the 2 year measurement period the marked branches were cut and the projection images of branch crowns were collected by a digital camera in the field after the images were vectorized with photoshop the ca of the branch was directly extracted the throughfall percentage was calculated as 2 ytf i 1 n v yt f i n f a x r d 100 where ytf is the throughfall percentage of the individual shrub vytfi is the throughfall volume l for each collector n is the number of throughfall collectors under each shrub canopy fa is the opening area m2 of the funnel used in the experiments and xrd is rainfall depth mm the canopy interception loss percentage yri for each rainfall event was calculated as 3 yri 100 y t f y s f where ytf is the throughfall percentage and ysf is the stemflow percentage 2 4 meteorological variables the automatic weather station with a delta t logger delta t devices ltd u k was installed in an open area adjacent to the study plots meteorological variables were automatically measured and recorded at 30 min intervals by the weather station tables 1e and 3e the meteorological data presented here are daily averages individual rainfall event was identified by the criterion that a continuous rain free period should be longer than 4 hrs the meteorological variables measured in this study included rainfall depth xrd mm rainfall intensity xri mm h 1 rainfall duration xrt h atmospheric temperature xat c relative atmospheric humidity xah dew point temperature xdp c wind speed xws m s 1 solar radiation intensity xsr w m 2 and reference crop evapotranspiration xet mm h 1 an auto output value from the weather station based on the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the values presented in this study were daily averages in this study non precipitation meteorological factors were averaged for the entire day of the rainfall event in contrast to averaging just during the rainfall event levia and germer 2015 because the light rainfall events in the region were intermittent and short lasting with trace amounts of water produced therefore weather conditions before and after the events could influence canopy hydrological processes such as interception loss by evaporation carlyle moses 2004 in addition the potential significance of meteorological factors might weaken statistically owing to the similarity in weather conditions during different rainfall events such as high humidity and low temperature in general 2 5 statistical analyses the t test and non parametric tests mann whitney tests were used to determine statistically significant differences α 0 05 in the percentages of stemflow throughfall and interception loss of unhealthy and healthy c intermedia linear or nonlinear regressions were used to determine the partitioning relationships among stemflow throughfall and interception loss as well as their respective responses to rainfall depth multiple linear regressions based on meteorological and morphological factors were used to determine the mechanisms of rainfall partitioning statistical analyses were performed using spss 20 0 statistical software spss inc chicago usa to disentangle the relative importance of each group of factors precipitation non precipitation meteorological and morphological factors independently or in combination variation partition was employed based on stemflow interception loss and throughfall stemflow interception loss and throughfall as the response variables were applied to partition of variation and seven fractions were got a variation explained by precipitation factors independent of non precipitation meteorological and morphological factors b variation explained by non precipitation meteorological factors independent of precipitation and morphological explanation factors c variation explained by morphological factors independent of precipitation and non precipitation meteorological factors d e f and g indicates a common explanation between different variables respectively these analyses were conducted using the vegan library in r software canoco 4 5 microcomputer power ithaca usa was used for determination of multivariate relationships between response variables e g throughfall stemflow and interception loss and explaining variable e g morphological factors precipitation factors and non precipitation meteorological factors firstly detrended correspondence analysis dca showed that response data were linear and had a gradient length so a linear method was recommended secondly redundancy analysis rda was performed to correlate each response variable with explanatory variables in addition forward selection was performed to test which parameter had a significant influence on stemflow throughfall and interception loss statistical significance was kept at p 0 05 for all analyses zhang et al 2011 for the biplot resulted from the rda analysis the axes in rda biplot indicate a linear combination of different explanatory variables that can best explain the variation of dependent variables the vectors denote different explanatory variables and response variables the angles between vectors represent their correlations the position of point relative to axes means individual sample scores on the first two ordination axes and the distances between points mean similarity of different samples the projection of a point onto a vector indicates the weight value of individual sample on some explanatory or response variable borcard et al 2011 3 results 3 1 rainfall partitioning fig 3 shows the depths of individual rainfall events stemflow throughfall interception loss and rainfall intensity during the 21 small rainfall events the stemflow depth for unhealthy c intermedia ranged from 0 0 to 2 3 mm with an average value of 0 7 mm accounting for 0 0 18 9 of the individual rainfall events fig 3a the values of stemflow for healthy c intermedia ranged from 0 0 to 2 6 mm with an average value of 0 6 mm accounting for 0 2 18 1 of the rainfall events fig 3b the interception loss for unhealthy c intermedia ranged from 0 1 to 1 3 mm with an average value of 0 5 mm accounting for 1 2 47 4 of the individual rainfall events fig 3a while the corresponding values for healthy c intermedia were 0 1 3 0 mm and 0 9 82 3 respectively average value of 1 0 mm the throughfall depth for unhealthy c intermedia ranged from 0 2 to 13 2 mm with an average value of 4 9 mm accounting for 51 8 88 9 of individual rainfall events fig 3a the values for healthy c intermedia were 0 1 12 0 mm and 7 9 83 9 respectively average value of 4 5 mm fig 4 shows the percentages of stemflow throughfall and interception loss during rainfall partitioning there was no significant difference in the stemflow percentages between unhealthy 8 0 and healthy c intermedia 8 2 p 0 05 however significant differences were found for interception loss and throughfall the averaged percentages of interception loss for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia were 15 3 and 26 4 p 0 05 respectively and the corresponding values for throughfall were 76 7 and 65 4 p 0 05 respectively 3 2 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall depth significant relationships were found between rainfall depth and stemflow interception loss and throughfall percentages of individual shrubs during each rainfall event figs 5 and 6 all of the values of p were less than 0 01 although all of r2 value were less than 0 6 the response of throughfall to rainfall depth was weaker than that of interception loss and their variations were inverse especially for healthy c intermedia interestingly the values of stemflow percentage increased with the rainfall depth in a low value stepwise manner the lowest values of stemflow percentage nearly zero were randomly concentrated in the 0 2 mm rainfall events while the values were highly variable in the 6 15 mm events the pattern in unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 54p 0 001 was more obvious than healthy c intermedia r2 0 22p 0 001 however a precise precipitation threshold for stemflow production could not be deduced overall the variation in stemflow percentage in response to rainfall depth was divided into three stages initiation 0 2 mm transition 2 6 mm and scattered 6 15 mm the stemflow percentage during the initiation stage ranged from 0 1 to 12 6 and 0 1 8 7 for healthy and unhealthy c intermedia respectively the corresponding values were 2 4 15 7 and 2 9 12 2 and 1 9 24 3 and 7 1 26 0 for the transition and scattered stages respectively the absolute variation in stemflow steadily increased from the initiation to the scattered stage for both healthy and unhealthy c intermedia by contrast the highest variations in interception loss 63 2 and 50 6 and throughfall 56 9 and 51 0 occurred during the initiation stage 3 3 partitioning relationship among throughfall stemflow and interception loss as shown in figs 7 and 8 a significant negative linear relationship was observed between throughfall and interception loss r2 0 80 p 0 001 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 90 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia the sum of throughfall and interception loss at the individual sampling scale was no less than 75 of the rainfall amount however the relationship between throughfall and stemflow was not distinct r2 0 10 p 0 002 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 22 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia a more significant and complex negative logarithmic relationship was observed between interception loss and stemflow r2 0 35 p 0 001 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 42 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia linear regressions between throughfall stemflow and interception loss were performed based on the three stages of stemflow table 4e the overall significant relationship between throughfall and interception loss did not change no significant relationships for stemflow were observed at the transition stage significant relationships between stemflow and interception loss were observed at the initiation stage for both shrub types r2 0 16 p 0 032 for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 49 p 0 001 for healthy c intermedia and at the scattered stage only for healthy c intermedia r2 0 09 p 0 044 additionally significant relationships between stemflow and throughfall were indicated at the initiation stage for healthy c intermedia r2 0 32 p 0 001 and at the scattered stage for unhealthy c intermedia r2 0 29 p 0 001 therefore the three stages of stemflow variation could be redefined by the dynamic partitioning relationships among stemflow throughfall and interception firstly the relationships among stemflow interception loss and throughfall were statistically significant at the initiation stage but not at the transition stage secondly the relationship between stemflow and throughfall was rebuilt at the scattered stage while that between interception loss and throughfall was weakened 3 4 meteorological and morphological factors affecting stemflow interception loss and throughfall when rainfall depth region and grouping of shrub individuals were not considered variation partition results fig 9 showed that the pure effect of precipitation factor on stemflow interception loss and throughfall was 10 9 45 1 and 40 7 respectively the pure effect of non precipitation meteorological factors on stemflow interception loss and throughfall was 2 8 12 7 and 11 0 respectively the pure effect of morphological factors on stemflow interception loss and throughfall was 26 7 16 8 and 22 0 respectively the common explanation between different variables were negligible for stemflow interception loss and throughfall precipitation had a primary effect on interception loss and throughfall whereas morphological factors were crucial in explaining the variation in stemflow in addition we used forward selection based on rda for all of driving factors to obtain the significant variables for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively table 1 xrd and scpa were the first two most significant variables for both unhealthy and healthy c intermedia precipitation dominated the explanation of variance among the multi factors for both unhealthy and healthy c intermedia although individual morphological factor showed a low percentage of the explained variance all of the factors explained about 20 7 of the variance totally which indicated the non negligible role of morphological factors in determining stemflow interception loss and throughfall for healthy c intermedia however for unhealthy c intermedia non precipitation meteorological factors exerted more influences 11 8 compared to that in healthy c intermedia 8 3 fig 10 shows the whole relationships among multiple variables and individual samples based on the rda analysis for both unhealthy and healthy c intermedia ytf and ysf were positively correlated with xrd at the initiation stage red solid circles while yri was negatively correlated with xrd at the scattered stage black solid circles for healthy c intermedia interception loss exhibited positive correlations with most of the morphological variables and the non precipitation meteorological furthermore all the results derived from the multiple linear regression within 0 15 mm rainfall depth table 5e the variation partitioning fig 9 and the rda analysis table 1 and fig 10 were consistent with each other 3 5 factors affecting stemflow interception loss and throughfall at different stages of stemflow variation step wise multiple regression analysis was conducted for the three stages of stemflow variation the results table 2 indicated a progressive change in explanatory variables for stemflow interception loss and throughfall from the initiation to the scattered stages as indicated in table 5e explanatory factors exerting contrary effects on throughfall and interception loss were the same during the initiation and scattered stages as shown in table 2 at the initiation stage the factors were xat and xrt for unhealthy c intermedia and xdp xrd and scv for healthy c intermedia at the scattered stage the factors were xrd and xri for unhealthy c intermedia and xws for healthy c intermedia however the effect of explanatory factors at the transition stage was based on the significant correlation among different factors such as xah and xet r 0 78 p 0 01 additionally a progressive shift in the explanatory variables i e from non precipitation factors at the initiation stage to precipitation factors at the scattered stage was observed especially for unhealthy c intermedia in conjunction with the results presented in table 4e it can be concluded that the dynamic partitioning between stemflow and interception loss primarily occurred during the initiation stage when the rainfall amount was 2 mm and the percentage of interception loss was 71 based on the regression analysis accuracy 49 fig 11 or 40 based on actual observations fig 11 the stable initiation of stemflow could be achieved however a common factor driven mechanism for partitioning into interception loss and stemflow could not be established significant effects of xdp at the initiation stage and scpa at the transition stage on stemflow were observed for healthy c intermedia whereas xah showed significant effects at the initiation stage for unhealthy c intermedia for stemflow table 2 xws and xdp were significant factors during the initiation stages of unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively whereas xri and scpa were significant during the transition and scattered stages for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively morphological factors scpa sch sadb and sabl were more important for healthy c intermedia however the meteorological factors were mainly responsible for the rainfall partitioning in unhealthy c intermedia xrd xri and xat the degree of variation explained by morphological factors steadily increased with the increasing rainfall depth for throughfall and interception loss 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during the whole rainfall events 0 15 mm a significantly dynamic partitioning relationship between interception loss and throughfall resulted in a low and unstable stemflow that was largely explained by xrd and scpa in general the throughfall and interception loss percentages summed up to greater than 80 which is consistent with the previous studies in arid and semi arid regions zhang et al 2015 serrato and diaz 1998 whitford et al 1997 domingo et al 1998 martinez meza and whitford 1996 in this study the specific values were 91 9 and 92 1 for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively the overall precipitation partitioning was strongly constrained by the allocation of rainfall into the components of throughfall and interception loss which consequently resulted in a low and unstable stemflow averaging near 8 0 similar stemflow percentages were determined in several other studies zhang et al 2015 li et al 2008 yang et al 2008 jian et al 2014 suggesting that stemflow in arid and semi arid regions might represent a minor and concomitant canopy hydrological process in agreement with the results of several previous studies li et al 2008 germer et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2013 xrd and scpa the two most important factors worked against each other to drive partitioning into interception loss and throughfall tables 5e and 1 xrd and scpa were the primary factors in determining the stemflow for unhealthy and healthy c intermedia respectively while all the factors that had significant impacts on stemflow for unhealthy c intermedia were meteorological factors morphological factors are known to have a significant and complex influence on stemflow production yuan et al 2016 navar 1993 martinez meza and whitford 1996 wang et al 2013 just as the results of variation partitioning showed in fig 9 however in this study morphological degradation diminished the influence of these factors on stemflow here morphological degradation of c intermedia was characterized by larger canopy gaps smaller canopy area and relatively homogeneous structure among individual shrubs zhai et al 2015 yang et al 2015 the statistical analyses demonstrate that contrary to healthy c intermedia fewer differences among individual shrubs of unhealthy c intermedia can compensate for the potential contribution of morphological factors to the stemflow 4 2 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during initiation stage 0 2 mm although the causality of partitioning into interception loss and stemflow was observed at the stemflow initiation stage a stable and credible precipitation threshold for stemflow production could not be derived possibly owing to the variability in non precipitation meteorological factors several previous studies have investigated the precipitation threshold for stemflow production and found that the critical rainfall depth was usually less than 3 mm zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 llorens and domingo 2007 our results showed that the minimum percentage of stemflow were randomly distributed within the 0 2 mm range of rainfall depths suggesting that the rainfall depth factor might not necessarily be responsible for the stemflow generation figs 5 and 6 and the relationship between stemflow and interception loss within this rainfall depth range 0 2 mm revealed that the initiation of stemflow may be determined by a maximum interception loss of 40 for healthy c intermedia fig 11 r2 0 49 p 0 001 n 33 as a causality between interception loss and stemflow price and carlyle moses 2003 staelens et al 2008 considered the uncertainty about precipitation threshold for stemflow production during trace rainfall events a range value of rainfall depth would be better rather than a specific value according to previous studies non precipitation meteorological factors such as xws xat xah and xdp could significantly affect the canopy water storage capacity stemflow production and other canopy hydrological processes levia and germer 2015 zhang et al 2018 these include the effects of preferential stemflow in wind driven rainfall wind speeds zhang et al 2014 andré et al 2008 air temperature and humidity on interception loss through evaporation carlyle moses 2004 zhang et al 2015 concluded that non precipitation meteorological factors were not significantly correlate with rainfall partitioning in the rainfall range of 0 30 mm but might be significant with interception loss the effects of non precipitation meteorological factors on interception loss were primarily established in the 0 2 mm range 4 3 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during transition stage 2 6 mm no significant relationships were observed between stemflow and interception loss or between stemflow and throughfall at the transition stage therefore it could be regarded as an independent stemflow production stage firstly free throughfall the primary type in this stage carlyle moses and price 2006 had no direct partitioning relationships with stemflow secondly a certain amount of the stemflow averaged about 2 will turn to vapour by evaporation which was nearly equal to the upper value of stable stemflow initiation therefore the conversion between stemflow and interception loss might have been completed before this stage fig 11 finally stemflow could be produced preferentially before the canopy was partially saturated with the holding water crockford et al 1996 without a significant conversion of the three partitioning components into each other these changes in relationships and mechanisms explain the potential independence of stemflow production during this stage although the relationship between interception loss and stemflow was not significant scpa exerted contrary influences on interception loss positive and stemflow negative for healthy c intermedia since scpa is related to plant size larger plants may give rise to a lower stemflow zhang et al 2014 levia et al 2010 garcia estringana et al 2010 or higher interception loss due to higher canopy water storage levia and germer 2015 however the effects of scpa might be countered by the interaction of other significant factors e g sch sadb scba and xah leading to a non significant relationship between interception loss and stemflow 4 4 dynamic partitioning relationships and driving factors during scattered stage 6 15 mm the dynamic partitioning between stemflow and throughfall was re established during the stemflow scattered stage the variability in morphological factors and their influence on meteorological factors might have resulted in the scattered patterns of stemflow a few previous studies have indicated that stemflow percentages rapidly increased and subsequently stabilized around an upper value for a similar rainfall depth interval zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however in this study the data of stemflow showed a scattered distribution instead of converging to a stable value at the individual shrub scale similarly the scattered pattern of stemflow have also been observed at both shrub zhang et al 2015 and branch zhang et al 2016 scales especially when the rainfall depth was less than 15 mm the variability in morphological factors and their influences on meteorological factors might result in the scattered patterns of stemflow we hypothesize that the scattered patterns of stemflow in this interval reflected a unique process that occurred flowing the rapid increase of stemflow and followed by a tendency of convergence which was driven by the interaction of multiple factors firstly the change in the relative influence from meteorological to morphological factors magnified the sampling effects variation in morphological factors of individual shrubs secondly the random combination of meteorological xri and morphological factors sch and stnb without a negative feedback constraint for unhealthy c intermedia table 7e and the positive feedback of morphological factors scpa sch and sadb for healthy c intermedia tables 6e and 1 explain the scattered stemflow in addition xri might be partially responsible for the relationships between stemflow and throughfall in the interval since the dynamic partitioning between stemflow and throughfall would occur when the canopy was well saturated especially under higher rainfall intensity carlyle moses and price 2006 however the determinate but weak relationship constraint r 2 0 29 p 0 01 could not change the scattered pattern because rainfall intensity was only a minor factor 5 conclusions this study analyzed stemflow by incorporating the overall dynamic partitioning relationships among stemflow throughfall and interception loss and a stepped approach was utilized to characterize inter storm stemflow new insights from this study include 1 low and unstable stemflow might result from significant and preferential dynamic partitioning between throughfall and interception loss except for the scenarios of higher throughfall and interception loss percentages in general 2 stemflow responds to the increases in rainfall depth in a low value stepwise manner 3 in terms of the relative importance non precipitation meteorological factors are more important to light rainfall events while precipitation meteorological factors are more important to larger rainfall events and 4 a hydrological precipitation threshold for stemflow cannot be extrapolated by regression and the threshold should be a range value instead of a specific value we suggest that the quantification of uncertainties and various methods for precipitation partitioning should be introduced in modeling plant hydrological processes in the arid area also the whole conversion relationships among stemflow interception and throughfall should be taken into consideration in the current ecohydrological models to provide new sights for the hydrology management focusing on revegetation stability in the arid area declaration of interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other
