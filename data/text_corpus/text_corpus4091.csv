20455,the influence of forward speed on stochastic free surface crossing in a gaussian wave field is investigated the case of a material point moving with a constant forward speed is considered the wave field is assumed stationary in time and homogeneous in space the focus is on up crossing events which are defined as the material point crossing the free surface into the water domain the effect of the doppler shift induced by the forward speed on the up crossing frequency and the related conditional joint distribution of wave kinematic variables is analytically investigated some general trends are illustrated through different examples where three kinds of wave direction distribution are considered unidirectional short crested anisotropic and isotropic the way the developed approach may be used in the context of slamming on marine structures is briefly discussed keywords water wave gaussian level crossing doppler effect forward speed slamming 1 introduction from an engineering standpoint two quantities related to the chance of free surface crossing for an object travelling in an ocean wave field may be of interest i the average frequency of crossing events ii the related joint probability distribution of wave kinematic variables given crossing the present study focuses on up crossing events which are defined as follows the free surface up crosses the object or equivalently the object down crosses the free surface into the water domain an up crossing event will lead to a water entry phenomenon which may induce significant hydrodynamic loads on the structure of the object see e g korobkin and pukhnachov 1988 faltinsen 2006 kapsenberg 2011 wang and guedes soares 2017 therefore the knowledge of i and ii may be valuable for the design of a marine structure that will be exposed to water wave impacts down crossing events i e water exit events may also be of practical interest in ship design for example to assess the risk of efficiency loss due to the partial emersion of an appendage or a propeller moreover water exit events can also generate high intensity transient hydrodynamic loads see e g baarholm and faltinsen 2004 korobkin et al 2017 breton et al 2020 the theoretical approach developed in the present paper for up crossing events may be readily transposed to down crossing events if the considered object for instance a ship appendage or a hull section is sufficiently small compared to water wave wavelengths the body geometry may be reduced to a single material point regarding the risk of free surface crossing then the problem becomes more tractable and may be addressed by using the level crossing theory of stochastic processes based on the pioneering work of rice 1944 1945 and subsequent works see for example lindgren 2012 chapter 8 and references therein when the motions of the water waves are modelled at the first order airy wave theory the randomness of the related kinematic variables can be modelled through gaussian processes then the average up crossing frequency and the related joint probability distribution of kinematic variables are both analytically tractable when the material point moves with a given forward velocity the motion induced doppler shift has a non trivial effect on the encounter wave spectrum lindgren et al 1999 investigated the effect of doppler shift on the distribution of the zero crossing wave period the time between successive mean level down and up crossings measured in the frame of a moving body but they did not consider the related conditional distribution of kinematic variables more recently aberg et al 2008 also investigated the effect of doppler shift on the distribution of some wave characteristics measured along the direction of body motion namely the wave slope waveheight and wavelength in the context of slamming on ships following the pioneering work of ochi 1964b a and ochi and motter 1971 1973 different authors investigated the stochastic properties of slamming induced loads and structural stresses including the effect of forward speed in the analysis in most studies however the vertical component of the relative fluid velocity is considered as the only kinematic variable relevant to the estimate of slamming loads see for example ochi and motter 1973 rassinot and mansour 1995 wang et al 2002 hermundstad and moan 2007 dessi and ciappi 2013 wang and guedes soares 2016 this assumption greatly simplifies the problem by reducing the conditional distribution of kinematic variables used as an input for the impact model given up crossing to a univariate distribution which is of rayleigh type in the framework of linear wave theory however this univariate approach may provide unreliable predictions since slamming loads may be sensitive to other kinematic variables e g scolan and korobkin 2015 such as the acceleration added mass effect the tangential velocity or the angular position of the object relative to the local free surface e g hascoët et al 2019 going beyond a univariate approach the early study of belik and price 1982 investigated the effect of accounting for the tangential component of the water entry velocity in the context of slamming on high speed vessels they considered only long crested unidirectional sea states and carried out their investigation through numerical experiments where the random sampling of impact kinematic variables was obtained from the numerical realisation of gaussian waves and ship responses more recently helmers et al 2012 analytically considered the joint distribution of several kinematic variables namely the fluid vertical velocity the fluid vertical acceleration the wave slope and the seakeeping roll angle to estimate the probability distribution of impact loads on a wedge shaped body exposed to irregular waves however these authors did not consider scenarii where the body has a forward speed and focused on unidirectional sea states the present study is devoted to the analytical investigation of the effect of forward speed on the conditional joint distribution of wave kinematic variables given up crossing the effect of forward motion on the related up crossing frequency is also analysed the case of a material point moving through a gaussian wave field at a constant velocity in a horizontal plane i e at a given altitude is investigated both long crested unidirectional and short crested multidirectional wave fields are considered section 2 sets the framework of the present study in section 3 the case of a body at rest is first considered as a preamble then in section 4 the effect of forward speed on the up crossing frequency and the related conditional joint distribution of kinematic variables is analytically investigated it is illustrated through a few examples section 5 briefly discusses how the developed framework may be used in the context of slamming the paper ends with a concluding summary in section 6 2 framework and assumptions the present section sets the framework of the analysis to be developed in sections 3 and 4 2 1 water waves modelled as a gaussian field in the present paper both long crested unidirectional and short crested multidirectional seas are considered let the wave motions be described in a spacetime coordinate system t x y z where the origin of the space coordinates o is a fixed point in the reference frame of the mean flow i e the reference frame where there is no mean current located on the plane of the mean free surface and z is directed along the ascending vertical see fig 1 for a sketch of the problem formulation in the most general case the free surface elevation η measured along the vertical direction z can be modelled as a stochastic process which depends on the time t and on the two horizontal space coordinates x and y if a linear wave model is assumed this stochastic process can be modelled as gaussian besides in the present study the considered sea states are assumed to be stationary in time and homogeneous in space then the gaussian process η is fully characterised in a probabilistic sense by its mean which is zero in the present case and its two dimensional one sided variance density spectrum g ω θ defined for ω 0 and θ π π where ω is the intrinsic wave angular frequency measured in the reference frame of the mean flow and θ the direction of wave propagation in the plane o x y in this framework a realisation of the random wave field may be numerically approximated as the sum of independent airy waves see e g ochi 2005 holthuijsen 2007 1 η x y t n 1 n q 1 q a n q cos ω n t k n cos θ q x k n sin θ q y ϕ n q where the frequencies and directions ω n θ q account for the discretisation of the two dimensional wave spectrum the wave amplitudes and phases a n q and ϕ n q are independent random variables the wave amplitudes a n q follow individual rayleigh distributions of modes 2 σ n q g ω n θ q δ ω n δ θ q where δ ω n and δ θ q are the sizes of frequency and direction discretisation intervals the wave phases ϕ n q are uniformly distributed over π π the wave numbers k n are related to the wave frequencies ω n through the dispersion relation 3 ω n 2 g k n tanh k n h where g is the acceleration due to gravity g 9 81 m s 2 is assumed in the present paper and h is the water depth in the following sections the transfer functions of different kinematic variables will be introduced to that end it is convenient to introduce the complex notation and express the surface elevation as 4 η x y t n 1 n q 1 q re a n q exp i ω n t k n cos θ q x k n sin θ q y where i is the imaginary unit and 5 a n q a n q exp i ϕ n q are the wave complex amplitudes in the present approach the space coordinate system x y z is eulerian a lagrangian type linear wave model could have been an attractive alternative as this kind of model has been shown to account for interesting wave features see e g gjøsund 2003 fouques et al 2006 lindgren and lindgren 2011 which are missed by the eulerian linear model e g the steepening of crests and flattening of troughs however the lagrangian approach leads to a model which is nonlinear with respect to wave amplitudes when expressed in an eulerian coordinate system even when it is restricted to the first order this nonlinear feature would have hindered the analytical developments to be set out in sections 3 4 2 2 wave direction distribution most equations developed in sections 3 4 assume that the frequency and direction dependencies in the two dimensional spectrum can be separated as follows 6 g ω θ d θ s ω in the above equation s is the frequency spectrum and d is a normalised function defined for θ π π and satisfying 7 π π d θ d θ 1 this frequency direction separation is assumed in order to further analytical developments however it is not theoretically restrictive and formulae valid in the general case where this assumption would not hold are always introduced beforehand in the different illustrative examples given below three different types of wave direction distribution are considered 1 unidirectional sea state with a spreading function given by 8 d 1 θ δ θ where δ denotes the dirac delta function following this distribution all waves propagate in the direction of increasing x coordinate 2 multidirectional anisotropic sea state with a spreading function given by 9 3 isotropic sea state with a spreading function 10 d 3 θ 1 2 π θ π π 2 3 spectral shape in the illustrative examples reported below the considered sea states are assumed to have a jonswap frequency spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 11 s ω n 0 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 with 12 h s is the significant wave height and ω p is the peak angular frequency of the spectrum γ is a parameter which controls the magnitude of the peak of the spectrum relative to its high frequency tail in all examples it is set to its typical value γ 3 3 the normalisation factor n 0 is such that 13 h s 2 16 0 s ω d ω besides the wave spectrum is truncated at low and high frequencies in order to discard excessively long and short waves 1 of wave variance which is proportional to wave energy is truncated at the low frequency and high frequency ends in total 2 of wave energy is disregarded 1 1 this assumption is not critical for the theoretical developments which follow another truncation level may have been adopted however note that the truncation of the high frequency end will matter when coming to practical applications such as the study of wave induced slamming loads in such applications the exposed part of the solid body should be sufficiently small compared to water wave wavelengths so that it can be modelled as a single material point regarding the risk of free surface crossing the normalisation of the spectrum following eq 13 is performed before the truncation for γ 3 3 this leads to a low frequency cutoff ω min 0 74 ω p and a high frequency cutoff ω max 3 0 ω p the average zero crossing wave period is given by 14 t z 2 π m 0 m 2 where m p denotes the p th moment of the wave spectra 15 m p 0 ω p s ω d ω following these assumptions about the spectral shape the numerical values of the first five moments are 16 m 0 0 0613 h s 2 m 1 0 0720 h s 2 ω p m 2 0 0918 h s 2 ω p 2 m 3 0 130 h s 2 ω p 3 m 4 0 208 h s 2 ω p 4 2 4 considered kinematic variables in sections 3 and 4 analytical formulae will be provided for the joint probability distribution of wave kinematic variables given up crossing the variables considered in the present study are the following η x y t the free surface elevation u x y t v x y t the horizontal components of the fluid velocity in the plane z 0 along the x axis and y axis respectively u t x y t v t x y t the components of the fluid acceleration in the plane z 0 along x axis and y axis respectively 2 2 in the present paper q v denotes the derivative of the function q with respect to the variable v w x y t the vertical component of the fluid velocity in the plane z 0 in the linear wave model w η t w t x y t the vertical component of the fluid acceleration in the plane z 0 η x x y t η y x y t the slope components of the free surface along x axis and y axis respectively including other first order kinematic variables such as the free surface curvature in the analysis to be developed in sections 3 4 would be straightforward in the present study the first order flow velocity and acceleration components at z 0 are considered as a direct proxy for the kinematics at the free surface this assumption is in line with several stretching schemes used to alleviate the deficiencies of the linear wave theory in describing the near surface fluid kinematics for irregular sea states e g wheeler 1970 chakrabarti 1971 horng 1991 conversely other techniques such as linear extrapolation above z 0 e g xu 1995 or delta stretching rodenbusch and forristall 1986 would yield a different proxy for the fluid kinematics at the free surface the kinematic variables listed above were selected as potentially relevant for the computation of hydrodynamic loads on a marine structure see section 5 for a discussion in the context of slamming hence the considered horizontal velocity and acceleration components are those of the fluid when the interest would be on the horizontal motions of the free surface itself e g for remote sensing applications the approach developed below may still be used to compute the probability distribution of the relevant variables note however that different definitions are admissible to describe the horizontal motions of the free surface these different definitions translate into nonlinear relations involving partial derivatives of η which would complicate the computation of the resulting distributions for more details see baxevani et al 2003 3 free surface up crossing at a fixed material point 3 1 non conditional distribution of kinematic variables when the body is assumed to be at rest located at x 0 y 0 z a the wetting of the material point stands for the up crossing of the level a by the stochastic process 17 η 0 t η x 0 y 0 t whose time derivative is given by 18 η 0 t η t x 0 y 0 t the kinematic variables introduced in section 2 4 measured at the location of the material point at a given time may be gathered in a random vector 3 3 in the present paper when considering a time stochastic process p t and p are respectively used to denote the stochastic process itself and its value at a given time which is a random variable similarly in the case a random field f x y t f denotes its value at a given location and at a given time 19 z a η η 0 u v w t w η 0 η x η y u t v t as the different kinematic variables are obtained from linear transformations of η the random vector z a is gaussian the mean vector of z a is zero the coefficients of its covariance matrix σ z a may be computed as 20 σ z a k l π π d θ 0 d ω re h k ω θ h l ω θ g ω θ where h k resp h l is the complex transfer function whose input and output are respectively the sea surface elevation η and the k th resp l th variable of the random vector z a h l denotes the complex conjugate of h l the linear wave theory yields the following transfer functions following the complex notation adopted in eq 4 21 h η ω θ 1 h u ω θ cos θ g k ω ω h v ω θ sin θ g k ω ω h w t ω θ ω 2 h w ω θ i ω h η x ω θ i cos θ k ω h η y ω θ i sin θ k ω h u t ω θ i cos θ g k ω h v t ω θ i sin θ g k ω in the linear wave model the horizontal acceleration components and slope components are linearly related through 22 u t v t g η x η y hence two of these four variables should be discarded when considering the joint normal distribution of kinematic variables otherwise the covariance matrix would be singular in the subsequent development u t and v t are discarded and the remaining variables are collected in a reduced vector 23 z η η 0 u v w t w η 0 η x η y besides the transfer functions of eq 21 are either real or imaginary which implies that z can be split in two independent gaussian vectors 24 x η η 0 u v w t and 25 y w η 0 η x η y whose covariance matrices are given by expressions of the form of eq 20 in terms of probability density function the above considerations translate into 26 f z η u v w t w η x η y f x η u v w t f y w η x η y where f z f x f y are the respective multivariate normal density functions of the gaussian vectors z x and y case of infinite water depth with frequency direction separation in the case of infinite water depth the dispersion relation simplifies into 27 k ω 2 g then by further assuming the independence of wave direction and frequency distributions eq 6 the covariance matrix of the vectors x and y can be expressed in terms of wave spectrum moments 28 29 in eqs 28 29 m p denotes the p th moment of the wave frequency spectrum see eq 15 and α p q are numerical factors accounting for the directional spreading of waves 30 α p q π π d θ d θ cos p θ sin q θ 3 2 conditional distribution given up crossing let z ˇ and x ˇ denote respectively the random vectors containing the variables of z and x except for η η 0 the conditional density function of z ˇ given that η 0 t is up crossing the level a can be written as see for example lindgren 2012 31 f z ˇ η 0 t a w f z ˇ η a 0 ξ f w η a ξ d ξ w 0 where f z ˇ η a and f w η a are the conditional density functions of z ˇ and w η 0 given η a taking advantage of the independence of the vectors x and y eq 31 may also be written 32 f z ˇ η 0 t a f x ˇ η a w f y 0 ξ f w ξ d ξ w 0 where f x ˇ η a is the conditional density function of x ˇ given η a which is gaussian and f w is the non conditional density function of w the normalisation factor appearing in eq 32 can be readily calculated yielding 33 f z ˇ η 0 t a 2 π m 2 f x ˇ η a w f y w 0 3 3 up crossing frequency the average up crossing frequency of the level z a by the sea surface elevation is given by rice s formula rice 1945 34 μ 0 a 0 ξ f η w a ξ d ξ where f η w is the non conditional bivariate density function of η and w in the present case where the considered stochastic process η 0 t is gaussian the up crossing frequency can be further expressed as 35 μ 0 a 1 2 π m 2 m 0 exp a 2 2 m 0 3 4 illustrative examples this subsection illustrates the effect of the up crossing conditioning on the distribution of the wave kinematic variables the water depth is assumed to be infinite three different sea states are considered these sea states have the same wave frequency distribution see section 2 3 but have a different wave direction distribution following eqs 8 9 10 as a result from one case to another the non conditional covariance matrices of the kinematic variables σ x and σ y differ only through the coefficients α p q see eqs 28 29 the numerical values of these coefficients obtained for each considered sea state are reported in table 1 the numerical values of the first five wave spectrum moments also necessary to compute σ x and σ y have been reported in eq 16 3 4 1 unidirectional sea state as a first illustrative example fig 2 shows the univariate density functions of the different variables given up crossing for a material point standing at an altitude a h s 4 in a unidirectional sea state see eq 8 the kinematic variables have been nondimensionalised so that the density functions reported in fig 2 do not depend on the actual values of h s and t p for testing purpose these conditional univariate distributions have been computed by using two different methods 1 analytical calculation by successive integration of the multivariate density function given in eq 33 the detailed expressions of the resulting univariate density functions are reported in appendix a 1 2 level crossing detection in monte carlo realisations of the sea state following the random phase amplitude model briefly described in section 2 1 for each realisation complex wave amplitudes see eq 5 are drawn randomly and the corresponding free surface elevation is obtained from eq 4 the other kinematic variables η x w w t u u t are computed from expressions similar to eq 4 where the appropriate complex amplitudes are obtained by using the transfer functions given in eq 21 to compute the time sequence of the different variables the fast fourier transform has been advantageously used see for example 5 6 in lindgren et al 2013 for the results reported in fig 2 1000 sea state realisations were simulated each of them over a physical duration of 1 0 4 t p leading to the detection of 7 348 281 up crossings in total both methods show an excellent agreement on the distributions besides the monte carlo empirical up crossing frequency is also in good agreement with the analytical expression eq 35 which yields using the frequency moments given in eq 16 the numerical value μ 0 a h s 4 0 735 t p note that the monte carlo approach is numerically demanding since the total number of detected up crossings should be quite large to reach a reasonable statistical precision especially in the tails of the distributions the present calculation required a total cpu time of about one hour on a personal computer in order to check the analytical developments provided throughout the present paper monte carlo simulations were also used to estimate the results reported in fig 3 conditional distributions given up crossing for a material point at rest in a multidirectional sea state fig 4 up crossing frequency as a function of forward speed and fig 5 conditional distributions given up crossing for a material point with forward motion the agreement between analytical and numerical results was good however for reasons of clarity monte carlo results are not shown in figs 3 4 5 the nature of the different conditional univariate distributions shown in fig 2 is as follows the vertical component of the fluid velocity w given up crossing follows a rayleigh distribution of mode m 2 the univariate distributions of u and w t given up crossing are normal see appendix a 1 1 the univariate distributions of u t and η x which are linearly related through eq 22 given up crossing result from the convolution of a normal distribution with a rayleigh distribution see appendix a 1 2 the analytical expressions of these distributions see appendix a 1 show that a change in the assumed crossing level here a h s 4 has been assumed would affect the conditional distributions of u and w t only through their mean value see appendix a 1 1 the conditional distributions of w u t and η x do not depend on the value of the crossing level a 3 4 2 multidirectional sea states to illustrate the effect of wave directional spreading the bivariate density functions of the horizontal velocity components u v the horizontal acceleration components u t v t and the slope components η x η y given up crossing are shown in fig 3 two different direction distributions are considered anisotropic and isotropic d 2 and d 3 defined in eqs 9 10 the univariate distributions of the vertical components of the fluid velocity and acceleration w and w t given up crossing are not sensitive to the direction distribution of random waves see appendix a 1 along with eq 28 therefore they are identical to the ones shown in fig 2 and are not reproduced in fig 3 for both considered sea states the symmetry of the direction distribution about the y 0 plane translates into α 11 α 01 0 see table 1 the nullity of α 11 implies that the variables u u t η x respectively do not depend on v v t η y when non conditioned see eqs 28 29 besides the nullity of α 01 implies that v v t η y do not depend neither on η nor on w therefore their univariate distributions are not affected by the level crossing conditioning it also implies that the level crossing conditioning does not alter the independence of the pairs u v u t v t η x η y then their conditional bivariate density functions are equal to the product of the respective conditional univariate density functions in the case of the isotropic sea state d 3 two additional remarkable properties can be noted α 10 0 and α 20 α 02 then the random variables u u t η x v v t η y are not affected by the level crossing conditioning due to α 10 α 01 0 moreover u u t η x have the same variance as v v t η y due to α 20 α 02 this explains why the corresponding isodensity contours shown as dashed lines in fig 3 are centred circles in the case of the anisotropic sea state u non conditionally depends on η correlation coefficient 0 94 and u t η x non conditionally depend on w correlation coefficients 0 92 and 0 92 respectively the random variable u given up crossing follows a normal distribution with a non zero mean and a reduced variance see eqs a 2 a 3 in appendix the conditional variance of u is smaller than the one of v although it is the opposite for non conditional variances the egglike shape of the isodensity contours of the conditional bivariate distributions of u t v t and η x η y is due to the conditional univariate distributions of u t and η x being the convolution of a normal distribution with a rayleigh distribution see appendix a 1 2 4 body with horizontal motion the present section analytically investigates the effect of doppler shift on stochastic up crossing when the considered material point has a forward speed in the reference frame of the mean flow the section 4 1 is a preamble where the concepts of encounter wave frequency and encounter wave spectrum are briefly reminded the new up crossing condition is defined in section 4 2 the following paragraph section 4 3 introduces an extra kinematic variable that need to be considered in the problem along with the related non conditional distribution then the general expression of the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing is specified in section 4 4 the related up crossing frequency is considered in section 4 5 the section ends with illustrative examples section 4 6 4 1 encounter wave frequency and encounter wave spectrum encounter wave frequency the material point is now assumed to move at a constant speed v s which may be positive or negative in a plane parallel to the mean free surface at a given altitude z a the heading of the material point ψ is measured relative to the x axis of the frame in which the problem is formulated see fig 1 the encounter frequency between the moving body and a water wave of angular frequency ω propagating along a direction θ can be expressed as 36 ω ω θ ω v s cos ψ θ k ω where k ω is the dispersion relation for v s cos ψ θ 0 waves approach from behind and two different intrinsic wave frequencies may give the same encounter frequency when v s cos ψ θ ω k the material point catches up with the water waves and the encounter frequency becomes negative encounter wave spectrum the two dimensional encounter wave spectrum is then given by 37 g ω θ ω ω ω θ r 1 r ω θ g ω r ω θ θ where ω ω is the jacobian related to the variable substitution r ω θ is the number of distinct intrinsic frequencies corresponding to the encounter frequency ω for a given direction θ or stated differently r is the number of real solutions of eq 36 when ω is the unknown for a given water depth h a given heading ψ and a given forward speed v s the number of solutions may be 0 1 or 2 depending on the values of ω and θ when two solutions exist the two corresponding contributions of the intrinsic wave spectrum have to be summed which explains the summation operator in eq 37 if the water depth is finite the jacobian ω ω has no simple closed form expression when infinite water depth can be assumed the jacobian reads 38 ω ω ω θ 1 4 cos ψ θ ω ω s 1 2 with 39 ω s g v s eq 37 shows that the motion induced doppler shift has a non trivial effect on the encounter wave spectrum however as it is developed below the computation of the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing does not require the explicit use of the encounter spectrum g hence the properties of the encounter spectrum are not further investigated here more details on this subject can be found in lindgren et al 1999 4 2 up crossing condition when the material point moves at a constant velocity in a horizontal plane a water entry event stands for the up crossing of the level a by the stochastic process 40 η s t η x 0 v s cos ψ t y 0 v s sin ψ t t where x 0 y 0 is the position of the body at t 0 4 3 non conditional distribution of kinematic variables as η x y t is a gaussian field stationary in time and homogeneous in space η s t is a stationary gaussian process its variance density spectrum corresponds to the encounter wave frequency spectrum 41 s ω π π d θ g ω θ the time derivative of this stochastic process η s t may be physically interpreted as the velocity of the free surface elevation measured in the reference frame of the moving material point besides as the material point moves in a horizontal plane the vertical velocity and acceleration of the fluid particles is the same when measured in the reference frame of the mean flow and the reference frame of the moving material point as a consequence for a moving material point η s is not equal to the vertical component of the fluid velocity to the leading order this point is further discussed in section 5 2 then compared to the case of a material point at rest see section 3 1 eq 23 it is necessary to introduce η s as an extra variable in the considered random vector of kinematic variables 42 z s η η s u v w t w η x η y η s the different kinematic variables collected in z s are measured at the instant location of the moving material point at a given time the components of the fluid velocity and acceleration u v w w t u t v t the last two variables are absent from z s due to their linear relationship with η x and η y see eq 22 are still measured in the reference frame of the mean flow as the extra component η s results from a linear transformation of η the random vector z s is gaussian its mean vector is zero the transfer functions of the first 7 components are still given by eq 21 while the transfer function of η s can be expressed as 43 h η s ω θ i ω ω θ as h η s is imaginary it is again possible to split the random vector z s into two independent gaussian random vectors a first vector x whose components and covariance matrix remain the same see eqs 24 28 a second vector y s which includes the additional random variable η s compared to the vector y defined in eq 25 44 y s w η x η y η s y s is a zero mean gaussian vector whose covariance matrix σ y s has an expression of the form of eq 20 the non conditional probability density function of kinematic variables can be expressed as 45 f z s η u v w t w η x η y η s f x η u v w t f y s w η x η y η s where f y s is the probability density function of y s the covariance matrix of y s may be further expressed as 46 where m 2 denotes the 2nd order moment of the encounter wave spectrum 47 m 2 π π d θ d ω ω 2 g ω θ π π d θ 0 d ω ω ω θ 2 g ω θ m 1 1 is defined as 48 m 1 1 π π d θ 0 d ω ω ω ω θ g ω θ and τ p q is defined as 49 τ p q π π d θ cos p θ sin q θ 0 d ω g k ω ω ω θ g ω θ eq 47 gives two alternative expressions depending on which wave spectrum g or g is used for the integration conversely m 1 1 and τ p q cannot be readily expressed in terms of encounter spectrum because ω may not be an injective function of ω for a given angle θ see section 4 1 from eqs 46 47 48 49 it appears that the computation of σ y s does not require the use of the encounter spectrum g the knowledge of σ y s is sufficient to compute the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing and the related up crossing frequency hence as anticipated in section 4 1 the explicit computation of the encounter spectrum g is not required for the present matter case of infinite water depth with frequency direction separation if the water depth is infinite and the wave frequency direction distributions are independent eqs 47 48 49 can be further expressed as 50 m 1 1 m 2 β 1 ω s m 3 51 τ 10 α 10 m 3 cos ψ α 20 sin ψ α 11 m 4 ω s 52 τ 01 α 01 m 3 cos ψ α 11 sin ψ α 02 m 4 ω s 53 m 2 m 2 2 β 1 ω s m 3 β 2 ω s 2 m 4 where the coefficients β 1 and β 2 are given by 54 β 1 π π d θ cos θ ψ d θ cos ψ α 10 sin ψ α 01 and 55 β 2 π π d θ cos 2 θ ψ d θ 1 2 1 cos 2 ψ α 20 α 02 2 sin 2 ψ α 11 4 4 conditional distribution given up crossing adopting similar notations as in section 3 2 let z ˇ s resp x ˇ denote the random vector containing the variables of z s resp x except for η s η the conditional density function of z ˇ s given that η s t is up crossing the level a reads 56 f z ˇ s η s t a η s f z ˇ s η a 0 d ξ ξ f η s η a ξ η s 0 which may also be written as 57 f z ˇ s η s t a 2 π m 2 f x ˇ η a η s f y s η s 0 when comparing the case of a fixed material point see section 3 and the case of a moving material point present section up crossings are checked for two different stochastic processes η 0 t and η s t respectively hence the population sampled from up crossing conditioning is also different a priori however the random vector x ˇ depends solely on the variable η s but not on the variable η s here it is important to differentiate the stochastic process η s t from the random variable η s which is the value of η s t at a given time as the probabilistic properties of η s are the same as those of η 0 including its dependency relation with x ˇ the conditional distribution of x ˇ given up crossing turns out to be unaffected by the horizontal motion of the material point it depends solely on the crossing level a conversely the random vector y defined in eq 25 does not depend on η s but depends on η s whose probabilistic properties are affected by the velocity v s and heading ψ of the material point hence the conditional distribution of y given up crossing is found to be affected by the horizontal motion of the material point which reflects the fact that the underlying sampled population is indeed statistically different when the material is given a horizontal motion see section 4 6 for illustrative examples 4 5 up crossing frequency similarly to eq 35 the up crossing frequency for a material point moving at a constant speed is given by 58 μ s 1 2 π m 2 m 0 exp a 2 2 m 0 case of infinite water depth with frequency direction separation if the water depth is infinite and the wave frequency direction distributions are independent eqs 39 53 may be combined to express m 2 as follows 59 m 2 m 2 2 m 3 g β 1 v s m 4 g 2 β 2 v s 2 from eq 59 it appears that for a given sea state and given heading m 2 is a quadratic function of v s which reaches a minimum value 60 m 2 min m 2 m 3 2 m 4 β 1 2 β 2 for a velocity 61 v s min g m 3 m 4 β 1 β 2 the corresponding minimum up crossing frequency can be readily obtained by substituting eq 60 into eq 58 when the ship velocity becomes much larger than the phase velocity of waves the up crossing frequency tends to the asymptote 62 where μ s becomes linearly dependent on v s physically it corresponds to a situation where the wave field can be considered as frozen at a given time 4 6 illustrative examples figs 4 5 illustrate how the up crossing frequency and the related conditional distribution of kinematic variables are affected by the forward speed of the material point five different configurations are considered they are listed in table 2 the considered sea states are the same as in section 3 4 compared to the case of a material point at rest the consideration of forward motion required to introduce the additional kinematic variable η s along with four additional covariance coefficients see section 4 3 for infinite water depth as assumed in the present examples eqs 50 to 55 provide closed form expressions for these four additional covariance coefficients as functions of frequency moments m p coefficients α p q and material point heading ψ for the assumed spectrum shape the numerical values of the first five frequency moments are given in eq 16 the numerical values of the coefficients α p q for the different direction distributions have been reported in table 1 4 6 1 up crossing frequency fig 4 shows the evolution of the up crossing frequency μ s as a function of the velocity of the material point v s for the different configurations listed in table 2 as the wave frequency spectrum s ω is the same for the five configurations all the curves intersect at v s 0 indeed when the material point is at rest the up crossing frequency is not sensitive to the directional spreading of the sea state in all cases the function μ s v s shows a minimum whose coordinates are given by eqs 58 60 61 all curves are symmetrical about the vertical axis passing through their minimum which reflects the fact that μ s v s is the square root of a quadratic function see eqs 58 60 for the configurations c 4 c 5 the minimum up crossing frequency is obtained for v s 0 this is due to the symmetry of the wave direction distribution about the direction perpendicular to the material point heading which implies β 1 0 resulting in v s min 0 see eq 61 the minimum up crossing frequency is strictly greater than zero for all considered configurations which is related to two different effects first the dispersion relation of water waves implies that individual waves of different frequencies propagate with different phase speeds then a material moving at a constant velocity cannot maintain a constant position relative to all individual waves in the present illustrative examples an infinite water depth has been assumed the effect of wave dispersion would be much reduced in shallow water second the projections of wave propagation speeds along the material point heading are further scattered by the directional spreading of waves this second effect is accounted for in eq 60 by the factor β 1 2 β 2 this factor is equal to 1 for a unidirectional sea except for a material moving exactly abeam a unidirectional sea degenerate case where the up crossing frequency does not depend on the forward speed and less than 1 otherwise then for a given frequency spectrum s ω the smallest possible minimum up crossing frequency is obtained for a unidirectional sea which is consistent with the results reported in fig 4 in the case of the unidirectional sea c 1 it is also interesting to note that the minimum up crossing frequency is reached for v s min c p the former being the phase velocity corresponding to the peak of the wave frequency spectrum this velocity ordering is due to the contribution of short waves in the tail of the assumed jonswap spectrum finally when v s c p the ordering of the asymptotic slopes obtained for the different configurations can be understood from eq 62 as the wave frequency spectrum s ω is the same in all considered cases the difference in the asymptotic slopes is governed by the geometrical factor β 2 for the five configurations considered here c 1 to c 5 the respective geometrical factors can be analytically computed by using eq 55 and table 1 which gives β 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 4 6 2 kinematic variables which are not affected by the speed of advance the conditional distribution of the kinematic variables u v w t given up crossing is not affected by the horizontal motion of the material point but depends solely on its altitude a see section 4 4 for an explanation therefore the effect of level crossing conditioning on these variables is identical to the one illustrated in section 3 4 for the three considered wave direction distributions d 1 d 2 d 3 4 6 3 kinematic variables which are affected by the speed of advance among the kinematic variables considered in the present paper the conditional distributions of w η x η y u t and v t given up crossing are affected by the speed of advance of the material point through their dependence on η s see sections 4 3 4 4 conversely they do not depend on the assumed altitude of the material point a fig 5 illustrates the effect of the forward speed on the conditional distributions of these five kinematic variables given up crossing for the five configurations listed in table 2 the random variable η s given up crossing follows a rayleigh distribution with a mode equal to m 2 see eq 53 this distribution is not represented in fig 5 but the value of its mode computed for the different considered configurations is reported in table 3 as the up crossing frequency depends on v s solely through the term m 2 see eq 58 the curves shown in fig 4 can be used as a direct proxy up to a numerical factor for the evolution of the mode m 2 as a function of v s conversely when v s 0 the velocity of the free surface elevation measured in the reference frame of the mean flow η t w given up crossing is not rayleigh distributed anymore indeed the moving material point may cross the sloped free surface even though the sea elevation η is locally decreasing instead the conditional distribution of w given up crossing results from the convolution of a rayleigh distribution with a normal distribution see appendix a 2 1 the evolution of the conditional bivariate density function of u t v t as a function of v s follows the one of η x η y in a symmetric way since these variables are linearly related through eq 22 the effect of the forward speed on the bivariate distribution of η x η y given up crossing is discussed below individually for the different considered configurations configuration c 1 unidirectional sea as the sea is assumed to be unidirectional along the x axis the variables v t and η y are identically zero the distributions of η x u t and w given up crossing are all significantly affected by the forward speed of the material point in the asymptotic case where v s c p the conditional distribution of η x given up crossing converges towards a rayleigh distribution of mode m 4 g while in the limit v s c p this is η x which converges towards the same rayleigh distribution mathematically this asymptotic behaviour can be explained as follows the material point heading is ψ 0 and all waves propagate in the direction θ 0 then the transfer function of η s is asymptotically equivalent to 63 leading to the equivalence relation 64 as the conditional distribution of η s given up crossing is of rayleigh type eq 64 explains the asymptotic behaviour of the conditional distribution of η x from a physical viewpoint eq 64 reflects the fact that the free surface can be considered as frozen at a given time when v s in practice fig 5 shows that for v s c p 4 resp v s c p 3 η x resp η x is already very close to be rayleigh distributed configurations c 2 c 4 material point moving in a short crested anisotropic sea with different headings in the configurations c 2 c 3 c 4 the material point is moving in a short crested anisotropic sea with a heading different for each configuration when v s c p 1 the asymptotic behaviour is reminiscent of the one discussed for configuration c 1 in this asymptotic regime the free surface may be again considered as frozen except for waves propagating exactly abeam i e with directions satisfying cos ψ θ 0 let η ℓ denote the wave slope measured along the direction of motion of the material point the transfer function of η ℓ is given by 65 h η ℓ ω θ sgn v s i cos θ ψ k ω while the transfer function of η s is asymptotically equivalent to 66 which induces 4 4 the only exception would the degenerate situation where all waves propagate exactly abeam with cos θ ψ 0 leading to η ℓ 0 and η s η regardless of the value of v s 67 as a consequence the univariate distribution of η ℓ given up crossing converges to a rayleigh distribution this explains the shift of the bivariate density function of η x η y towards the direction of motion as v s increases fig 5 middle column for the heading ψ 0 configuration c 2 η y is independent of η s which implies that the distribution of η y is not affected by the level crossing conditioning it remains a centred normal distribution besides η y and η x non conditioned are independent variables since α 11 0 see section 3 1 and table 1 then the combination of these two features implies that η x and η y given up crossing are also independent the univariate distribution of η x given up crossing results from the convolution of a rayleigh distribution with a normal distribution see appendix a 2 1 for headings ψ π 4 π 2 configurations c 3 and c 4 η x and η y both depend on η s then the bivariate density function of η x η y given up crossing takes a more complicated form whose analytical expression is detailed in appendix a 2 2 although η x and η y non conditioned are independent the level crossing conditioning introduces a dependence for the configuration c 4 only positive velocities are considered because of the symmetry of this configuration a change of sign in v s would have no effect on the distribution of w and would change the bivariate density functions of the pairs η x η y and u t v t into their reflexion through the x axis configuration c 5 isotropic sea in an isotropic wave field the bivariate density function of η x η y given up crossing does not depend on the heading of the material point except for a rotation since the problem has been formulated in a frame which is not aligned with the direction of motion in the present example ψ 0 has been assumed note also that for all density functions shown in fig 5 configuration c 5 only positive forward speeds have been assumed a change of sign in v s would have no effect on the distribution of w and would simply change the bivariate density functions of η x η y and u t v t into their reflexion through the y axis the conditional density function of η x η y shifts towards the direction of motion as v s increases this tendency can be understood in the same way as explained above for configurations c 2 c 4 similarly to configuration c 2 in configuration c 5 η x and η y given up crossing are independent variables 5 discussion about the use of the stochastic model in the context of slamming the conditional distribution of wave kinematic variables given free surface up crossing may be of practical interest for questions related to the resulting water entry events one application may be the prediction of the slamming load distribution for the design of a marine structure which will be exposed to wave impacts this possible application was a motive for the choice of kinematic variables considered in the present study see section 2 4 the present section discusses the use of the stochastic framework introduced in sections 3 4 for applications related to slamming first the different combinations of kinematic variables which may be considered are discussed in section 5 1 in the light of existing studies on stochastic slamming in irregular waves then section 5 2 explains how the velocity and acceleration components of the fluid may be expressed in a local frame relevant for the water entry problem section 5 3 briefly mentions the possibility of taking into account seakeeping motions in the stochastic analysis finally the potential need to take into account the temporal evolution of kinematic variables during water entry events and how it may be implemented is discussed in section 5 4 5 1 considered kinematic variables the normal component relative to the free surface of the fluid velocity is the most decisive variable when addressing the question of slamming loads on a marine structure in many stochastic approaches it is the only considered random variable the slamming loads being assumed to be weakly dependent on the other kinematic variables see for example ochi and motter 1973 rassinot and mansour 1995 wang et al 2002 hermundstad and moan 2007 dessi and ciappi 2013 wang and guedes soares 2016 helmers et al 2012 implemented a more comprehensive stochastic approach where the conditional joint distribution of four kinematic variables vertical velocity vertical acceleration wave slope and seakeeping heel angle was used to estimate the probability distribution of impact loads on a wedge shaped body exposed to unidirectional waves with no forward speed as they used an analytical wagner type wagner 1932 water entry model computationally fast helmers et al 2012 could perform the transfer of the distribution of kinematic variables through the impact model by using a monte carlo sampling if they are identified as relevant additional kinematic variables such as the tangential velocity of the fluid see for example belik and price 1982 may be included in the stochastic analysis generally the more numerous the considered kinematic variables the more elaborate the impact model need to be the most advanced analytical models based on wagner s theory can in principle take into account all the kinematic variables considered in the present analysis see e g scolan and korobkin 2015 if the water entry model is computationally demanding e g cfd simulations as an alternative to monte carlo sampling other approaches such as metamodels or reliability methods may be used to probe the probability distribution of slamming loads and stresses 5 2 velocity and acceleration components in the local frame of the free surface when the considered solid body moves forward through the wave field some attention is required regarding the fluid motion components to be used as an input for the water entry model these components should be specified as normal and tangential relative to the local free surface for the sake of simplicity let consider a two dimensional situation it can be readily generalised to three dimensions where a material point moves through a unidirectional sea along the x axis let consider an up crossing event where the material point crosses the free surface at a point c and let define a local fixed frame c t n where the vectors t and n are locally tangent and normal to the free surface at up crossing the situation is sketched in fig 6 to the leading order consistent with the order of approximation of the linear wave model the relative fluid velocity in the local frame c t n reads 68 v r u v s v t t v s η x w v n n note that the term v s η x should not be neglected since v s may be significantly larger than the magnitude of w even for vessels with moderate speeds hence to the leading order the relative normal velocity of the fluid is equal to the relative velocity of the free surface elevation 69 v n v s η x w η s from a physical standpoint the relation v n η s can be interpreted as the kinematic free surface condition expressed to the leading order in the reference frame of the moving material point regarding the relative fluid acceleration its components in the local fixed frame c t n to the leading order read 70 a r u t a t t w t a n n where the assumption that the material point moves with a constant velocity has been taken into account contrary to the result obtained for the velocity to the leading order the normal component of the fluid acceleration does not equal the acceleration rate of the free surface elevation measured in the frame of the moving material point 5 3 accounting for seakeeping motions the present study focused on the effect of the forward velocity on the up crossing frequency and the related conditional distribution of kinematic variables accounting for seakeeping motions in the present stochastic analysis would present no specific difficulties as long as the seakeeping motions are linearly modelled the way forward to include seakeeping motions in the present stochastic approach is described in appendix b 5 4 time evolution of kinematic variables during the water entry when considering the level crossing problem in the context of slamming another important question is whether the wave kinematics can be considered as fixed during the slamming event indeed the present study focused on the joint distribution of kinematic variables at the free surface crossing without considering the subsequent evolution of kinematic variables kinematic variables may be considered as fixed if the characteristic time of the slamming event t s is much smaller than the characteristic encounter period of impacting waves which may be translated into 71 ω t s 1 the characteristic slamming time t s may be roughly estimated as the characteristic height of the exposed structure h e divided by the characteristic impact velocity 72 t s h e h ω 2 where h is the characteristic height of impacting waves the combination of eqs 71 72 shows that kinematic variables may be considered as fixed during the impact event if the vertical extension of the body part exposed to slamming is much smaller than the characteristic height of impacting waves this may be typically the case for appendages such as stabilising fins on a ship or diving planes on a surfaced submarine assuming fixed kinematic variables may be also justified for larger bodies if the early stage of the water entry can be considered as the most relevant with regard to hydrodynamic loads this may be typically the case for blunt bodies such as for example a bulbous bow or the sections of a flat bottomed ship conversely if the late stage of the wave impact and or the subsequent water exit phase needs to be investigated the subsequent time evolution of kinematic variables need to be considered for each event this time evolution is stochastic by nature the realisation of stochastic trajectories following up crossing events may be obtained by means of monte carlo experiments which may be computationally demanding these monte carlo experiments may be performed by using two different approaches i the full realisation of a sea state from which stochastic trajectories of water entries are extracted after up crossing detections ii the realisation of short sea state sequences starting directly from initial up crossing conditions which are drawn from the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing the option ii may prove numerically much more efficient especially when considering rare events for instance if the body is far from the mean sea level or if a focus on extreme wave impacts is needed this option would also offer more flexibility to implement variance reduction techniques such as importance sampling the subsequent evolution of kinematic variables starting from random initial conditions may be accounted for in a simplified deterministic manner helmers et al 2012 used such an approach to compute the time evolution of the free surface elevation η 0 after up crossing starting from random initial up crossing conditions for η 0 and η 0 and assuming that the third time derivative η 0 is equal to its conditional mean given the instantaneous value of the first time derivative η 0 these authors obtained a deterministic expression for η 0 as the solution of a second order differential equation alternatively another option is to use regression techniques based on slepian models see e g lindgren and rychlik 1991 this latter approach would allow to also insert random intermediate conditions at intermediate timepoints after upcrossing 6 conclusions the effect of forward speed on stochastic free surface crossing has been studied in the framework of the linear wave model the present study has focused on up crossing events i e the crossing of the free surface by the object into the water domain however the model may be readily modified to include both up crossing and down crossing events or focus on down crossing events only the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing has been shown to be significantly affected by the forward velocity of the considered material point the effect on the related up crossing frequency has been also investigated the analysis has been carried out analytically and formulae have been given for the general case of multidirectional waves in water of finite depth in the specific case where the water depth can be assumed infinite and the sea state has a two dimensional spectrum with separated frequency direction dependencies analytical developments have been furthered to express the conditional distribution of kinematic variables and the up crossing frequency in terms of wave frequency moments and non dimensional coefficients accounting for the wave directional spreading the prediction of the probability distribution of slamming loads on a ship may be a particular application of the present stochastic model the considered solid body has to be small compared to water wave wavelengths so the present theory can be used this condition may be fulfilled for small crafts or specific structures on large ships e g appendages bulbous bow ship sections the way forward to include seakeeping motions in the analysis has been briefly sketched in appendix different possible approaches to perform the transfer of the probability distribution of kinematic variables through a water entry model

gives explicit analytical expressions for the conditional density functions of kinematic variables given that η 0 t up crosses the level a represented in figs 2 3 the free surface elevation is given η

gaussian vector z a see eq 19 either depend on η η 0 or on w η 0 or on neither none of the kinematic variables considered in section 3 depends concurrently on both η and w generic expressions for their respective univariate conditional density functions given up crossing are detailed below a 1 1 variables which depend on η i e u v w t variables which depend on η follow conditional distributions of gaussian type by denoting ζ the considered variable its conditional mean is given by a 2 e ζ η 0 t a e ζ η a cov ζ η m 0 a and its conditional variance by a 3 var ζ η 0 t a var ζ η a var ζ cov ζ η 2 m 0 where cov ζ η is the non conditional covariance of ζ and η the relevant non conditional covariances may be found in the expression of the related covariance matrix σ x see eq 28 a 1 2 variables which depend on w i e η x η y u t v t the conditional density function of a variable ξ which depends on w is given by a 4 f ξ η 0 t a ξ 0 2 π m 2 χ f ξ w ξ χ d χ where f ξ w is the non conditional bivariate density function of ξ and w it may be convenient to express f ξ η 0 t a differently as follows a 5 f ξ η 0 t a ξ 0 f w η 0 t a χ f ξ w χ ξ d χ where f w η 0 t a is given by eq a 1 and f ξ w χ is the conditional distribution of ξ given w χ then by making the change of variable a 6 z ρ σ ξ m 2 χ eq a 5 may be transformed into a 7 f ξ η 0 t a ξ 0 z ρ σ ξ 2 exp 1 2 z ρ σ ξ 2 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 σ ξ exp ξ sign ρ z 2 2 1 ρ 2 σ ξ 2 d z where σ ξ is the non conditional standard deviation of ξ and ρ cov ξ w σ ξ m 2 is the non conditional correlation coefficient between ξ and w in the case where ρ 0 eq a 7 corresponds to the convolution of a rayleigh distribution of mode ρ σ ξ and a centred normal distribution of variance 1 ρ 2 σ ξ 2 which is the conditional variance of ξ given w when ρ 0 there is a change of sign in eq a 7 then through the change of variable z z it can also be expressed as a convolution where the rayleigh distribution is replaced by its reflection about the axis z 0 eq a 7 can be further expressed as a 8 f ξ η 0 t a ξ 1 ρ 2 2 π 1 σ ξ exp ξ 2 2 1 ρ 2 σ ξ 2 1 π 2 ρ ξ 1 ρ 2 σ ξ exp ρ 2 ξ 2 2 1 ρ 2 σ ξ 2 1 erf ρ ξ 2 1 ρ 2 σ ξ aberg et al 2008 proposed a more compact form for this type of distribution by expressing it in terms of cumulative distribution function and making use of the standard normal distribution see lemma 5 3 in aberg et al 2008 since the density function f ξ η 0 t a can be expressed as the convolution of two elementary density functions see eq a 7 the corresponding random variable ξ η 0 t a may be comprehended as the sum or difference for negative values of ρ of two independent random variables i one being rayleigh distributed with a mode ρ σ ξ ii and the other being normally distributed with a mean equal to zero and a variance equal to 1 ρ 2 σ ξ 2 see also aberg et al 2008 lemma 5 1 the relative weight of these two components is controlled by ρ the correlation coefficient between ξ and w as expected for ρ 1 resp ρ 0 only the rayleigh component resp the normal component remains a 2 material point with translational motion this appendix section gives explicit analytical expressions for the conditional distributions given that η s t up crosses the level a represented in fig 5 the free surface elevation is given η s η a the variable η s given up crossing follows a rayleigh distribution of mode m 2 see eqs 47 59 the conditional distribution of variables which depend on η s but not on η s namely w t u v is not affected by the horizontal motion of the material point and results given in appendix a 1 1 are still valid as for the variables which depend on η s namely w u t v t η x η y the analytical expression of their conditional univariate distributions is given in appendix a 2 1 an analytical expression for the conditional bivariate distribution of two variables which depend on η s is given in appendix a 2 2 this expression has been used to plot the isodensity lines of the pairs η x η y and u t v t shown in fig 5 a 2 1 conditional distribution of a variable which depends on η s the conditional density function given up crossing of a variable ξ which depends on η s may be expressed as a 9 f ξ η s t a ξ 0 2 π m 2 χ f ξ η s ξ χ d χ which is similar to eq a 4 then in a way similar to the development given in appendix a 1 2 where the variable w should be replaced with η s f ξ η s t a may be expressed as the convolution of a rayleigh distribution and a normal distribution eqs a 7 a 8 may be readily reused with ρ now being the non conditional correlation coefficient between ξ and η s see the expression of the related covariance matrix σ y s in eq 46 a 2 2 conditional bivariate distribution of two variables which depend on η s the conditional bivariate distributions of u t v t and η x η y represented in fig 5 require to consider the case of two variables which both depend on the level crossing velocity η s in order to adopt general notations let q be a gaussian vector a 10 q q 1 q 2 q 3 where q 1 q 2 q 3 denote respectively u t or η x v t or η y and η s then the bivariate density function of q 1 and q 2 given up crossing may be expressed as a 11 g q 1 q 2 1 σ 3 1 2 π det σ q 1 2 0 d q 3 q 3 exp 1 2 q σ q 1 q where σ q is the covariance matrix of the gaussian vector q and σ 3 is the standard deviation of q 3 similarly to the explanation proposed in appendix a 1 2 the conditional bivariate distribution g may be comprehended as resulting from the sum of two independent vectors the first vector may be expressed as a 12 r ρ 13 σ 1 ρ 23 σ 2 r where ρ i j is the unconditioned correlation coefficient between the i th and j th components of the vector q σ i is the unconditioned standard deviation of the i th component of the vector q and r is a random variable which is rayleigh distributed with a mode equal to 1 the second vector is a zero mean gaussian vector whose covariance matrix is equal to the conditional covariance matrix of q 1 q 2 given q 3 after completing the square in the argument of the exponential function in eq a 11 the following closed form expression is obtained a 13 g q 1 q 2 1 σ 3 1 8 π det σ q 1 2 exp c q 1 q 2 a 33 3 2 2 a 33 π b q 1 q 2 exp b q

defined as a 16 a k l 1 2 σ q 1 k l appendix b stochastic approach including seakeeping motions including seakeeping motions in the present stochastic approach would require to consider a new stochastic process b 1 η b t η s t ζ s t where η b denotes the relative free surface elevation measured in the frame of the moving material point it is decomposed as the sum of η s t which accounts for the forward motion of the material point eq 40 and ζ s t which accounts for seakeeping motions around the average forward motion if the seakeeping motions are linearly modelled ζ s t results from a linear transformation of η s t and consequently η b t is also a gaussian process knowing the response amplitude operators of the floating platform along with the position of the material point on this platform the transfer function of ζ s can be readily expressed the variable ζ s may also account for the diffraction waves as well as the waves generated by the steady forward and unsteady motions of the vessel if the related transfer functions are known see for example hermundstad and moan 2005 2007 who include the effect of the waves generated by the forward motion of the ship in their analysis then in a way similar to eq 42 a new gaussian vector collecting the relevant kinematic variables should be defined b 2 z b η b η b z w where z w contains the kinematic variables of interest for example the kinematic variables necessary as the input of a water entry model the non conditional probability distribution of z b is a multivariate normal distribution whose covariance matrix may be expressed in the same way as eq 20 let z ˇ b denote the random vector containing the variables of z b except for η b the conditional density function of kinematic variables given up crossing can be written as b 3 f z ˇ b η b t a η b z w 2 π σ η b η b f z ˇ b η b a η b z w with η b 0 where a is the altitude of the material point on calm water and σ η b is the non conditional standard deviation of η b the related up crossing frequency reads b 4 μ b 1 2 π σ η b σ η b exp 1 2 a σ η b 2 where σ η b is the standard deviation of η b which is not equal to m 0 due to seakeeping motions 
20455,the influence of forward speed on stochastic free surface crossing in a gaussian wave field is investigated the case of a material point moving with a constant forward speed is considered the wave field is assumed stationary in time and homogeneous in space the focus is on up crossing events which are defined as the material point crossing the free surface into the water domain the effect of the doppler shift induced by the forward speed on the up crossing frequency and the related conditional joint distribution of wave kinematic variables is analytically investigated some general trends are illustrated through different examples where three kinds of wave direction distribution are considered unidirectional short crested anisotropic and isotropic the way the developed approach may be used in the context of slamming on marine structures is briefly discussed keywords water wave gaussian level crossing doppler effect forward speed slamming 1 introduction from an engineering standpoint two quantities related to the chance of free surface crossing for an object travelling in an ocean wave field may be of interest i the average frequency of crossing events ii the related joint probability distribution of wave kinematic variables given crossing the present study focuses on up crossing events which are defined as follows the free surface up crosses the object or equivalently the object down crosses the free surface into the water domain an up crossing event will lead to a water entry phenomenon which may induce significant hydrodynamic loads on the structure of the object see e g korobkin and pukhnachov 1988 faltinsen 2006 kapsenberg 2011 wang and guedes soares 2017 therefore the knowledge of i and ii may be valuable for the design of a marine structure that will be exposed to water wave impacts down crossing events i e water exit events may also be of practical interest in ship design for example to assess the risk of efficiency loss due to the partial emersion of an appendage or a propeller moreover water exit events can also generate high intensity transient hydrodynamic loads see e g baarholm and faltinsen 2004 korobkin et al 2017 breton et al 2020 the theoretical approach developed in the present paper for up crossing events may be readily transposed to down crossing events if the considered object for instance a ship appendage or a hull section is sufficiently small compared to water wave wavelengths the body geometry may be reduced to a single material point regarding the risk of free surface crossing then the problem becomes more tractable and may be addressed by using the level crossing theory of stochastic processes based on the pioneering work of rice 1944 1945 and subsequent works see for example lindgren 2012 chapter 8 and references therein when the motions of the water waves are modelled at the first order airy wave theory the randomness of the related kinematic variables can be modelled through gaussian processes then the average up crossing frequency and the related joint probability distribution of kinematic variables are both analytically tractable when the material point moves with a given forward velocity the motion induced doppler shift has a non trivial effect on the encounter wave spectrum lindgren et al 1999 investigated the effect of doppler shift on the distribution of the zero crossing wave period the time between successive mean level down and up crossings measured in the frame of a moving body but they did not consider the related conditional distribution of kinematic variables more recently aberg et al 2008 also investigated the effect of doppler shift on the distribution of some wave characteristics measured along the direction of body motion namely the wave slope waveheight and wavelength in the context of slamming on ships following the pioneering work of ochi 1964b a and ochi and motter 1971 1973 different authors investigated the stochastic properties of slamming induced loads and structural stresses including the effect of forward speed in the analysis in most studies however the vertical component of the relative fluid velocity is considered as the only kinematic variable relevant to the estimate of slamming loads see for example ochi and motter 1973 rassinot and mansour 1995 wang et al 2002 hermundstad and moan 2007 dessi and ciappi 2013 wang and guedes soares 2016 this assumption greatly simplifies the problem by reducing the conditional distribution of kinematic variables used as an input for the impact model given up crossing to a univariate distribution which is of rayleigh type in the framework of linear wave theory however this univariate approach may provide unreliable predictions since slamming loads may be sensitive to other kinematic variables e g scolan and korobkin 2015 such as the acceleration added mass effect the tangential velocity or the angular position of the object relative to the local free surface e g hascoët et al 2019 going beyond a univariate approach the early study of belik and price 1982 investigated the effect of accounting for the tangential component of the water entry velocity in the context of slamming on high speed vessels they considered only long crested unidirectional sea states and carried out their investigation through numerical experiments where the random sampling of impact kinematic variables was obtained from the numerical realisation of gaussian waves and ship responses more recently helmers et al 2012 analytically considered the joint distribution of several kinematic variables namely the fluid vertical velocity the fluid vertical acceleration the wave slope and the seakeeping roll angle to estimate the probability distribution of impact loads on a wedge shaped body exposed to irregular waves however these authors did not consider scenarii where the body has a forward speed and focused on unidirectional sea states the present study is devoted to the analytical investigation of the effect of forward speed on the conditional joint distribution of wave kinematic variables given up crossing the effect of forward motion on the related up crossing frequency is also analysed the case of a material point moving through a gaussian wave field at a constant velocity in a horizontal plane i e at a given altitude is investigated both long crested unidirectional and short crested multidirectional wave fields are considered section 2 sets the framework of the present study in section 3 the case of a body at rest is first considered as a preamble then in section 4 the effect of forward speed on the up crossing frequency and the related conditional joint distribution of kinematic variables is analytically investigated it is illustrated through a few examples section 5 briefly discusses how the developed framework may be used in the context of slamming the paper ends with a concluding summary in section 6 2 framework and assumptions the present section sets the framework of the analysis to be developed in sections 3 and 4 2 1 water waves modelled as a gaussian field in the present paper both long crested unidirectional and short crested multidirectional seas are considered let the wave motions be described in a spacetime coordinate system t x y z where the origin of the space coordinates o is a fixed point in the reference frame of the mean flow i e the reference frame where there is no mean current located on the plane of the mean free surface and z is directed along the ascending vertical see fig 1 for a sketch of the problem formulation in the most general case the free surface elevation η measured along the vertical direction z can be modelled as a stochastic process which depends on the time t and on the two horizontal space coordinates x and y if a linear wave model is assumed this stochastic process can be modelled as gaussian besides in the present study the considered sea states are assumed to be stationary in time and homogeneous in space then the gaussian process η is fully characterised in a probabilistic sense by its mean which is zero in the present case and its two dimensional one sided variance density spectrum g ω θ defined for ω 0 and θ π π where ω is the intrinsic wave angular frequency measured in the reference frame of the mean flow and θ the direction of wave propagation in the plane o x y in this framework a realisation of the random wave field may be numerically approximated as the sum of independent airy waves see e g ochi 2005 holthuijsen 2007 1 η x y t n 1 n q 1 q a n q cos ω n t k n cos θ q x k n sin θ q y ϕ n q where the frequencies and directions ω n θ q account for the discretisation of the two dimensional wave spectrum the wave amplitudes and phases a n q and ϕ n q are independent random variables the wave amplitudes a n q follow individual rayleigh distributions of modes 2 σ n q g ω n θ q δ ω n δ θ q where δ ω n and δ θ q are the sizes of frequency and direction discretisation intervals the wave phases ϕ n q are uniformly distributed over π π the wave numbers k n are related to the wave frequencies ω n through the dispersion relation 3 ω n 2 g k n tanh k n h where g is the acceleration due to gravity g 9 81 m s 2 is assumed in the present paper and h is the water depth in the following sections the transfer functions of different kinematic variables will be introduced to that end it is convenient to introduce the complex notation and express the surface elevation as 4 η x y t n 1 n q 1 q re a n q exp i ω n t k n cos θ q x k n sin θ q y where i is the imaginary unit and 5 a n q a n q exp i ϕ n q are the wave complex amplitudes in the present approach the space coordinate system x y z is eulerian a lagrangian type linear wave model could have been an attractive alternative as this kind of model has been shown to account for interesting wave features see e g gjøsund 2003 fouques et al 2006 lindgren and lindgren 2011 which are missed by the eulerian linear model e g the steepening of crests and flattening of troughs however the lagrangian approach leads to a model which is nonlinear with respect to wave amplitudes when expressed in an eulerian coordinate system even when it is restricted to the first order this nonlinear feature would have hindered the analytical developments to be set out in sections 3 4 2 2 wave direction distribution most equations developed in sections 3 4 assume that the frequency and direction dependencies in the two dimensional spectrum can be separated as follows 6 g ω θ d θ s ω in the above equation s is the frequency spectrum and d is a normalised function defined for θ π π and satisfying 7 π π d θ d θ 1 this frequency direction separation is assumed in order to further analytical developments however it is not theoretically restrictive and formulae valid in the general case where this assumption would not hold are always introduced beforehand in the different illustrative examples given below three different types of wave direction distribution are considered 1 unidirectional sea state with a spreading function given by 8 d 1 θ δ θ where δ denotes the dirac delta function following this distribution all waves propagate in the direction of increasing x coordinate 2 multidirectional anisotropic sea state with a spreading function given by 9 3 isotropic sea state with a spreading function 10 d 3 θ 1 2 π θ π π 2 3 spectral shape in the illustrative examples reported below the considered sea states are assumed to have a jonswap frequency spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 11 s ω n 0 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 with 12 h s is the significant wave height and ω p is the peak angular frequency of the spectrum γ is a parameter which controls the magnitude of the peak of the spectrum relative to its high frequency tail in all examples it is set to its typical value γ 3 3 the normalisation factor n 0 is such that 13 h s 2 16 0 s ω d ω besides the wave spectrum is truncated at low and high frequencies in order to discard excessively long and short waves 1 of wave variance which is proportional to wave energy is truncated at the low frequency and high frequency ends in total 2 of wave energy is disregarded 1 1 this assumption is not critical for the theoretical developments which follow another truncation level may have been adopted however note that the truncation of the high frequency end will matter when coming to practical applications such as the study of wave induced slamming loads in such applications the exposed part of the solid body should be sufficiently small compared to water wave wavelengths so that it can be modelled as a single material point regarding the risk of free surface crossing the normalisation of the spectrum following eq 13 is performed before the truncation for γ 3 3 this leads to a low frequency cutoff ω min 0 74 ω p and a high frequency cutoff ω max 3 0 ω p the average zero crossing wave period is given by 14 t z 2 π m 0 m 2 where m p denotes the p th moment of the wave spectra 15 m p 0 ω p s ω d ω following these assumptions about the spectral shape the numerical values of the first five moments are 16 m 0 0 0613 h s 2 m 1 0 0720 h s 2 ω p m 2 0 0918 h s 2 ω p 2 m 3 0 130 h s 2 ω p 3 m 4 0 208 h s 2 ω p 4 2 4 considered kinematic variables in sections 3 and 4 analytical formulae will be provided for the joint probability distribution of wave kinematic variables given up crossing the variables considered in the present study are the following η x y t the free surface elevation u x y t v x y t the horizontal components of the fluid velocity in the plane z 0 along the x axis and y axis respectively u t x y t v t x y t the components of the fluid acceleration in the plane z 0 along x axis and y axis respectively 2 2 in the present paper q v denotes the derivative of the function q with respect to the variable v w x y t the vertical component of the fluid velocity in the plane z 0 in the linear wave model w η t w t x y t the vertical component of the fluid acceleration in the plane z 0 η x x y t η y x y t the slope components of the free surface along x axis and y axis respectively including other first order kinematic variables such as the free surface curvature in the analysis to be developed in sections 3 4 would be straightforward in the present study the first order flow velocity and acceleration components at z 0 are considered as a direct proxy for the kinematics at the free surface this assumption is in line with several stretching schemes used to alleviate the deficiencies of the linear wave theory in describing the near surface fluid kinematics for irregular sea states e g wheeler 1970 chakrabarti 1971 horng 1991 conversely other techniques such as linear extrapolation above z 0 e g xu 1995 or delta stretching rodenbusch and forristall 1986 would yield a different proxy for the fluid kinematics at the free surface the kinematic variables listed above were selected as potentially relevant for the computation of hydrodynamic loads on a marine structure see section 5 for a discussion in the context of slamming hence the considered horizontal velocity and acceleration components are those of the fluid when the interest would be on the horizontal motions of the free surface itself e g for remote sensing applications the approach developed below may still be used to compute the probability distribution of the relevant variables note however that different definitions are admissible to describe the horizontal motions of the free surface these different definitions translate into nonlinear relations involving partial derivatives of η which would complicate the computation of the resulting distributions for more details see baxevani et al 2003 3 free surface up crossing at a fixed material point 3 1 non conditional distribution of kinematic variables when the body is assumed to be at rest located at x 0 y 0 z a the wetting of the material point stands for the up crossing of the level a by the stochastic process 17 η 0 t η x 0 y 0 t whose time derivative is given by 18 η 0 t η t x 0 y 0 t the kinematic variables introduced in section 2 4 measured at the location of the material point at a given time may be gathered in a random vector 3 3 in the present paper when considering a time stochastic process p t and p are respectively used to denote the stochastic process itself and its value at a given time which is a random variable similarly in the case a random field f x y t f denotes its value at a given location and at a given time 19 z a η η 0 u v w t w η 0 η x η y u t v t as the different kinematic variables are obtained from linear transformations of η the random vector z a is gaussian the mean vector of z a is zero the coefficients of its covariance matrix σ z a may be computed as 20 σ z a k l π π d θ 0 d ω re h k ω θ h l ω θ g ω θ where h k resp h l is the complex transfer function whose input and output are respectively the sea surface elevation η and the k th resp l th variable of the random vector z a h l denotes the complex conjugate of h l the linear wave theory yields the following transfer functions following the complex notation adopted in eq 4 21 h η ω θ 1 h u ω θ cos θ g k ω ω h v ω θ sin θ g k ω ω h w t ω θ ω 2 h w ω θ i ω h η x ω θ i cos θ k ω h η y ω θ i sin θ k ω h u t ω θ i cos θ g k ω h v t ω θ i sin θ g k ω in the linear wave model the horizontal acceleration components and slope components are linearly related through 22 u t v t g η x η y hence two of these four variables should be discarded when considering the joint normal distribution of kinematic variables otherwise the covariance matrix would be singular in the subsequent development u t and v t are discarded and the remaining variables are collected in a reduced vector 23 z η η 0 u v w t w η 0 η x η y besides the transfer functions of eq 21 are either real or imaginary which implies that z can be split in two independent gaussian vectors 24 x η η 0 u v w t and 25 y w η 0 η x η y whose covariance matrices are given by expressions of the form of eq 20 in terms of probability density function the above considerations translate into 26 f z η u v w t w η x η y f x η u v w t f y w η x η y where f z f x f y are the respective multivariate normal density functions of the gaussian vectors z x and y case of infinite water depth with frequency direction separation in the case of infinite water depth the dispersion relation simplifies into 27 k ω 2 g then by further assuming the independence of wave direction and frequency distributions eq 6 the covariance matrix of the vectors x and y can be expressed in terms of wave spectrum moments 28 29 in eqs 28 29 m p denotes the p th moment of the wave frequency spectrum see eq 15 and α p q are numerical factors accounting for the directional spreading of waves 30 α p q π π d θ d θ cos p θ sin q θ 3 2 conditional distribution given up crossing let z ˇ and x ˇ denote respectively the random vectors containing the variables of z and x except for η η 0 the conditional density function of z ˇ given that η 0 t is up crossing the level a can be written as see for example lindgren 2012 31 f z ˇ η 0 t a w f z ˇ η a 0 ξ f w η a ξ d ξ w 0 where f z ˇ η a and f w η a are the conditional density functions of z ˇ and w η 0 given η a taking advantage of the independence of the vectors x and y eq 31 may also be written 32 f z ˇ η 0 t a f x ˇ η a w f y 0 ξ f w ξ d ξ w 0 where f x ˇ η a is the conditional density function of x ˇ given η a which is gaussian and f w is the non conditional density function of w the normalisation factor appearing in eq 32 can be readily calculated yielding 33 f z ˇ η 0 t a 2 π m 2 f x ˇ η a w f y w 0 3 3 up crossing frequency the average up crossing frequency of the level z a by the sea surface elevation is given by rice s formula rice 1945 34 μ 0 a 0 ξ f η w a ξ d ξ where f η w is the non conditional bivariate density function of η and w in the present case where the considered stochastic process η 0 t is gaussian the up crossing frequency can be further expressed as 35 μ 0 a 1 2 π m 2 m 0 exp a 2 2 m 0 3 4 illustrative examples this subsection illustrates the effect of the up crossing conditioning on the distribution of the wave kinematic variables the water depth is assumed to be infinite three different sea states are considered these sea states have the same wave frequency distribution see section 2 3 but have a different wave direction distribution following eqs 8 9 10 as a result from one case to another the non conditional covariance matrices of the kinematic variables σ x and σ y differ only through the coefficients α p q see eqs 28 29 the numerical values of these coefficients obtained for each considered sea state are reported in table 1 the numerical values of the first five wave spectrum moments also necessary to compute σ x and σ y have been reported in eq 16 3 4 1 unidirectional sea state as a first illustrative example fig 2 shows the univariate density functions of the different variables given up crossing for a material point standing at an altitude a h s 4 in a unidirectional sea state see eq 8 the kinematic variables have been nondimensionalised so that the density functions reported in fig 2 do not depend on the actual values of h s and t p for testing purpose these conditional univariate distributions have been computed by using two different methods 1 analytical calculation by successive integration of the multivariate density function given in eq 33 the detailed expressions of the resulting univariate density functions are reported in appendix a 1 2 level crossing detection in monte carlo realisations of the sea state following the random phase amplitude model briefly described in section 2 1 for each realisation complex wave amplitudes see eq 5 are drawn randomly and the corresponding free surface elevation is obtained from eq 4 the other kinematic variables η x w w t u u t are computed from expressions similar to eq 4 where the appropriate complex amplitudes are obtained by using the transfer functions given in eq 21 to compute the time sequence of the different variables the fast fourier transform has been advantageously used see for example 5 6 in lindgren et al 2013 for the results reported in fig 2 1000 sea state realisations were simulated each of them over a physical duration of 1 0 4 t p leading to the detection of 7 348 281 up crossings in total both methods show an excellent agreement on the distributions besides the monte carlo empirical up crossing frequency is also in good agreement with the analytical expression eq 35 which yields using the frequency moments given in eq 16 the numerical value μ 0 a h s 4 0 735 t p note that the monte carlo approach is numerically demanding since the total number of detected up crossings should be quite large to reach a reasonable statistical precision especially in the tails of the distributions the present calculation required a total cpu time of about one hour on a personal computer in order to check the analytical developments provided throughout the present paper monte carlo simulations were also used to estimate the results reported in fig 3 conditional distributions given up crossing for a material point at rest in a multidirectional sea state fig 4 up crossing frequency as a function of forward speed and fig 5 conditional distributions given up crossing for a material point with forward motion the agreement between analytical and numerical results was good however for reasons of clarity monte carlo results are not shown in figs 3 4 5 the nature of the different conditional univariate distributions shown in fig 2 is as follows the vertical component of the fluid velocity w given up crossing follows a rayleigh distribution of mode m 2 the univariate distributions of u and w t given up crossing are normal see appendix a 1 1 the univariate distributions of u t and η x which are linearly related through eq 22 given up crossing result from the convolution of a normal distribution with a rayleigh distribution see appendix a 1 2 the analytical expressions of these distributions see appendix a 1 show that a change in the assumed crossing level here a h s 4 has been assumed would affect the conditional distributions of u and w t only through their mean value see appendix a 1 1 the conditional distributions of w u t and η x do not depend on the value of the crossing level a 3 4 2 multidirectional sea states to illustrate the effect of wave directional spreading the bivariate density functions of the horizontal velocity components u v the horizontal acceleration components u t v t and the slope components η x η y given up crossing are shown in fig 3 two different direction distributions are considered anisotropic and isotropic d 2 and d 3 defined in eqs 9 10 the univariate distributions of the vertical components of the fluid velocity and acceleration w and w t given up crossing are not sensitive to the direction distribution of random waves see appendix a 1 along with eq 28 therefore they are identical to the ones shown in fig 2 and are not reproduced in fig 3 for both considered sea states the symmetry of the direction distribution about the y 0 plane translates into α 11 α 01 0 see table 1 the nullity of α 11 implies that the variables u u t η x respectively do not depend on v v t η y when non conditioned see eqs 28 29 besides the nullity of α 01 implies that v v t η y do not depend neither on η nor on w therefore their univariate distributions are not affected by the level crossing conditioning it also implies that the level crossing conditioning does not alter the independence of the pairs u v u t v t η x η y then their conditional bivariate density functions are equal to the product of the respective conditional univariate density functions in the case of the isotropic sea state d 3 two additional remarkable properties can be noted α 10 0 and α 20 α 02 then the random variables u u t η x v v t η y are not affected by the level crossing conditioning due to α 10 α 01 0 moreover u u t η x have the same variance as v v t η y due to α 20 α 02 this explains why the corresponding isodensity contours shown as dashed lines in fig 3 are centred circles in the case of the anisotropic sea state u non conditionally depends on η correlation coefficient 0 94 and u t η x non conditionally depend on w correlation coefficients 0 92 and 0 92 respectively the random variable u given up crossing follows a normal distribution with a non zero mean and a reduced variance see eqs a 2 a 3 in appendix the conditional variance of u is smaller than the one of v although it is the opposite for non conditional variances the egglike shape of the isodensity contours of the conditional bivariate distributions of u t v t and η x η y is due to the conditional univariate distributions of u t and η x being the convolution of a normal distribution with a rayleigh distribution see appendix a 1 2 4 body with horizontal motion the present section analytically investigates the effect of doppler shift on stochastic up crossing when the considered material point has a forward speed in the reference frame of the mean flow the section 4 1 is a preamble where the concepts of encounter wave frequency and encounter wave spectrum are briefly reminded the new up crossing condition is defined in section 4 2 the following paragraph section 4 3 introduces an extra kinematic variable that need to be considered in the problem along with the related non conditional distribution then the general expression of the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing is specified in section 4 4 the related up crossing frequency is considered in section 4 5 the section ends with illustrative examples section 4 6 4 1 encounter wave frequency and encounter wave spectrum encounter wave frequency the material point is now assumed to move at a constant speed v s which may be positive or negative in a plane parallel to the mean free surface at a given altitude z a the heading of the material point ψ is measured relative to the x axis of the frame in which the problem is formulated see fig 1 the encounter frequency between the moving body and a water wave of angular frequency ω propagating along a direction θ can be expressed as 36 ω ω θ ω v s cos ψ θ k ω where k ω is the dispersion relation for v s cos ψ θ 0 waves approach from behind and two different intrinsic wave frequencies may give the same encounter frequency when v s cos ψ θ ω k the material point catches up with the water waves and the encounter frequency becomes negative encounter wave spectrum the two dimensional encounter wave spectrum is then given by 37 g ω θ ω ω ω θ r 1 r ω θ g ω r ω θ θ where ω ω is the jacobian related to the variable substitution r ω θ is the number of distinct intrinsic frequencies corresponding to the encounter frequency ω for a given direction θ or stated differently r is the number of real solutions of eq 36 when ω is the unknown for a given water depth h a given heading ψ and a given forward speed v s the number of solutions may be 0 1 or 2 depending on the values of ω and θ when two solutions exist the two corresponding contributions of the intrinsic wave spectrum have to be summed which explains the summation operator in eq 37 if the water depth is finite the jacobian ω ω has no simple closed form expression when infinite water depth can be assumed the jacobian reads 38 ω ω ω θ 1 4 cos ψ θ ω ω s 1 2 with 39 ω s g v s eq 37 shows that the motion induced doppler shift has a non trivial effect on the encounter wave spectrum however as it is developed below the computation of the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing does not require the explicit use of the encounter spectrum g hence the properties of the encounter spectrum are not further investigated here more details on this subject can be found in lindgren et al 1999 4 2 up crossing condition when the material point moves at a constant velocity in a horizontal plane a water entry event stands for the up crossing of the level a by the stochastic process 40 η s t η x 0 v s cos ψ t y 0 v s sin ψ t t where x 0 y 0 is the position of the body at t 0 4 3 non conditional distribution of kinematic variables as η x y t is a gaussian field stationary in time and homogeneous in space η s t is a stationary gaussian process its variance density spectrum corresponds to the encounter wave frequency spectrum 41 s ω π π d θ g ω θ the time derivative of this stochastic process η s t may be physically interpreted as the velocity of the free surface elevation measured in the reference frame of the moving material point besides as the material point moves in a horizontal plane the vertical velocity and acceleration of the fluid particles is the same when measured in the reference frame of the mean flow and the reference frame of the moving material point as a consequence for a moving material point η s is not equal to the vertical component of the fluid velocity to the leading order this point is further discussed in section 5 2 then compared to the case of a material point at rest see section 3 1 eq 23 it is necessary to introduce η s as an extra variable in the considered random vector of kinematic variables 42 z s η η s u v w t w η x η y η s the different kinematic variables collected in z s are measured at the instant location of the moving material point at a given time the components of the fluid velocity and acceleration u v w w t u t v t the last two variables are absent from z s due to their linear relationship with η x and η y see eq 22 are still measured in the reference frame of the mean flow as the extra component η s results from a linear transformation of η the random vector z s is gaussian its mean vector is zero the transfer functions of the first 7 components are still given by eq 21 while the transfer function of η s can be expressed as 43 h η s ω θ i ω ω θ as h η s is imaginary it is again possible to split the random vector z s into two independent gaussian random vectors a first vector x whose components and covariance matrix remain the same see eqs 24 28 a second vector y s which includes the additional random variable η s compared to the vector y defined in eq 25 44 y s w η x η y η s y s is a zero mean gaussian vector whose covariance matrix σ y s has an expression of the form of eq 20 the non conditional probability density function of kinematic variables can be expressed as 45 f z s η u v w t w η x η y η s f x η u v w t f y s w η x η y η s where f y s is the probability density function of y s the covariance matrix of y s may be further expressed as 46 where m 2 denotes the 2nd order moment of the encounter wave spectrum 47 m 2 π π d θ d ω ω 2 g ω θ π π d θ 0 d ω ω ω θ 2 g ω θ m 1 1 is defined as 48 m 1 1 π π d θ 0 d ω ω ω ω θ g ω θ and τ p q is defined as 49 τ p q π π d θ cos p θ sin q θ 0 d ω g k ω ω ω θ g ω θ eq 47 gives two alternative expressions depending on which wave spectrum g or g is used for the integration conversely m 1 1 and τ p q cannot be readily expressed in terms of encounter spectrum because ω may not be an injective function of ω for a given angle θ see section 4 1 from eqs 46 47 48 49 it appears that the computation of σ y s does not require the use of the encounter spectrum g the knowledge of σ y s is sufficient to compute the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing and the related up crossing frequency hence as anticipated in section 4 1 the explicit computation of the encounter spectrum g is not required for the present matter case of infinite water depth with frequency direction separation if the water depth is infinite and the wave frequency direction distributions are independent eqs 47 48 49 can be further expressed as 50 m 1 1 m 2 β 1 ω s m 3 51 τ 10 α 10 m 3 cos ψ α 20 sin ψ α 11 m 4 ω s 52 τ 01 α 01 m 3 cos ψ α 11 sin ψ α 02 m 4 ω s 53 m 2 m 2 2 β 1 ω s m 3 β 2 ω s 2 m 4 where the coefficients β 1 and β 2 are given by 54 β 1 π π d θ cos θ ψ d θ cos ψ α 10 sin ψ α 01 and 55 β 2 π π d θ cos 2 θ ψ d θ 1 2 1 cos 2 ψ α 20 α 02 2 sin 2 ψ α 11 4 4 conditional distribution given up crossing adopting similar notations as in section 3 2 let z ˇ s resp x ˇ denote the random vector containing the variables of z s resp x except for η s η the conditional density function of z ˇ s given that η s t is up crossing the level a reads 56 f z ˇ s η s t a η s f z ˇ s η a 0 d ξ ξ f η s η a ξ η s 0 which may also be written as 57 f z ˇ s η s t a 2 π m 2 f x ˇ η a η s f y s η s 0 when comparing the case of a fixed material point see section 3 and the case of a moving material point present section up crossings are checked for two different stochastic processes η 0 t and η s t respectively hence the population sampled from up crossing conditioning is also different a priori however the random vector x ˇ depends solely on the variable η s but not on the variable η s here it is important to differentiate the stochastic process η s t from the random variable η s which is the value of η s t at a given time as the probabilistic properties of η s are the same as those of η 0 including its dependency relation with x ˇ the conditional distribution of x ˇ given up crossing turns out to be unaffected by the horizontal motion of the material point it depends solely on the crossing level a conversely the random vector y defined in eq 25 does not depend on η s but depends on η s whose probabilistic properties are affected by the velocity v s and heading ψ of the material point hence the conditional distribution of y given up crossing is found to be affected by the horizontal motion of the material point which reflects the fact that the underlying sampled population is indeed statistically different when the material is given a horizontal motion see section 4 6 for illustrative examples 4 5 up crossing frequency similarly to eq 35 the up crossing frequency for a material point moving at a constant speed is given by 58 μ s 1 2 π m 2 m 0 exp a 2 2 m 0 case of infinite water depth with frequency direction separation if the water depth is infinite and the wave frequency direction distributions are independent eqs 39 53 may be combined to express m 2 as follows 59 m 2 m 2 2 m 3 g β 1 v s m 4 g 2 β 2 v s 2 from eq 59 it appears that for a given sea state and given heading m 2 is a quadratic function of v s which reaches a minimum value 60 m 2 min m 2 m 3 2 m 4 β 1 2 β 2 for a velocity 61 v s min g m 3 m 4 β 1 β 2 the corresponding minimum up crossing frequency can be readily obtained by substituting eq 60 into eq 58 when the ship velocity becomes much larger than the phase velocity of waves the up crossing frequency tends to the asymptote 62 where μ s becomes linearly dependent on v s physically it corresponds to a situation where the wave field can be considered as frozen at a given time 4 6 illustrative examples figs 4 5 illustrate how the up crossing frequency and the related conditional distribution of kinematic variables are affected by the forward speed of the material point five different configurations are considered they are listed in table 2 the considered sea states are the same as in section 3 4 compared to the case of a material point at rest the consideration of forward motion required to introduce the additional kinematic variable η s along with four additional covariance coefficients see section 4 3 for infinite water depth as assumed in the present examples eqs 50 to 55 provide closed form expressions for these four additional covariance coefficients as functions of frequency moments m p coefficients α p q and material point heading ψ for the assumed spectrum shape the numerical values of the first five frequency moments are given in eq 16 the numerical values of the coefficients α p q for the different direction distributions have been reported in table 1 4 6 1 up crossing frequency fig 4 shows the evolution of the up crossing frequency μ s as a function of the velocity of the material point v s for the different configurations listed in table 2 as the wave frequency spectrum s ω is the same for the five configurations all the curves intersect at v s 0 indeed when the material point is at rest the up crossing frequency is not sensitive to the directional spreading of the sea state in all cases the function μ s v s shows a minimum whose coordinates are given by eqs 58 60 61 all curves are symmetrical about the vertical axis passing through their minimum which reflects the fact that μ s v s is the square root of a quadratic function see eqs 58 60 for the configurations c 4 c 5 the minimum up crossing frequency is obtained for v s 0 this is due to the symmetry of the wave direction distribution about the direction perpendicular to the material point heading which implies β 1 0 resulting in v s min 0 see eq 61 the minimum up crossing frequency is strictly greater than zero for all considered configurations which is related to two different effects first the dispersion relation of water waves implies that individual waves of different frequencies propagate with different phase speeds then a material moving at a constant velocity cannot maintain a constant position relative to all individual waves in the present illustrative examples an infinite water depth has been assumed the effect of wave dispersion would be much reduced in shallow water second the projections of wave propagation speeds along the material point heading are further scattered by the directional spreading of waves this second effect is accounted for in eq 60 by the factor β 1 2 β 2 this factor is equal to 1 for a unidirectional sea except for a material moving exactly abeam a unidirectional sea degenerate case where the up crossing frequency does not depend on the forward speed and less than 1 otherwise then for a given frequency spectrum s ω the smallest possible minimum up crossing frequency is obtained for a unidirectional sea which is consistent with the results reported in fig 4 in the case of the unidirectional sea c 1 it is also interesting to note that the minimum up crossing frequency is reached for v s min c p the former being the phase velocity corresponding to the peak of the wave frequency spectrum this velocity ordering is due to the contribution of short waves in the tail of the assumed jonswap spectrum finally when v s c p the ordering of the asymptotic slopes obtained for the different configurations can be understood from eq 62 as the wave frequency spectrum s ω is the same in all considered cases the difference in the asymptotic slopes is governed by the geometrical factor β 2 for the five configurations considered here c 1 to c 5 the respective geometrical factors can be analytically computed by using eq 55 and table 1 which gives β 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 4 6 2 kinematic variables which are not affected by the speed of advance the conditional distribution of the kinematic variables u v w t given up crossing is not affected by the horizontal motion of the material point but depends solely on its altitude a see section 4 4 for an explanation therefore the effect of level crossing conditioning on these variables is identical to the one illustrated in section 3 4 for the three considered wave direction distributions d 1 d 2 d 3 4 6 3 kinematic variables which are affected by the speed of advance among the kinematic variables considered in the present paper the conditional distributions of w η x η y u t and v t given up crossing are affected by the speed of advance of the material point through their dependence on η s see sections 4 3 4 4 conversely they do not depend on the assumed altitude of the material point a fig 5 illustrates the effect of the forward speed on the conditional distributions of these five kinematic variables given up crossing for the five configurations listed in table 2 the random variable η s given up crossing follows a rayleigh distribution with a mode equal to m 2 see eq 53 this distribution is not represented in fig 5 but the value of its mode computed for the different considered configurations is reported in table 3 as the up crossing frequency depends on v s solely through the term m 2 see eq 58 the curves shown in fig 4 can be used as a direct proxy up to a numerical factor for the evolution of the mode m 2 as a function of v s conversely when v s 0 the velocity of the free surface elevation measured in the reference frame of the mean flow η t w given up crossing is not rayleigh distributed anymore indeed the moving material point may cross the sloped free surface even though the sea elevation η is locally decreasing instead the conditional distribution of w given up crossing results from the convolution of a rayleigh distribution with a normal distribution see appendix a 2 1 the evolution of the conditional bivariate density function of u t v t as a function of v s follows the one of η x η y in a symmetric way since these variables are linearly related through eq 22 the effect of the forward speed on the bivariate distribution of η x η y given up crossing is discussed below individually for the different considered configurations configuration c 1 unidirectional sea as the sea is assumed to be unidirectional along the x axis the variables v t and η y are identically zero the distributions of η x u t and w given up crossing are all significantly affected by the forward speed of the material point in the asymptotic case where v s c p the conditional distribution of η x given up crossing converges towards a rayleigh distribution of mode m 4 g while in the limit v s c p this is η x which converges towards the same rayleigh distribution mathematically this asymptotic behaviour can be explained as follows the material point heading is ψ 0 and all waves propagate in the direction θ 0 then the transfer function of η s is asymptotically equivalent to 63 leading to the equivalence relation 64 as the conditional distribution of η s given up crossing is of rayleigh type eq 64 explains the asymptotic behaviour of the conditional distribution of η x from a physical viewpoint eq 64 reflects the fact that the free surface can be considered as frozen at a given time when v s in practice fig 5 shows that for v s c p 4 resp v s c p 3 η x resp η x is already very close to be rayleigh distributed configurations c 2 c 4 material point moving in a short crested anisotropic sea with different headings in the configurations c 2 c 3 c 4 the material point is moving in a short crested anisotropic sea with a heading different for each configuration when v s c p 1 the asymptotic behaviour is reminiscent of the one discussed for configuration c 1 in this asymptotic regime the free surface may be again considered as frozen except for waves propagating exactly abeam i e with directions satisfying cos ψ θ 0 let η ℓ denote the wave slope measured along the direction of motion of the material point the transfer function of η ℓ is given by 65 h η ℓ ω θ sgn v s i cos θ ψ k ω while the transfer function of η s is asymptotically equivalent to 66 which induces 4 4 the only exception would the degenerate situation where all waves propagate exactly abeam with cos θ ψ 0 leading to η ℓ 0 and η s η regardless of the value of v s 67 as a consequence the univariate distribution of η ℓ given up crossing converges to a rayleigh distribution this explains the shift of the bivariate density function of η x η y towards the direction of motion as v s increases fig 5 middle column for the heading ψ 0 configuration c 2 η y is independent of η s which implies that the distribution of η y is not affected by the level crossing conditioning it remains a centred normal distribution besides η y and η x non conditioned are independent variables since α 11 0 see section 3 1 and table 1 then the combination of these two features implies that η x and η y given up crossing are also independent the univariate distribution of η x given up crossing results from the convolution of a rayleigh distribution with a normal distribution see appendix a 2 1 for headings ψ π 4 π 2 configurations c 3 and c 4 η x and η y both depend on η s then the bivariate density function of η x η y given up crossing takes a more complicated form whose analytical expression is detailed in appendix a 2 2 although η x and η y non conditioned are independent the level crossing conditioning introduces a dependence for the configuration c 4 only positive velocities are considered because of the symmetry of this configuration a change of sign in v s would have no effect on the distribution of w and would change the bivariate density functions of the pairs η x η y and u t v t into their reflexion through the x axis configuration c 5 isotropic sea in an isotropic wave field the bivariate density function of η x η y given up crossing does not depend on the heading of the material point except for a rotation since the problem has been formulated in a frame which is not aligned with the direction of motion in the present example ψ 0 has been assumed note also that for all density functions shown in fig 5 configuration c 5 only positive forward speeds have been assumed a change of sign in v s would have no effect on the distribution of w and would simply change the bivariate density functions of η x η y and u t v t into their reflexion through the y axis the conditional density function of η x η y shifts towards the direction of motion as v s increases this tendency can be understood in the same way as explained above for configurations c 2 c 4 similarly to configuration c 2 in configuration c 5 η x and η y given up crossing are independent variables 5 discussion about the use of the stochastic model in the context of slamming the conditional distribution of wave kinematic variables given free surface up crossing may be of practical interest for questions related to the resulting water entry events one application may be the prediction of the slamming load distribution for the design of a marine structure which will be exposed to wave impacts this possible application was a motive for the choice of kinematic variables considered in the present study see section 2 4 the present section discusses the use of the stochastic framework introduced in sections 3 4 for applications related to slamming first the different combinations of kinematic variables which may be considered are discussed in section 5 1 in the light of existing studies on stochastic slamming in irregular waves then section 5 2 explains how the velocity and acceleration components of the fluid may be expressed in a local frame relevant for the water entry problem section 5 3 briefly mentions the possibility of taking into account seakeeping motions in the stochastic analysis finally the potential need to take into account the temporal evolution of kinematic variables during water entry events and how it may be implemented is discussed in section 5 4 5 1 considered kinematic variables the normal component relative to the free surface of the fluid velocity is the most decisive variable when addressing the question of slamming loads on a marine structure in many stochastic approaches it is the only considered random variable the slamming loads being assumed to be weakly dependent on the other kinematic variables see for example ochi and motter 1973 rassinot and mansour 1995 wang et al 2002 hermundstad and moan 2007 dessi and ciappi 2013 wang and guedes soares 2016 helmers et al 2012 implemented a more comprehensive stochastic approach where the conditional joint distribution of four kinematic variables vertical velocity vertical acceleration wave slope and seakeeping heel angle was used to estimate the probability distribution of impact loads on a wedge shaped body exposed to unidirectional waves with no forward speed as they used an analytical wagner type wagner 1932 water entry model computationally fast helmers et al 2012 could perform the transfer of the distribution of kinematic variables through the impact model by using a monte carlo sampling if they are identified as relevant additional kinematic variables such as the tangential velocity of the fluid see for example belik and price 1982 may be included in the stochastic analysis generally the more numerous the considered kinematic variables the more elaborate the impact model need to be the most advanced analytical models based on wagner s theory can in principle take into account all the kinematic variables considered in the present analysis see e g scolan and korobkin 2015 if the water entry model is computationally demanding e g cfd simulations as an alternative to monte carlo sampling other approaches such as metamodels or reliability methods may be used to probe the probability distribution of slamming loads and stresses 5 2 velocity and acceleration components in the local frame of the free surface when the considered solid body moves forward through the wave field some attention is required regarding the fluid motion components to be used as an input for the water entry model these components should be specified as normal and tangential relative to the local free surface for the sake of simplicity let consider a two dimensional situation it can be readily generalised to three dimensions where a material point moves through a unidirectional sea along the x axis let consider an up crossing event where the material point crosses the free surface at a point c and let define a local fixed frame c t n where the vectors t and n are locally tangent and normal to the free surface at up crossing the situation is sketched in fig 6 to the leading order consistent with the order of approximation of the linear wave model the relative fluid velocity in the local frame c t n reads 68 v r u v s v t t v s η x w v n n note that the term v s η x should not be neglected since v s may be significantly larger than the magnitude of w even for vessels with moderate speeds hence to the leading order the relative normal velocity of the fluid is equal to the relative velocity of the free surface elevation 69 v n v s η x w η s from a physical standpoint the relation v n η s can be interpreted as the kinematic free surface condition expressed to the leading order in the reference frame of the moving material point regarding the relative fluid acceleration its components in the local fixed frame c t n to the leading order read 70 a r u t a t t w t a n n where the assumption that the material point moves with a constant velocity has been taken into account contrary to the result obtained for the velocity to the leading order the normal component of the fluid acceleration does not equal the acceleration rate of the free surface elevation measured in the frame of the moving material point 5 3 accounting for seakeeping motions the present study focused on the effect of the forward velocity on the up crossing frequency and the related conditional distribution of kinematic variables accounting for seakeeping motions in the present stochastic analysis would present no specific difficulties as long as the seakeeping motions are linearly modelled the way forward to include seakeeping motions in the present stochastic approach is described in appendix b 5 4 time evolution of kinematic variables during the water entry when considering the level crossing problem in the context of slamming another important question is whether the wave kinematics can be considered as fixed during the slamming event indeed the present study focused on the joint distribution of kinematic variables at the free surface crossing without considering the subsequent evolution of kinematic variables kinematic variables may be considered as fixed if the characteristic time of the slamming event t s is much smaller than the characteristic encounter period of impacting waves which may be translated into 71 ω t s 1 the characteristic slamming time t s may be roughly estimated as the characteristic height of the exposed structure h e divided by the characteristic impact velocity 72 t s h e h ω 2 where h is the characteristic height of impacting waves the combination of eqs 71 72 shows that kinematic variables may be considered as fixed during the impact event if the vertical extension of the body part exposed to slamming is much smaller than the characteristic height of impacting waves this may be typically the case for appendages such as stabilising fins on a ship or diving planes on a surfaced submarine assuming fixed kinematic variables may be also justified for larger bodies if the early stage of the water entry can be considered as the most relevant with regard to hydrodynamic loads this may be typically the case for blunt bodies such as for example a bulbous bow or the sections of a flat bottomed ship conversely if the late stage of the wave impact and or the subsequent water exit phase needs to be investigated the subsequent time evolution of kinematic variables need to be considered for each event this time evolution is stochastic by nature the realisation of stochastic trajectories following up crossing events may be obtained by means of monte carlo experiments which may be computationally demanding these monte carlo experiments may be performed by using two different approaches i the full realisation of a sea state from which stochastic trajectories of water entries are extracted after up crossing detections ii the realisation of short sea state sequences starting directly from initial up crossing conditions which are drawn from the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing the option ii may prove numerically much more efficient especially when considering rare events for instance if the body is far from the mean sea level or if a focus on extreme wave impacts is needed this option would also offer more flexibility to implement variance reduction techniques such as importance sampling the subsequent evolution of kinematic variables starting from random initial conditions may be accounted for in a simplified deterministic manner helmers et al 2012 used such an approach to compute the time evolution of the free surface elevation η 0 after up crossing starting from random initial up crossing conditions for η 0 and η 0 and assuming that the third time derivative η 0 is equal to its conditional mean given the instantaneous value of the first time derivative η 0 these authors obtained a deterministic expression for η 0 as the solution of a second order differential equation alternatively another option is to use regression techniques based on slepian models see e g lindgren and rychlik 1991 this latter approach would allow to also insert random intermediate conditions at intermediate timepoints after upcrossing 6 conclusions the effect of forward speed on stochastic free surface crossing has been studied in the framework of the linear wave model the present study has focused on up crossing events i e the crossing of the free surface by the object into the water domain however the model may be readily modified to include both up crossing and down crossing events or focus on down crossing events only the conditional distribution of kinematic variables given up crossing has been shown to be significantly affected by the forward velocity of the considered material point the effect on the related up crossing frequency has been also investigated the analysis has been carried out analytically and formulae have been given for the general case of multidirectional waves in water of finite depth in the specific case where the water depth can be assumed infinite and the sea state has a two dimensional spectrum with separated frequency direction dependencies analytical developments have been furthered to express the conditional distribution of kinematic variables and the up crossing frequency in terms of wave frequency moments and non dimensional coefficients accounting for the wave directional spreading the prediction of the probability distribution of slamming loads on a ship may be a particular application of the present stochastic model the considered solid body has to be small compared to water wave wavelengths so the present theory can be used this condition may be fulfilled for small crafts or specific structures on large ships e g appendages bulbous bow ship sections the way forward to include seakeeping motions in the analysis has been briefly sketched in appendix different possible approaches to perform the transfer of the probability distribution of kinematic variables through a water entry model

gaussian vector z a see eq 19 either depend on η η 0 or on w η 0 or on neither none of the kinematic variables considered in section 3 depends concurrently on both η and w generic expressions for their respective univariate conditional density functions given up crossing are detailed below a 1 1 variables which depend on η i e u v w t variables which depend on η follow conditional distributions of gaussian type by denoting ζ the considered variable its conditional mean is given by a 2 e ζ η 0 t a e ζ η a cov ζ η m 0 a and its conditional variance by a 3 var ζ η 0 t a var ζ η a var ζ cov ζ η 2 m 0 where cov ζ η is the non conditional covariance of ζ and η the relevant non conditional covariances may be found in the expression of the related covariance matrix σ x see eq 28 a 1 2 variables which depend on w i e η x η y u t v t the conditional density function of a variable ξ which depends on w is given by a 4 f ξ η 0 t a ξ 0 2 π m 2 χ f ξ w ξ χ d χ where f ξ w is the non conditional bivariate density function of ξ and w it may be convenient to express f ξ η 0 t a differently as follows a 5 f ξ η 0 t a ξ 0 f w η 0 t a χ f ξ w χ ξ d χ where f w η 0 t a is given by eq a

form for this type of distribution by expressing it in terms of cumulative distribution function and making use of the standard normal distribution see lemma 5 3 in aberg et al 2008 since the density function f ξ η 0 t a can be expressed as the convolution of two elementary density functions see eq a 7 the corresponding random variable ξ η 0 t a may be comprehended as the sum or difference for negative values of ρ of two independent random variables i one being rayleigh distributed with a mode ρ σ ξ ii and the other being normally distributed with a mean equal to zero and a variance equal to 1 ρ 2 σ ξ 2 see also aberg et al 2008 lemma 5 1 the relative weight of these two components is controlled by ρ the correlation coefficient between ξ and w as expected for ρ 1 resp ρ 0 only the rayleigh component resp the normal component remains a 2 material point with translational motion this appendix section gives explicit analytical expressions for the conditional distributions given that η s t up crosses the level a represented in fig 5 the free surface elevation is given η s η a the variable η s given up crossing follows a rayleigh distribution of mode m 2 see eqs 47 59 the conditional distribution of variables which depend on η s but not on η s namely w t u v is not affected by the horizontal motion of the material point and results given in appendix a 1 1 are still valid as for the variables which depend on η s namely w u t v t η x η y the analytical expression of their conditional univariate distributions is given in appendix a 2 1 an analytical expression for the conditional bivariate distribution of two variables which depend on η s is given in appendix a 2 2 this expression has been used to plot the isodensity lines of the pairs η x η y and u t v t shown in fig 5 a 2 1 conditional distribution of a variable which depends on η s the conditional density function given up crossing of a variable ξ which depends on η s may be expressed as a 9 f ξ η s t a ξ 0 2 π m 2 χ f ξ η s ξ χ d χ which is similar to eq a 4 then in a way similar to the development given in appendix a 1 2 where the variable w should be replaced with η s f ξ η s t a may be expressed as the convolution of a rayleigh distribution and a normal distribution eqs a 7 a 8 may be readily reused with ρ now being the non conditional correlation coefficient between ξ and η s see the expression of the related covariance matrix σ y s in eq 46 a 2 2 conditional bivariate distribution of two variables which depend on η s the conditional bivariate distributions of u t v t and η x η y represented in fig 5 require to consider the case of two variables which both depend on the level crossing velocity η s in order to adopt general notations let q be a gaussian vector a 10 q q 1 q 2 q 3 where q 1 q 2 q 3 denote respectively u t or η x v t or η y and η s then the bivariate density function of q 1 and q 2 given up crossing may be expressed as a 11 g q 1 q 2 1 σ 3 1 2 π det σ q 1 2 0 d q 3 q 3 exp 1 2 q σ q 1 q where σ q is the covariance matrix of the gaussian vector q and σ 3 is the standard deviation of q 3 similarly to the explanation proposed in appendix a 1 2 the conditional bivariate distribution g may be comprehended as resulting from the sum of two independent vectors the first vector may be expressed as a 12 r ρ 13 σ 1 ρ 23 σ 2 r where ρ i j is the unconditioned correlation coefficient between the i th and j th components of the vector q σ i is the unconditioned standard deviation of the i th component of the vector q and r is a random variable which is rayleigh distributed with a mode equal to 1 the second vector is a zero mean gaussian vector whose covariance matrix is equal to the conditional covariance matrix of q 1 q 2 given q 3 after completing the square in the argument of the exponential function in eq a 11 the following closed form expression is obtained a 13 g q 1 q 2 1 σ 3 1 8 π det σ q 1 2 exp c q 1 q 2 a 33 3 2 2 a 33 π b q 1 q 2 exp b q

defined as a 16 a k l 1 2 σ q 1 k l appendix b stochastic approach including seakeeping motions including seakeeping motions in the present stochastic approach would require to consider a new stochastic process b 1 η b t η s t ζ s t where η b denotes the relative free surface elevation measured in the frame of the moving material point it is decomposed as the sum of η s t which accounts for the forward motion of the material point eq 40 and ζ s t which accounts for seakeeping motions around the average forward motion if the seakeeping motions are linearly modelled ζ s t results from a linear transformation of η s t and consequently η b t is also a gaussian process knowing the response amplitude operators of the floating platform along with the position of the material point on this platform the transfer function of ζ s can be readily expressed the variable ζ s may also account for the diffraction waves as well as the waves generated by the steady forward and unsteady motions of the vessel if the related transfer functions are known see for example hermundstad and moan 2005 2007 who include the effect of the waves generated by the forward motion of the ship in their analysis then in a way similar to eq 42 a new gaussian vector collecting the relevant kinematic variables should be defined b 2 z b η b η b z w where z w contains the kinematic variables of interest for example the kinematic variables necessary as the input of a water entry model the non conditional probability distribution of z b is a multivariate normal distribution whose covariance matrix may be expressed in the same way as eq 20 let z ˇ b denote the random vector containing the variables of z b except for η b the conditional density function of kinematic variables given up crossing can be written as b 3 f z ˇ b η b t a η b z w 2 π σ η b η b f z ˇ b η b a η b z w with η b 0 where a is the altitude of the material point on calm water and σ η b is the non conditional standard deviation of η b the related up crossing frequency reads b 4 μ b 1 2 π σ η b σ η b exp 1 2 a σ η b 2 where σ η b is the standard deviation of η b which is not equal to m 0 due to seakeeping motions 
20456,three dimensional direct numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the effects of the yaw angle and spanning length on the vortex structures and hydrodynamics of flow crossing a near wall cylindrical structure two yaw angles α 0 45 and three spanning length ratios l 25 50 100 are investigated at re 500 under the normal cylinder condition α 0 a parallel vortex shedding pattern is observed in the wake the vortex formation lengths are identical for all l whereas the spanwise correlation of the vortex shedding declines with the increasing l indicating the intensified three dimensionality a single dominant peak is found in the lift frequency spectra for each l case under the yawed condition α 45 the flow characteristics are fundamentally changed with negatively yawed linear vortex shedding tubes being observed in the wake different from the normal cases the vortex formation length for l 25 is larger than that of l 50 and 100 while the oblique angle of the vortex tube decreases with the increasing l it is shown that at α 45 the three dimensional flow features are fully developed when l 50 the lift frequency spectra show multiple peaks while the magnitudes of the secondary peaks are significantly reduced by extending the spanning length by comparing the results between α 0 and α 45 it is found the independence principle ip is applicable for predicting the first order statistics of the hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding frequency but fails in predicting the second order force statistics the effects of the yaw angle on the pressure and shear stress

academic research due to its importance in various engineering applications e g wind past cable stayed bridges power transmission lines and flow passing undersea pipelines phelan et al 2006 zuo and jones 2006 however these circular cylindrical structures are not always orthogonal to flow streamwise and the spanning lengths usually range from hundreds to thousands of cylinder diameter zuo 2005 these may lead to more evident and complex three dimensional 3 d flow characteristics comparing with normal cylindrical structures in lower spanning length experimental and numerical research has investigated the three dimensional effects in the wake and hydrodynamic forces of a yawed circular cylinder when a uniform incoming flow passing a yawed cylinder the independence principle ip is commonly used to evaluate the fluid forces and vortex shedding frequency zdravkovich 2003 it assumes that the hydrodynamics is only driven by the velocity component normal to the cylinder axis while it is independent of the yaw angle for the cylinder herein the yaw angle α is defined as the angle between the incoming flow and a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis as shown in fig 1 b where α 0 refers to the flow direction perpendicular to the cylinder axis according to the criteria suggested by zhou et al 2010 franzini et al 2013 and zhao et al 2013 the ip is valid when the relative difference of the hydrodynamics is lower than 15 between the normal and inclined cylinder lam et al 2010 found that the mean drag coefficient and the strouhal number st the vortex shedding frequency obey the ip for the circular cylinder at a yaw angle less than 45 wu et al 2020 also found that the hydrodynamics are independent of yaw angles of α 15 30 and 45 however hogan et al 2010 showed that the ip can only reasonably predict the vortex shedding frequency along the entire cylinder span for α 20 the result of zhao et al 2009 instead concluded that the st and mean drag coefficient agree well with the ip for yaw angle changing from 0 to 60 although no consensus among the range of the ip validity previous studies franzini et al 2009 2013 zhao et al 2009 2013 zhou et al 2010 has suggested that the validity of ip is undermined with the increase of α especially when α 45 for flow around an isolated cylinder some results hayashi et al 1995 poulin and larsen 2007 vakil and green 2009 hoang et al 2015 demonstrated that the ip was inaccurate for predicting the hydrodynamic forces of a circular cylinder with a large yaw angle due to the intense three dimensional characteristics of the flow since the 3 d flow features observed in the wake of a yawed cylinder is highly related to the spanning length of the cylinder ramberg 1983 norberg 1994 phelan et al 2006 zuo and jones 2006 yeo and jones 2008 the influences of the aspect ratio l l d l spanning length d cylinder diameter on the flow characteristics have been investigated through experiments and simulations for example ramberg 1983 showed that the end effects on the three dimensional flow field are still significant for a yawed cylinder with l 100 szepessy and bearman 1992 found that the lower l has a weakening effect on the vortex shedding frequency with st 0 19 at l 6 7 reducing to st 0 17 at l 1 matsuzaki et al 1994 showed that the disturbance of flow from the end effect becomes more significant as the cylinder length is shortened and its yaw angle is increased larose et al 2003 found that the hydrodynamics exhibits significant deviations along the span with l 33 yeo and jones 2011 numerically investigated the flow around an inclined cylinder at α 45 with l 10 20 30 and the results showed that the requisite cylinder length would be approximately 60d or higher to accurately model inherently three dimensional characteristics of the flow liang and duan 2019 investigated the flow characteristics around a yawed cylinder with α 15 30 45 and l 6 they found that the vortex shedding holds a similar way as flow normally crossing a circular cylinder with the axes of the vortex structures parallel to the cylinder axis at α 15 45 the abovementioned studies have mainly focused on the effect of yawed angle and spanning length on the flow around an isolated cylinder however the study of flow past a yawed circular cylinder close to a plane boundary is relatively rare which is commonly encountered in flow oblique to cylindrical structures such as submarine pipelines and jacket platform tubes near the seabed existing studies thapa et al 2014 ji et al 2020 demonstrated the impact of the bottom wall on the three dimensional vortex shedding features for example for flow past a wall free cylinder lucor and karniadakis 2003 showed that the spanwise vortex structures in the wake are no longer parallel to the axis of the cylinder at α 60 and 70 however with the effect of the bottom wall the inclination of the wake vortices occurs at a lower yaw angle condition e g α 45 in thapa et al 2014 and α 15 in ji et al 2020 thapa et al 2014 also found that the force coefficients do not follow the ip if α 30 under the condition of l 19 2 and gap ratio g d 0 4 where the g refers to the gap distance between the cylinder surface and the bottom wall the above studies discussed the effects of yaw angle and spanning length on the flow characteristics around a near wall circular cylinder however the underlying mechanism from the yaw angle and spanning length on three dimensional flow features and the ip validity is still unclear due to the scattered parameters besides the investigation of the distributions of pressure and shear stress on the bottom wall which is crucial for accurately predicting the local scouring of the seabed is scarce the present study aims to investigate the spanning length and yaw angle effects on 3 d vortex structures and hydrodynamic forces of a near wall cylinder as well as the pressure and shear stress distributions on the bottom wall with l 25 100 α 0 45 g d 0 8 and re 500 through direct numerical simulations dns the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the numerical methodology and simulation parameters are presented the vortex structures fluid forces and pressure coefficient and shear stress on the bottom wall are discussed in section 3 finally major conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 numerical model

vorst 1992 preconditioned by using the geometric multi grid method for the sake of conciseness further descriptions of the solution procedure can be found in our previous work ji et al 2012 2020 chen et al 2015 2019 to verify the accuracy of the present numerical methodology flow around an isolated cylinder at re 500 was simulated and then the results were compared with those in literature as shown in table 1 in this study the non dimensional drag c d and lift c l coefficients strouhal number st and base pressure coefficient c pb are defined as 4 c d 2f d ρu2 ndl c l 2f l ρu2 ndl 5 st fd u

the pressure at the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and p the reference pressure as suggested in williamson 1996a the normalized spanwise vortex wavelength λ z d refers to the distance between two adjacent co rotating streamwise vortices along the span it is seen from table 1 that the present results are in good agreement with the published experimental and numerical data thus validating the present numerical solution 2 2 simulation parameters and convergence study in the present study 3 d characteristics of the flow around a yawed circular cylinder are investigated under different spanning lengths herein the re u n d ν 500 is employed because in such condition the flow is fully three dimensional williamson 1996b fig 1 shows the 3 d simulation domain boundary conditions and physical configuration the streamwise x cross flow y length of the domain are 60d and 40d respectively where the circular cylinder is located at 15d from the inlet and 45d to the outlet the cylinder is horizontally placed above the bottom plane perpendicular to the two side walls three aspect ratios l l d 25 50 100 and two yaw angles α 0 45 are considered in the present study in fig 1 g denotes the gap distance between the cylinder s lower surface and the bottom wall a fixed gap ratio g d 0 8 is chosen because it is within the intermediate gap ratio region 0 3 g d 1 0 where the bottom wall effect on vortex shedding is significant wang et al 2008a b at the inlet a mean velocity profile is adopted which is defined as 7 u v w u n y 0 u n y tan α where u n y is the velocity profile given by

boundary between the viscous sub layer and the logarithmic region thapa et al 2014 the neumann boundary conditions are adopted at the outflow free slip boundary conditions are applied to the top boundary the no slip boundary conditions are imposed on the bottom wall and the cylinder surface periodic boundary conditions are used in two side boundaries as shown in fig 2 the computational domain is discretized by a cartesian mesh in the x y plane a uniform mesh with grid spacing δx δy d 32 is used around the cylinder to ensure simulation accuracy the mesh is then stretched out away from this region with the grid resolution being 768 384 in the x y plane in the z direction 256 512 and 1024 planes are uniformly adopted for the cases of l 25 50 and 100 respectively with a grid spacing of δz 0 1d the 3 d mesh dependence study of jiang and cheng 2017 has suggested that spanwise grid spacing δz of 0 1d would not affect the stability of 3 d flow which justifies the adopted spanwise grid to verify the mesh convergence simulations are conducted for flow around a circular cylinder close to a wall at l 25 g d 0 8 α 0 re 500 and δtu n d 0 002 with three different mesh densities as shown in table 2 the differences in hydrodynamic forces and st between mesh a and b are significantly reduced when compared with mesh c for example the maximum difference in root mean square rms drag coefficients c d rms between mesh a and b is less than 5 3 within a reasonable error range the agreement from mesh b and a shows that the results converge at δx δy d 32 the convergence of the computations is further checked by applying three different time step sizes as shown in table 3 marginal differences between these three cases were found validating the convergence in δtu n d 0 002 from above the grid discretization with δx δy d 32 and the non dimensional time step size δtu n d 0 002 were chosen for the following simulations besides based on the adopted grid and time step size the maximum cfl number uδt δx is smaller than 0 5 satisfying the cfl criteria all the simulations are performed on a high performance computing cluster in each case 450 h are approximately required using 64 cpu cores 3 numerical results 3 1 vortex structures figs 3 5 show the instantaneous iso surfaces of vortex structures and the corresponding sectional contours of the dimensionless spanwise vorticity ω z u y x u x y u n d at α 0 and 45 for l 25 50 and 100 respectively when the flow is fully developed the vortex cores are captured by the dimensionless second negative eigenvalue λ 2 λ 2 u n d 2 0 8 of the tensor ψ 2 ω 2 where ψ and ω are the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor u respectively jeong and hussain 1995 the iso surfaces are colored by ω z to differentiate the clockwise in blue and anti clockwise in red rotating spanwise vortices as shown in fig 3 b at α 0 for each typical cross section the recirculation length does not exhibit obvious variation along the span indicating that the free shear layer for the wake is invariant along the cylinder span this leads to the vortex tube as marked by the green dash line in fig 3 a approximately parallel to the axis of the circular cylinder which is defined as the parallel vortex shedding pattern in fig 3 b the vortex shedding suppression and the cross trajectory of the clockwise and counterclockwise vortices are observed in the wake for example at z l 4 8 although a periodic vortex shedding can be found from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder the positive vortex from the lower surface is stretched into a thin vortex filament due to the vortex shedding suppression that is the roll up of the lower shear layer induces the separation of the boundary layer forming a clockwise rotated vortex the merge of the clockwise vortices from the boundary layer and upper shear layer in turn suppresses the vortex shedding from the lower cylinder surface therefore no intact vortex tubes in positive sign red are observed in the wake as shown in fig 3 a besides due to the merge of clockwise vortices the intensity and dimension of these vortices are greater than those of the counterclockwise vortices this leads to the counterclockwise vortices occupy the upper position while clockwise vortices shed from the upper side occupy the lower position this crossing trajectory phenomenon is also found in the wake for flow around a near wall cylinder sarkar and sarkar 2010 chen et al 2019 ji et al 2020 which is different from the wake dynamics in an isolated cylinder case with the yaw angle up to α 45 as shown in fig 3 d it is surprisingly found that the suppression of vortex shedding from the gap side shear layer is undermined that is the vortex shedding is more alike to that of an isolated cylinder compared to the vortex shedding in α 0 this can be demonstrated by the intensified strength of the counterclockwise vortices red in the wake and further proved by the partly neutralized mean lift force as discussed later however the counterclockwise vortices break down into smaller scale vortices and disperse on both the upper and lower position of the clockwise vortices further downstream this leads to the intensification of flow three dimensionality at α 45 than that at α 0 by showing significantly distorted spanwise vortex tubes and irregular streamwise vortices in grey color in the wake as shown in fig 3 c at α 45 although the recirculation length remains approximately identical in each section a significant phase lag of vortex shedding can be observed along the span for example at z l 4 8 a clockwise vortex is just shed from the upper shear layer whereas at z l 8 8 the lower shear layer is about to shed a counterclockwise vortex showing approximately an antiphase vortex shedding pattern between these two sections this spanwise vortex shedding lag leads to the formation of oblique vortex tubes in the wake as shown in fig 3 c that is the rolling axis of the spanwise vortex tube is yawed with respect to the cylinder axis and its orientation is opposite to that of the oncoming flow which is defined as the negatively yawed vortex shedding pattern zhang et al 2020 the oblique angle β between the spanwise tube and the cylinder axis is 12 5 in fig 3 a which is smaller than the flow yaw angle this is similar to the observation of ramberg 1983 for flow passing an isolated cylinder where the spanwise vortex structures are inclined at an angle smaller than the yaw angle of the cylinder as shown in figs 4 a and fig 5 a for α 0 with the increase of the l the spanwise vortex tubes at l 50 and l 100 show increasingly evident waviness than that at l 25 in the wake especially for l 100 the spanwise vortex lines are neither parallel to the cylinder axis nor consistently oblique to it along the span while showing many regional parallel segments this unsynchronized distribution of the spanwise vortex shedding may be related to variations of the vorticity strength in different sections that is for example at z l 8 16 the shear layers with intense vorticity closely wrap the cylinder base fig 5 b and the relatively lower pressure fig 6 a induced by the higher vorticity around the cylinder base delays the shed of the vortex whereas at z l 9 16 there is an obvious gap between the cylinder base and the shear layers thus the relatively higher pressure fig 6 b induced by the lower vorticity locally speeds up the detachment of the vortex shedding due to the phase difference of vortex shedding in different spanwise location significant vortex dislocations williamson 1996b zhao et al 2013 that were observed in the flow passing an isolated cylinder are also observed in l 100 as exemplified by the green dash line in fig 5 a this is different from the observation in l 25 and 50 and that of thapa et al 2014 for flow past a near wall cylinder with l 19 2 where no obvious vortex dislocation along the span is observed the lack of vortex dislocations at l 50 implies that the lower spanning length of the cylinder may limit the development of the three dimensional flow features as shown in figs 4 c and fig 5 c for l 50 and l 100 with α 45 the negatively yawed vortex shedding pattern observed in l 25 and α 45 is also observed in the wake however the absolute value of oblique angle β shows a significant drop from β 12 5 for l 25 to β 4 6 for l 50 which can be attributed to the periodic boundary conditions adopted in the spanwise direction further increase the spanning length to l 100 β shows a small decrease to β 4 0 signifying the convergence of the yaw angle of the vortex tubes and the negligible cylinder end effects that is the yaw angle of the vortex rows is approximately 4 0 at g d 0 8 re n 500 and α 45 and a low cylinder spanning length may result in an unphysical high value besides the vortex rows exhibit more intact linear distribution along the span for l 50 and l 100 comparing that for l 25 due to the same reason discussed above note that for l 100 and α 45 two separated oblique vortex tubes shed from the cylinder along the span indicating that the vortex shedding in the upper and low parts is in different period fig 7 shows the evolution of the instant coherent structures at the middle cross section and the corresponding velocity profiles at different downstream locations for re 500 and l 100 as shown in fig 7 a under the induction of the lower wake vortex marked by a1 from the cylinder shear layer the boundary layer is lifted and then rolled into a clockwise vortex close to the wall marked by b1 where this vortex gradually merges with the clockwise vortex marked by c1 from the upper cylinder surface the streamwise vortical structures marked by the red dash circle generated from the shear layers connect two adjacent spanwise tubes a1 and c1 from the upper side besides some separated streamwise vortical structures roll below the spanwise tube as marked by the blue dash circle and then induce more streamwise vortical structures from the boundary layer as marked by the black dash circle connecting two consecutive spanwise tubes c1 and c2 from the lower side note that due to the periodically induced by the wake vortices from the lower cylinder surface the coherent structures from the boundary layer have the same periodicity as the wake vortices from fig 7 a d as exemplified by the clockwise vortex c1 the corresponding vortex tube in the wake is nearly two dimensional at the beginning and loses its spanwise coherence by the three dimensional destabilization when it convects further downstream which is similar to the distribution of the spanwise tubes in fig 5 a besides further downstream with the increasing disturbance from the irregular wake vortices more small scale streamwise elongated streaks are lifted up from the boundary layer indicating the intensification of wake turbulence during the evolution process of the coherent structures the velocity profile in the wake is significantly changed due to the interactions between the boundary layer and cylinder shear layers for example as shown in fig 7 e at x d 1 the overshot of the velocity is evident in the gap region due to the acceleration of the gap flow besides the velocity deficit right behind the cylinder center is caused by the formation of the anti clockwise vortex for x d 4 the velocity close to wall is smaller than that of the disturbed profile red dotted line which is related to the shielding by the lifted streamwise elongated streak as shown in fig 7 e h the velocity fluctuation gradually decreases with the increase of streamwise location corresponding to the weakening of wake vortices as they convect downstream 3 2 hydrodynamic forces figs 8 and 9 show the spatio temporal distributions of lift coefficients c l for different l at α 0 and α 45 respectively as shown in fig 8 at α 0 the spanwise strips of c l are regularly distributed over time for each l which is related to the periodic vortex shedding of the cylinder however the instantaneous amplitudes of c l are not constant over the entire length but within a finite length of the cylinder thus showing segments with different amplitudes of c l along the span the fluctuation in spanwise c l is related to the different vorticity strength of vortex shedding the discontinuities of adjacent spanwise c l segments are attributed to the vortex dislocations and the length of the segments with different intensity increases with the increasing l which can be observed from vortex structures in figs 3 5 although c l fluctuations are observed along the span the c l strips are generally parallel to the z axis over most of the spanwise region corresponding to the parallel vortex shedding pattern at α 0 as shown in fig 9 at α 45 the lift coefficients show oblique strips as marked by the white dotted line within the spatio temporal domain indicating that vortex shedding does not occur simultaneously along the entire span this is attributed to the inclination of the spanwise vortex rows under the negatively yawed vortex shedding pattern figs 3 5 although obvious phase differences of vortex shedding are observed along the span the adjacent c l strips are parallel to each other note that it is also observed that multiple c l segments caused by large vortex waviness and vortex dislocations move along the cylinder length the moving segments exhibit as a series of oblique strips in the spatio temporal domain as marked by the white dash line showing a traveling wave mode the slopes of the traveling strips with respect to the time indicate the traversing speeds of the c l segments along the cylinder span which are approximately identical to the spanwise component of the incoming flow velocity table 4 lists the mean and rms values of the drag and lift coefficients with the fluid forces being sampled since the flow is fully developed it is seen that the mean drag and lift coefficients are virtually the same at different l for α 0 while the rms values of the drag and lift coefficients at l 100 show a significant decrease compared with those at l 25 this may be caused by the intensified waviness of the vortex rows at a larger spanning length and the resultant non negligible phase lags of the fluid forces at different spanwise positions note that compared to the rms lift coefficients of an isolated cylinder as listed in table 1 c l rms in the near wall cases shows a significant drop owing to the vortex shedding suppression caused by the adjacent plane boundary moreover the mean lift coefficient is negative for the cases at α 0 indicating the attractive force on the cylinder to the wall as explained in chen et al 2019 attractive mean lift may appear at an intermediate g d owing to the deflection of the stagnation point and the streamwise velocity difference on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder compared to the results with α 0 the value of c d shows moderate increments in the cases with l 50 and 100 while the absolute value of c l displays a small drop in the yawed conditions all these changes are related to the enhancement of the gap side vortex shedding from the cylinder as discussed above that is with stronger counterclockwise vortices shed from the lower surface of the cylinder the base pressure decreases which leads to a larger mean drag moreover the absolute value of the mean lift is reduced owing to the slightly recovered symmetry of the wake note that the results with l 25 are atypical due to the non negligible end effects and the non fully developed 3 d wake drastic drops are observed on the rms drag and lift coefficients c d rms and c l rms in the yawed conditions which is attributed to the cancellation of the fluid forces at different spanwise sections ji et al 2020 the effect of the yaw angle on the validity of the ip is further investigated by comparing the mean and rms values of drag and lift coefficients at different yaw angles and spanning lengths the first order statistics c d and c l verify the ip at all l with the maximum difference of 14 3 existing at l 100 for c l however for the second order statistics c d rms and c l rms remarkable drops ranging from 50 to 80 are observed signifying the invalidity of the ip in the yawed flow with α 45 as mentioned in lam and lin 2008 the mean drag coefficient for a circular cylinder is inversely proportional to the average vortex formation lengths and a longer vortex formation and lower values of streamwise turbulence intensity would minimize the fluctuating lift here the vortex formation length is defined as the streamwise distance from the center of the cylinder to the point where the maximum value of rms streamwise velocity is achieved along the wake axis williamson 1996b therefore the time averaged dimensionless rms values u rms u n of the fluctuating streamwise velocity distributions along the wake centerline y 0 x direction are plotted in fig 10 for different spanning lengths and yaw angles as shown in fig 10 similar trends are observed in the u rms u n distributions for different spanning lengths and yaw angles for example at α 0 the u rms u n distributions along the wake centerline for different spanning lengths peak at nearly the same streamwise position although the intensity of u rms u n varies this leads to identical vortex formation lengths for l 25 50 and 100 which can also be reflected by the same spatio and temporal averaged mean drag coefficients c d in these conditions as listed in table 4 increasing the yaw angle to α 45 differences in the peak u rms u n position between different spanning length cases are obtained the vortex formation length for l 25 becomes larger than that of l 50 and l 100 thus leading a smaller c d see table 4 as shown in fig 10 the maximum values of the turbulence intensity u rms u n increase with the increasing l for both α 0 and 45 however the c l rms in the two cases decreases with the increasing l this seems to contradict to the conclusion stated in lam and lin 2008 that lower streamwise turbulence intensity would reduce the fluctuating lift to fill the gap the spatial averaged sectional fluid force coefficients c d c l c d r m s and c l r m s are calculated and listed in table 5 note that these fluid force coefficients are first averaged over time and then space however the force coefficients such as c d c l c d rms and c l rms being equivalent to c d c l c d r m s and c l r m s respectively are first averaged over the cylinder span and then time and thus they can be taken as time averaged global force coefficients compare tables 4 and 5 it is found that c d and c l have the same values with c d and c l respectively indicating the swap of the averaging order has no effects on the first order statistics however the second order statistics c d r m s and c l r m s are significantly larger than their global counterparts c d rms and c l rms especially for the α 45 cases this is easy to be understood that when the instantaneous fluid forces are first averaged along the cylinder span the phase lags caused by the wake three dimensionality and the inclined vortex shedding lead to the cancellation of the forces along the span however no spanwise cancellation exists when the instantaneous fluid forces are first averaged over time compare the values of c d r m s and c l r m s at α 0 and 45 it is found that the spatio averaged sectional rms drag and lift coefficient display a small step up with an increase in the yaw angle being opposite to the significant drops of c d rms and c l rms the small step up of c d r m s and c l r m s can be attributed to the mildly enhanced gap side vortex shedding at α 45 as discussed above now let us focus on the relationship between c l r m s representing the local fluctuating lift force and the profiles of u rms u n along the wake centerline the value of c l r m s increases with the increasing l following the trend of the peak value of u rms u n well which verifies the relationship suggested in lam and lin 2008 based on the uneven distributions of the lift coefficients along the span in figs 8 9 the variation of the sectional lift coefficient in the axial direction is further quantitatively examined by the correlation factor defined as r z 1 z 2 c l z 1 c l z 2 c l rms z 1 c l rms z 2 zhao et al 2013 where c l z c l z c l z is the fluctuating lift coefficient c l z is the time averaged lift coefficient c l rms z is the rms lift coefficient fig 11 shows the spanwise distributions of the r 0 z for different yawed angles and spanning lengths referring to as the correlation between the end section z d 0 of the cylinder and other sections along the span as shown in fig 11 at α 0 with increasing l from 25 to 100 the r 0 z shows increasingly significant fluctuations along the span while the maximum of the r 0 z gradually reduces indicating a decline of the spanwise correlation for vortex shedding for example for l 25 r 0 z is ranging from 0 79 to 1 showing a positive correlation this indicates that the phase of vortex shedding at different sections are similar along the span however for l 100 the r 0 z is generally decreasing along the span till z l 0 75 with the r 0 z being close to 0 in the range of z l 0 65 0 8 the decreasing trend of r 0 z with the increasing l is related to the vortex dislocations as shown in fig 5 a note that the r 0 z at α 0 is not symmetrical along the span due to the curved and distorted 3 d vortex structures in the wake however at α 45 the r 0 z is generally symmetrical about the z l 0 5 for each l case as shown in fig 11 compared with those at α 0 the fluctuations of r 0 z along the span are less obvious due to the linearly oblique vortex structures at α 45 for l 25 and l 50 the r 0 z decreases first and then increases along the axial direction the negative correlation factors are found in the range of z l 0 25 to z l 0 75 with the minimum of r 0 z 0 7 at z l 0 5 this demonstrates that the vortex shedding of the end and middle section of the cylinder are nearly in antiphase owing to the linearly oblique vortex rows and the periodic spanwise boundary conditions besides the wavelengths of r 0 z for l 25 and l 50 along the span are 25d and 50d respectively however for l 100 the wavelength of r 0 z is equal to 50d by showing two wave troughs at z l 0 25 and z l 0 75 respectively therefore it is reflected by the two oblique vortex tubes along the cylinder in the wake as shown in fig 5 c it is seen from the wavelength of r 0 z in fig 11 that a lower spanning length of the cylinder may limit the development of 3 d flow and the spanning length of the cylinder should be no less than 50d in the specific configuration to inherently exhibit the three dimensional characteristics of the flow fig 12 shows the normalized frequency spectra of c l and c d for different yaw angles and spanning lengths where the frequency is normalized by the maximum amplitude of the frequency intensity in each case by applying fast fourier transform on the lift coefficients along the span not shown here the vortex shedding frequencies are identically distributed over the entire span therefore only the frequency results of lift and drag coefficients of the middle section are plotted in fig 12 for l 25 the dominant frequency of lift coefficient f l at α 0 is 0 255 whereas the f l is equal to 0 253 at α 45 this small deviation between the normal and yaw inflow case indicates that the ip is valid in predicting the vortex shedding frequency for l 50 and l 100 the dominant f l 0 253 is independent on the yaw angle as shown in fig 12 the dominant frequencies of the lift and drag coefficients are identical for an individual case it is different from that of the isolated cylinder case where the dominant frequency of the drag coefficient f d is twice of the dominant f l williamson 1996b zdravkovich 2003 besides the dominant f l for each case is larger than that of the isolated cylinder case st 0 207 this indicates that the presence of the bottom wall would speed up the vortex shedding as shown in fig 12 a at α 0 only a dominant peak is observed in the lift frequency curves for each l case however with increasing the yaw angle up to α 45 more peaks with relatively high intensities are obtained in the lift frequency domain which is related to the intensified irregularly arranged streamwise vortices in the wake as a consequence the spanwise vortices are curved and then split into small scale eddies due to the disturbance by the streamwise vortex generated axial flow this behavior also changes the frequency distribution of turbulence fluctuation of the wake flow which induces wider signal bandwidth and multiple secondary frequencies in the frequency spectrum note that the multi frequency features are especially evident for l 25 and the peaks of the lift frequency curves are more concentrated with the increasing of l 3 3 pressure coefficient and shear stress as demonstrated in section 3 1 the interaction between the cylinder wake and the bottom wall leads to the suppression of the lower surface vortex shedding in turn the vortex shedding effects on the force distributions of the bottom wall are established by examining the pressure coefficient c p and shear stress τ along the wall the shear stress τ is defined as follows 9 τ μ u y 2 w y 2 where μ is the fluid viscosity and the velocity components u and w are normalized by the u n the c p and τ distribution on the bottom wall are critical in predicting the scour profiles of the deformable seabed beneath the subsea cylindrical structures for example the shear stress τ is important for calculating the shields parameter which is important for predicting the sediment incipient motion of the sandy seabed liang et al 2005a b zhao and cheng 2010 ong et al 2010 the interaction dynamics between the cylinder wake and the bottom wall are examined by the instantaneous vortex shedding and the corresponding c p and τ along the wall for different spanwise sections with α 0 and α 45 l 25 as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 in fig 14 a at α 0 due to the intensification of the gap flow velocity c p is minimum right below the cylinder on the bottom wall in the downstream c p reaches a local maximum between 2 x d 4 indicating the existence of an adverse pressure gradient this is related to the separation of the wall boundary layer and the resultant secondary vortex for example as shown in fig 13 b the counter clockwise vortex shed from the lower cylinder surface induces the separation of the wall boundary layer leading to a local reversal flow along the bottom wall manifested by the recirculation zone approximately at x d 2 4 in fig 14 b the shear stress reaches the maximum underneath the cylinder and a secondary peak around at x d 2 due to the separated wall boundary layer as shown in fig 13 a d note that the maximum suction pressure c p 0 and the maximum shear stress both occur right underneath the cylinder leading to a maximum depth of the equilibrium scour hole liang et al 2005a b zhao and cheng 2010 as shown in fig 14 a and b similar trends are observed in the distributions of bottom wall c p as well as τ along the x direction for different spanwise sections indicating that the vortex shedding effects on the bottom wall are comparable along the span as shown in fig 14 c and d at α 45 the distribution of c p shows significant variations along the span indicating the different vortex shedding phases see fig 13 e h however the τ displays consistent distributions near the cylinder with a relatively stable maximum value occurring underneath the cylinder similar to that at α 0 note that both the c p and τ on the bottom wall exhibit evident fluctuations further downstream due to the complex interactions between the disordered vortices from the shear layers and the wall boundary layer as shown in fig 13 e h to improve the understanding of the bottom wall c p and τ involved in the subsea cylindrical structures with different yaw angles and spanning lengths the temporal and spatio averaged c p and τ on the bottom wall right underneath the cylinder are listed in table 6 respectively it is shown that under a specific l both the mean suction pressure c p negative and the mean shear stress τ increase with the increasing of yaw angle for example the differences of the c p between the normal flow α 0 and yawed flow condition α 45 for l 25 50 100 are 4 4 7 9 and 7 9 respectively while the differences of the τ between α 0 and α 45 conditions are 6 5 for each l both of which prove the ip validity 4 conclusions this paper presents a three dimensional dns of flow around a yawed circular cylinder close to a bottom wall with a parameter space of l 25 100 α 0 45 g d 0 8 and re 500 the spanning length and yaw angle effects on 3 d vortex structures hydrodynamics and forces distributions on the bottom wall have been investigated and presented at α 0 the spanwise vortex tube is parallel to the cylinder axis forming a parallel vortex shedding pattern whereas the parallel vortex shedding is undermined with the increasing l the vortex formation lengths are identical for all l while turbulence intensities increase with the increasing l due to vortex shedding suppression a crossing trajectory phenomenon where the counterclockwise vortices from the lower surface occupy the upper position while the clockwise vortices occupy the lower position is observed in the wake for all cases at α 45 the spanwise vortex tubes are yawed with respect to the cylinder axis forming negatively yawed vortex shedding patterns and the oblique angle between the spanwise tubes and the cylinder axis decreases with the increase of l two oblique vortex tubes are generated along the cylinder for l 100 compared with only one oblique tube for l 25 and l 50 the vortex formation length for l 25 becomes slightly larger than that of l 50 and l 100 whereas the value of turbulence intensity increases with the increasing l the fluctuation features and spanwise correlation of the vortex structures can be reflected inherently by the three dimensional hydrodynamic forces the spanwise vortex dislocations cause the discontinuous segments of the lift coefficients along the span and the segments in different intensities increase with the increasing l at α 0 the maximum of the correlation factor r 0 z gradually reduces with increasing l from 25 to 100 indicating a decline of the spanwise correlation for vortex shedding at α 45 the r 0 z is generally symmetrical about the z l 0 5 for each l case besides for l 25 50 and 100 the wavelengths of r 0 z are 25d 50d and 50d respectively which indicates that the cylinder length should be at least 50d to inherently reflect the 3 d characteristics of the flow at α 0 only a dominant peak is observed in the lift frequency spectra for each l case at α 45 more peaks in relatively high intensities are obtained in the lift frequency domain and with the increasing of l the magnitudes of the secondary frequencies are reduced and the peaks of the lift frequency curves are more concentrated the vortex shedding pattern also influences the distributions of the pressure coefficient c p and shear stress τ on the bottom wall where the maximum c p negative and τ occur right underneath the cylinder and the corresponding suction pressure and the shear stress increase with the increasing yaw angle independence principle ip is valid for predicting the first order fluid force statistics vortex shedding frequency and the wall pressure and shear stress but fails for predicting the second order fluid force statistics owing to the wake three dimensionality and the oblique vortex shedding in the present study the reynolds number of 500 is relatively low when compared to the full scale applications although the present results at lower re can provide some insights into the wake modes and hydrodynamic features direct numerical simulations of flows past a long cylinder in real life cases at higher re are needed to be investigated in the future for further understanding the underlying physics of more realistic flows around the power lines and subsea pipelines credit authorship

20456,three dimensional direct numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the effects of the yaw angle and spanning length on the vortex structures and hydrodynamics of flow crossing a near wall cylindrical structure two yaw angles α 0 45 and three spanning length ratios l 25 50 100 are investigated at re 500 under the normal cylinder condition α 0 a parallel vortex shedding pattern is observed in the wake the vortex formation lengths are identical for all l whereas the spanwise correlation of the vortex shedding declines with the increasing l indicating the intensified three dimensionality a single dominant peak is found in the lift frequency spectra for each l case under the yawed condition α 45 the flow characteristics are fundamentally changed with negatively yawed linear vortex shedding tubes being observed in the wake different from the normal cases the vortex formation length for l 25 is larger than that of l 50 and 100 while the oblique angle of the vortex tube decreases with the increasing l it is shown that at α 45 the three dimensional flow features are fully developed when l 50 the lift frequency spectra show multiple peaks while the magnitudes of the secondary peaks are significantly reduced by extending the spanning length by comparing the results between α 0 and α 45 it is found the independence principle ip is applicable for predicting the

academic research due to its importance in various engineering applications e g wind past cable stayed bridges power transmission lines and flow passing undersea pipelines phelan et al 2006 zuo and jones 2006 however these circular cylindrical structures are not always orthogonal to flow streamwise and the spanning lengths usually range from hundreds to thousands of cylinder diameter zuo 2005 these may lead to more evident and complex three dimensional 3 d flow characteristics comparing with normal cylindrical structures in lower spanning length experimental and numerical research has investigated the three dimensional effects in the wake and hydrodynamic forces of a yawed circular cylinder when a uniform incoming flow passing a yawed cylinder the independence principle ip is commonly used to evaluate the fluid forces and vortex shedding frequency zdravkovich 2003 it assumes that the hydrodynamics is only driven by the velocity component normal to the cylinder axis while it is independent of the yaw angle for the cylinder herein the yaw angle α is defined as the angle between the incoming flow and a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis as shown in fig 1 b where α 0 refers to the flow direction perpendicular to the cylinder axis according to the criteria suggested by zhou et al 2010 franzini et al 2013 and zhao et al 2013 the ip is valid when the relative difference of the hydrodynamics is lower than 15 between the normal and inclined cylinder lam et al 2010 found that the mean drag coefficient and the strouhal number st the vortex shedding frequency obey the ip for the circular cylinder at a yaw angle less than 45 wu et al 2020 also found that the hydrodynamics are independent of yaw angles of α 15 30 and 45 however hogan et al 2010 showed that the ip can only reasonably predict the vortex shedding frequency along the entire cylinder span for α 20 the result of zhao et al 2009 instead concluded that the st and mean drag coefficient agree well with the ip for yaw angle changing from 0 to 60 although no consensus among the range of the ip validity previous studies franzini et al 2009 2013 zhao et al 2009 2013 zhou et al 2010 has suggested that the validity of ip is undermined with the increase of α especially when α 45 for flow around an isolated cylinder some results hayashi et al 1995 poulin and larsen 2007 vakil and green 2009 hoang et al 2015 demonstrated that the ip was inaccurate for predicting the hydrodynamic forces of a circular cylinder with a large yaw angle due to the intense three dimensional characteristics of the flow since the 3 d flow features observed in the wake of a yawed cylinder is highly related to the spanning length of the cylinder ramberg 1983 norberg 1994 phelan et al 2006 zuo and jones 2006 yeo and jones 2008 the influences of the aspect ratio l l d l spanning length d cylinder diameter on the flow characteristics have been investigated through experiments and simulations for example ramberg 1983 showed that the end effects on the three dimensional flow field are still significant for a yawed cylinder with l 100 szepessy and bearman 1992 found that the lower l has a weakening effect on the vortex shedding frequency with st 0 19 at l 6 7 reducing to st 0 17 at l 1 matsuzaki et al 1994 showed that the disturbance of flow from the end effect becomes more significant as the cylinder length is shortened and its yaw angle is increased larose et al 2003 found that the hydrodynamics exhibits significant deviations along the span with l 33 yeo and jones 2011 numerically investigated the flow around an inclined cylinder at α 45 with l 10 20 30 and the results showed that the requisite cylinder length would be approximately 60d or higher to accurately model inherently three dimensional characteristics of the flow liang and duan 2019 investigated the flow characteristics around a yawed cylinder with α 15 30 45 and l 6 they found that the vortex shedding holds a similar way as flow normally crossing a circular cylinder with the axes of the vortex structures parallel to the cylinder axis at α 15 45 the abovementioned studies have mainly focused on the effect of yawed angle and spanning length on the flow around an isolated cylinder however the study of flow past a yawed circular cylinder close to a plane boundary is relatively rare which is commonly encountered in flow oblique to cylindrical structures such as submarine pipelines and jacket platform tubes near the seabed existing studies thapa et al 2014 ji et al 2020 demonstrated the impact of the bottom wall on the three dimensional vortex shedding features for example for flow past a wall free cylinder lucor and karniadakis 2003 showed that the spanwise vortex structures in the wake are no longer parallel to the axis of the cylinder at α 60 and 70 however with the effect of the bottom wall the inclination of the wake vortices occurs at a lower yaw angle condition e g α 45 in thapa et al 2014 and α 15 in ji et al 2020 thapa et al 2014 also found that the force coefficients do not follow the ip if α 30 under the condition of l 19 2 and gap ratio g d 0 4 where the g refers to the gap distance between the cylinder surface and the bottom wall the above studies discussed the effects of yaw angle and spanning length on the flow characteristics around a near wall circular cylinder however the underlying mechanism from the yaw angle and spanning length on three dimensional flow features and the ip validity is still unclear due to the scattered parameters besides the investigation of the distributions of pressure and shear stress on the bottom wall which is crucial for accurately predicting the local scouring of the seabed is scarce the present study aims to investigate the spanning length and yaw angle effects on 3 d vortex structures and hydrodynamic forces of a near wall cylinder as well as the pressure and shear stress distributions on the bottom wall with l 25 100 α 0 45 g d 0 8 and re 500 through direct numerical simulations dns the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the numerical methodology and simulation parameters are presented the vortex structures fluid forces and pressure coefficient and shear stress on the bottom wall are discussed in section 3 finally major conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 numerical model

vorst 1992 preconditioned by using the geometric multi grid method for the sake of conciseness further descriptions of the solution procedure can be found in our previous work ji et al 2012 2020 chen et al 2015 2019 to verify the accuracy of the present numerical methodology flow around an isolated cylinder at re 500 was simulated and then the results were compared with those in literature as shown in table 1 in this study the non dimensional drag c d and lift c l coefficients strouhal number st and base pressure coefficient c pb are defined as 4 c d 2f d ρu2 ndl c l 2f l ρu2 ndl 5 st fd u

the pressure at the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and p the reference pressure as suggested in williamson 1996a the normalized spanwise vortex wavelength λ z d refers to the distance between two adjacent co rotating streamwise vortices along the span it is seen from table 1 that the present results are in good agreement with the published experimental and numerical data thus validating the present numerical solution 2 2 simulation parameters and convergence study in the present study 3 d characteristics of the flow around a yawed circular cylinder are investigated under different spanning lengths herein the re u n d ν 500 is employed because in such condition the flow is fully three dimensional williamson 1996b fig 1 shows the 3 d simulation domain boundary conditions and physical configuration the streamwise x cross flow y length of the domain are 60d and 40d respectively where the circular cylinder is located at 15d from the inlet and 45d to the outlet the cylinder is horizontally placed above the bottom plane perpendicular to the two side walls three aspect ratios l l d 25 50 100 and two yaw angles α 0 45 are considered in the present study in fig 1 g denotes the gap distance between the cylinder s lower surface and the bottom wall a fixed gap ratio g d 0 8 is chosen because it is within the intermediate gap ratio region 0 3 g d 1 0 where the bottom wall effect on vortex shedding is significant wang et al 2008a b at the inlet a mean velocity profile is adopted which is defined as 7 u v w u n y 0 u n y tan α where u n y is the velocity profile given by 8 u n y u y u ν 1 κ ln 9 0 y u ν when y u ν 11 63 when y u v 11 63 where y is the height from the bottom wall u is the friction velocity and κ 0 4 is the von kármán constant yu ν 11 63 refers to the boundary between the viscous sub layer and the logarithmic region thapa et al 2014 the neumann boundary conditions are adopted at the outflow free slip boundary conditions are applied to the top boundary the no slip boundary conditions are imposed on the bottom wall and the cylinder surface periodic boundary conditions are used in two side boundaries as shown in fig 2 the computational domain is discretized by a cartesian mesh in the x y plane a uniform mesh with grid spacing δx δy d 32 is used around the cylinder to ensure simulation accuracy the mesh is then stretched out away from this region with the grid resolution being 768 384 in the x y plane in the z direction 256 512 and 1024 planes are uniformly adopted for the cases of l 25 50 and 100 respectively with a grid spacing of δz 0 1d the 3 d mesh dependence study of jiang and cheng 2017 has suggested that spanwise grid spacing δz of 0 1d would not affect the stability of 3 d flow which justifies the adopted spanwise grid to verify the mesh convergence simulations are conducted for flow around a circular cylinder close to a wall at l 25 g d 0 8 α 0 re 500 and δtu n d 0 002 with three different mesh densities as shown in table 2 the differences in hydrodynamic forces and st between mesh a and b are significantly reduced when compared with mesh c for example the maximum difference in root mean square rms drag coefficients c d rms between mesh a and b is less than 5 3 within a reasonable error range the agreement from mesh b and a shows that the results converge at δx δy d 32 the convergence of the computations is further checked by applying three different time step sizes as shown in table 3 marginal differences between these three cases were found validating the convergence in δtu n d 0 002 from above the grid discretization with δx δy d 32 and the non dimensional time step size δtu n d 0 002 were chosen for the following simulations besides based on the adopted grid and time step size the maximum cfl number uδt δx is smaller than 0 5 satisfying the cfl criteria all the simulations are performed on a high performance computing cluster in each case 450 h are approximately required using 64 cpu cores 3 numerical results 3 1 vortex structures figs 3 5 show the instantaneous iso surfaces of vortex structures and the corresponding sectional contours of the dimensionless spanwise vorticity ω z u y x u x y u n d at α 0 and 45 for l 25 50 and 100 respectively when the flow is fully developed the vortex cores are captured by the dimensionless second negative eigenvalue λ 2 λ 2 u n d 2 0 8 of the tensor ψ 2 ω 2 where ψ and ω are the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor u respectively jeong and hussain 1995 the iso surfaces are colored by ω z to differentiate the clockwise in blue and anti clockwise in red rotating spanwise vortices as shown in fig 3 b at α 0 for each typical cross section the recirculation length does not exhibit obvious variation along the span indicating that the free shear layer for the wake is invariant along the cylinder span this leads to the vortex tube as marked by the green dash line in fig 3 a approximately parallel to the axis of the circular cylinder which is defined as the parallel vortex shedding pattern in fig 3 b the vortex shedding suppression and the cross trajectory of the clockwise and counterclockwise vortices are observed in the wake for example at z l 4 8 although a periodic vortex shedding can be found from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder the positive vortex from the lower surface is stretched into a thin vortex filament due to the vortex shedding suppression that is the roll up of the lower shear layer induces the separation of the boundary layer forming a clockwise rotated vortex the merge of the clockwise vortices from the boundary layer and upper shear layer in turn suppresses the vortex shedding from the lower cylinder surface therefore no intact vortex tubes in positive sign red are observed in the wake as shown in fig 3 a besides due to the merge of clockwise vortices the intensity and dimension of these vortices are greater than those of the counterclockwise vortices this leads to the counterclockwise vortices occupy the upper position while clockwise vortices shed from the upper side occupy the lower position this crossing trajectory phenomenon is also found in the wake for flow around a near wall cylinder sarkar and sarkar 2010 chen et al 2019 ji et al 2020 which is different from the wake dynamics in an isolated cylinder case with the yaw angle up to α 45 as shown in fig 3 d it is surprisingly found that the suppression of vortex shedding from the gap side shear layer is undermined that is the vortex shedding is more alike to that of an isolated cylinder compared to the vortex shedding in α 0 this can be demonstrated by the intensified strength of the counterclockwise vortices red in the wake and further proved by the partly neutralized mean lift force as discussed later however the counterclockwise vortices break down into smaller scale vortices and disperse on both the upper and lower position of the clockwise vortices further downstream this leads to the intensification of flow three dimensionality at α 45 than that at α 0 by showing significantly distorted spanwise vortex tubes and irregular streamwise vortices in grey color in the wake as shown in fig 3 c at α 45 although the recirculation length remains approximately identical in each section a significant phase lag of vortex shedding can be observed along the span for example at z l 4 8 a clockwise vortex is just shed from the upper shear layer whereas at z l 8 8 the lower shear layer is about to shed a counterclockwise vortex showing approximately an antiphase vortex shedding pattern between these two sections this spanwise vortex shedding lag leads to the formation of oblique vortex tubes in the wake as shown in fig 3 c that is the rolling axis of the spanwise vortex tube is yawed with respect to the cylinder axis and its orientation is opposite to that of the oncoming flow which is defined as the negatively yawed vortex shedding pattern zhang et al 2020 the oblique angle β between the spanwise tube and the cylinder axis is 12 5 in fig 3 a which is smaller than the flow yaw angle this is similar to the observation of ramberg 1983 for flow passing an isolated cylinder where the spanwise vortex structures are inclined at an angle smaller than the yaw angle of the cylinder as shown in figs 4 a and fig 5 a for α 0 with the increase of the l the spanwise vortex tubes at l 50 and l 100 show increasingly evident waviness than that at l 25 in the wake especially for l 100 the spanwise vortex lines are neither parallel to the cylinder axis nor consistently oblique to it along the span while showing many regional parallel segments this unsynchronized distribution of the spanwise vortex shedding may be related to variations of the vorticity strength in different sections that is for example at z l 8 16 the shear layers with intense vorticity closely wrap the cylinder base fig 5 b and the relatively lower pressure fig 6 a induced by the higher vorticity around the cylinder base delays the shed of the vortex whereas at z l 9 16 there is an obvious gap between the cylinder base and the shear layers thus the relatively higher pressure fig 6 b induced by the lower vorticity locally speeds up the detachment of the vortex shedding due to the phase difference of vortex shedding in different spanwise location significant vortex dislocations williamson 1996b zhao et al 2013 that were observed in the flow passing an isolated cylinder are also observed in l 100 as exemplified by the green dash line in fig 5 a this is different from the observation in l 25 and 50 and that of thapa et al 2014 for flow past a near wall cylinder with l 19 2 where no obvious vortex dislocation along the span is observed the lack of vortex dislocations at l 50 implies that the lower spanning length of the cylinder may limit the development of the three dimensional flow features as shown in figs 4 c and fig 5 c for l 50 and l 100 with α 45 the negatively yawed vortex shedding pattern observed in l 25 and α 45 is also observed in the wake however the absolute value of oblique angle β shows a significant drop from β 12 5 for l 25 to β 4 6 for l 50 which can be attributed to the periodic boundary conditions adopted in the spanwise direction further increase the spanning length to l 100 β shows a small decrease to β 4 0 signifying the convergence of the yaw angle of the vortex tubes and the negligible cylinder end effects that is the yaw angle of the vortex rows is approximately 4 0 at g d 0 8 re n 500 and α 45 and a low cylinder spanning length may result in an unphysical high value besides the vortex rows exhibit more intact linear distribution along the span for l 50 and l 100 comparing that for l 25 due to the same reason discussed above note that for l 100 and α 45 two separated oblique vortex tubes shed from the cylinder along the span indicating that the vortex shedding in the upper and low parts is in different period fig 7 shows the evolution of the instant coherent structures at the middle cross section and the corresponding velocity profiles at different downstream locations for re 500 and l 100 as shown in fig 7 a under the induction of the lower wake vortex marked by a1 from the cylinder shear layer the boundary layer is lifted and then rolled into a clockwise vortex close to the wall marked by b1 where this vortex gradually merges with the clockwise vortex marked by c1 from the upper cylinder surface the streamwise vortical structures marked by the red dash circle generated from the shear layers connect two adjacent spanwise tubes a1 and c1 from the upper side besides some separated streamwise vortical structures roll below the spanwise tube as marked by the blue dash circle and then induce more streamwise vortical structures from the boundary layer as marked by the black dash circle connecting two consecutive spanwise tubes c1 and c2 from the lower side note that due to the periodically induced by the wake vortices from the lower cylinder surface the coherent structures from the boundary layer have the same periodicity as the wake vortices from fig 7 a d as exemplified by the clockwise vortex c1 the corresponding vortex tube in the wake is nearly two dimensional at the beginning and loses its spanwise coherence by the three dimensional destabilization when it convects further downstream which is similar to the distribution of the spanwise tubes in fig 5 a besides further downstream with the increasing disturbance from the irregular wake vortices more small scale streamwise elongated streaks are lifted up from the boundary layer indicating the intensification of wake turbulence during the evolution process of the coherent structures the velocity profile in the wake is significantly changed due to the interactions between the boundary layer and cylinder shear layers for example as shown in fig 7 e at x d 1 the overshot of the velocity is evident in the gap region due to the acceleration of the gap flow besides the velocity deficit right behind the cylinder center is caused by the formation of the anti clockwise vortex for x d 4 the velocity close to wall is smaller than that of the disturbed profile red dotted line which is related to the shielding by the lifted streamwise elongated streak as shown in fig 7 e h the velocity fluctuation gradually decreases with the increase of streamwise location corresponding to the weakening of wake vortices as they convect downstream 3 2 hydrodynamic forces figs 8 and 9 show the spatio temporal distributions of lift coefficients c l for different l at α 0 and α 45 respectively as shown in fig 8 at α 0 the spanwise strips of c l are regularly distributed over time for each l which is related to the periodic vortex shedding of the cylinder however the instantaneous amplitudes of c l are not constant over the entire length but within a finite length of the cylinder thus showing segments with different amplitudes of c l along the span the fluctuation in spanwise c l is related to the different vorticity strength of vortex shedding the discontinuities of adjacent spanwise c l segments are attributed to the vortex dislocations and the length of the segments with different intensity increases with the increasing l which can be observed from vortex structures in figs 3 5 although c l fluctuations are observed along the span the c l strips are generally parallel to the z axis over most of the spanwise region corresponding to the parallel vortex shedding pattern at α 0 as shown in fig 9 at α 45 the lift coefficients show oblique strips as marked by the white dotted line within the spatio temporal domain indicating that vortex shedding does not occur simultaneously along the entire span this is attributed to the inclination of the spanwise vortex rows under the negatively yawed vortex shedding pattern figs 3 5 although obvious phase differences of vortex shedding are observed along the span the adjacent c l strips are parallel to each other note that it is also observed that multiple c l segments caused by large vortex waviness and vortex dislocations move along the cylinder length the moving segments exhibit as a series of oblique strips in the spatio temporal domain as marked by the white dash line showing a traveling wave mode the slopes of the traveling strips with respect to the time indicate the traversing speeds of the c l segments along the cylinder span which are approximately identical to the spanwise component of the incoming flow velocity table 4 lists the mean and rms values of the drag and lift coefficients with the fluid forces being sampled since the flow is fully developed it is seen that the mean drag and lift coefficients are virtually the same at different l for α 0 while the rms values of the drag and lift coefficients at l 100 show a significant decrease compared with those at l 25 this may be caused by the intensified waviness of the vortex rows at a larger spanning length and the resultant non negligible phase lags of the fluid forces at different spanwise positions note that compared to the rms lift coefficients of an isolated cylinder as listed in table 1 c l rms in the near wall cases shows a significant drop owing to the vortex shedding suppression caused by the adjacent plane boundary moreover the mean lift coefficient is negative for the cases at α 0 indicating the attractive force on the cylinder to the wall as explained in chen et al 2019 attractive mean lift may appear at an intermediate g d owing to the deflection of the stagnation point and the streamwise velocity difference on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder compared to the results with α 0 the value of c d shows moderate increments in the cases with l 50 and 100 while the absolute value of c l displays a small drop in the yawed conditions all these changes are related to the enhancement of the gap side vortex shedding from the cylinder as discussed above that is with stronger counterclockwise vortices shed from the lower surface of the cylinder the base pressure decreases which leads to a larger mean drag moreover the absolute value of the mean lift is reduced owing to the slightly recovered symmetry of the wake note that the results with l 25 are atypical due to the non negligible end effects and the non fully developed 3 d wake drastic drops are observed on the rms drag and lift coefficients c d rms and c l rms in the yawed conditions which is attributed to the cancellation of the fluid forces at different spanwise sections ji et al 2020 the effect of the yaw angle on the validity of the ip is further investigated by comparing the mean and rms values of drag and lift coefficients at different yaw angles and spanning lengths the first order statistics c d and c l verify the ip at all l with the maximum difference of 14 3 existing at l 100 for c l however for the second order statistics c d rms and c l rms remarkable drops ranging from 50 to 80 are observed signifying the invalidity of the ip in the yawed flow with α 45 as mentioned in lam and lin 2008 the mean drag coefficient for a circular cylinder is inversely proportional to the average vortex formation lengths and a longer vortex formation and lower values of streamwise turbulence intensity would minimize the fluctuating lift here the vortex formation length is defined as the streamwise distance from the center of the cylinder to the point where the maximum value of rms streamwise velocity is achieved along the wake axis williamson 1996b therefore the time averaged dimensionless rms values u rms u n of the fluctuating streamwise velocity distributions along the wake centerline y 0 x direction are plotted in fig 10 for different spanning lengths and yaw angles as shown in fig 10 similar trends are observed in the u rms u n distributions for different spanning lengths and yaw angles for example at α 0 the u rms u n distributions along the wake centerline for different spanning lengths peak at nearly the same streamwise position although the intensity of u rms u n varies this leads to identical vortex formation lengths for l 25 50 and 100 which can also be reflected by the same spatio and temporal averaged mean drag coefficients c d in these conditions as listed in table 4 increasing the yaw angle to α 45 differences in the peak u rms u n position between different spanning length cases are obtained the vortex formation length for l 25 becomes larger than that of l 50 and l 100 thus leading a smaller c d see table 4 as shown in fig 10 the maximum values of the turbulence intensity u rms u n increase with the increasing l for both α 0 and 45 however the c l rms in the two cases decreases with the increasing l this seems to contradict to the conclusion stated in lam and lin 2008 that lower streamwise turbulence intensity would reduce the fluctuating lift to fill the gap the spatial averaged sectional fluid force coefficients c d c l c d r m s and c l r m s are calculated and listed in table 5 note that these fluid force coefficients are first averaged over time and then space however the force coefficients such as c d c l c d rms and c l rms being equivalent to c d c l c d r m s and c l r m s respectively are first averaged over the cylinder span and then time and thus they can be taken as time averaged global force coefficients compare tables 4 and 5 it is found that c d and c l have the same values with c d and c l respectively indicating the swap of the averaging order has no effects on the first order statistics however the second order statistics c d r m s and c l r m s are significantly larger than their global counterparts c d rms and c l rms especially for the α 45 cases this is easy to be understood that when the instantaneous fluid forces are first averaged along the cylinder span the phase lags caused by the wake three dimensionality and the inclined vortex shedding lead to the cancellation of the forces along the span however no spanwise cancellation exists when the instantaneous fluid forces are first averaged over time compare the values of c d r m s and c l r m s at α 0 and 45 it is found that the spatio averaged sectional rms drag and lift coefficient display a small step up with an increase in the yaw angle being opposite to the significant drops of c d rms and c l rms the small step up of c d r m s and c l r m s can be attributed to the mildly enhanced gap side vortex shedding at α 45 as discussed above now let us focus on the relationship between c l r m s representing the local fluctuating lift force and the profiles of u rms u n along the wake centerline the value of c l r m s increases with the increasing l following the trend of the peak value of u rms u n well which verifies the relationship suggested in lam and lin 2008 based on the uneven distributions of the lift coefficients along the span in figs 8 9 the variation of the sectional lift coefficient in the axial direction is further quantitatively examined by the correlation factor defined as r z 1 z 2 c l z 1 c l z 2 c l rms z 1 c l rms z 2 zhao et al 2013 where c l z c l z c l z is the fluctuating lift coefficient c l z is the time averaged lift coefficient c l rms z is the rms lift coefficient fig 11 shows the spanwise distributions of the r 0 z for different yawed angles and spanning lengths referring to as the correlation between the end section z d 0 of the cylinder and other sections along the span as shown in fig 11 at α 0 with increasing l from 25 to 100 the r 0 z shows increasingly significant fluctuations along the span while the maximum of the r 0 z gradually reduces indicating a decline of the spanwise correlation for vortex shedding for example for l 25 r 0 z is ranging from 0 79 to 1 showing a positive correlation this indicates that the phase of vortex shedding at different sections are similar along the span however for l 100 the r 0 z is generally decreasing along the span till z l 0 75 with the r 0 z being close to 0 in the range of z l 0 65 0 8 the decreasing trend of r 0 z with the increasing l is related to the vortex dislocations as shown in fig 5 a note that the r 0 z at α 0 is not symmetrical along the span due to the curved and distorted 3 d vortex structures in the wake however at α 45 the r 0 z is generally symmetrical about the z l 0 5 for each l case as shown in fig 11 compared with those at α 0 the fluctuations of r 0 z along the span are less obvious due to the linearly oblique vortex structures at α 45 for l 25 and l 50 the r 0 z decreases first and then increases along the axial direction the negative correlation factors are found in the range of z l 0 25 to z l 0 75 with the minimum of r 0 z 0 7 at z l 0 5 this demonstrates that the vortex shedding of the end and middle section of the cylinder are nearly in antiphase owing to the linearly oblique vortex rows and the periodic spanwise boundary conditions besides the wavelengths of r 0 z for l 25 and l 50 along the span are 25d and 50d respectively however for l 100 the wavelength of r 0 z is equal to 50d by showing two wave troughs at z l 0 25 and z l 0 75 respectively therefore it is reflected by the two oblique vortex tubes along the cylinder in the wake as shown in fig 5 c it is seen from the wavelength of r 0 z in fig 11 that a lower spanning length of the cylinder may limit the development of 3 d flow and the spanning length of the cylinder should be no less than 50d in the specific configuration to inherently exhibit the three dimensional characteristics of the flow fig 12 shows the normalized frequency spectra of c l and c d for different yaw angles and spanning lengths where the frequency is normalized by the maximum amplitude of the frequency intensity in each case by applying fast fourier transform on the lift coefficients along the span not shown here the vortex shedding frequencies are identically distributed over the entire span therefore only the frequency results of lift and drag coefficients of the middle section are plotted in fig 12 for l 25 the dominant frequency of lift coefficient f l at α 0 is 0 255 whereas the f l is equal to 0 253 at α 45 this small deviation between the normal and yaw inflow case indicates that the ip is valid in predicting the vortex shedding frequency for l 50 and l 100 the dominant f l 0 253 is independent on the yaw angle as shown in fig 12 the dominant frequencies of the lift and drag coefficients are identical for an individual case it is different from that of the isolated cylinder case where the dominant frequency of the drag coefficient f d is twice of the dominant f l williamson 1996b zdravkovich 2003 besides the dominant f l for each case is larger than that of the isolated cylinder case st 0 207 this indicates that the presence of the bottom wall would speed up the vortex shedding as shown in fig 12 a at α 0 only a dominant peak is observed in the lift frequency curves for each l case however with increasing the yaw angle up to α 45 more peaks with relatively high intensities are obtained in the lift frequency domain which is related to the intensified irregularly arranged streamwise vortices in the wake as a consequence the spanwise vortices are curved and then split into small scale eddies due to the disturbance by the streamwise vortex generated axial flow this behavior also changes the frequency distribution of turbulence fluctuation of the wake flow which induces wider signal bandwidth and multiple secondary frequencies in the frequency spectrum note that the multi frequency features are especially evident for l 25 and the peaks of the lift frequency curves are more concentrated with the increasing of l 3 3 pressure coefficient and shear stress as demonstrated in section 3 1 the interaction between the cylinder wake and the bottom wall leads to the suppression of the lower surface vortex shedding in turn the vortex shedding effects on the force distributions of the bottom wall are established by examining the pressure coefficient c p and shear stress τ along the wall the shear stress τ is defined as follows 9 τ μ u y 2 w y 2 where μ is the fluid viscosity and the velocity components u and w are normalized by the u n the c p and τ distribution on the bottom wall are critical in predicting the scour profiles of the deformable seabed beneath the subsea cylindrical structures for example the shear stress τ is important for calculating the shields parameter which is important for predicting the sediment incipient motion of the sandy seabed liang et al 2005a b zhao and cheng 2010 ong et al 2010 the interaction dynamics between the cylinder wake and the bottom wall are examined by the instantaneous vortex shedding and the corresponding c p and τ along the wall for different spanwise sections with α 0 and α 45 l 25 as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 in fig 14 a at α 0 due to the intensification of the gap flow velocity c p is minimum right below the cylinder on the bottom wall in the downstream c p reaches a local maximum between 2 x d 4 indicating the existence of an adverse pressure gradient this is related to the separation of the wall boundary layer and the resultant secondary vortex for example as shown in fig 13 b the counter clockwise vortex shed from the lower cylinder surface induces the separation of the wall boundary layer leading to a local reversal flow along the bottom wall manifested by the recirculation zone approximately at x d 2 4 in fig 14 b the shear stress reaches the maximum underneath the cylinder and a secondary peak around at x d 2 due to the separated wall boundary layer as shown in fig 13 a d note that the maximum suction pressure c p 0 and the maximum shear stress both occur right underneath the cylinder leading to a maximum depth of the equilibrium scour hole liang et al 2005a b zhao and cheng 2010 as shown in fig 14 a and b similar trends are observed in the distributions of bottom wall c p as well as τ along the x direction for different spanwise sections indicating that the vortex shedding effects on the bottom wall are comparable along the span as shown in fig 14 c and d at α 45 the distribution of c p shows significant variations along the span indicating the different vortex shedding phases see fig 13 e h however the τ displays consistent distributions near the cylinder with a relatively stable maximum value occurring underneath the cylinder similar to that at α 0 note that both the c p and τ on the bottom wall exhibit evident fluctuations further downstream due to the complex interactions between the disordered vortices from the shear layers and the wall boundary layer as shown in fig 13 e h to improve the understanding of the bottom wall c p and τ involved in the subsea cylindrical structures with different yaw angles and spanning lengths the temporal and spatio averaged c p and τ on the bottom wall right underneath the cylinder are listed in table 6 respectively it is shown that under a specific l both the mean suction pressure c p negative and the mean shear stress τ increase with the increasing of yaw angle for example the differences of the c p between the normal flow α 0 and yawed flow condition α 45 for l 25 50 100 are 4 4 7 9 and 7 9 respectively while the differences of the τ between α 0 and α 45 conditions are 6 5 for each l both of which prove the ip validity 4 conclusions this paper presents a three dimensional dns of flow around a yawed circular cylinder close to a bottom wall with a parameter space of l 25 100 α 0 45 g d 0 8 and re 500 the spanning length and yaw angle effects on 3 d vortex structures hydrodynamics and forces distributions on the bottom wall have been investigated and presented at α 0 the spanwise vortex tube is parallel to the cylinder axis forming a parallel vortex shedding pattern whereas the parallel vortex shedding is undermined with the increasing l the vortex formation lengths are identical for all l while turbulence intensities increase with the increasing l due to vortex shedding suppression a crossing trajectory phenomenon where the counterclockwise vortices from the lower surface occupy the upper position while the clockwise vortices occupy the lower position is observed in the wake for all cases at α 45 the spanwise vortex tubes are yawed with respect to the cylinder axis forming negatively yawed vortex shedding patterns and the oblique angle between the spanwise tubes and the cylinder axis decreases with the increase of l two oblique vortex tubes are generated along the cylinder for l 100 compared with only one oblique tube for l 25 and l 50 the vortex formation length for l 25 becomes slightly larger than that of l 50 and l 100 whereas the value of turbulence intensity increases with the increasing l the fluctuation features and spanwise correlation of the vortex structures can be reflected inherently by the three dimensional hydrodynamic forces the spanwise vortex dislocations cause the discontinuous segments of the lift coefficients along the span and the segments in different intensities increase with the increasing l at α 0 the maximum of the correlation factor r 0 z gradually reduces with increasing l from 25 to 100 indicating a decline of the spanwise correlation for vortex shedding at α 45 the r 0 z is generally symmetrical about the z l 0 5 for each l case besides for l 25 50 and 100 the wavelengths of r 0 z are 25d 50d and 50d respectively which indicates that the cylinder length should be at least 50d to inherently reflect the 3 d characteristics of the flow at α 0 only a dominant peak is observed in the lift frequency spectra for each l case at α 45 more peaks in relatively high intensities are obtained in the lift frequency domain and with the increasing of l the magnitudes of the secondary frequencies are reduced and the peaks of the lift frequency curves are more concentrated the vortex shedding pattern also influences the distributions of the pressure coefficient c p and shear stress τ on the bottom wall where the maximum c p negative and τ occur right underneath the cylinder and the corresponding suction pressure and the shear stress increase with the increasing yaw angle independence principle ip is valid for predicting the first order fluid force statistics vortex shedding frequency and the wall pressure and shear stress but fails for predicting the second order fluid force statistics owing to the wake three dimensionality and the oblique vortex shedding in the present study the reynolds number of 500 is relatively low when compared to the full scale applications although the present results at lower re can provide some insights into the wake modes and hydrodynamic features direct numerical simulations of flows past a long cylinder in real life cases at higher re are needed to be investigated in the future for further understanding the underlying physics of more realistic flows around the power lines and subsea pipelines credit authorship

20457,in the present article a novel mathematical model formulation is introduced to account for the effect of heeling of the ship while manoeuvring in calm water harbour conditions the mathematical model is based on a comprehensive captive manoeuvring test program carried out with the well known benchmark hull kcs where the roll motion was forced with a newly installed harmonic roll actuator the new mathematical model was implemented in the ship manoeuvring simulator and compared against free running model tests the simulator model after slight tuning seems capable of capturing the manoeuvring motion of the ship in 6 dof however additional research is planned with respect to the effect of the transverse stability and the draft of the ship keywords manoeuvring roll shallow water

although a ship is primarily designed to transport as many goods as possible in an economic way thus with small resistance and effective propulsion its manoeuvrability may not be disregarded as sooner or later a ship will need to manoeuvre to reach its destination one of the effects that is mostly neglected in the study of the manoeuvrability is the effect of roll motion or heel it is however a well known fact that the roll motion of a ship is of importance especially ships with a low transverse stability lever g m are prone to severe roll motion influence in such cases it is beneficial to include the fourth degree of freedom in the manoeuvring prediction models for such ships as for example stated at the simman 2008 workshop to that aim the effect of the roll motion on the common manoeuvring derivatives in the horizontal plane has become a field of interest for various researchers especially over the last 25 years however this does not mean that research started then for instance son and nomoto 1981 discussed already 40 years ago the effect of the roll motion on container ships the effect of the roll on the steerability was further investigated by kijima and furukawa 1998 aiming at relating the value of g m with the course stability of a ship this led to an approximate formula for the course stability of the ship which was later updated by yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 in 2003 a captive roll oscillator was installed to the pmm system at kriso korea to include the roll motion kim et al 2003 based on the captive model test results the hull forces were expressed in an mmg like model and standard manoeuvring trials were simulated confirming the influence of g m the 2011 report of the 26th ittc manoeuvring committee stated that already several institutes had started to conduct captive roll motion tests in particular japanese researchers are active in this field like yoshimura 2011 yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 or fukui et al 2015 the common ground of all these articles is the use of captive roll tests to retrieve the 4 dof derivatives identified in the mmg model the larger the roll motion becomes the more it affects the other manoeuvring derivatives validations are commonly performed with free running tests the use of the captive roll tests combined with other excursions leads however to massive test programs to cover all possible variations in order to minimize the number of tests for new ship models yasukawa et al 2019 proposes a practical extrapolation model applicable to determine roll dependent manoeuvring derivatives of course apart from model testing one can study the effect of the roll motion by other means as well already in the early days of cfd wilson and stern 2002 studied the roll motion of a naval ship at different frequencies alternatively one can combine different methods like the use of support vector machines combined with model tests see for instance wang et al 2013 or rely to advanced potential flow techniques as demonstrated by dashtimanesh et al 2019 nevertheless the present article relies on captive model tests to study the effect of the roll motion on the other degrees of freedom and how a 6 dof manoeuvring model can be established for harbour manoeuvres accounting these effects to that aim the carriage of the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water flanders hydraulics research co operation with ghent university has been updated in 2017 with a captive roll mode which enables to combine harmonic or fixed heel with any other motion in the horizontal degree of freedom in the present study the well known benchmark hull kcs is covered a hull that is especially prone to heel influence and especially parametric roll tello ruiz et al 2019 nevertheless it should be emphasized that the present field of study is not oriented towards external effects such as wind or waves inducing the roll motion numerous literature can be found in this field in contrast information on the coupling effect between roll be it externally induced or not to the open water manoeuvring derivatives and vice versa is more scarce as shown above and deserves the additional attention given here 2 experimental research the experimental research has been carried out in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water flanders hydraulics research co operation with ghent university in this tank with main dimensions 80 7 0 5 m³ both free running and captive manoeuvring tests can be carried out during captive model tests the surge sway yaw and roll motions of the ship model are imposed by the mechanism of the towing tank while the heave and pitch motions are free the captive motion modes can be controlled independently a comprehensive description of the tank can be found in delefortrie et al 2016b however information on the harmonic roll actuator was not yet provided in that article with this roll actuator fixed values as well as harmonic motions can be imposed within the following limits 1 15 ϕ 15 p 16 s p 40 s ² especially the acceleration can be restrictive but in practice the maximal accelerations are limited by the maximal forces and moments that may act on the ship model the axis of the roll motion is a fixed one and is located on the calm water plane during the towing tank tests the heel angle of the ship model is continuously monitored the roll velocity is obtained through numerical derivation of the roll angle time series the tests discussed in this article were carried out with the appended benchmark ship kcs at a scale factor of 52 67 fhr ship model code c04 no roll damping devices such as bilge keels were included table 1 shows its main particulars the largest g m value was used to execute forced roll tests at 100 ukc 50 ukc 20 ukc and 10 ukc with the smallest g m value forced roll tests free decay tests and parametric roll tests have been carried out at 100 ukc a common open water program aiming to identify a mathematical model suitable for harbour manoeuvring simulations should cover a wide range of possible conditions such as speeds between 5 knots astern and 17 knots ahead ukc dependent combined with thrust ahead or astern and different rudder angles between 35 covering in this way a full 360 range of drift and yaw angles such program which consists already of more than 300 tests was then extended with forced roll tests and tests at discrete heel angles different from zero in the remaining part of this article model scale speeds will be used 1 knot full scale corresponds to 0 071 m s model scale with the newly installed roll actuator harmonic forced roll tests were carried out as follows 2 ϕ t ϕ m ϕ a sin 2 π t t such a test always begins and ends always at the average heel angle ϕ m the variations are different as a function of the under keel clearance and loading condition these are summarised in table 2 for the loading condition with large g m c0401 and in table 3 and table 4 for the loading condition with small g m c0402 in the large g m condition the heel of the ship was also slowly period 380 s harmonically varied from 5 to 5 2 5 2 5 for the smaller water depths during the steady state condition when sailing at 0 142 m s and for different drift angles 0 5 10 25 40 55 70 90 a selection of tests at zero drift angle was repeated at constant heel angles of 2 5 and 5 the latter only for under keel clearances 50 in the small g m condition free roll decay tests have been carried out according to table 5 the conventions used in this paper are based on the coordinate systems shown in fig 1 the origin o of the ship fixed system is determined as follows located amidships on the static waterline corresponding to the static loading condition even keel no heel in the longitudinal plane of symmetry in practice due to the small applied heel angles and occurring pitch motions a horizontally bound axis system 0 x y z is used the ship s position in the tank is referred to a tank fixed axis system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 3 roll observations 3 1 large g m with this loading condition only forced roll tests have been carried out in this section the most remarkable findings will be discussed using the following definitions low frequency roll 5 amplitude 10 s period high frequency roll 4 amplitude 2 s period note that latter is consider a high frequent motion for calm water manoeuvring not for seakeeping the roll moment during the forced roll tests at zero speed has been plotted in fig 2 at low frequency the signal is regular and can be described by a first order harmonic however at high frequency the signal seems more scattered fourier analysis in fig 3 reveals that the signal is periodic with a strong fifth order harmonic and that the measurement is thus repeatable the same effect is observed for the pitch motion which indicates a strong pitch roll coupling fig 4 shows a view of the transom of the kcs at different heeled water lines while rolling a large part of the transom emerges from the water at high frequency the pitch response to the roll movement is delayed due to the increased damping see fig 5 the test starts at almost zero trim with a movement towards positive roll angles the trim responds hydrostatically with a negative angle however with some delay the recovery of the trim is slower compared to the recovery of the roll towards zero degrees and shows even overshoot the fifth order component is then ascribed to the hydrostatic component base the combinations of roll velocity acceleration and pitch roll pitch roll pitch roll pitch roll pitch 3 2 small g m in this loading condition both roll decay tests and forced roll tests have been carried out 3 2 1 free decay tests roll decay tests have been carried out at four different forward speeds 0 0 223 0 449 and 0 589 m s and at two initial angles 6 and 9 an example of the decay motion can be found in fig 6 the fit on the figure is a linear first order fit 3 k p i x x p k p p m g g m ϕ 0 both model and measurement coincide in fig 6 the roll period varies between 4 8 s and 5 1 s respectively for the tests at 0 589 m s and at 0 m s this means that both k p and k p are speed dependent moreover the decay is weaker when the initial angle is larger in other words the absolute value of k p is smaller for the tests starting at 9 see also fig 7 3 2 2 forced roll tests the results from the forced roll tests are compared with the results from the free decay tests by fitting the measured roll moment with equation 3 the effect of sailing speed and roll amplitude are confirmed and the predicted roll derivatives are of the same magnitude as for the roll decay tests see fig 8 based on the forced roll tests the influence of the roll frequency can be analysed as well the roll added moment of inertia decreases with increasing frequency to reach a minimal value at a certain speed dependent frequency and to increase again with increasing frequency the roll damping derivative increases more or less linearly with the roll frequency 4 mathematical model 4 1 set of equations the goal is to update the manoeuvring model presented by delefortrie et al 2016 to take into account the roll coupling in terms of inertia and centrifugal terms the attention is drawn to the terms depending of p and p 4 x i c m u v r x g r 2 y g r z g p r 5 y i c m v u r x g r y g r 2 z g p 6 z i c 0 m v p x g p r y g p z g p 2 7 k i c i x x p i x z r i y x p r i y z r 2 m v p y g v u r z g 8 m i c i x y p i y z r i x z p 2 r 2 i x x i z z p r m v p x g u v r z g 9 n i c i z z r i x z p i x y p 2 i y z p r m v u r x g u v r y g the above equations can be further simplified as y g 0 for the kcs the terms with the product of inertia can also be neglected i x z has a marginal amplitude while i x y and i y z are zero due to symmetry the test program considered a maximal heel angle of 5 at that point the ship bound axis system rotates with 5 around the x axis of the horizontal bound system see fig 1 a lateral variable is then influenced as follows for instance the sway velocity of the ship is when only the lateral carriage moves at velocity v 10 v v cos 5 0 996 v v the ship bound axis system can thus still be considered horizontal bound the authors are aware that larger heel angles can occur for instance when initiating a turning circle in the following sections the focus will be put on the hull forces of the modular mathematical model it seems that the roll motions present in the program do not significantly affect the propulsion and steering induced terms in the other degrees of freedom in other words the reader can be referred to delefortrie et al 2021 for a discussion of the forces generated by the rudder of the kcs and delefortrie and eloot 2021 for a presentation of the propulsion and induced terms in particular for the single propeller rudder kcs ship the formulation of the propulsion induced roll moment is 11 k p k t p β k t p γ k t p β k t p γ k p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ k ε sgn β γ π 2 t p ε whereas the steering induced component is 12 k r z r a h ε z ε f y 4 2 mathematical model of hull forces 4 2 1 roll dependency 4 2 1 1 introduction of a hydrodynamic roll angle in all degrees of freedom hydrodynamic forces and moments are to a greater or lesser extent affected by the roll angle and its time derivatives these effects are not only dependent of the roll motion parameters but also on the ship s longitudinal speed moreover higher order effects can be observed at higher frequencies and the ship is even prone to parametric rolling which also exerts significant forces in the horizontal degrees of freedom but which is out of scope here to take account of higher order effects in the damping it was decided to introduce a hydrodynamic angle κ which expresses the roll speed dependency analogously as the speed components in the other degrees of freedom 13 tan κ 0 5 p l pp u the use of the ship length in the numerator may seem strange in combination with a roll motion but it allows to have a better spread of κ and a better prediction of the regression results the effect of κ will be expressed by tabular functions for the different degrees of freedom the models are expressed for the following κ values 0 5 10 30 40 90 150 160 170 180 the roll dependency models have been computed for the large and small g m loading conditions the latter being shown by blue data points on the following figures 4 2 1 2 longitudinal force the roll dependency on the longitudinal force is minor but yet a mathematical model has been built which is the following function 14 x x p m l p ρ 2 l t u 2 p l pp 2 2 x κ ρ 2 l t u 2 x β 0 the coefficients have been represented in fig 9 and the marginal influence of the roll motion is reflected in the significance of the coefficients thus one may neglect as well the roll dependency on the surge force 4 2 1 3 lateral force the lateral force is computed as follows 15 y y p m l m z g p ρ 2 l t u 2 p l pp 2 2 y κ y ϕ g y u ϕ u g l m ϕ the lateral force is affected by the roll moment which is expressed by y ϕ but on the other hand there is a clear effect of the combination roll angle and longitudinal speed which has been reported in literature and is modelled with y u ϕ both terms are represented in fig 10 y ϕ is more or less constant at the largest under keel clearances and is proportional to g m however its value tends to double for the smaller under keel clearances this has several reasons on one hand the maximal roll angle decreases from 5 to 2 5 but on the other hand the roll moment itself does not decrease due to the increased roll damping k p at smaller under keel clearances y ϕ seems directly connected to the roll moment measurement and should not be included in the simulator an open issue is to what extent a correlation occurs between the sway force and the roll moment during the execution of captive model tests in case of a dynamic roll motion variable roll angle the centre of gravity will oscillate laterally and this will cause an oscillatory inertia force which will be measured in the sway force y u ϕ has not only a different sign for the two loading conditions but also between 50 ukc and the other water depths the sign swap at 50 ukc is probably a mathematical issue see also the trend for y p in fig 11 as both y u ϕ and y p have the wrong sign they may lead to the same result the roll velocity dependency has been plotted in fig 11 the function s magnitude increases with decreasing under keel clearance and increasing g m the effect of the roll acceleration is marginal 4 2 1 4 heave force the roll angle has mainly a hydrostatic effect on the heave force which is expressed by a quadratic relationship 16 z m z g p 2 z ϕ ϕ m g ϕ 2 m g t u h 2 z β 0 the resulting z ϕ ϕ has been plotted in fig 12 as expected its value is more or less constant for the different loading conditions and water depths z ϕ ϕ 0 95 0 06 m g at lower ukc frequency effects have been observed however it was decided not to include them in the model 4 2 1 5 roll moment the roll moment is modelled as follows 17 k k p m t 2 i x x p ρ 2 l t 2 u 2 p l pp 2 2 k κ m g g m ϕ mind that the roll speed is quadratic instead of the more common p p the sign is governed by the k κ function regressions were carried out with both options however no major differences were observed if p p is used the k κ function becomes symmetric fig 13 presents the outcome based on the quadratic roll speed k p increases with decreasing g m and under keel clearance the roll damping function increases with decreasing under keel clearance and increasing g m 4 2 1 6 pitch moment as for the heave force the pitch moment is dependent of the roll angle however due to the frequency dependency in the roll pitch coupling a damping function is needed as well which leads to the following formulation 18 m m ϕ ϕ m g l ϕ 2 ρ 2 l 2 t u 2 p l pp 2 2 m κ m g l t u h 2 m β 0 fig 14 shows the regression coefficients for the different series because of the frequency dependency the supposedly constant hydrostatic term m ϕ ϕ shows more variation compared to the heave force m ϕ ϕ 0 07 0 02 m g l 4 2 1 7 yaw moment the yaw moment is significantly influenced by the frequency of the roll motion and this dependency increases with the vessel s speed which leads to the following formulation 19 n n p m l 2 n u u p m l g u 2 p ρ 2 l 2 t u 2 p l pp 2 2 n κ n ϕ g n u ϕ u g l m l ϕ the different coefficients are shown in fig 15 for 50 ukc there is an unbalance but for the other conditions n p can be considered constant and the speed frequency dependency increases with decreasing under keel clearance the same is true for the roll velocity dependency although the terms in ϕ appeared not to contribute to the yawing moment they have been added in eq 19 for consistency with eq 15 4 2 2 other dependencies the other components of the hull forces have been modelled like mentioned in delefortrie et al 2016a fig 16 shows an example for the drift functions which show the known behaviour as a function of the ukc the question then was whether or not roll sway or roll yaw coupling should be modelled or not to do so the model deviations were investigated as a function of roll angle for tests with yaw or drift in most of the cases the roll angle had not a significant influence on the deviations however at small ukc the sway velocity has an influence on the roll dependency for the sway force and the roll moment especially if the sway velocity and roll angle have the same sign such observations are a result of a complex flow which can be ascribed to the changed local under keel clearance of the ship s side that is under attack it was decided not to include these effects and further adaptation of the mathematical models was not needed 4 2 3 validation a first validation is performed in table 6 by comparing the measured x forces and moments with the modelled y forces and moment in general the agreement is acceptable and even excellent for the heave at 100 ukc the pitch moment is hard to model due to the pitch roll coupling and the transom section of the kcs 5 simulations 5 1 overview the above mentioned mathematical model has been implemented in the ship manoeuvring simulator and fast time simulations have been performed with the large g m case the downside is that this deliberately limits the roll motion of the ship but only in this condition sufficient water depths are available to see the influence of the under keel clearance to check whether the mathematical model works at lower g m values a comparison with free running tests is shown in section 5 5 special attention was needed for the roll moment derivatives of previously developed ships which have been expressed as see delefortrie et al 2016a 20 k p ϕ δ g m t k p i x x p k u p u p for these ships k κ can be expressed as a function of k p and k u p 21 k κ sin κ k p u 2 p l 2 2 cos κ sin κ k u p 0 25 ρ l 2 t 2 u 2 p l 2 2 based on test simulations the nonlinear extra damping term ϕ δ g m t k p i x x should be maintained in the new model formulation as well standard manoeuvring trials are presented using the telegraph positions mentioned in table 7 5 2 acceleration trials fig 17 shows the obtained speeds for the different telegraph positions and under keel clearances some ahead speeds above the red line are not achievable due to excessive sinkage all other manoeuvres will therefore focus on the telegraph position slow in fig 18 the most relevant time signals have been shown a pid controller is used to maintain a straight track which requires a small negative rudder angle rudder actions have a direct influence on the heel angle which is the largest 0 3 at the smallest under keel clearance remark that the small trimming attitude of the vessel is either by the bow or by the stern 5 3 turning circles fig 19 shows the main parameters of the 35 turning circles at telegraph position slow the outward heel at larger under keel clearances changes into inward heel at 10 and 20 ukc the damping of the heel motion seems difficult at 10 ukc due to the speed reduction while turning the sinkage reduces significantly 5 4 zigzag tests fig 20 shows the relevant parameters of the 20 20 zigzag tests at telegraph position slow the overshoot angles decrease and the period increases with decreasing under keel clearance the speed drop during the manoeuvre is more significant at larger under keel clearances again the heel motion is opposite and less damped at smaller under keel clearances 5 5 comparison with free running tests in the frame of simman 2021 free running tests have been carried out in 2018 with the initial stability lever set to g m 0 6 on full scale both 50 and 20 ukc were covered in the program as the latter is to be discussed at simman 2021 the focus is here put on 50 ukc 20 5 zigzag tests which were repeated at least 5 times the key results can be found in table 8 although the periods overlap when the manoeuvre starts to starboard or to port there is a significant difference in overshoot angles between both directions in the simulator the g m was set to 0 6 m and the same mathematical model was used however to match the free running trials tuning was needed for several terms in table 9 an overview of the multiplicators applied to obtain a fair agreement the tuning of the rudder forces f x and f y is straightforward as these force components are measured during free running tests as well hence a direct comparison with the simulated forces is possible the need for the tuning of f x and f y can be explained by the fact that the simulations were carried out with the original mathematical model for the rudder forces delefortrie 2016a it was also the main trigger to derive a new mathematical model for the prediction of lift and drag of the rudder as presented in delefortrie et al 2021 an explanation for the need to adapt y β is under investigation given the original simulation model and the tuning a comparison is performed for the 20 5 and 20 5 zigzag test as shown in fig 21 and fig 22 mind that the higher frequency fluctuations present on v and ϕ are caused by measurement inaccuracies rather than smoothening the signal it was provided as is but the reader should focus on the low frequent similarities especially in the tuned simulation the tracks are well predicted 6 conclusions in this article open water manoeuvring tests with the benchmark ship kcs have been studied with specific attention to the rolling of the ship while manoeuvring the newly implemented roll engine on the towing carriage was used to conduct an extensive study on the rolling behaviour of the ship the kcs seems particularly vulnerable to roll due to its transom s shape this vulnerability was also shown previously with the execution of parametric roll tests the mathematical manoeuvring models have been adapted to cope with the additional captive roll motion and resulting measurements the formulation of the mathematical model in the ship manoeuvring simulator was adapted accordingly fast time simulations in combination with free running tests showed that the simulation model is capable of predicting the behaviour of the ship in 6 dof although some tuning was needed a more comprehensive study with captive model tests involving multiple g m and draft variations is planned for mid 2021 to fully capture the effect on the roll moment after that simulations are planned where degrees of freedom can be des activated to investigate the effect of each degree of freedom for instance simulations can be carried out with roll heave and pitch being restrained credit authorship contribution statement guillaume delefortrie conceptualization

20457,in the present article a novel mathematical model formulation is introduced to account for the effect of heeling of the ship while manoeuvring in calm water harbour conditions the mathematical model is based on a comprehensive captive manoeuvring test program carried out with the well known benchmark hull kcs where the roll motion was forced with a newly installed harmonic roll actuator the new mathematical model was implemented in the ship manoeuvring simulator and compared against free running model tests the simulator model after slight tuning seems capable of capturing the manoeuvring motion of the ship in 6 dof however additional research is planned with respect to the effect of the transverse stability and the draft of the ship keywords manoeuvring roll shallow water

although a ship is primarily designed to transport as many goods as possible in an economic way thus with small resistance and effective propulsion its manoeuvrability may not be disregarded as sooner or later a ship will need to manoeuvre to reach its destination one of the effects that is mostly neglected in the study of the manoeuvrability is the effect of roll motion or heel it is however a well known fact that the roll motion of a ship is of importance especially ships with a low transverse stability lever g m are prone to severe roll motion influence in such cases it is beneficial to include the fourth degree of freedom in the manoeuvring prediction models for such ships as for example stated at the simman 2008 workshop to that aim the effect of the roll motion on the common manoeuvring derivatives in the horizontal plane has become a field of interest for various researchers especially over the last 25 years however this does not mean that research started then for instance son and nomoto 1981 discussed already 40 years ago the effect of the roll motion on container ships the effect of the roll on the steerability was further investigated by kijima and furukawa 1998 aiming at relating the value of g m with the course stability of a ship this led to an approximate formula for the course stability of the ship which was later updated by yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 in 2003 a captive roll oscillator was installed to the pmm system at kriso korea to include the roll motion kim et al 2003 based on the captive model test results the hull forces were expressed in an mmg like model and standard manoeuvring trials were simulated confirming the influence of g m the 2011 report of the 26th ittc manoeuvring committee stated that already several institutes had started to conduct captive roll motion tests in particular japanese researchers are active in this field like yoshimura 2011 yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 or fukui et al 2015 the common ground of all these articles is the use of captive roll tests to retrieve the 4 dof derivatives identified in the mmg model the larger the roll motion becomes the more it affects the other manoeuvring derivatives validations are commonly performed with free running tests the use of the captive roll tests combined with other excursions leads however to massive test programs to cover all possible variations in order to minimize the number of tests for new ship models yasukawa et al 2019 proposes a practical extrapolation model applicable to determine roll dependent manoeuvring derivatives of course apart from model testing one can study the effect of the roll motion by other means as well already in the early days of cfd wilson and stern 2002 studied the roll motion of a naval ship at different frequencies alternatively one can combine different methods like the use of support vector machines combined with model tests see for instance wang et al 2013 or rely to advanced potential flow techniques as demonstrated by dashtimanesh et al 2019 nevertheless the present article relies on captive model tests to study the effect of the roll motion on the other degrees of freedom and how a 6 dof manoeuvring model can be established for harbour manoeuvres accounting these effects to that aim the carriage of the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water flanders hydraulics research co operation with ghent university has been updated in 2017 with a captive roll mode which enables to combine harmonic or fixed heel with any other motion in the horizontal degree of freedom in the present study the well known benchmark hull kcs is covered a hull that is especially prone to heel influence and especially parametric roll tello ruiz et al 2019 nevertheless it should be emphasized that the present field of study is not oriented towards external effects such as wind or waves inducing the roll motion numerous literature can be found in this field in contrast information on the coupling effect between roll be it externally induced or not to the open water manoeuvring derivatives and vice versa is more scarce as shown above and deserves the additional attention given here 2 experimental research the experimental research has been carried out in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water flanders hydraulics research co operation with ghent university in this tank with main dimensions 80 7 0 5 m³ both free running and captive manoeuvring tests can be carried out during captive model tests the surge sway yaw and roll motions of the ship model are imposed by the mechanism of the towing tank while the heave and pitch motions are free the captive motion modes can be controlled independently a comprehensive description of the tank can be found in delefortrie et al 2016b however information on the harmonic roll actuator was not yet provided in that article with this roll actuator fixed values as well as harmonic motions can be imposed within the following limits 1 15 ϕ 15 p 16 s p 40 s ² especially the acceleration can be restrictive but in practice the maximal accelerations are limited by the maximal forces and moments that may act on the ship model the axis of the roll motion is a fixed one and is located on the calm water plane during the towing tank tests the heel angle of the ship model is continuously monitored the roll velocity is obtained through numerical derivation of the roll angle time series the tests discussed in this article were carried out with the appended benchmark ship kcs at a scale factor of 52 67 fhr ship model code c04 no roll damping devices such as bilge keels were included table 1 shows its main particulars the largest g m value was used to execute forced roll tests at 100 ukc 50 ukc 20 ukc and 10 ukc with the smallest g m value forced roll tests free decay tests and parametric roll tests have been carried out at 100 ukc a common open water program aiming to identify a mathematical model suitable for harbour manoeuvring simulations should cover a wide range of possible conditions such as speeds between 5 knots astern and 17 knots ahead ukc dependent combined with thrust ahead or astern and different rudder angles between 35 covering in this way a full 360 range of drift and yaw angles such program which consists already of more than 300 tests was then extended with forced roll tests and tests at discrete heel angles different from zero in the remaining part of this article model scale speeds will be used 1 knot full scale corresponds to 0 071 m s model scale with the newly installed roll actuator harmonic forced roll tests were carried out as follows 2 ϕ t ϕ m ϕ a sin 2 π t t such a test always begins and ends always at the average heel angle ϕ m the variations are different as a function of the under keel clearance and loading condition these are summarised in table 2 for the loading condition with large g m c0401 and in table 3 and table 4 for the loading condition with small g m c0402 in the large g m condition the heel of the ship was also slowly period 380 s harmonically varied from 5 to 5 2 5 2 5 for the smaller water depths during the steady state condition when sailing at 0 142 m s and for different drift angles 0 5 10 25 40 55 70 90 a selection of tests at zero drift angle was repeated at constant heel angles of 2 5 and 5 the latter only for under keel clearances 50 in the small g m condition free roll decay tests have been carried out according to table 5 the conventions used in this paper are based on the coordinate systems shown in fig 1 the origin o of the ship fixed system is determined as follows located amidships on the static waterline corresponding to the static loading condition even keel no heel in the longitudinal plane of symmetry in practice due to the small applied heel angles and occurring pitch motions a horizontally bound axis system 0 x y z is used the ship s position in the tank is referred to a tank fixed axis system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 3 roll observations 3 1 large g m with this loading condition only forced roll tests have been carried out in this section the most remarkable findings will be discussed using the following definitions low frequency roll 5 amplitude 10 s period high frequency roll 4 amplitude 2 s period note that latter is consider a high frequent motion for calm water manoeuvring not for seakeeping the roll moment during the forced roll tests at zero speed has been plotted in fig 2 at low frequency the signal is regular and can be described by a first order harmonic however at high frequency the signal seems more scattered fourier analysis in fig 3 reveals that the signal is periodic with a strong fifth order harmonic and that the measurement is thus repeatable the same effect is observed for the pitch motion which indicates a strong pitch roll coupling fig 4 shows a view of the transom of the kcs at different heeled water lines while rolling a large part of the transom emerges from the water at high frequency the pitch response to the roll movement is delayed due to the increased damping see fig 5 the test starts at almost zero trim with a movement towards positive roll angles the trim responds hydrostatically with a negative angle however with some delay the recovery of the trim is slower compared to the recovery of the roll towards zero degrees and shows even overshoot the fifth order component is then ascribed to the hydrostatic component base the combinations of roll velocity acceleration and pitch roll pitch roll pitch roll pitch roll pitch 3 2 small g m in this loading condition both roll decay tests and forced roll tests have been carried out 3 2 1 free decay tests roll decay tests have been carried out at four different forward speeds 0 0 223 0 449 and 0 589 m s and at two initial angles 6 and 9 an example of the decay motion can be found in fig 6 the fit on the figure is a linear first order fit 3 k p i x x p k p p m g g m ϕ 0 both model and measurement coincide in fig 6 the roll period varies between 4 8 s and 5 1 s respectively for the tests at 0 589 m s and at 0 m s this means that both k p and k p are speed dependent moreover the decay is weaker when the initial angle is larger in other words the absolute value of k p is smaller for the tests starting at 9 see also fig 7 3 2 2 forced roll tests the results from the forced roll tests are compared with the results from the free decay tests by fitting the measured roll moment with equation 3 the effect of sailing speed and roll amplitude are confirmed and the predicted roll derivatives are of the same magnitude as for the roll decay tests see fig 8 based on the forced roll tests the influence of the roll frequency can be analysed as well the roll added moment of inertia decreases with increasing frequency to reach a minimal value at a certain speed dependent frequency and to increase again with increasing frequency the roll damping derivative increases more or less linearly with the roll frequency 4 mathematical model 4 1 set of equations the goal is to update the manoeuvring model presented by delefortrie et al 2016 to take into account the roll coupling in terms of inertia and centrifugal terms the attention is drawn to the terms depending of p and p 4 x i c m u v r x g r 2 y g r z g p r 5 y i c m v u r x g r y g r 2 z g p 6 z i c 0 m v p x g p r y g p z g p 2 7 k i c i x x p i x z r i y x p r i y z r 2 m v p y g v u r z g 8 m i c i x y p i y z r i x z p 2 r 2 i x x i z z p r m v p x g u v r z g 9 n i c i z z r i x z p i x y p 2 i y z p r m v u r x g u v r y g the above equations can be further simplified as y g 0 for the kcs the terms with the product of inertia can also be neglected i x z has a marginal amplitude while i x y and i y z are zero due to symmetry the test program considered a maximal heel angle of 5 at that point the ship bound axis system rotates with 5 around the x axis of the horizontal bound system see fig 1 a lateral variable is then influenced as follows for instance the sway velocity of the ship is when only the lateral carriage moves at velocity v 10 v v cos 5 0 996 v v the ship bound axis system can thus still be considered horizontal bound the authors are aware that larger heel angles can occur for instance when initiating a turning circle in the following sections the focus will be put on the hull forces of the modular mathematical model it seems that the roll motions present in the program do not significantly affect the propulsion and steering induced terms in the other degrees of freedom in other words the reader can be referred to delefortrie et al 2021 for a discussion of the forces generated by the rudder of the kcs and delefortrie and eloot 2021 for a presentation of the propulsion and induced terms in particular for the single propeller rudder kcs ship the formulation of the propulsion induced roll moment is 11 k p k t p β k t p γ k t p β k t p γ k p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ k ε sgn β γ π 2 t p ε whereas the steering induced component is 12 k r z r a h ε z ε f y 4 2 mathematical model of hull forces 4 2 1 roll dependency 4 2 1 1 introduction of a hydrodynamic roll angle in all degrees of freedom hydrodynamic forces and moments are to a greater or lesser extent affected by the roll angle and its time derivatives these effects are not only dependent of the roll motion parameters but also on the ship s longitudinal speed moreover higher order effects can be observed at higher frequencies and the ship is even prone to parametric rolling which also exerts significant forces in the horizontal degrees of freedom but which is out of scope here to take account of higher order effects in the damping it was decided to introduce a hydrodynamic angle κ which expresses the roll speed dependency analogously as the speed components in the other degrees of freedom 13 tan κ 0 5 p l pp u the use of the ship length in the numerator may seem strange in combination with a roll motion but it allows to have a better spread of κ and a better prediction of the regression results the effect of κ will be expressed by tabular functions for the different degrees of freedom the models are expressed for the following κ values 0 5 10 30 40 90 150 160 170 180 the roll dependency models have been computed for the large and small g m loading conditions the latter being shown by blue data points on the following figures 4 2 1 2 longitudinal force the roll dependency on the longitudinal force is minor but yet a mathematical model has been built which is the following function 14 x x p m l p ρ 2 l t u 2 p l pp 2 2 x κ ρ 2 l t u 2 x β 0 the coefficients have been represented in fig 9 and the marginal influence of the roll motion is reflected in the significance of the coefficients thus one may neglect as well the roll dependency on the surge force 4 2 1 3 lateral force the lateral force is computed as follows 15 y y p m l m z g p ρ 2 l t u 2 p l pp 2 2 y κ y ϕ g y u ϕ u g l m ϕ the lateral force is affected by the roll moment which is expressed by y ϕ but on the other hand there is a clear effect of the combination roll angle and longitudinal speed which has been reported in literature and is modelled with y u ϕ both terms are represented in fig 10 y ϕ is more or less constant at the largest under keel clearances and is proportional to g m however its value tends to double for the smaller under keel clearances this has several reasons on one hand the maximal roll angle decreases from 5 to 2 5 but on the other hand the roll moment itself does not decrease due to the increased roll damping k p at smaller under keel clearances y ϕ seems directly connected to the roll moment measurement and should not be included in the simulator an open issue is to what extent a correlation occurs between the sway force and the roll moment during the execution of captive model tests in case of a dynamic roll motion variable roll angle the centre of gravity will oscillate laterally and this will cause an oscillatory inertia force which will be measured in the sway force y u ϕ has not only a different sign for the two loading conditions but also between 50 ukc and the other water depths the sign swap at 50 ukc is probably a mathematical issue see also the trend for y p in fig 11 as both y u ϕ and y p have the wrong sign they may lead to the same result the roll velocity dependency has been plotted in fig 11 the function s magnitude increases with decreasing under keel clearance and increasing g m the effect of the roll acceleration is marginal 4 2 1 4 heave force the roll angle has mainly a hydrostatic effect on the heave force which is expressed by a quadratic relationship 16 z m z g p 2 z ϕ ϕ m g ϕ 2 m g t u h 2 z β 0 the resulting z ϕ ϕ has been plotted in fig 12 as expected its value is more or less constant for the different loading conditions and water depths z ϕ ϕ 0 95 0 06 m g at lower ukc frequency effects have been observed however it was decided not to include them in the model 4 2 1 5 roll moment the roll moment is modelled as follows 17 k k p m t 2 i x x p ρ 2 l t 2 u 2 p l pp 2 2 k κ m g g m ϕ mind that the roll speed is quadratic instead of the more common p p the sign is governed by the k κ function regressions were carried out with both options however no major differences were observed if p p is used the k κ function becomes symmetric fig 13 presents the outcome based on the quadratic roll speed k p increases with decreasing g m and under keel clearance the roll damping function increases with decreasing under keel clearance and increasing g m 4 2 1 6 pitch moment as for the heave force the pitch moment is dependent of the roll angle however due to the frequency dependency in the roll pitch coupling a damping function is needed as well which leads to the following formulation 18 m m ϕ ϕ m g l ϕ 2 ρ 2 l 2 t u 2 p l pp 2 2 m κ m g l t u h 2 m β 0 fig 14 shows the regression coefficients for the different series because of the frequency dependency the supposedly constant hydrostatic term m ϕ ϕ shows more variation compared to the heave force m ϕ ϕ 0 07 0 02 m g l 4 2 1 7 yaw moment the yaw moment is significantly influenced by the frequency of the roll motion and this dependency increases with the vessel s speed which leads to the following formulation 19 n n p m l 2 n u u p m l g u 2 p ρ 2 l 2 t u 2 p l pp 2 2 n κ n ϕ g n u ϕ u g l m l ϕ the different coefficients are shown in fig 15 for 50 ukc there is an unbalance but for the other conditions n p can be considered constant and the speed frequency dependency increases with decreasing under keel clearance the same is true for the roll velocity dependency although the terms in ϕ appeared not to contribute to the yawing moment they have been added in eq 19 for consistency with eq 15 4 2 2 other dependencies the other components of the hull forces have been modelled like mentioned in delefortrie et al 2016a fig 16 shows an example for the drift functions which show the known behaviour as a function of the ukc the question then was whether or not roll sway or roll yaw coupling should be modelled or not to do so the model deviations were investigated as a function of roll angle for tests with yaw or drift in most of the cases the roll angle had not a significant influence on the deviations however at small ukc the sway velocity has an influence on the roll dependency for the sway force and the roll moment especially if the sway velocity and roll angle have the same sign such observations are a result of a complex flow which can be ascribed to the changed local under keel clearance of the ship s side that is under attack it was decided not to include these effects and further adaptation of the mathematical models was not needed 4 2 3 validation a first validation is performed in table 6 by comparing the measured x forces and moments with the modelled y forces and moment in general the agreement is acceptable and even excellent for the heave at 100 ukc the pitch moment is hard to model due to the pitch roll coupling and the transom section of the kcs 5 simulations 5 1 overview the above mentioned mathematical model has been implemented in the ship manoeuvring simulator and fast time simulations have been performed with the large g m case the downside is that this deliberately limits the roll motion of the ship but only in this condition sufficient water depths are available to see the influence of the under keel clearance to check whether the mathematical model works at lower g m values a comparison with free running tests is shown in section 5 5 special attention was needed for the roll moment derivatives of previously developed ships which have been expressed as see delefortrie et al 2016a 20 k p ϕ δ g m t k p i x x p k u p u p for these ships k κ can be expressed as a function of k p and k u p 21 k κ sin κ k p u 2 p l 2 2 cos κ sin κ k u p 0 25 ρ l 2 t 2 u 2 p l 2 2 based on test simulations the nonlinear extra damping term ϕ δ g m t k p i x x should be maintained in the new model formulation as well standard manoeuvring trials are presented using the telegraph positions mentioned in table 7 5 2 acceleration trials fig 17 shows the obtained speeds for the different telegraph positions and under keel clearances some ahead speeds above the red line are not achievable due to excessive sinkage all other manoeuvres will therefore focus on the telegraph position slow in fig 18 the most relevant time signals have been shown a pid controller is used to maintain a straight track which requires a small negative rudder angle rudder actions have a direct influence on the heel angle which is the largest 0 3 at the smallest under keel clearance remark that the small trimming attitude of the vessel is either by the bow or by the stern 5 3 turning circles fig 19 shows the main parameters of the 35 turning circles at telegraph position slow the outward heel at larger under keel clearances changes into inward heel at 10 and 20 ukc the damping of the heel motion seems difficult at 10 ukc due to the speed reduction while turning the sinkage reduces significantly 5 4 zigzag tests fig 20 shows the relevant parameters of the 20 20 zigzag tests at telegraph position slow the overshoot angles decrease and the period increases with decreasing under keel clearance the speed drop during the manoeuvre is more significant at larger under keel clearances again the heel motion is opposite and less damped at smaller under keel clearances 5 5 comparison with free running tests in the frame of simman 2021 free running tests have been carried out in 2018 with the initial stability lever set to g m 0 6 on full scale both 50 and 20 ukc were covered in the program as the latter is to be discussed at simman 2021 the focus is here put on 50 ukc 20 5 zigzag tests which were repeated at least 5 times the key results can be found in table 8 although the periods overlap when the manoeuvre starts to starboard or to port there is a significant difference in overshoot angles between both directions in the simulator the g m was set to 0 6 m and the same mathematical model was used however to match the free running trials tuning was needed for several terms in table 9 an overview of the multiplicators applied to obtain a fair agreement the tuning of the rudder forces f x and f y is straightforward as these force components are measured during free running tests as well hence a direct comparison with the simulated forces is possible the need for the tuning of f x and f y can be explained by the fact that the simulations were carried out with the original mathematical model for the rudder forces delefortrie 2016a it was also the main trigger to derive a new mathematical model for the prediction of lift and drag of the rudder as presented in delefortrie et al 2021 an explanation for the need to adapt y β is under investigation given the original simulation model and the tuning a comparison is performed for the 20 5 and 20 5 zigzag test as shown in fig 21 and fig 22 mind that the higher frequency fluctuations present on v and ϕ are caused by measurement inaccuracies rather than smoothening the signal it was provided as is but the reader should focus on the low frequent similarities especially in the tuned simulation the tracks are well predicted 6 conclusions in this article open water manoeuvring tests with the benchmark ship kcs have been studied with specific attention to the rolling of the ship while manoeuvring the newly implemented roll engine on the towing carriage was used to conduct an extensive study on the rolling behaviour of the ship the kcs seems particularly vulnerable to roll due to its transom s shape this vulnerability was also shown previously with the execution of parametric roll tests the mathematical manoeuvring models have been adapted to cope with the additional captive

showed that the simulation model is capable of predicting the behaviour of the ship in 6 dof although some tuning was needed a more comprehensive study with captive model tests involving multiple g m and draft variations is planned for mid 2021 to fully capture the effect on the roll moment after that simulations are planned where degrees of freedom can be des activated to investigate the effect of each degree of freedom for instance simulations can be carried out with roll heave and pitch being restrained credit authorship contribution statement guillaume delefortrie conceptualization

introduction over the last few decades the use of concrete caissons in port infrastructures has been developed greatly by means of the use of lightweight floating caissons and the improvements of the technology required for their manufacture cejuela et al 2018 the process of port infrastructure construction involves different kinds of manoeuvres one is the foundation manoeuvre in the final phase of this manoeuvre where the positioning and sinking of the caisson takes place various teams take part in and must be coordinated to execute the positioning with accuracy currently this manoeuvre is carried out by coordinating of both land based i e winches and windlasses and marine equipment i e tugs and auxiliary boats and in most cases the coordination is carried out by specialized personnel directly on the caisson this manoeuvre is not performed without risk and accidents are common for many reasons failure of coordination between teams unexpected environmental loads anchorage or malfunctioning of mooring lines as well as human failure accidents may result in an inaccurate anchoring of the caisson or even human damage leading to economic losses and high risk for the personnel involved in the anchoring manoeuvres for all of the reasons cited above any attempt to provide an automatic process for port infrastructure caisson construction can give as a result a significant reduction in costs and an improvement in security in this paper it is proposed a control scheme for the dynamic positioning dp of the caisson with the aim of decreasing costs and improving security we focus on this dp manoeuvre which requires a complex deploy of personnel and equipment as previously indicated within the vessels or floating structures dp design the existing literature ranges from the application from pid and classical control techniques to modern techniques such as adaptive sliding backsteeping fuzzy or optimal control approaches xu and liu 2016 xia et al 2018 fang and lee 2016 xia et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 cheng du et al 2013 xu et al 2014 a complete study of previous dp approaches can be found in sorensen 2011 and references therein furthermore in the dp applications for vessels different kind of methods have been applied for the states and the disturbances estimation including among others the kalman filter the unscented kalman filter ukf or particle filter chen et al 2018 jayasiri et al 2017 xu et al 2013 as far as the control allocation system is concerned the control methods applied in the contributions cited above are based on thrusters the control allocation methods for different types of thruster configurations can be found in fossen and johansen 2006 and fossen and perez 2009 for marine vehicles and in johansen and fossen 2013 a more general frame work for control allocation algorithms is presented moreover dp control applications of moored vessels are also based on thrusters as it is shown in the contributions published by aamo and fossen 1999 berntsen et al 2008 chen et al 2013 where the mooring system is modeled by means of finite elements aamo and fossen 2001 notwithstanding all the contributions cited above regarding to the dp control with an allocation system based on thrusters specific contributions related to dp control of anchored caissons without thrusters are not found in the literature in the allocation systems based on rotatable thrusters for marine vehicles it is possible to control the thrust direction and its magnitude this means that it is controlled the direction of the forces provoked in the vehicle furthermore in the allocation systems with fixed thrusters the thrust direction does not change with respect to the local coordinated system of the vehicle however in the allocation system for caissons of this work based on mooring lines not only is the direction of the forces in the caisson not controlled but the direction of the forces also varies as a function of the relative position between the caisson and the anchoring points this introduces instability to the system and makes it more difficult to control belowfloat 15pt abovecaption 13pt for all the reasons commented above it is proposed a dp control scheme as shown in fig 1 a dual loop controller is developed with the ukf for states and disturbances estimation which reduces errors in stationary state and provides stability to the caisson motion additionally it is proposed an algorithm easy to implement and computationally cheap for the control allocation module of the dp control scheme our approach differs from the usual approach previously reported in the literature whereby there are no thrusters and it is considered eight lines and winches distributed over the caisson as indicated in appendix a the application of the ukf filter for the estimation of anchored caisson states and waves perturbances the application of a dual loop controller based on classical theory dynamic for dp control of anchored caissons without thrusters the proposition of a control allocation system for anchored caissons based on eight mooring lines and winches without thrusters this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the dynamic model of the caisson with environmental disturbances and actuators models sections 3 and 4 develop the ukf based nonlinear filter and the dual loop controller respectively section 5 discusses the control allocation system section 6 presents de simulation results the conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 the model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the dynamic model of the caisson object of study of this paper is represented by the following equation armesto et al 2015 1 m a z c t k t τ z c τ d τ c z c t f a t f w t where z c t x y z ϕ θ ψ t are the position and the euler angles of the caisson m is the mass of the caisson a is the added mass at infinite frequency k is the function of delay and fluid memory effects c is the hydrostatic restoration coefficient and f a x a y a z a k a m a n a the actuators forces and moments and f w x w y w z w k w m w n w are the forces and moments induced by waves the caisson s coordinate system is located in the center of gravity and is considered inertial for more details of the caisson main features see appendix a 2 2 waves model similar to the hydrodynamic model the wave excitation model is also based in potential flow theory broadly used in literature journee 2001 using a commercial boundary elements method the wave diffraction problem is solved and the first order wave forces vector f ω i ϕ k is obtained for different wave angular frequencies ω i and different wave headings ϕ k in an analogous way the second order wave forces quadratic transfer function q t f d i f ω i ω j ϕ k is obtained then for any sea state represented with n c components of specific angular frequency ω i height h i heading ϕ i and phase φ i the wave forces are computed in the time domain as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 f 1 s t 0 5 i 1 n

appendix a for details the winches are modeled by 4 t w d i a g k w 1 k w 2 k w 3 k w 4 k w 5 k w 6 k w 7 k w 8 t where k w i i 1 8 are the gains of the winches assembled in the caisson and t are the tensions for each of the eight lines provided by the allocation system see algorithm 1 in section 5 moreover the forces and moments components acting on the center of gravity of the caisson due to the winches are modeled by following the next procedure firstly it is calculated the position of the caisson referred to the inertial coordinate axe of the initial position of the caisson by doing 5 p t h

the matrix t h 1 includes a rotation matrix so that the caisson rotates with respect to the center of gravity and the caisson s surge sway and yaw components provided by the model defined in eq 1 undo

1 3 i then the forces and moments provoked by each of the turret in the center of gravity of the caisson is a vector defined by 20 f a t f t m t note that the forces and moments obtained in eq 20 are applied to eq 1 3 non linear filtering the model in eq 1 is non linear that is why the estimation of the states of the system constitutes a non linear filtering problem this problem can be solved using the ekf but it is well known that this filter is not robust with respect to the parameter uncertainty and can produce unstable filters if the assumptions of local linearity are violated sorenson 1985 uhlmann 1992 to avoid these drawbacks julier and uhlmann 1997 proposed the ukf which has the following advantages it can capture the mean and covariance with subsequent accuracy up to third order taylor series expansion for any non linearity and is robust to parameter uncertainty ristic et al 2004 in order to estimate the states of the model object of study of this paper equation 1 with the ukf filter it is necessary to formulate an augmented discrete state space model as follows fossen and perez 2009 21 x w k 1 z c k 1 h a w 6 6 0 6 6 x w k z c k x w k z c k g k z c k f a k w k 22 y f k

frequencies for each degree of freedom x w k η w k t ζ w k t t is a measurement vector of the 1st order wave effects in surge sway and yaw where ζ w t ζ x ζ y ζ ψ is a vector of internal states of the waves and η w t w x w y w ψ g k z c k f a k is a discrete function of the non linear model defined in 1 which gives as a result a vector of 12 components 0 0 0 0 0 0 z c k t y f k y f x k y f y k y f ψ k t are the outputs of the model w k n 0 q is the process noise vector and n k n 0 r is the measurement noise vector k n and n is the set of natural numbers the sub index k is assigned to a continuous time instant t k in this way the ukf filter uses a wave model of matrices 23 and 24 which facilitates the estimation of the low frequency components and the wave frequency components of the position x k y k and the heading ψ k measurements note that the second order wave effects are not estimated with the ukf filter the integral term of the controller designed in the next section will compensate those effects the ukf uses the so called unscented transformation that is if we have the random variable x f x w z c t and a static mapping y f h x f as previously indicated one can specifically choose 2 n 1 points χ i called sigma points and weighting coefficients w i such that the weighted sample mean and covariance obtained from these points approximate the mean and covariance of x f that is x f p x f then we can transform the sigma points using h to obtain a set of sigma points for y f and estimate the mean and covariance of y f namely y f p y f using the weighted averages of the transformed sigma points in order to do this the matrix χ is made up by 2 l 1 sigma vectors χ i with their corresponding weights w i in the following way 26 χ 0 x f χ i x f l λ p x f i i 1 l χ i x f l λ p x f i l i l 1 2 l w 0 m λ l λ w 0 c λ l λ 1 α 2 β w i m w i c 1 2 l λ i 1 2 l where λ α 2 l κ l is a scaling parameter α determines the spread of sigma points around the mean x f normally a small positive value 1e 3 l is the dimension of x f p x f is the covariance of x f κ is a secondary scaling parameter and β it is used to incorporate prior knowledge of the x f distribution for gaussian distributions β 2 is optimal the standard ukf algorithm is developed through the following steps 1 initialize the mean and covariance by 27 x ˆ f 0 e x f 0 p 0 e x f 0 x ˆ f 0 x f 0 x ˆ f 0 t

calculated in 26 q is the covariance matrix of the process noise and r is the measurement noise covariance matrix in the implementation of the ukf the cholesky factorization press et al 1992 is used in order to calculate the square root of the covariance matrix because it provides numerical stability and efficiency the tuning of the ukf is done through the entries of the state and measurement noise using the same criterion as with the standard kalman filter tuning fossen and perez 2009 that is if we believe the model is accurate we lower the covariance of the state noise which reduces the influence of noise on the estimates however if the model is believed to be uncertain we need to increase the state covariance so the filter uses innovations y f k y ˆ f k k 1 to correct the predictions made with the uncertain model this reduces bias and increase noise in the estimates the covariance matrix r of the ukf is due to sensors noise which is uncorrelated then r is chosen diagonal 36 r d i a g σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ n v 2 where σ i 2 is the measurement noise covariance of the measured variable i and n v is the number of variables n v 3 for the model indicated in 22 the states covariance matrix q of the ukf is also chosen diagonal 37 q d i a g q 1 q 2 q n s where q i is the state covariance of the variable i and n s is the number of states n s 12 for the model indicated in 21 the values of the q matrix are chosen assuming that the uncertainty is small since the model of 1 is accurate 4 the controller in this section we propose a three degrees of freedom controller based in classical methods for the loop indicated in fig 1 which generates a control vector of forces and moments f c t x c y c n c in order to follow a reference vector r e f t x r e f y r e f ψ r e f fig 2 shows the structure of the dual loop controller for the surge degree of freedom which includes an integral term for decreasing errors due to external disturbances and a lead compensation term in order to provide stability to the caisson behavior the same control structure is applied for the rest degrees of freedom to be controlled sway and yaw it must be noted that the reference is applied through a first order system so that smooth motion of the caisson can be assured this improve the safety of the operation which is part of the aim of this paper as commented before since the design of the indicated controller is based on classical linear theory we obtain an approximated linear model of the non linear one defined in eq 1 the approximated model is a set of transfers functions of the degrees of freedom to be controlled surge sway and yaw the transfer function parameters were estimated using least squares with individual trails note that aim of the approximated model is just to the design the controller which it is applied to the non linear model defined in eq 1 the laplace transfer function of the approximated model and the controller for each degree of freedom are found in table 1 by means of the root locus theory the lead compensation controller indicated in fig 2 is designed 5 control allocation the actuators of the dp system indicated in fig 1 are made up of eight anchor lines see appendix a for details relative to the lines configuration therefore the actuators system is over actuated since only three degrees of freedom are controlled surge sway and yaw this makes the actuators system redundant as it is well known moreover it must be noted that the mooring lines distribution of this work see fig 15 provokes coupling among the different axes of the coordinate system fixed to the center of gravity which means that the corrections made in one of the degrees of freedom to control its motion have an impact in the rest of them additionally the forces induced in the caisson by the different mooring lines are not constant and vary with the relative position and attitude of the eyebolts distributed on the top of the caisson with respect to the anchor points in the seabed in this section it is established how the control forces and moments f c t x c y c n c generated by the controller are equally distributed over the anchor lines by generating a vector of tensions t t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 t 8 t the developed control allocation module is presented in algorithm 1 which matrices are defined in eq 38 this algorithm has the advantage that is easy to implement and computationally cheap 38 a 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

of this section follow the logic and rationale as the theory previously presented in this article including the non linear hydrodynamical model the dual loop controller the ukf filter and the control allocation for the evaluation of the proposed control scheme for dp system fig 1 we simulate a case of study for the caisson indicated in appendix a under external perturbances induced by waves the simulations here presented were run in matlab and a time step of 0 1s was used the simulation scheme followed in this article is sum up as follows based on the theory presented in section 4 the controller is designed by root locus analysis the dp control scheme of fig 1 with the controller previously designed is implemented the statistical properties and the performance of the ukf filter are verified the simulations are run to establish a comparison between the dp control scheme with a first order network filter and with the ukf filter the next subsections develops these bullet points 6 1 controller design simulations fig 3 depicts an analysis which compares the root locus of the linear approximation top of the figure to the one with the inclusion of the lead compensation controller bottom of the figure as far as the surge and sway degrees of freedom are concern their root locus branches are on the imaginary axis which may produce unstable behavior however when the lead compensation controller is introduced in the system the branches are out of the imaginary axis and tends to a break in point this is due to the criteria established for the position of the poles and the zeros of the controller see table 1 this means that for positive values of the lead compensation controller gain k i i x y ψ the behavior of the caisson is going to be stable this values are chosen based on previous knowledge of the caisson dynamics it must be noted that for dimensions of the caisson the forces and moments due to caisson motion are high and therefore the gain values k i i x y ψ are high too 6 2 dp simulations the reference vector was set to r e f x r e f y r e f ψ r e f 4 3 5 the ukf matrices were tuned by doing q 1 0 4 i 12 r 0 04 i 3 p 0 001 i 12 the wave parameters used were height of 1 m a period of 8 s and direction of 0 degrees in x axis fig 5 depicts the wave forces and moments induced to the caisson with the cited wave parameters fig 4 shows the statistical properties of the ukf filter by drawing the histogram of the residuals for the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom the histogram is drawn following the expression lloyd 1998 39 f n h n w h where n h is the number of measurements of the bar w h is the width of the bar and n is the total number of measurements next the corresponding gaussian probability distribution is drawn over the histogram to check if the parameter distribution is gaussian or normal fig 4 exhibits a normal distribution of the residuals which confirms that it is possible to apply the ukf filter to the application proposed on this work figs 6 to 11 present the results of the proposed control scheme it is shown how the system is able to compensate the second order wave effects thanks to the integral term added in the dual loop as shown in fig 2 since the system is able to follow the reference with no stationary state error see fig 7 moreover the ukf is able to filter the first order wave effects as can be seen in fig 7 see the zoomed part of the figure for the surge degree of freedom where the waves provoke a higher incidence in the caisson motion the results of the system in the x plane y plane indicate a low oscillation despite the disturbances see fig 8 when controlling the caisson from a starting point to a final point as indicated in fig 6 additionally simulations have been carried out with the same controller and disturbances as in the previous case but using a first order network as a filter comparing the results obtained in fig 8 with the ukf to those of fig 12 with the first order network a higher deviation can be appreciated in the path described by the caisson with respect to the reference path a line between the initial and final point when the first order network is used moreover if fig 11 is compared with fig 13 a greater control effort is observed when applying the first order network as a filter due to the abruptly changes and saturations that occur in the tensions applied to some of the lines this means that the inclusion of the ukf filter increases the safety of the operation and the life expectancy of the actuators which constitutes one of the aims of this work 7 conclusions and further research in this paper we propose a control scheme which includes a dual loop controller a non linear filter based on the ukf and a control allocation system for dp operations the simulations were performed to verify the effectiveness of the approach the results show no error in stationary states thanks to the integral term added in the dual loop controller which is able to compensate second order wave effects moreover the low oscillation in the caisson s trajectory means that the controller compensate first order wave effects too finally it is compared the results given by the dual loop controller with a first order network to the ones given by the dual loop controller with the ukf we conclude that the controller with the ukf provides a reduction in the deviation from the reference path and also a reduction in the control effort therefore a longer life expectancy of the actuators and an improvement in safety of the operation is expected in subsequent research an in scale model a caisson is going to be developed in order to perform trials in a model basin with the implementation of the control scheme proposed in this article credit authorship contribution

allocation methods for different types of thruster configurations can be found in fossen and johansen 2006 and fossen and perez 2009 for marine vehicles and in johansen and fossen 2013 a more general frame work for control allocation algorithms is presented moreover dp control applications of moored vessels are also based on thrusters as it is shown in the contributions published by aamo and fossen 1999 berntsen et al 2008 chen et al 2013 where the mooring system is modeled by means of finite elements aamo and fossen 2001 notwithstanding all the contributions cited above regarding to the dp control with an allocation system based on thrusters specific contributions related to dp control of anchored caissons without thrusters are not found in the literature in the allocation systems based on rotatable thrusters for marine vehicles it is possible to control the thrust direction and its magnitude this means that it is controlled the direction of the forces provoked in the vehicle furthermore in the allocation systems with fixed thrusters the thrust direction does not change with respect to the local coordinated system of the vehicle however in the allocation system for caissons of this work based on mooring lines not only is the direction of the forces in the caisson not controlled but the direction of the forces also varies as a function of the relative position between the caisson and the anchoring points this introduces instability to the system and makes it more difficult to control belowfloat 15pt abovecaption 13pt for all the reasons commented above it is proposed a dp control scheme as shown in fig 1 a dual loop controller is developed with the ukf for states and disturbances estimation which reduces errors in stationary state and provides stability to the caisson motion additionally it is proposed an algorithm easy to implement and computationally cheap for the control allocation module of the dp control scheme our approach differs from the usual approach previously reported in the literature whereby there are no thrusters and it is considered eight lines and winches distributed over the caisson as indicated in appendix a the application of the ukf filter for the estimation of anchored caisson states and waves perturbances the application of a dual loop controller based on classical theory dynamic for dp control of anchored caissons without thrusters the proposition of a control allocation system for anchored caissons based on eight mooring lines and winches without thrusters this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the dynamic model of the caisson with environmental disturbances and actuators models sections 3 and 4 develop the ukf based nonlinear filter and the dual loop controller respectively section 5 discusses the control allocation system section 6 presents de simulation results the conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 the model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the dynamic model of the caisson object of study of this paper is represented by the following equation armesto et al 2015 1 m a z c t k t τ z c τ d τ c z c t f a t f w t where z c t x y z ϕ θ ψ t are the position and the euler angles of the caisson m is the mass of the caisson a is the added mass at infinite frequency k is the function of delay and fluid memory effects c is the hydrostatic restoration coefficient and f a x a y a z a k a m a n a the actuators forces and moments and f w x w y w z w k w m w n w are the forces and moments induced by waves the caisson s coordinate system is located in the center of gravity and is considered inertial for more details of the caisson main features see appendix a 2 2 waves model similar to the hydrodynamic model the wave excitation model is also based in potential flow theory broadly used in literature journee 2001 using a commercial boundary elements method the wave diffraction problem is solved and the first order wave forces vector f ω i ϕ k is obtained for different wave angular frequencies ω i and different wave headings ϕ k in an analogous way the second order wave forces quadratic transfer function q t f d i f ω i ω j ϕ k is obtained then for any sea state represented with n c components of specific angular frequency ω i height h i heading ϕ i and phase φ i the wave forces are computed in the time domain as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 f 1 s t 0 5 i 1 n

appendix a for details the winches are modeled by 4 t w d i a g k w 1 k w 2 k w 3 k w 4 k w 5 k w 6 k w 7 k w 8 t where k w i i 1 8 are the gains of the winches assembled in the caisson and t are the tensions for each of the eight lines provided by the allocation system see algorithm 1 in section 5 moreover the forces and moments components acting on the center of gravity of the caisson due to the winches are modeled by following the next procedure firstly it is calculated the position of the caisson referred to the inertial coordinate axe of the initial position of the caisson by doing 5 p t h

1 3 i then the forces and moments provoked by each of the turret in the center of gravity of the caisson is a vector defined by 20 f a t f t m t note that the forces and moments obtained in eq 20 are applied to eq 1 3 non linear filtering the model in eq 1 is non linear that is why the estimation of the states of the system constitutes a non linear filtering problem this problem can be solved using the ekf but it is well known that this filter is not robust with respect to the parameter uncertainty and can produce unstable filters if the assumptions of local linearity are violated sorenson 1985 uhlmann 1992 to avoid these drawbacks julier and uhlmann 1997 proposed the ukf which has the following advantages it can capture the mean and covariance with subsequent accuracy up to third order taylor series expansion for any non linearity and is robust to parameter uncertainty ristic et al 2004 in order to estimate the states of the model object of study of this paper equation 1 with the ukf filter it is necessary to formulate an augmented discrete state space model as follows fossen and perez 2009 21 x w k 1 z c k 1 h a w 6 6 0 6 6 x w k z c k x w k z c k g k z c k f a k w k 22 y f k

frequencies for each degree of freedom x w k η w k t ζ w k t t is a measurement vector of the 1st order wave effects in surge sway and yaw where ζ w t ζ x ζ y ζ ψ is a vector of internal states of the

ψ k t are the outputs of the model w k n 0 q is the process noise vector and n k n 0 r is the measurement noise vector k n and n is the set of natural numbers the sub index k is assigned to a continuous time instant t k in this way the ukf filter uses a wave model of matrices 23 and 24 which facilitates the estimation of the low frequency components and the wave frequency components of the position x k y k and the heading ψ k measurements note that the second order wave effects are not estimated with the ukf filter the integral term of the controller designed in the next section will compensate those effects the ukf uses the so called unscented transformation that is if we have the random variable x f x w z c t and a static mapping y f h x f as previously indicated one can specifically choose 2 n 1 points χ i called sigma points and weighting coefficients w i such that the weighted sample mean and covariance obtained from these points approximate the mean and covariance of x f that is x f p x f then we can transform the sigma points using h to obtain a set of sigma points for y f and estimate the mean and covariance of y f namely y f p y f using the weighted averages of the transformed sigma points in order to do this the matrix χ is made up by 2 l 1 sigma vectors χ i with their corresponding weights w i in the following way 26 χ 0 x f χ i x f l λ p x f i i 1 l χ i x f l λ p x f i l i l 1 2 l w 0 m λ l λ w 0 c λ l λ 1 α 2 β w i m w i c 1 2 l λ i 1 2 l where λ α 2 l κ l is a scaling parameter α determines the spread of sigma points around the mean x f normally a small positive value 1e 3 l is the dimension of x f p x f is the covariance of x f κ is a secondary scaling parameter and β it is used to incorporate prior knowledge of the x f distribution for gaussian distributions β 2 is optimal the standard ukf algorithm is developed through the following steps 1 initialize the mean and covariance by 27 x ˆ f 0 e x f 0 p 0 e x f 0 x ˆ f 0 x f 0 x ˆ f 0 t

calculated in 26 q is the covariance matrix of the process noise and r is the measurement noise covariance matrix in the implementation of the ukf the cholesky factorization press et al 1992 is used in order to calculate the square root of the covariance matrix because it provides numerical stability and efficiency the tuning of the ukf is done through the entries of the state and measurement noise using the same criterion as with the standard kalman filter tuning fossen and perez 2009 that is if we believe the model is accurate we lower the covariance of the state noise which reduces the influence of noise on the estimates however if the model is believed to be uncertain we need to increase the state covariance so the filter uses innovations y f k y ˆ f k k 1 to correct the predictions made with the uncertain model this reduces bias and increase noise in the estimates the covariance matrix r of the ukf is due to sensors noise which is uncorrelated then r is chosen diagonal 36 r d i a g σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ n v 2 where σ i 2 is the measurement noise covariance of the measured variable i and n v is the number of variables n v 3 for the model indicated in 22 the states covariance matrix q of the ukf is also chosen diagonal 37 q d i a g q 1 q 2 q n s where q i is the state covariance of the variable i and n s is the number of states n s 12 for the model indicated in 21 the values of the q matrix are chosen assuming that the uncertainty is small since the model of 1 is accurate 4 the controller in this section we propose a three degrees of freedom controller based in classical methods for the loop indicated in fig 1 which generates a control vector of forces and moments f c t x c y c n c in order to follow a reference vector r e f t x r e f y r e f ψ r e f fig 2 shows the structure of the dual loop controller for the surge degree of freedom which includes an integral term for decreasing errors due to external disturbances and a lead compensation term in order to provide stability to the caisson behavior the same control structure is applied for the rest degrees of freedom to be controlled sway and yaw it must be noted that the reference is applied through a first order system so that smooth motion of the caisson can be assured this improve the safety of the operation which is part of the aim of this paper as commented before since the design of the indicated controller is based on classical linear theory we obtain an approximated linear model of the non linear one defined in eq 1 the approximated model is a set of transfers functions of the degrees of freedom to be controlled surge sway and yaw the transfer function parameters were estimated using least squares with individual trails note that aim of the approximated model is just to the design the controller which it is applied to the non linear model defined in eq 1 the laplace transfer function of the approximated model and the controller for each degree of freedom are found in table 1 by means of the root locus theory the lead compensation controller indicated in fig 2 is designed 5 control allocation the actuators of the dp system indicated in fig 1 are made up of eight anchor lines see appendix a for details relative to the lines configuration therefore the actuators system is over actuated since only three degrees of freedom are controlled surge sway and yaw this makes the actuators system redundant as it is well known moreover it must be noted that the mooring lines distribution of this work see fig 15 provokes coupling among the different axes of the coordinate system fixed to the center of gravity which means that the corrections made in one of the degrees of freedom to control its motion have an impact in the rest of them additionally the forces induced in the caisson by the different mooring lines are not constant and vary with the relative position and attitude of the eyebolts distributed on the top of the caisson with respect to the anchor points in the seabed in this section it is established how the control forces and moments f c t x c y c n c generated by the controller are equally distributed over the anchor lines by generating a vector of tensions t t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 t 8 t the developed control allocation module is presented in algorithm 1 which matrices are defined in eq 38 this algorithm has the advantage that is easy to implement and computationally cheap 38 a 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

of this section follow the logic and rationale as the theory previously presented in this article including the non linear hydrodynamical model the dual loop controller the ukf filter and the control allocation for the evaluation of the proposed control scheme for dp system fig 1 we simulate a case of study for the caisson indicated in appendix a under external perturbances induced by waves the simulations here presented were run in matlab and a time step of 0 1s was used the simulation scheme followed in this article is sum up as follows based on the theory presented in section 4 the controller is designed by root locus analysis the dp control scheme of fig 1 with the controller previously designed is implemented the statistical properties and the performance of the ukf filter are verified the simulations are run to establish a comparison between the dp control scheme with a first order network filter and with the ukf filter the next subsections develops these bullet points 6 1 controller design simulations fig 3 depicts an analysis which compares the root locus of the linear approximation top of the figure to the one with the inclusion of the lead compensation controller bottom of the figure as far as the surge and sway degrees of freedom are concern their root locus branches are on the imaginary axis which may produce unstable behavior however when the lead compensation controller is introduced in the system the branches are out of the imaginary axis and tends to a break in point this is due to the criteria established for the position of the poles and the zeros of the controller see table 1 this means that for positive values of the lead compensation controller gain k i i x y ψ the behavior of the caisson is going to be stable this values are chosen based on previous knowledge of the caisson dynamics it must be noted that for dimensions of the caisson the forces and moments due to caisson motion are high and therefore the gain values k i i x y ψ are high too 6 2 dp simulations the reference vector was set to r e f x r e f y r e f ψ r e f 4 3 5 the ukf matrices were tuned by doing q 1 0 4 i 12 r 0 04 i 3 p 0 001 i 12 the wave parameters used were height of 1 m a period of 8 s and direction of 0 degrees in x axis fig 5 depicts the wave forces and moments induced to the caisson with the cited wave parameters fig 4 shows the statistical properties of the ukf filter by drawing the histogram of the residuals for the surge sway and yaw degrees of freedom the histogram is drawn following the expression lloyd 1998 39 f n h n w h where n h is the number of measurements of the bar w h is the width of the bar and n is the total number of measurements next the corresponding gaussian probability distribution is drawn over the histogram to check if the parameter distribution is gaussian or normal fig 4 exhibits a normal distribution of the residuals which confirms that it is possible to apply the ukf filter to the application proposed on this work figs 6 to 11 present the results of the proposed control scheme it is shown how the system is able to compensate the second order wave effects thanks to the integral term added in the dual loop as shown in fig 2 since the system is able to follow the reference with no stationary state error see fig 7 moreover the ukf is able to filter the first order wave effects as can be seen in fig 7 see the zoomed part of the figure for the surge degree of freedom where the waves provoke a higher incidence in the caisson motion the results of the system in the x plane y plane indicate a low oscillation despite the disturbances see fig 8 when controlling the caisson from a starting point to a final point as indicated in fig 6 additionally simulations have been carried out with the same controller and disturbances as in the previous case but using a first order network as a filter comparing the results obtained in fig 8 with the ukf to those of fig 12 with the first order network a higher deviation can be appreciated in the path described by the caisson with respect to the reference path a line between the initial and final point when the first order network is used moreover if fig 11 is compared with fig 13 a greater control effort is observed when applying the first order network as a filter due to the abruptly changes and saturations that occur in the tensions applied to some of the lines this means that the inclusion of the ukf filter increases the safety of the operation and the life expectancy of the actuators which constitutes one of the aims of this work 7 conclusions and further research in this paper we propose a control scheme which includes a dual loop controller a non linear filter based on the ukf and a control allocation system for dp operations the simulations were performed to verify the effectiveness of the approach the results show no error in stationary states thanks to the integral term added in the dual loop controller which is able to compensate second order wave effects moreover the low oscillation in the caisson s trajectory means that the controller compensate first order wave effects too finally it is compared the results given by the dual loop controller with a first order network to the ones given by the dual loop controller with the ukf we conclude that the controller with the ukf provides a reduction in the deviation from the reference path and also a reduction in the control effort therefore a longer life expectancy of the actuators and an improvement in safety of the operation is expected in subsequent research an in scale model a caisson is going to be developed in order to perform trials in a model basin with the implementation of the control scheme proposed in this article credit authorship contribution

20459,in this work wave trapping characteristics of a permeable composite wavy barrier located near an inclined seawall are examined under the framework of linear potential flow theory for the waves past the thin barrier a semi empirical discharge equation having a quadratic pressure drop along with the velocity continuum is considered the boundary value problem is solved using the dual boundary

such as wave reflection wave run up the vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall are discussed considering various values of barrier porosity number of ripples ripple amplitude relative spacing between the wall and barrier relative submergence depth seawall inclination and seawall porosity the numerical results suggest that the performance of the wavy barrier within sight of partial reflection leeward inclined wall is marginal for the design of the development of breakwaters as contrasted to the vertical and seaward inclined wall the ripple amplitude minimizes the vertical force on the wavy barrier and the reduction is 63 for the non dimensional ripple amplitude a b 0 25 as compared to a flat plate where a and b refers to ripple amplitude and plate width

to global warming and it disastrously affects the waterfront populace and marine infrastructure to alleviate the sea level rise impact on fully developed near shore locales the seawalls have been developed in several shapes such as vertical seawalls stepped seawalls venkateswarlu and karmakar 2019 2020a sloping seawalls curved seawalls anand et al 2010 and permeable seawalls elchahal et al 2008 in general the seawalls are land based coastal structures and these are frequently constructed parallel to the shoreline koraim et al 2014 the primary function of the seawalls is mitigating wave flooding and wave overtopping due to storm surges in general the seawalls are impermeable in nature and generally reflect the total incident wave amplitude and reflected wave amplitude interacts again with the incoming waves in this procedure the partial clapotis vijay and sahoo 2019 and standing waves vijay et al 2020 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a 2021 are commonly observed as a result of the change in the fluid particle velocities most of the studies used the boundary element method bem to examine the breakwaters of non rectilinear shapes further the seawall encounters a higher wave force as a result of full wave reflection and it is one of the significant reasons behind the structural failures venkateswarlu and karmakar 2019 to reduce the wave force experienced by seawalls the submerged breakwaters are identified as primitive solutions and these are introduced in several formats in recent years the breakwater shape characteristics gained momentum and the general pattern of the breakwater advancement is identified as from impermeable rigid breakwaters to permeable breakwaters from sloping breakwaters to vertical breakwaters from the thick vertical porous barriers to thin vertical and horizontal porous barriers the thin breakwaters to flexible and wavy barriers yip and chwang 2000 cho and kim 2008 the vertical and horizontal thin porous structures vijay et al 2019 cho and kim 2008 inclined plates rao et al 2009 and composite wavy barriers yueh et al 2016 are suggested as dynamic wave dampers by several prominent workers based on merits and demerits to protect the fixed structures on account of a permeable hindrance with seawall the finite spacing is provided between the porous structures and fixed structures seawalls to create an artificial damping zone and this is consequently viewed as a wave trapping chamber several researchers headed towards the design and development of an effective wave trapping system on consolidating the several conceivable mechanisms such as i incident wave reflection ii wave trapping by gap region iii wave damping through porous flow and iv phase change of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes this can be accomplished by installing a wavy porous barrier near an existing seawall and it is worth mentioning that the tidal variation wave elevation as a result of global warming shows minimal impact on the fully submerged wavy barriers as compared with vertical barriers in general the thin barriers can be easily rearranged recycled removed and relocated in days and some cases in hours holy loch breakwater west coast of scotland from one installation site to another site besides the thin barriers are independent of water depth viably appropriate in sensitive bottom bed locales and offer minimal visual hindrance over the horizon but it is likewise detailed that the thin barriers are ineffective in creating the quiescent wave field in the case of long period waves in this specific case the seawall reflects the rest of the longwave energy transmitted from the wavy barrier thus the combination of submerged wavy barrier and inclined seawall with gap region is proposed as an effective solution to protect the coastal infrastructure to investigate the wave trapping efficiency of the wavy barrier with the inclined wall a brief review of the published articles is reported the submerged horizontal plate has been recommended as an active wave damper by several notable workers patarapanich and cheong 1989 neelamani and reddy 1992 to stifle the vertical motion of the incident wave and corresponding wave oscillations near the free surface yueh and tsaur 1999 carried out a comparative study on wave scattering performance of submerged dike and thin barriers using composite bem the submerged dike shows an evident role in mitigating the long waves as compared with the thin barriers subsequently the thin barriers are effective in the dissipation of intermediate and shorter wave amplitudes thereafter several scientists recommended the wave induced flow past submerged horizontal barriers in several formats such as submerged horizontal barrier cho and kim 2013 double horizontal plate placed in non stratified fluid liu et al 2008 and stratified fluid medina rodríguez and silva 2018 multiple inclined plates cho and kim 2008 the surface plate with bottom pitching plate karmakar and guedes soares 2018 and plate of the finite thickness liu et al 2012 using the analytical numerical and laboratory measurements to create a calm wave climate from the intermediate and shorter wave periods the recommended angle of inclination for optimal performance of inclined plate breakwater is nearly 200 and the bottom inclined plate placed near seabed shows an inconsequential role on wave damping in the case of multiple inclined plates cho and kim 2008 in the case of double horizontal plates upper porous and bottom rigid plate the moderate wave transmission k t 0 55 is obtained for the specific value of dimensionless plate length liu et al 2008 very recently the identical ripples medina rodríguez et al 2016 and non identical ripples yueh et al 2016 are acquainted for the horizontally submerged plate of finite thickness and non finite thinness to improve the property of reflection medina rodríguez et al 2016 examined the sinusoidal wavy plate of finite thickness in the presence of wavy elevated and horizontal bottom and the study concluded that the wavy bottom displays the higher magnitude of wave reflection as compared with the horizontal bottom yueh et al 2016 used dual bem to examine the wave reflection performance of the submerged composite wavy barrier the study reported several identical conditions such as wave scattering performance of sinusoidal rippled bed and comparative study of the horizontal wavy and composite wavy barrier most of the cases show that the composite wavy barrier displays the highest wave reflection as compared with the other plates finally the study recommended the composite wavy barrier as a substitution of rubble mound breakwaters comprised of sloping edges in environmentally sensitive locations from the past three decades the bem has emerged as a powerful numerical technique for solving a variety of physical problems arising in science and engineering bem facilitates a clear advantage at least in the case of linear operators over the other discretization techniques due to its dimensionality reduction by order one which helps in saving memory and computational time in the field of wave structure interaction numerous scientists and engineers reported the wave induced flow past porous and non porous structures using bem composite bem and multi domain bem yueh and tsaur 1999 yueh and chuang 2012 liu and li 2017 vijay et al 2019 the traditional bem suffers rank deficiency issues of influence matrices for problems involving degenerate boundaries although the multi domain bem can deal with degenerate boundary problems by splitting the original domain into two subdomains however the introduction of hypersingular integral formulation plays an important role to solve the problem efficiently in a single domain though the problem can be dealt with multi domain bem the matrix size is comparatively higher to simplify the problem the researchers and scientists headed towards the dbem for solving degenerate boundary value problems considering a single domain the dbem is identified as an elegant tool to determine rank deficiency issues and it is recommended by several notable authors chen et al 1994 2002 2004 chen and chen 1998 from the mathematical perspective one can not guarantee the uniqueness of the solution for rank deficiency problems hong and chen 1988 paved the way to use the classical dual bem to handle rank deficiency issues of the conventional bem applying dual bem the degenerate boundary problems such as crack problems and cutoff walls in seepage problems were easily tackled without dividing the actual domain into the subdomain the fundamental thought behind the dual bem is the introduction of a hypersingular boundary integral equation for providing a full rank matrix yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et al 2017 to the best of the authors knowledge the surface gravity wave trapping by a composite permeable wavy barrier installed near an inclined impermeable wall using dbem is far from complete and this is the prime objective of the present work the wavy ripples available in the plate can alter the particle orbit and enhances the phase shift of incident waves in general it is identified that the water depth is minimal at the toe of the seawall and the seabed is undulating thus the present study considered a finite spacing between the seawall and submerged wavy barrier and it is regarded as a wave trapping chamber to minimize complexity in analysing the undulating seabed the present study is assumed that the water depth is constant the gap region available between the porous and non porous structures generates the harmonic oscillations in the form of optima and zero minima in the trapping and force coefficients the significant contribution of the present study lies in the methodology based on the dbem and the influence of a wavy plate near a sloping seawall with this as motivation the surface gravity wave trapping by a composite wavy barrier near a sloping seawall is investigated section 1 briefs the imperative need and viable utilization of thin wave hindrances in creating the quiescent wave field followed by a literature study and motivation section 2 presents the mathematical formulation of the present numerical study section 3 discusses the methodology based on the dbem to solve the boundary value problem section 4 presents the validation of the developed numerical code and the various results of engineering interest of the present physical problem the wave reflection wave run up vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall for a composite wavy barrier installed near an inclined wall are reported for different wave and structural parameters finally section 5 provides a summary of the conclusions and significant recommendations based on the parametric study 2 mathematical formulation gravity wave interaction with a horizontally submerged thin wavy porous barrier located at a finite distance from the sloping seawall is investigated in the context of two dimensional linear water wave theory the porous barrier is assumed to be tightly held in place i e zero degrees of freedom by a group of piles at a certain distance along the y axis in the cartesian coordinate system the x axis is taken along the horizontal axis and z axis is vertically positive upward with the origin chosen at the free water surface as shown in fig 1 the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω therefore the existence

when c r 0 the boundary condition boils down to the far field condition a value ranging between zero and unity is often used to mimic the partially reflecting wall isaacson and qu 1990 the configuration of the thin porous barrier fig 2 is obtained by superposing the sine curves yueh et al 2016 and its structural shape or wavy profile is given as 5 p x h 1 n 0 d a n sin 2 n π x b 0 x b where a n a and b refers to plate width the flow past porous structure obeys a semi empirical quadratic discharge equation derived by molin and remy 2015 and reused by liu and li 2017 and lyu et al

the application of the separation of variables method the velocity potential in the outer regions is given by 10 φ i g h 2 ω e i k 0 x l r 0 e i k 0 x l z 0 z x l the breakwater setup is considered to be at a sufficiently long distance l h 5 sufficiently far distance from the breakwater from the fictitious far field where the effect of evanescent modes contribution is assumed to be negligible mackay and johanning 2020 on the fictitious boundary the velocity potential and the horizontal fluid velocity potential must be continuous in eq 10 the eigenfunction z 0 z is given by 11 z 0 z cosh k

at the interface of free surface and sloping wall to the incident wave height and is given as zhao et al 2017 14 k h 2 i ρ ω φ g h 3 numerical solution using dual boundary element method dbem the computational domain of a thin wavy porous barrier near a sloping seawall is shown in fig 3 as discussed in section 1 the present boundary value problem is solved in a single domain instead of a multi domain which eliminates the unnecessary creation of matching boundaries and as a result greater reduction in the matrix size to derive the boundary integral equation corresponding to a given differential equation free space green s function and green s second identity are required let g l q p ln r and g l q p n q 1 r r n q n q is the unit outward normal at point q be the fundamental

boundary integral equations can be obtained across the boundaries of thin zero thickness porous breakwater by considering the boundary points on the two sides of the degenerate boundary which are given by hong and chen 1988 yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et al 2017 17 π φ p γ φ q g l q p n q g l q p φ q n q d γ q p γ r γ 18 π φ p n p γ φ q 2 g l q p n p n q g l q p n p φ q n q d γ q p γ where γ r

obtain the analytical solution corresponding to the system of boundary integral equations given by eqs 17 and 18 therefore some form of numerical approximation is necessary in the numerical implementation of dbem the boundary γ is discretized into n constant elements in a counter clockwise sense eq 17 can be rewritten in a matrix form as follows 19 u i j φ n t i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices u i j and t i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients u i j and t i j which are given as follows 20 u i j γ j ln r d γ q t i j γ j n q ln r d γ q π δ i j in the case of a non vanishing thickness plate type breakwater the unknown velocity potential can be obtained by solving eq 19 whereas in the case of a thin or vanishing thickness breakwater it is not sufficient to achieve a unique solution due to the rank deficiency of the influence matrices hence it is necessary to include the hypersingular boundary integral equation the hypersingular boundary integral equation can be derived by applying the normal derivatives to the boundary integral equation of the potential function eq 15 by discretizing the boundary γ into n constant elements eq 18 can also be written in a matrix form as follows 21 l i j φ n m i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices l i j and m i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients l i j and m i j which are

resultant system of matrix equations given by 23 u γ r γ r u γ r γ u γ r γ u γ γ r u γ γ u γ γ l γ γ r l γ γ l γ γ φ n γ r φ n γ φ n γ t γ r γ r t γ r γ t γ r γ t γ γ r t γ γ t γ γ m γ γ r m γ γ m γ γ φ γ r φ γ φ γ after employing the boundary conditions eqs 2 13 into eq 23 we obtain the following system of the linear algebraic equations 24 a x y where y contains the known boundary data of the potential and normal flux it is worth mentioning that as the boundary condition on the porous boxes is nonlinear i e quadratic obtaining a numerical solution is not straightforward therefore we adopted an iterative procedure given by liu and li 2017 the solution of eq 24 provides the unknown boundary data x the scattering coefficients by the breakwater system are computed using eqs 12 14 the time independent non dimensional vertical force and horizontal force on the wall is given as 25 z p p x z n z d γ ρ g h h x w p x z n x d γ ρ g h h where p x z is the hydrodynamic pressure given by 26 p x z i ρ ω φ 4 results and discussion 4 1 convergence study in our present work we adopt the panel size based on the water depth and the constant of proportionality given by zhao et al 2020 as ν h κ the proportionality constant κ is varied for a range of relative water depth 0 5 3 0 and κ 120 is rationally chosen based on the numerical results presented in table 1 the study plays an important role in finding the suitable panel size of the discrete elements to optimally increase the accuracy and reduce the computation time it may be noted that in the case of the horizontal plate thickness is negligible to the incoming wave the force attracted by the structure is very less however due to the wavy nature of the barrier wherein the ripple amplitude exposes a certain length in the horizontal direction this attracts wave force which is not zero whose magnitude is minimal and is of the order of 1 10 of the vertical force thus the present study ignored to show the horizontal force coefficient 4 2 verification of the numerical code with mbem fig 4 a b illustrates the integrity of the developed code dbem with an independently developed numerical model based on mbem the degenerate boundary value problems involving thin boundaries inside the domain can be analyzed by combining the multiple regions wherein the connection between them is established by creating the artificial boundaries in which the continuity of velocity and pressure is maintained technically their contribution is zero and is purely used for combining the domains since for each discrete element both the velocity and pressure are unknown it increases the matrix size considerably depending on the number of elements in the artificial boundaries further these results are not of engineering interest to avoid creating artificial boundaries we resort to the dbem and the problem can be dealt within a single domain thus eliminating the need to maintain consistency in outward normal the test conditions of the flat barrier are b h 1 0 s b 1 5 h 1 h 0 20 c r 1 n r 1 θ 0 an excellent agreement is observed between the two numerical models dbem and mbem in the case of wave reflection fig 4a and vertical force on the barrier fig 4b in the case of mbem the problem involves splitting the computation domains and an artificial boundary is required to maintain the continuity of velocity and pressure to combine both the domains this complexity is eliminated in the present work based on the dbem some of the design parameters are kept fixed throughout the present work such as the water depth h 4 m thickness of thin porous barrier δ 1 cm discharge coefficient α 0 40 and relative wave steepness h λ 0 05 unless otherwise mentioned 4 3 effect of porosity fig 5 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 5a b wave run up k h fig 5b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 5c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 5d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of wavy barrier porosity μ the partially reflecting inclined wall is set at a finite distance from the wavy barrier and the sloping angle of the seawall is considered to be θ 30 in the clockwise direction leeward inclined wall the full wave reflection k r 1 is obtained for no plate case and it is due to the consideration of zero flow condition c r 1 with the introduction of the wavy porous plate an artificial wave trapping chamber is created and the oscillating pattern in k r is observed for all the combinations of porosity in addition the oscillating crest in the k h zero minima of z p and again oscillating crest in the x w is observed at k 0 h 0 8 for all the combinations of wavy barrier porosity the magnitude of the primary oscillations in the trapping coefficients diminishes with the increase of plate porosity due to a change in the fluid discharge through the composite wavy plate in general the wave scattering and trapping coefficients display a unique pattern for change in non dimensional wave number and the pattern is an oscillating crest followed by an oscillating trough however the magnitude of oscillating crest and troughs may vary with changes in the properties of incident waves and breakwater in the case of intermediate depth the fluid oscillations in k r are observed to be high due to non identical ripple amplitude the oscillating peaks are sharp whereas the troughs approach almost zero value because of progress in porosity in the case of the run up coefficient fig 5b the gradual enhance of k h for long period waves followed by the almost identical values of k h for intermediate and short period waves is obtained in the case of the no plate case with a change in k 0 h by introducing the porous wavy barrier the minimal plate porosity μ 0 1 shows lesser wave run up due to higher wave reflection as a result of reduced pores the higher values of k h is noted for maximal value of plate porosity and the effect is more prominent in the case of intermediate and short period waves in the case of wave force coefficients the minimal plate porosity allows minimal wave energy through the plate thus the optima of vertical force on the barrier z p is noted for minimal plate porosity μ 0 1 in intermediate waves k 0 h 1 higher values of porosity minimize the optima of z p and the change in the optima of z p is observed due to the conversion of trapped incident wave mass in the gap region from potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa vijay et al 2019 thereafter a sudden fall of z p followed by the little rise of z p is observed with an increase in the k 0 h in the no plate condition the wavy plate is transparent to the incident waves thus zero vertical force is observed the monotonic reduction of horizontal force on the wall x w is obtained for the no plate condition for change in the k 0 h with the introduction of a wavy plate there exists an oscillatory pattern of x w due to wave motion over wavy surfaces the intensity of the oscillatory pattern is significant for the wavy plate of minimal porosity μ 0 1 as compared with maximal porosity μ 0 4 the very significant reduction of x w is observed for all the combinations of plate porosity in the intermediate and short period waves due to the significant wave damping by the porous plate the higher wave force on the wall x w is observed in the case of long period waves due to zero porosity offered by the sloping wall and a rigid wall obstructs the total fluid discharged through the wavy porous plate it is also observed that the wavy plate porosity μ 0 4 shows almost similar values to that of the no plate case this strongly suggests that the wavy plate of moderate porosity μ 0 2 is suitable to balance the vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall as compared with higher porosity μ 0 4 4 4 effect of number of ripples fig 6 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 6a b wave run up k h fig 6b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 6c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 6d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of the number of ripples d the oscillatory peaks and troughs are observed to be varied within zero and unity respectively for the flat and wavy plate the flat plate displays higher wave reflection for intermediate and longer waves with the addition of ripples to a horizontal plate the magnitude of harmonic oscillations the difference between harmonic crest and trough is observed to increase with the number of ripples due to the superposition of incident and reflected wave amplitudes for intermediate and short period waves the minimal wave reflection k r 0 1 is observed for d 4 ripples in the general potential problems the zero minima of wave reflection generally treated as full wave trapping and moderate minimal estimation of wave reflection is termed as partial wave trapping thus the wavy porous plate having d 4 can effectively work as an effective wave trapping system as compared with the horizontal porous plate for intermediate waves the horizontal plate and wavy plate display almost identical values of wave run up but the wavy plate consists of d 4 ripples show a little decrease of wave run up as compared with the horizontal plate for shorter waves this could be possible because of a change in the fluid discharge pattern in the presence of a horizontal plate and wavy plate from the practical viewpoint numerous authors examined the incident wave motion over a wavy rigid bed and few of the authors identified the bragg resonant reflection by the wavy rigid bed mei et al 1988 similarly in the case of the composite wavy plate the minimal wave reflection and minimal wave run up are achieved and it may be due to the effect of artificial damping chamber created near the wall region and also back and forth motions of incident waves near wavy surfaces the vertical force on the wavy barrier z p and horizontal force on the wall x w displays an inverse relationship in the case of long period waves the wavy plate exhibits minimal hindrance thus the total incident wave is reflected by the sloping rigid wall in the case of long period waves hence the almost zero minima of z p and unity value of x w is obtained and monotonic increasing pattern of z p in an oscillatory manner and decreasing pattern of x w is observed with an increase in k 0 h the number of ripples shows a considerable reduction of vertical force on the barrier z p at each of the oscillating trough for intermediate and short period waves and it is evident within 1 k 0 h 4 in the construction viewpoint the submerged wavy barrier is fully constrained i e zero degrees of freedom and it is placed in the given location with the help of slender piles the incident wave diffraction by slender piles is viewed as insignificant due to negligible thickness the strong slender piles are a prerequisite in the construction perspective to withstand the wavy plate from higher wave loading however the higher number of ripples diminishes wave force at each of the harmonic troughs thus the slender piles penetration length can be reduced and it decreases the capital cost to install the breakwater in the given location in the case of horizontal force on the wall x w the increase in the number of ripples doesn t affect the x w in the long intermediate and short period waves thus the present study recommends the composite wavy barrier for effective wave trapping and it will be useful to alter the wave reflection as compared with the flat plate 4 5 effect of ripple amplitude fig 7 a d shows the variation of a wave reflection k r fig 7a b wave run up k h fig 7b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 7c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 7d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of ripples amplitude a b the increase in the non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h illustrates the oscillatory pattern of wave reflection k r gayen and gupta 2020 due to the back and forth motion of incident and reflected waves by porous and non porous structures the primary oscillating trough is observed for the horizontal plate at k 0 h 1 1 with the introduction of wavy surfaces the forward shift in the oscillatory trough is observed for ripple amplitude within 0 025 a b 0 075 in the wave reflection thereafter the enhance of ripple amplitude shows a larger deviation of wave reflection from the practical viewpoint the surge in the ripple amplitude increases the total surface area of the composite wavy barrier and allows maximal interaction with the incident waves in addition the wavy barrier diminishes the oscillatory pattern in the wave run up as compared with the flat plate for intermediate and short period waves the slight decreasing trend of wave run up is observed due to the interference effect of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes in the case of vertical forces the horizontal plate shows a minor primary peak followed by a major secondary peak with an increase in the non dimensional wave number by introducing the ripples the plate transforms into a wavy barrier and the wavy barrier shows a moderate increase of primary peak and moderate decrease on the secondary peak the larger deviation is obtained in the vertical force on the barrier z p with an increase in the ripple amplitude particularly the a b 0 075 converts the minor peak into a major peak at k 0 h 0 41 and vice versa this finding is completely new and it is useful to balance the vertical force on the barrier on changing the ripple amplitude the harmonic peak of vertical force z p is observed for the horizontal plate at k 0 h 1 06 and as a comparison the 2 8 11 4 and 28 6 reduction of vertical force z p is obtained for ripple amplitudes a b 0 025 a b 0 050 and a b 0 075 respectively the sudden wave loadings on the floating structures may cause fatigue failures due to the dynamic nature of incident waves and these types of practical problems can overcome through the ripples on balancing the magnitude of harmonic oscillations the horizontal force on the wall is the least affected phenomenon for the change in the ripple amplitude and a monotonic decreasing pattern of horizontal force on the wall is observed with the change in the k 0 h for all the values of ripple amplitude as discussed in section 4 3 the decrease in the wave loading on the wavy barrier helps to reduce the depth of piles and in turn reduces the capital cost of breakwater and installation time 4 6 effect of relative spacing fig 8 a d shows the variation of a wave reflection k r fig 8a b wave run up k h fig 8b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 8c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 8d as a function of relative spacing s λ for different values of wavy barrier porosity μ the periodic harmonic oscillatory pattern of trapping and force coefficients is observed with the change in relative spacing s λ the harmonic peak followed by a harmonic trough of k r is observed periodically interestingly in the case of wave reflection the magnitude of the harmonic peak is the least affected as compared with the harmonic trough for all the values of porosity the barrier porosity μ 0 15 and μ 0 35 shows moderate values of k r and moderate barrier porosity μ 0 25 shows almost zero minima of k r and higher porosity μ 0 45 depicts shows higher values of k r at each of the harmonic troughs from a practical perspective in the case of a wave trapping chamber a special case called standing waves is observed by several researchers liu et al 2011 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020b as a result of interaction between the incident and reflected wave amplitudes the vertical and sloping walls generally reflect the incident wave amplitude due to zero porosity kumaran et al 2021 thus the π shift of incident waves followed by the formation of standing waves are the major reasons behind the periodic harmonic oscillations in the wave reflection in the case of horizontal and vertical barriers the fluid flows in vertical and horizontal directions however in the presence of a composite plate there exists a change in the flow pattern thus the certain non identical shift of harmonic trough is observed in the k r this finding may be useful for fine tuning the trapping coefficients in the design of wavy barriers located near partially reflecting seawalls the higher plate porosity allows more wave energy pass through structures thus the maximal wave run up k h is obtained for maximal porosity and minimal wave run up k h is noted for minimal plate porosity in the form of harmonic oscillations the effect of porosity is very significant at each of the harmonic troughs as compared to the harmonic peak a unit relative spacing s λ 1 shows a pair of harmonic peaks followed by a pair of harmonic troughs this shows that the relative spacing available between the fixed structures and floating structures served as incentives in developing the harmonic oscillations in the case of wave run up the maximal variation is observed at each of the harmonic troughs as a comparison the high wave run up is noted for μ 0 45 the 15 8 35 3 and 55 9 reduction of wave run up is achieved for μ 0 35 μ 0 25 and μ 0 15 respectively at s λ 0 26 the vertical force on the wavy barrier and horizontal force on the wall shows an inverse relation for various values of plate porosity and relative spacing in the case of a wavy barrier placed far away from the seawall the incident wave initially interacts with the wavy barrier in either a vertical direction or horizontal direction afterward the wavy barrier dissipates some part of the wave energy and the rest of the wave energy interacts with the porous seawall thus the wavy barrier experience maximal wave force as compared with the partially reflecting wall and the reduction of force exerted by the partially reflecting wall is marginal to protect the fixed rigid structures with the installation of porous objects the wavy ripples usually enhance the wave reflection and it causes a minimal force on the partially reflecting wall the periodic harmonic trough of vertical force on the barrier and periodic harmonic peak of force on the wall is obtained for the integer multiples of half of the wavelength for all the combinations of porosity the run up coefficient k h and horizontal force on the wall x w shows an almost identical pattern with the change in relative spacing and for all the combinations of porosity with a change in numerical values however the wave run up is higher as compared with the wave force experienced by the wall and this may be due to the higher incident wavelength k 0 h 2 π 3 as compared with the composite wavy barrier width b h 1 4 7 effect of relative submergence the submergence depth of the wavy barrier plays an effective role in creating the tranquil zone in the leeward regions the major part of the incident wave energy around 90 is concentrated near the free surface and the corresponding water depth is three times the incident wave height dai et al 2018 the optimal submergence depth of the porous plate is defined based on the distribution of incident wave field over and underneath the barrier thus the variation of trapping coefficients is reported for the gradual increase of submergence depth of wavy barrier fig 9 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 9a b wave run up k h fig 9b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 9c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 9d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of relative submergence of wavy barrier h 1 h the minimal relative submergence depth h 1 h 0 1 shows minimal wave reflection and minimal wave run up in the oscillatory pattern for intermediate and long period waves the increase in relative submergence depth diminishes the oscillations and almost full reflection is obtained for h 1 h 0 4 due to the presence of a fully reflecting leeward inclined wall in the case of minimal submergence depth h 1 h 0 1 the wavy ripples play a significant role in reducing the wave reflection and wave run up at each of the oscillating troughs however in the case of h 1 h 0 4 the incident waves don t interact with the wavy barrier and directly approaching the leeward inclined seawall thus the higher values of wave reflection are observed for h 1 h 0 4 the minimal wave run up is obtained for h 1 h 0 1 as compared with the h 1 h 0 4 the submergence depths h 1 h 0 3 and h 1 h 0 4 shows almost identical values of wave run up due to non variation of wave damping and wave trapping this shows that the effectiveness of the wavy barrier is highly reduced and almost negligible for higher submergence depth h 1 h 0 4 the optima of vertical force on the barrier is obtained by minimal relative submergence depth h 1 h 0 1 and the primary harmonic peak is observed in the z p for k 0 h 1 1 within a pair of sub harmonic peaks the zero minima of force exerted by wave barrier z p is noted for specific values of k 0 h for all the combinations of relative submerge which may be due to destructive interferences of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes however the magnitude of harmonic oscillations is marginal for the design of wavy barriers to protect the available fixed rigid structures a linear decreasing pattern of horizontal force on the wall x w is observed with an increase in the non dimensional wave number the infinitesimal variation of x w is observed for all the combinations of relative submergence h 1 h and this observation is a result of fluid damping by the waviness property of the barrier the short period waves display zero x w due to the higher wave reflection and wave damping by the submerged composite wavy barrier however the minimal variation between the x w for all the combinations of h 1 h is a result of the combined effect of wave damping and wave trapping by the wavy barrier finally the minimal h 1 h enhances the harmonic oscillations due to superior wave damping and wave trapping 4 8 effect of seawall inclination in the present study the wavy barrier is installed within the sight of the inclined seawall and the seawall is rotated in the anti clockwise acw and clockwise direction cw in general the angle of seawall inclination plays a significant role in creating the wave damping chamber to dissipate the trapped wave mass fig 10 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 10a b wave run up k h fig 10b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 10c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 10d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of seawall inclination θ varied within 45 0 acw θ 45 0 cw the seawall inclination is classified into three categories such as a seaward inclination θ 22 5 0 and 45 0 acw ii no inclination or vertical wall θ 90 0 and iii leeward inclination θ 22 5 0 and 45 0 cw the seaward inclination θ 45 0 shows the non harmonic oscillatory pattern of wave reflection in the intermediate and short period waves the 50 decrease in the angle of seawall inclination θ 22 5 0 illustrates the optima and minima of wave reflection for intermediate and deep water waves respectively the vertical wall and leeward inclined wall enhance the harmonic oscillations and the leeward inclined wall shows multiple optima and zero minima of wave reflection in the intermediate and short period waves the minimal wave reflection referred to as optimal wave trapping and partial wave trapping is achieved by leeward inclined seawall consists of θ 45 0 and partial wave trapping is obtained for θ 22 5 0 as a comparison the effect of the wavy barrier on wave trapping is minimal for the seaward inclined wall as compared with the leeward inclined wall the combination of wavy barrier and leeward inclined wall consists of θ 45 0 shows effective wave trapping due to the interference effect the seaward inclined wall minimizes the wave run up as compared with the vertical wall and leeward inclined wall due to change in the flow pattern by the shape characteristics of the trapping chamber seaward inclined interface the oscillatory pattern having minimal magnitude is observed in the wave run up by a vertical wall and an increase in the sloping angle of the leeward wall worked as incentives for increasing the oscillatory pattern in the wave run up due to the back and forth motion of the trapped wave mass however higher wave run up and multiple oscillatory peaks and troughs are observed in the wave run up for leeward inclined wall consists of θ 45 0 as compared with other cases the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 depicts a moderate sloping bottom and it allows the free movement of the trapped wave mass within the confined zone the double peaked pattern is noted in the vertical force on the barrier for the seaward inclined wall θ 45 0 in the presence of wavy barrier and optima of z p is observed for intermediate waves of k 0 h 0 8 the seaward inclined wall consists of θ 22 5 0 shows a triple peaked pattern along with zero minima of force on the wavy barrier thereafter the increase in the angle of inclination minimizes the first harmonic peak and maximizes the secondary oscillating peak due to the interference effect this kind of observation is similar to the change in ripple amplitude as reported in section 4 5 the vertical wall shows triple zero minima in the intermediate and short period waves respectively the leeward inclined walls illustrate multiple oscillatory peaks followed by troughs and all the combinations of the angle of inclination show the highest value of z p for intermediate waves the fluid force experienced by the seawall x w is almost similar for all the combinations of seawall inclination for long period waves and significant changes in the x w is observed for intermediate and short period waves the minimal estimation of x w is observed for the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 as compared with other cases and it is marginal in the meticulous design and development of wavy barriers within the sight of inclined seawalls the zero minima of x w is observed for the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 for change in k 0 h within 2 k 0 h 4 the leeward sloping wall allows more wave run up compared to the vertical wall and seaward inclined wall and it is already noted in fig 10b the leeward sloping wall acts as an effective damping chamber and this may be a major reason behind the zero minima of wave force on the wall in the case of intermediate and short period waves 4 9 effect of seawall porosity in general the partially reflecting seawall dissipates some part of wave energy and reflects the remaining wave energy the reflection and damping property of seawall can be controlled by changing the c r value the c r 1 indicates full wave reflection by the seawall and c r 0 demonstrates no wall condition leeward far field region the total wave transmitted from the wavy barrier interacts with the partially reflecting wall and the c r 0 5 depicts 50 of wave energy dissipated and the remaining 50 of wave energy reflected by the wall thus the effect of leeward inclined seawall θ 30 reflection property c r on the trapping characteristics is studied as a function of non dimensional wavelength fig 11 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 11a b wave run up k h fig 11b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 11c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 11d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of seawall reflection property porosity c r the interaction between the incident wave and wavy barrier is very minimal for long period waves and the total wave interacts with the inclined seawall thus the reflection property of seawall attenuates the incident waves for change in non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h within 0 01 k 0 h 0 50 the reflection of shallow water waves partially depends upon the reflection property of the seawall the initial values of k r is almost equals to c r but a small reduction of k r is observed due to the wave damping effect of the composite wavy barrier thereafter minor harmonic oscillations are observed in the wave reflection due to free fluid oscillations as a result of trapping chamber spacing s b 2 and higher barrier porosity μ 0 3 the increase in the c r means an increase in the reflecting property of inclined seawall and the lower values of c r shows minimal values of wave reflection and higher values of c r illustrates higher values of wave reflection due to wave damping by the seawall the almost identical values of wave run up coefficient k h is noted with the change in the non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h the higher c r 1 shows higher wave run up as compared with minimal c r 0 25 due to change in the wave damping property of inclined seawall a little oscillatory pattern is observed in the k h for c r 1 due to the interference effect of the incident and reflected waves in the trapping chamber the optima of wave run up are observed in the intermediate wave regime for fully reflecting inclined seawall c r 1 near k 0 h 1 71 and 17 34 and 51 reduction of wave run up is achieved with the introduction of partially reflecting seawall consists of c r 0 75 c r 0 50 and c r 0 25 respectively the optima of vertical force on the barrier z p is observed for fully reflecting inclined seawall c r 1 at k 0 h 1 1 and a considerable reduction of z p is observed with a decrease in the reflection property of inclined seawall thereafter the minimal value of wave reflection is observed for c r 1 at k 0 h 1 72 and a slight increase in z p is noted with a decrease in the c r the minimal c r 0 25 diminish the secondary peak which is observed for other values of c r at k 0 h 3 due to the enhanced wave damping by inclined partially reflecting seawall the horizontal force experienced by the inclined seawall x w follows an exponential downward pattern with enhance in the non dimensional wavelength for all the values of c r the lower values of c r shows the lower estimation of x w and higher values of c r illustrates higher values of x w due to wave damping offered by the inclined wall overall the partially reflecting wall shows better values of trapping and force coefficients as compared with the fully reflecting seawalls the present study suggests the moderate values of c r 0 5 to balance the trapping coefficients and force coefficients experienced by a composite wavy barrier and inclined seawall 4 10 effect of structure repetition fig 12 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 12a b wave run up k h fig 12b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 12c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 12d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for the different number of structure repetitions the n r 1 displays trapping and force coefficients of a single wavy barrier placed at a finite distance from the seawall and presents the trapping and force coefficients by an array of four identical wavy barriers having zero spacing between the two adjacent plates the increase in the plate number shows the minimal wave reflection in an oscillatory manner due to higher wave damping thus the corresponding wave run up is minimal in the case of intermediate and short period waves the four plate barrier reduces around 50 of wave run up as compared with the single plate barrier in the case of intermediate and short period waves however from the design aspect the higher number of plates enhances the protection and simultaneously marginal increase in the cost as these barriers are easy to fabricate and cost effective the magnitude of vertical force on the barrier z p is minimal and optima of z p is noticed in the case of intermediate waves the multiple wavy plates placed far away from the vertical wall offer higher wave reflection compared to a seaward and leeward inclined wall thus the leeward plate experiences higher wave force at each of the harmonic peaks and zero minima are obtained in the intermediate zone the increase in the number of plates displays the very minimal variation of vertical force on the wall for intermediate and short period waves due to the damping effect of multiple wavy barriers 5 conclusions in the present study the wave trapping efficiency of a composite wavy barrier at a finite distance from the inclined partially reflecting wall is examined using the dbem the validation of the present study numerical results dbem is verified with an independently developed numerical model based on mbem the effect of composite wavy barrier porosity the number of ripples ripple amplitude relative spacing relative submergence seawall inclination and seawall porosity on wave reflection wave run up the vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall are parametrically analyzed based on the numerical results the present study recommended a composite wavy plate of moderate porosity μ 0 2 having a higher number of ripples d 4 and higher ripple amplitude a b 0 20 placed in a submerged depth of 0 1 h 1 h 0 2 to viably distribute the incident wave amplitude in the form of trapping and force coefficients particularly the higher number of ripples diminish the wave reflection at each of the harmonic peaks and troughs due to the superposition of incident and reflected wave amplitudes thus the diameter and penetration depth of slender piles can be reduced as a special case three types of seawalls such as a seaward inclined wall leeward inclined wall and vertical wall with a composite wavy barrier is investigated and the optimal wave trapping and force coefficients are obtained for the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 finally the present study recommended the leeward partially reflecting wall consists of c r 0 5 and θ 45 0 with a composite wavy barrier further the present study suggests the composite wave barrier serves as an excellent alternative to the conventional breakwaters in real field

20459,in this work wave trapping characteristics of a permeable composite wavy barrier located near an inclined seawall are examined under the framework of linear potential flow theory for the waves past the thin barrier a semi empirical discharge equation having a quadratic pressure drop along with the velocity continuum is considered the boundary value problem is solved using the dual boundary

such as wave reflection wave run up the vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall are discussed considering various values of barrier porosity number of ripples ripple amplitude relative spacing between the wall and barrier relative submergence depth seawall inclination and seawall porosity the numerical results suggest that the performance of the wavy barrier within sight of

to global warming and it disastrously affects the waterfront populace and marine infrastructure to alleviate the sea level rise impact on fully developed near shore locales the seawalls have been developed in several shapes such as vertical seawalls stepped seawalls venkateswarlu and karmakar 2019 2020a sloping seawalls curved seawalls anand et al 2010 and permeable seawalls elchahal et al 2008 in general the seawalls are land based coastal structures and these are frequently constructed parallel to the shoreline koraim et al 2014 the primary function of the seawalls is mitigating wave flooding and wave overtopping due to storm surges in general the seawalls are impermeable in nature and generally reflect the total incident wave amplitude and reflected wave amplitude interacts again with the incoming waves in this procedure the partial clapotis vijay and sahoo 2019 and standing waves vijay et al 2020 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a 2021 are commonly observed as a result of the change in the fluid particle velocities most of the studies used the boundary element method bem to examine the breakwaters of non rectilinear shapes further the seawall encounters a higher wave force as a result of full wave reflection and it is one of the significant reasons behind the structural failures venkateswarlu and karmakar 2019 to reduce the wave force experienced by seawalls the submerged breakwaters are identified as primitive solutions and these are introduced in several formats in recent years the breakwater shape characteristics gained momentum and the general pattern of the breakwater advancement is identified as from impermeable rigid breakwaters to permeable breakwaters from sloping breakwaters to vertical breakwaters from the thick vertical porous barriers to thin vertical and horizontal porous barriers the thin breakwaters to flexible and wavy barriers yip and chwang 2000 cho and kim 2008 the vertical and horizontal thin porous structures vijay et al 2019 cho and kim 2008 inclined plates rao et al 2009 and composite wavy barriers yueh et al 2016 are suggested as dynamic wave dampers by several prominent workers based on merits and demerits to protect the fixed structures on account of a permeable hindrance with seawall the finite spacing is provided between the porous structures and fixed structures seawalls to create an artificial damping zone and this is consequently viewed as a wave trapping chamber several researchers headed towards the design and development of an effective wave trapping system on consolidating the several conceivable mechanisms such as i incident wave reflection ii wave trapping by gap region iii wave damping through porous flow and iv phase change of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes this can be accomplished by installing a wavy porous barrier near an existing seawall and it is worth mentioning that the tidal variation wave elevation as a result of global warming shows minimal impact on the fully submerged wavy barriers as compared with vertical barriers in general the thin barriers can be easily rearranged recycled removed and relocated in days and some cases in hours holy loch breakwater west coast of scotland from one installation site to another site besides the thin barriers are independent of water depth viably appropriate in sensitive bottom bed locales and offer minimal visual hindrance over the horizon but it is likewise detailed that the thin barriers are ineffective in creating the quiescent wave field in the case of long period waves in this specific case the seawall reflects the rest of the longwave energy transmitted from the wavy barrier thus the combination of submerged wavy barrier and inclined seawall with gap region is proposed as an effective solution to protect the coastal infrastructure to investigate the wave trapping efficiency of the wavy barrier with the inclined wall a brief review of the published articles is reported the submerged horizontal plate has been recommended as an active wave damper by several notable workers patarapanich and cheong 1989 neelamani and reddy 1992 to stifle the vertical motion of the incident wave and corresponding wave oscillations near the free surface yueh and tsaur 1999 carried out a comparative study on wave scattering performance of submerged dike and thin barriers using composite bem the submerged dike shows an evident role in mitigating the long waves as compared with the thin barriers subsequently the thin barriers are effective in the dissipation of intermediate and shorter wave amplitudes thereafter several scientists recommended the wave induced flow past submerged horizontal barriers in several formats such as submerged horizontal barrier cho and kim 2013 double horizontal plate placed in non stratified fluid liu et al 2008 and stratified fluid medina rodríguez and silva 2018 multiple inclined plates cho and kim 2008 the surface plate with bottom pitching plate karmakar and guedes soares 2018 and plate of the finite thickness liu et al 2012 using the analytical numerical and laboratory measurements to create a calm wave climate from the intermediate and shorter wave periods the recommended angle of inclination for optimal performance of inclined plate breakwater is nearly 200 and the bottom inclined plate placed near seabed shows an inconsequential role on wave damping in the case of multiple inclined plates cho and kim 2008 in the case of double horizontal plates upper porous and bottom rigid plate the moderate wave transmission k t 0 55 is obtained for the specific value of dimensionless plate length liu et al 2008 very recently the identical ripples medina rodríguez et al 2016 and non identical ripples yueh et al 2016 are acquainted for the horizontally submerged plate of finite thickness and non finite thinness to improve the property of reflection medina rodríguez et al 2016 examined the sinusoidal wavy plate of finite thickness in the presence of wavy elevated and horizontal bottom and the study concluded that the wavy bottom displays the higher magnitude of wave reflection as compared with the horizontal bottom yueh et al 2016 used dual bem to examine the wave reflection performance of the submerged composite wavy barrier the study reported several identical conditions such as wave scattering performance of sinusoidal rippled bed and comparative study of the horizontal wavy and composite wavy barrier most of the cases show that the composite wavy barrier displays the highest wave reflection as compared with the other plates finally the study recommended the composite wavy barrier as a substitution of rubble mound breakwaters comprised of sloping edges in environmentally sensitive locations from the past three decades the bem has emerged as a powerful numerical technique for solving a variety of physical problems arising in science and engineering bem facilitates a clear advantage at least in the case of linear operators over the other discretization techniques due to its dimensionality reduction by order one which helps in saving memory and computational time in the field of wave structure interaction numerous scientists and engineers reported the wave induced flow past porous and non porous structures using bem composite bem and multi domain bem yueh and tsaur 1999 yueh and chuang 2012 liu and li 2017 vijay et al 2019 the traditional bem suffers rank deficiency issues of influence matrices for problems involving degenerate boundaries although the multi domain bem can deal with degenerate boundary problems by splitting the original domain into two subdomains however the introduction of hypersingular integral formulation plays an important role to solve the problem efficiently in a single domain though the problem can be dealt with multi domain bem the matrix size is comparatively higher to simplify the problem the researchers and scientists headed towards the dbem for solving degenerate boundary value problems considering a single domain the dbem is identified as an elegant tool to determine rank deficiency issues and it is recommended by several notable authors chen et al 1994 2002 2004 chen and chen 1998 from the mathematical perspective one can not guarantee the uniqueness of the solution for rank deficiency problems hong and chen 1988 paved the way to use the classical dual bem to handle rank deficiency issues of the conventional bem applying dual bem the degenerate boundary problems such as crack problems and cutoff walls in seepage problems were easily tackled without dividing the actual domain into the subdomain the fundamental thought behind the dual bem is the introduction of a hypersingular boundary integral equation for providing a full rank matrix yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et al 2017 to the best of the authors knowledge the surface gravity wave trapping by a composite permeable wavy barrier installed near an inclined impermeable wall using dbem is far from complete and this is the prime objective of the present work the wavy ripples available in the plate can alter the particle orbit and enhances the phase shift of incident waves in general it is identified that the water depth is minimal at the toe of the seawall and the seabed is undulating thus the present study considered a finite spacing between the seawall and submerged wavy barrier and it is regarded as a wave trapping chamber to minimize complexity in analysing the undulating seabed the present study is assumed that the water depth is constant the gap region available between the porous and non porous structures generates the harmonic oscillations in the form of optima and zero minima in the trapping and force coefficients the significant contribution of the present study lies in the methodology based on the dbem and the influence of a wavy plate near a sloping seawall with this as motivation the surface gravity wave trapping by a composite wavy barrier near a sloping seawall is investigated section 1 briefs the imperative need and viable utilization of thin wave hindrances in creating the quiescent wave field followed by a literature study and motivation section 2 presents the mathematical formulation of the present numerical study section 3 discusses the methodology based on the dbem to solve the boundary value problem section 4 presents the validation of the developed numerical code and the various results of engineering interest of the present physical problem the wave reflection wave run up vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall for a composite wavy barrier installed near an inclined wall are reported for different wave and structural parameters finally section 5 provides a summary of the conclusions and significant recommendations based on the parametric study 2 mathematical formulation gravity wave interaction with a horizontally submerged thin wavy porous barrier located at a finite distance from the sloping seawall is investigated in the context of two dimensional linear water wave theory the porous barrier is assumed to be tightly held in place i e zero degrees of freedom by a group of piles at a certain distance along the y axis in the cartesian coordinate system the x axis is taken along the horizontal axis and z axis is vertically positive upward with the origin chosen at the free water surface as shown in fig 1 the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω therefore the existence

elchahal et al 2008 is given by 4 φ n i k 0 1 c r 1 c r φ where c r denotes the reflection coefficient of the seawall it may be noted that when c r 1 the boundary condition reduces to no flow whereas when c r 0 the boundary condition boils down to the far field condition a value ranging between zero and unity is often used to mimic the partially reflecting wall isaacson and qu 1990 the configuration of the thin porous barrier fig 2 is obtained by superposing the sine curves yueh et al 2016 and its structural shape or wavy profile is given as 5 p x h 1 n 0 d a n sin 2 n π x b 0 x b where a n a and b refers to plate width the flow past porous structure obeys a semi empirical quadratic discharge equation derived by molin and remy 2015 and reused by liu and li 2017 and lyu et al 2020 is adopted the pressure drop across the porous barrier is considered to be proportional to the square of the normal velocity of the fluid and is given as 6 φ φ 8 i 3 π ω 1 μ 2 α μ 2 φ n φ n 2 c b

and the superscript and denote the velocity potential on the upper and lower sides of the wavy porous plate respectively the coefficients of the quadratic term in eq 6 denote the energy dissipation and that of the velocity term denotes the inertial effects moreover the fluid velocity normal to the porous structure is assumed to be continuous which yield 7 φ n φ n based on the experiments suh et al 2011 and huang et al 2011 revealed an empirical relation for the blockage coefficient as 8 c b δ 2 μ where δ represents the thickness of the plate the far field boundary conditions on the left

the application of the separation of variables method the velocity potential in the outer regions is given by 10 φ i g h 2 ω e i k 0 x l r 0 e i k 0 x l z 0 z x l the breakwater setup is considered to be at a sufficiently long distance l h 5 sufficiently far distance from the breakwater from the fictitious far field where the effect of evanescent modes contribution is assumed to be negligible mackay and johanning 2020 on the fictitious boundary the velocity potential and the horizontal fluid velocity potential must be continuous in eq 10 the eigenfunction z 0 z is given by 11 z 0 z cosh k

at the interface of free surface and sloping wall to the incident wave height and is given as zhao et al 2017 14 k h 2 i ρ ω φ g h 3 numerical solution using dual boundary element method dbem the computational domain of a thin wavy porous barrier near a sloping seawall is shown in fig 3 as discussed in section 1 the present boundary value problem is solved in a single domain instead of a multi domain which eliminates the unnecessary creation of matching boundaries and as a result greater reduction in the matrix size to derive the boundary integral equation corresponding to a given differential equation free space green s function and green s second identity are required let g l q p ln r and g l q p n q 1 r r n q n q is the unit outward normal at point q be the fundamental

the general field point p x z and the integration point q ξ η i e r x ξ 2 z η 2 and γ is the resultant of all the boundaries in the computational domain ω the system of singular and hyper singular boundary integral equations can be obtained across the boundaries of thin zero thickness porous breakwater by considering the boundary points on the two sides of the degenerate boundary which are given by hong and chen 1988 yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et al 2017 17 π φ p γ φ q g l q p n q g l q p φ q n q d γ q p γ r γ 18 π φ p n p γ φ q 2 g l q p n p n q g l q p n p φ q n q d γ q p γ where γ r

obtain the analytical solution corresponding to the system of boundary integral equations given by eqs 17 and 18 therefore some form of numerical approximation is necessary in the numerical implementation of dbem the boundary γ is discretized into n constant elements in a counter clockwise sense eq 17 can be rewritten in a matrix form as follows 19 u i j φ n t i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices u i j and t i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients u i j and t i j which are given as follows 20 u i j γ j ln r d γ q t i j γ j n q ln r d γ q π δ i j in the case of a non vanishing thickness plate type breakwater the unknown velocity potential can be obtained by solving eq 19 whereas in the case of a thin or vanishing thickness breakwater it is not sufficient to achieve a unique solution due to the rank deficiency of the influence matrices hence it is necessary to include the hypersingular boundary integral equation the hypersingular boundary integral equation can be derived by applying the normal derivatives to the boundary integral equation of the potential function eq 15 by discretizing the boundary γ into n constant elements eq 18 can also be written in a matrix form as follows 21 l i j φ n m i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices l i j and m i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients l i j and m i j which are

φ γ r φ γ φ γ after employing the boundary conditions eqs 2 13 into eq 23 we obtain the following system of the linear algebraic equations 24 a x y where y contains the known boundary data of the potential and normal flux it is worth mentioning that as the boundary condition on the porous boxes is nonlinear i e quadratic obtaining a numerical solution is not straightforward therefore we adopted an iterative procedure given by liu and li 2017 the solution of eq 24 provides the unknown boundary data x the scattering coefficients by the breakwater system are computed using eqs 12 14 the time independent non dimensional vertical force and horizontal force on the wall is given as 25 z p p x z n z d γ ρ g h h x w p x z n x d γ ρ g h h where p x z is the hydrodynamic pressure given by 26 p x z i ρ ω φ 4 results and discussion 4 1 convergence study in our present work we adopt the panel size based on the water depth and the constant of proportionality given by zhao et al 2020 as ν h κ the proportionality constant κ is varied for a range of relative water depth 0 5 3 0 and κ 120 is rationally chosen based on the numerical results presented in table 1 the study plays an important role in finding the suitable panel size of the discrete elements to optimally increase the accuracy and reduce the computation time it may be noted that in the case of the horizontal plate thickness is negligible to the incoming wave the force attracted by the structure is very less however due to the wavy nature of the barrier wherein the ripple amplitude exposes a certain length in the horizontal direction this attracts wave force which is not zero whose magnitude is minimal and is of the order of 1 10 of the vertical force thus the present study ignored to show the horizontal force coefficient 4 2 verification of the numerical code with mbem fig 4 a b illustrates the integrity of the developed code dbem with an independently developed numerical model based on mbem the degenerate boundary value problems involving thin boundaries inside the domain can be analyzed by combining the multiple regions wherein the connection between them is established by creating the artificial boundaries in which the continuity of velocity and pressure is maintained technically their contribution is zero and is purely used for combining the domains since for each discrete element both the velocity and pressure are unknown it increases the matrix size considerably depending on the number of elements in the artificial boundaries further these results are not of engineering interest to avoid creating artificial boundaries we resort to the dbem and the problem can be dealt within a single domain thus eliminating the need to maintain consistency in outward normal the test conditions of the flat barrier are b h 1 0 s b 1 5 h 1 h 0 20 c r 1 n r 1 θ 0 an excellent agreement is observed between the two numerical models dbem and mbem in the case of wave reflection fig 4a and vertical force on the barrier fig 4b in the case of mbem the problem involves splitting the computation domains and an artificial boundary is required to maintain the continuity of velocity and pressure to combine both the domains this complexity is eliminated in the present work based on the dbem some of the design parameters are kept fixed throughout the present work such as the water depth h 4 m thickness of thin porous barrier δ 1 cm discharge coefficient α 0 40 and relative wave steepness h λ 0 05 unless otherwise mentioned 4 3 effect of porosity fig 5 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 5a b wave run up k h fig 5b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 5c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 5d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of wavy barrier porosity μ the partially reflecting inclined wall is set at a finite distance from the wavy barrier and the sloping angle of the seawall is considered to be θ 30 in the clockwise direction leeward inclined wall the full wave reflection k r 1 is obtained for no plate case and it is due to the consideration of zero flow condition c r 1 with the introduction of the wavy porous plate an artificial wave trapping chamber is created and the oscillating pattern in k r is observed for all the combinations of porosity in addition the oscillating crest in the k h zero minima of z p and again oscillating crest in the x w is observed at k 0 h 0 8 for all the combinations of wavy barrier porosity the magnitude of the primary oscillations in the trapping coefficients diminishes with the increase of plate porosity due to a change in the fluid discharge through the composite wavy plate in general the wave scattering and trapping coefficients display a unique pattern for change in non dimensional wave number and the pattern is an oscillating crest followed by an oscillating trough however the magnitude of oscillating crest and troughs may vary with changes in the properties of incident waves and breakwater in the case of intermediate depth the fluid oscillations in k r are observed to be high due to non identical ripple amplitude the oscillating peaks are sharp whereas the troughs approach almost zero value because of progress in porosity in the case of the run up coefficient fig 5b the gradual enhance of k h for long period waves followed by the almost identical values of k h for intermediate and short period waves is obtained in the case of the no plate case with a change in k 0 h by introducing the porous wavy barrier the minimal plate porosity μ 0 1 shows lesser wave run up due to higher wave reflection as a result of reduced pores the higher values of k h is noted for maximal value of plate porosity and the effect is more prominent in the case of intermediate and short period waves in the case of wave force coefficients the minimal plate porosity allows minimal wave energy through the plate thus the optima of vertical force on the barrier z p is noted for minimal plate porosity μ 0 1 in intermediate waves k 0 h 1 higher values of porosity minimize the optima of z p and the change in the optima of z p is observed due to the conversion of trapped incident wave mass in the gap region from potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa vijay et al 2019 thereafter a sudden fall of z p followed by the little rise of z p is observed with an increase in the k 0 h in the no plate condition the wavy plate is transparent to the incident waves thus zero vertical force is observed the monotonic reduction of horizontal force on the wall x w is obtained for the no plate condition for change in the k 0 h with the introduction of a wavy plate there exists an oscillatory pattern of x w due to wave motion over wavy surfaces the intensity of the oscillatory pattern is significant for the wavy plate of minimal porosity μ 0 1 as compared with maximal porosity μ 0 4 the very significant reduction of x w is observed for all the combinations of plate porosity in the intermediate and short period waves due to the significant wave damping by the porous plate the higher wave force on the wall x w is observed in the case of long period waves due to zero porosity offered by the sloping wall and a rigid wall obstructs the total fluid discharged through the wavy porous plate it is also observed that the wavy plate porosity μ 0 4 shows almost similar values to that of the no plate case this strongly suggests that the wavy plate of moderate porosity μ 0 2 is suitable to balance the vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall as compared with higher porosity μ 0 4 4 4 effect of number of ripples fig 6 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 6a b wave run up k h fig 6b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 6c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 6d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of the number of ripples d the oscillatory peaks and troughs are observed to be varied within zero and unity respectively for the flat and wavy plate the flat plate displays higher wave reflection for intermediate and longer waves with the addition of ripples to a horizontal plate the magnitude of harmonic oscillations the difference between harmonic crest and trough is observed to increase with the number of ripples due to the superposition of incident and reflected wave amplitudes for intermediate and short period waves the minimal wave reflection k r 0 1 is observed for d 4 ripples in the general potential problems the zero minima of wave reflection generally treated as full wave trapping and moderate minimal estimation of wave reflection is termed as partial wave trapping thus the wavy porous plate having d 4 can effectively work as an effective wave trapping system as compared with the horizontal porous plate for intermediate waves the horizontal plate and wavy plate display almost identical values of wave run up but the wavy plate consists of d 4 ripples show a little decrease of wave run up as compared with the horizontal plate for shorter waves this could be possible because of a change in the fluid discharge pattern in the presence of a horizontal plate and wavy plate from the practical viewpoint numerous authors examined the incident wave motion over a wavy rigid bed and few of the authors identified the bragg resonant reflection by the wavy rigid bed mei et al 1988 similarly in the case of the composite wavy plate the minimal wave reflection and minimal wave run up are achieved and it may be due to the effect of artificial damping chamber created near the wall region and also back and forth motions of incident waves near wavy surfaces the vertical force on the wavy barrier z p and horizontal force on the wall x w displays an inverse relationship in the case of long period waves the wavy plate exhibits minimal hindrance thus the total incident wave is reflected by the sloping rigid wall in the case of long period waves hence the almost zero minima of z p and unity value of x w is obtained and monotonic increasing pattern of z p in an oscillatory manner and decreasing pattern of x w is observed with an increase in k 0 h the number of ripples shows a considerable reduction of vertical force on the barrier z p at each of the oscillating trough for intermediate and short period waves and it is evident within 1 k 0 h 4 in the construction viewpoint the submerged wavy barrier is fully constrained i e zero degrees of freedom and it is placed in the given location with the help of slender piles the incident wave diffraction by slender piles is viewed as insignificant due to negligible thickness the strong slender piles are a prerequisite in the construction perspective to withstand the wavy plate from higher wave loading however the higher number of ripples diminishes wave force at each of the harmonic troughs thus the slender piles penetration length can be reduced and it decreases the capital cost to install the breakwater in the given location in the case of horizontal force on the wall x w the increase in the number of ripples doesn t affect the x w in the long intermediate and short period waves thus the present study recommends the composite wavy barrier for effective wave trapping and it will be useful to alter the wave reflection as compared with the flat plate 4 5 effect of ripple amplitude fig 7 a d shows the variation of a wave reflection k r fig 7a b wave run up k h fig 7b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 7c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 7d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of ripples amplitude a b the increase in the non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h illustrates the oscillatory pattern of wave reflection k r gayen and gupta 2020 due to the back and forth motion of incident and reflected waves by porous and non porous structures the primary oscillating trough is observed for the horizontal plate at k 0 h 1 1 with the introduction of wavy surfaces the forward shift in the oscillatory trough is observed for ripple amplitude within 0 025 a b 0 075 in the wave reflection thereafter the enhance of ripple amplitude shows a larger deviation of wave reflection from the practical viewpoint the surge in the ripple amplitude increases the total surface area of the composite wavy barrier and allows maximal interaction with the incident waves in addition the wavy barrier diminishes the oscillatory pattern in the wave run up as compared with the flat plate for intermediate and short period waves the slight decreasing trend of wave run up is observed due to the interference effect of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes in the case of vertical forces the horizontal plate shows a minor primary peak followed by a major secondary peak with an increase in the non dimensional wave number by introducing the ripples the plate transforms into a wavy barrier and the wavy barrier shows a moderate increase of primary peak and moderate decrease on the secondary peak the larger deviation is obtained in the vertical force on the barrier z p with an increase in the ripple amplitude particularly the a b 0 075 converts the minor peak into a major peak at k 0 h 0 41 and vice versa this finding is completely new and it is useful to balance the vertical force on the barrier on changing the ripple amplitude the harmonic peak of vertical force z p is observed for the horizontal plate at k 0 h 1 06 and as a comparison the 2 8 11 4 and 28 6 reduction of vertical force z p is obtained for ripple amplitudes a b 0 025 a b 0 050 and a b 0 075 respectively the sudden wave loadings on the floating structures may cause fatigue failures due to the dynamic nature of incident waves and these types of practical problems can overcome through the ripples on balancing the magnitude of harmonic oscillations the horizontal force on the wall is the least affected phenomenon for the change in the ripple amplitude and a monotonic decreasing pattern of horizontal force on the wall is observed with the change in the k 0 h for all the values of ripple amplitude as discussed in section 4 3 the decrease in the wave loading on the wavy barrier helps to reduce the depth of piles and in turn reduces the capital cost of breakwater and installation time 4 6 effect of relative spacing fig 8 a d shows the variation of a wave reflection k r fig 8a b wave run up k h fig 8b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 8c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 8d as a function of relative spacing s λ for different values of wavy barrier porosity μ the periodic harmonic oscillatory pattern of trapping and force coefficients is observed with the change in relative spacing s λ the harmonic peak followed by a harmonic trough of k r is observed periodically interestingly in the case of wave reflection the magnitude of the harmonic peak is the least affected as compared with the harmonic trough for all the values of porosity the barrier porosity μ 0 15 and μ 0 35 shows moderate values of k r and moderate barrier porosity μ 0 25 shows almost zero minima of k r and higher porosity μ 0 45 depicts shows higher values of k r at each of the harmonic troughs from a practical perspective in the case of a wave trapping chamber a special case called standing waves is observed by several researchers liu et al 2011 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020b as a result of interaction between the incident and reflected wave amplitudes the vertical and sloping walls generally reflect the incident wave amplitude due to zero porosity kumaran et al 2021 thus the π shift of incident waves followed by the formation of standing waves are the major reasons behind the periodic harmonic oscillations in the wave reflection in the case of horizontal and vertical barriers the fluid flows in vertical and horizontal directions however in the presence of a composite plate there exists a change in the flow pattern thus the certain non identical shift of harmonic trough is observed in the k r this finding may be useful for fine tuning the trapping coefficients in the design of wavy barriers located near partially reflecting seawalls the higher plate porosity allows more wave energy pass through structures thus the maximal wave run up k h is obtained for maximal porosity and minimal wave run up k h is noted for minimal plate porosity in the form of harmonic oscillations the effect of porosity is very significant at each of the harmonic troughs as compared to the harmonic peak a unit relative spacing s λ 1 shows a pair of harmonic peaks followed by a pair of harmonic troughs this shows that the relative spacing available between the fixed structures and floating structures served as incentives in developing the harmonic oscillations in the case of wave run up the maximal variation is observed at each of the harmonic troughs as a comparison the high wave run up is noted for μ 0 45 the 15 8 35 3 and 55 9 reduction of wave run up is achieved for μ 0 35 μ 0 25 and μ 0 15 respectively at s λ 0 26 the vertical force on the wavy barrier and horizontal force on the wall shows an inverse relation for various values of plate porosity and relative spacing in the case of a wavy barrier placed far away from the seawall the incident wave initially interacts with the wavy barrier in either a vertical direction or horizontal direction afterward the wavy barrier dissipates some part of the wave energy and the rest of the wave energy interacts with the porous seawall thus the wavy barrier experience maximal wave force as compared with the partially reflecting wall and the reduction of force exerted by the partially reflecting wall is marginal to protect the fixed rigid structures with the installation of porous objects the wavy ripples usually enhance the wave reflection and it causes a minimal force on the partially reflecting wall the periodic harmonic trough of vertical force on the barrier and periodic harmonic peak of force on the wall is obtained for the integer multiples of half of the wavelength for all the combinations of porosity the run up coefficient k h and horizontal force on the wall x w shows an almost identical pattern with the change in relative spacing and for all the combinations of porosity with a change in numerical values however the wave run up is higher as compared with the wave force experienced by the wall and this may be due to the higher incident wavelength k 0 h 2 π 3 as compared with the composite wavy barrier width b h 1 4 7 effect of relative submergence the submergence depth of the wavy barrier plays an effective role in creating the tranquil zone in the leeward regions the major part of the incident wave energy around 90 is concentrated near the free surface and the corresponding water depth is three times the incident wave height dai et al 2018 the optimal submergence depth of the porous plate is defined based on the distribution of incident wave field over and underneath the barrier thus the variation of trapping coefficients is reported for the gradual increase of submergence depth of wavy barrier fig 9 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 9a b wave run up k h fig 9b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 9c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 9d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of relative submergence of wavy barrier h 1 h the minimal relative submergence depth h 1 h 0 1 shows minimal wave reflection and minimal wave run up in the oscillatory pattern for intermediate and long period waves the increase in relative submergence depth diminishes the oscillations and almost full reflection is obtained for h 1 h 0 4 due to the presence of a fully reflecting leeward inclined wall in the case of minimal submergence depth h 1 h 0 1 the wavy ripples play a significant role in reducing the wave reflection and wave run up at each of the oscillating troughs however in the case of h 1 h 0 4 the incident waves don t interact with the wavy barrier and directly approaching the leeward inclined seawall thus the higher values of wave reflection are observed for h 1 h 0 4 the minimal wave run up is obtained for h 1 h 0 1 as compared with the h 1 h 0 4 the submergence depths h 1 h 0 3 and h 1 h 0 4 shows almost identical values of wave run up due to non variation of wave damping and wave trapping this shows that the effectiveness of the wavy barrier is highly reduced and almost negligible for higher submergence depth h 1 h 0 4 the optima of vertical force on the barrier is obtained by minimal relative submergence depth h 1 h 0 1 and the primary harmonic peak is observed in the z p for k 0 h 1 1 within a pair of sub harmonic peaks the zero minima of force exerted by wave barrier z p is noted for specific values of k 0 h for all the combinations of relative submerge which may be due to destructive interferences of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes however the magnitude of harmonic oscillations is marginal for the design of wavy barriers to protect the available fixed rigid structures a linear decreasing pattern of horizontal force on the wall x w is observed with an increase in the non dimensional wave number the infinitesimal variation of x w is observed for all the combinations of relative submergence h 1 h and this observation is a result of fluid damping by the waviness property of the barrier the short period waves display zero x w due to the higher wave reflection and wave damping by the submerged composite wavy barrier however the minimal variation between the x w for all the combinations of h 1 h is a result of the combined effect of wave damping and wave trapping by the wavy barrier finally the minimal h 1 h enhances the harmonic oscillations due to superior wave damping and wave trapping 4 8 effect of seawall inclination in the present study the wavy barrier is installed within the sight of the inclined seawall and the seawall is rotated in the anti clockwise acw and clockwise direction cw in general the angle of seawall inclination plays a significant role in creating the wave damping chamber to dissipate the trapped wave mass fig 10 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 10a b wave run up k h fig 10b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 10c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 10d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of seawall inclination θ varied within 45 0 acw θ 45 0 cw the seawall inclination is classified into three categories such as a seaward inclination θ 22 5 0 and 45 0 acw ii no inclination or vertical wall θ 90 0 and iii leeward inclination θ 22 5 0 and 45 0 cw the seaward inclination θ 45 0 shows the non harmonic oscillatory pattern of wave reflection in the intermediate and short period waves the 50 decrease in the angle of seawall inclination θ 22 5 0 illustrates the optima and minima of wave reflection for intermediate and deep water waves respectively the vertical wall and leeward inclined wall enhance the harmonic oscillations and the leeward inclined wall shows multiple optima and zero minima of wave reflection in the intermediate and short period waves the minimal wave reflection referred to as optimal wave trapping and partial wave trapping is achieved by leeward inclined seawall consists of θ 45 0 and partial wave trapping is obtained for θ 22 5 0 as a comparison the effect of the wavy barrier on wave trapping is minimal for the seaward inclined wall as compared with the leeward inclined wall the combination of wavy barrier and leeward inclined wall consists of θ 45 0 shows effective wave trapping due to the interference effect the seaward inclined wall minimizes the wave run up as compared with the vertical wall and leeward inclined wall due to change in the flow pattern by the shape characteristics of the trapping chamber seaward inclined interface the oscillatory pattern having minimal magnitude is observed in the wave run up by a vertical wall and an increase in the sloping angle of the leeward wall worked as incentives for increasing the oscillatory pattern in the wave run up due to the back and forth motion of the trapped wave mass however higher wave run up and multiple oscillatory peaks and troughs are observed in the wave run up for leeward inclined wall consists of θ 45 0 as compared with other cases the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 depicts a moderate sloping bottom and it allows the free movement of the trapped wave mass within the confined zone the double peaked pattern is noted in the vertical force on the barrier for the seaward inclined wall θ 45 0 in the presence of wavy barrier and optima of z p is observed for intermediate waves of k 0 h 0 8 the seaward inclined wall consists of θ 22 5 0 shows a triple peaked pattern along with zero minima of force on the wavy barrier thereafter the increase in the angle of inclination minimizes the first harmonic peak and maximizes the secondary oscillating peak due to the interference effect this kind of observation is similar to the change in ripple amplitude as reported in section 4 5 the vertical wall shows triple zero minima in the intermediate and short period waves respectively the leeward inclined walls illustrate multiple oscillatory peaks followed by troughs and all the combinations of the angle of inclination show the highest value of z p for intermediate waves the fluid force experienced by the seawall x w is almost similar for all the combinations of seawall inclination for long period waves and significant changes in the x w is observed for intermediate and short period waves the minimal estimation of x w is observed for the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 as compared with other cases and it is marginal in the meticulous design and development of wavy barriers within the sight of inclined seawalls the zero minima of x w is observed for the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 for change in k 0 h within 2 k 0 h 4 the leeward sloping wall allows more wave run up compared to the vertical wall and seaward inclined wall and it is already noted in fig 10b the leeward sloping wall acts as an effective damping chamber and this may be a major reason behind the zero minima of wave force on the wall in the case of intermediate and short period waves 4 9 effect of seawall porosity in general the partially reflecting seawall dissipates some part of wave energy and reflects the remaining wave energy the reflection and damping property of seawall can be controlled by changing the c r value the c r 1 indicates full wave reflection by the seawall and c r 0 demonstrates no wall condition leeward far field region the total wave transmitted from the wavy barrier interacts with the partially reflecting wall and the c r 0 5 depicts 50 of wave energy dissipated and the remaining 50 of wave energy reflected by the wall thus the effect of leeward inclined seawall θ 30 reflection property c r on the trapping characteristics is studied as a function of non dimensional wavelength fig 11 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 11a b wave run up k h fig 11b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 11c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 11d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for different values of seawall reflection property porosity c r the interaction between the incident wave and wavy barrier is very minimal for long period waves and the total wave interacts with the inclined seawall thus the reflection property of seawall attenuates the incident waves for change in non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h within 0 01 k 0 h 0 50 the reflection of shallow water waves partially depends upon the reflection property of the seawall the initial values of k r is almost equals to c r but a small reduction of k r is observed due to the wave damping effect of the composite wavy barrier thereafter minor harmonic oscillations are observed in the wave reflection due to free fluid oscillations as a result of trapping chamber spacing s b 2 and higher barrier porosity μ 0 3 the increase in the c r means an increase in the reflecting property of inclined seawall and the lower values of c r shows minimal values of wave reflection and higher values of c r illustrates higher values of wave reflection due to wave damping by the seawall the almost identical values of wave run up coefficient k h is noted with the change in the non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h the higher c r 1 shows higher wave run up as compared with minimal c r 0 25 due to change in the wave damping property of inclined seawall a little oscillatory pattern is observed in the k h for c r 1 due to the interference effect of the incident and reflected waves in the trapping chamber the optima of wave run up are observed in the intermediate wave regime for fully reflecting inclined seawall c r 1 near k 0 h 1 71 and 17 34 and 51 reduction of wave run up is achieved with the introduction of partially reflecting seawall consists of c r 0 75 c r 0 50 and c r 0 25 respectively the optima of vertical force on the barrier z p is observed for fully reflecting inclined seawall c r 1 at k 0 h 1 1 and a considerable reduction of z p is observed with a decrease in the reflection property of inclined seawall thereafter the minimal value of wave reflection is observed for c r 1 at k 0 h 1 72 and a slight increase in z p is noted with a decrease in the c r the minimal c r 0 25 diminish the secondary peak which is observed for other values of c r at k 0 h 3 due to the enhanced wave damping by inclined partially reflecting seawall the horizontal force experienced by the inclined seawall x w follows an exponential downward pattern with enhance in the non dimensional wavelength for all the values of c r the lower values of c r shows the lower estimation of x w and higher values of c r illustrates higher values of x w due to wave damping offered by the inclined wall overall the partially reflecting wall shows better values of trapping and force coefficients as compared with the fully reflecting seawalls the present study suggests the moderate values of c r 0 5 to balance the trapping coefficients and force coefficients experienced by a composite wavy barrier and inclined seawall 4 10 effect of structure repetition fig 12 a d shows the variation tendency of a wave reflection k r fig 12a b wave run up k h fig 12b c vertical force on the barrier z p fig 12c and d horizontal force on the wall x w fig 12d as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h for the different number of structure repetitions the n r 1 displays trapping and force coefficients of a single wavy barrier placed at a finite distance from the seawall and presents the trapping and force coefficients by an array of four identical wavy barriers having zero spacing between the two adjacent plates the increase in the plate number shows the minimal wave reflection in an oscillatory manner due to higher wave damping thus the corresponding wave run up is minimal in the case of intermediate and short period waves the four plate barrier reduces around 50 of wave run up as compared with the single plate barrier in the case of intermediate and short period waves however from the design aspect the higher number of plates enhances the protection and simultaneously marginal increase in the cost as these barriers are easy to fabricate and cost effective the magnitude of vertical force on the barrier z p is minimal and optima of z p is noticed in the case of intermediate waves the multiple wavy plates placed far away from the vertical wall offer higher wave reflection compared to a seaward and leeward inclined wall thus the leeward plate experiences higher wave force at each of the harmonic peaks and zero minima are obtained in the intermediate zone the increase in the number of plates displays the very minimal variation of vertical force on the wall for intermediate and short period waves due to the damping effect of multiple wavy barriers 5 conclusions in the present study the wave trapping efficiency of a composite wavy barrier at a finite distance from the inclined partially reflecting wall is examined using the dbem the validation of the present study numerical results dbem is verified with an independently developed numerical model based on mbem the effect of composite wavy barrier porosity the number of ripples ripple amplitude relative spacing relative submergence seawall inclination and seawall porosity on wave reflection wave run up the vertical force on the barrier and horizontal force on the wall are parametrically analyzed based on the numerical results the present study recommended a composite wavy plate of moderate porosity μ 0 2 having a higher number of ripples d 4 and higher ripple amplitude a b 0 20 placed in a submerged depth of 0 1 h 1 h 0 2 to viably distribute the incident wave amplitude in the form of trapping and force coefficients particularly the higher number of ripples diminish the wave reflection at each of the harmonic peaks and troughs due to the superposition of incident and reflected wave amplitudes thus the diameter and penetration depth of slender piles can be reduced as a special case three types of seawalls such as a seaward inclined wall leeward inclined wall and vertical wall with a composite wavy barrier is investigated and the optimal wave trapping and force coefficients are obtained for the leeward inclined wall θ 45 0 finally the present study recommended the leeward partially reflecting wall consists of c r 0 5 and θ 45 0 with a composite wavy barrier further the present study suggests the composite wave barrier serves as an excellent alternative to the conventional breakwaters in real field
