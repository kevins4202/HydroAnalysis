21110,a hydroelastic model is taken up in this work to investigate the propagation of normal incident waves over a small undulation located on an elastic sea bed in a fluid flow for two superposed fluids where a floating ice sheet covers the upper fluid here both the floating ice sheet and elastic sea bed are approximated as thin elastic plates which follow the euler bernoulli beam equation familiar for such studies due to its minimal contribution the surface tension at the interface of the fluid layers is not accounted for the behavior of the roots of the associated complex dispersion relation is investigated through the application of a counting argument along with a contour plot the time harmonic waves for a given frequency are observed to propagate with exactly two wavenumbers such that the one corresponding to the smaller wavenumber propagates along the ice sheet while the other corresponding to the higher wavenumber along the interface by assuming the fluid to be incompressible and inviscid following an irrotational motion and then applying a perturbation technique the first order contribution to the velocity potentials in each layer is evaluated with the help of fourier transform following that the associated reflection and transmission coefficients are computed by carrying out appropriate integration for integrals containing a shape function depicting the sea bed undulation in order to validate the present model developed in this work one obtained result for reflection coefficient is validated against an available result which points towards a good agreement this validation establishes the model and the method followed in this work to be effective and allows subsequent investigation for this problem to be taken up for verification of the theory developed here one specific undulating bed topography is selected to assess the reflection as well as transmission coefficients which are depicted by graphical representations to examine and establish the energy conversion between the flexural wave mode and the interfacial wave mode present investigation demonstrates that the reflection and transmission of the waves exhibit an oscillatory behavior the reason for which is the outcome of multiple interaction of the incident wave with the elastic bottom undulation interface and the ice sheet it further shows that flexural wave moment is significantly affected as compared to the interfacial wave influence it is noted that significant variation in the elastic specification of the ice sheet and the elastic sea bed has a considerable influence for wave scattering by the undulating elastic sea bed it is observed that when water waves propagate over a deformable bottom the wave characteristics undergo a significant change this occurs due to the elasticity of the sea bed which immensely influences the kinematics and dynamics of the wave over and above providing the demonstration of the elastic behavior of the soil located below the elastic sea bed the approach adopted here is likely to be of immense significance in the design and construction of various types of floating breakwaters and very large floating structures vlfs for the purpose of various scientific activities mainly in polar regions further the solutions of problems like these dealing with a deformable sea bed will be beneficial in providing the required background to the researchers with respect to the incorporation of the characteristics of the infinite depth soil located below the sea bed keywords two superposed fluids ice sheet bottom undulation elastic sea bed perturbation technique fourier transform reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction it is very much known that the problems involving the scattering of water waves propagating in two superposed fluids by a floating structure or a submerged obstacle have pivotal significance on account of immense and reliable use in various areas of ocean engineering during the last few decades an extensive interest in pursuing investigation of this type of problems by scientific community has been observed in particular reflection of water waves by a small bed distortion has been accorded an ever increasing recognition due to its expansive effect in intensifying the way shore parallel bars or pipes function in the event of a train of water waves striking an obstacle located on a sea bed the wave gets reflected as well as transmitted fascinatingly some common obstacles such as sand swells are naturally available at the sea bottom that those obstacles exhibit smallness in some sense makes it possible for one to exploit a perturbation technique in order to compute the first order reflection and transmission coefficients in the last few years an increasing amount of interest has been recorded of investigations by various researchers on topics connected to water wave interaction with very large floating structures vlfs in order to utilize the ocean space this concern has arisen because of modified urban planning in a good number of countries due to increase in population resulting in shortage of land and also in countries having coastlines of long stretch such countries use the process of land reclamation from the ocean for the purpose of preventing overcrowding in the available land therefore authorities planners engineers and researchers recommend utilization of vlfs for human dwelling setting up of industrial area and storage space responding to the above stated demands it is known that vlfs is easy to design control and remove and has been beneficial owing to the fact that it can be artificially produced which makes it an easily floating space on water body and simultaneously has a minimal adverse environmental effect on the marine eco system the behavior of vlfs is usually supposed to be elastic because of the significance of the localized deflection or vibration of such a long structure resulting in small amplitude waves getting continuously excited this is despite of the fact that the thickness of such structures is much smaller than its length information on various recent enhancement on vlfs is available in the works of wang and tay 2011 lamas pardoa et al 2015 and the references cited therein an associated problem arises in the polar region where a vast region of the ocean surface is covered by thin sheets of ice extending up to the continental shelves in the present work the floating ice sheet under consideration is modeled as thin floating elastic plate following the familiar euler bernoulli beam equation and interestingly enough such plates are also found to be suitable for modeling vlfs in ocean engineering as a consequence the investigation of ice wave interaction plays a significant role in both arctic engineering and marine technology it is pertinent to mention that water waves in oceans propagate through the ice regions thereby weakening and rupturing continuous sea ice that has a huge impact on global climate due to the temporal adjustments in pack ice serving as a proxy for the factors affecting climate change of late a substantial fascination has been generated in the evaluation of ice wave interaction because of intensification of various scientific activities occurring mainly in the polar regions and also of reasonable amount of utilization in marine engineering another main objective is to figure out a suitable mechanism and the impact of wave propagation in the earthquake prone regions water wave interaction with a floating ice sheet of finite or infinite length using the model of thin elastic plate theory generates delightful mathematical problems for scientific marine research thereby bringing the attention of different kinds of practical problems for the purpose of obtaining their convenient solutions in a very important work fox and squire 1990 1994 studied water wave propagation from water region of a sea into a floating ice sheet and presented an acceptable linearized model to examine wave reflection and transmission particularly at the edges of the ice sheet marchenko 1999 investigated the excitation of flexural gravity edge waves in a fluid covered by an ice sheet having a discontinuity in this investigation it was noticed that the wave frequency and also the incident angle of the wave had a considerable impact on the generation of reflected and transmitted energy of the waves through the discontinuity in the form of a crack an extensive study on scattering of water waves due to the presence of floating ice sheets of non uniform of thickness is found in the analysis and description by bennetts 2007 and bennetts et al 2007 subsequently a detailed study on the important link between sea ice interaction and vlfs hydro elasticity was carried out by squire 2008 further watanabe et al 2004 and chen et al 2006 presented some significant developments in matters related to water wave interaction with flexible floating structures in homogeneous fluids of uniform water depth bhattacharjee et al 2007 and karmakar et al 2010 studied scattering of flexural gravity waves by a varying sea bottom using perturbation technique maiti and mandal 2008 investigated scattering of surface waves by an undulating sea bed in an ice covered ocean by adopting perturbation method and fourier transform mohapatra and bora 2012 investigated wave proliferation over an undulating sea bed for a fluid flow of two superposed fluids flowing underneath an infinitely extended floating ice sheet miles 1981 employed a perturbation method to analyze the occurrence of reflection and transmission for oblique waves scattered by an impermeable undulating sea bed for a homogeneous fluid utilizing the strategy of fourier transform davies 1982 considered a sinusoidal undulation at the sea bed to examine the reflection of incident surface waves heathershaw 1982 came up with an experimental proof in support of the theoretical results obtained for occurrence of reflection of wave energy which took place because of the resonant interactions between the waves and the undulating sea bed davies 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 showed the importance of bragg resonance which is the phenomenon occurring in the event of the wavenumber of the undulating sea bed being twice of that of the incident surface wave for a sea bed consisting of periodic undulations it is worthwhile noting that such resonant wave interaction has an immense and practical role to play in the development of surface waves in regions adjacent to the shore however any theory with a small perturbation parameter becomes invalid near the bragg resonance condition in order to modify a model which could get rid of this disadvantage mei 1985 established some pertinent results for the wave evolution and reflection theory which worked nicely for structures such as offshore sandbars set parallel to the coastline zhu 2001 employed galerkin eigenfunction expansion technique to study a refraction diffraction model within a porous structure located on a ripple sea bed in a homogeneous fluid employing green s second identity and modeling the mild slope equation of the sea bed numerically silva et al 2002 discussed linear wave scattering by a rapidly varying water depth with consideration of the thickness of the porous sea bed utilizing two different methods one comprising of perturbation and other comprising of fourier transform martha et al 2007 studied the scattering of linear oblique water waves by a small distortion on a sea bed possessing a reasonable porosity craig et al 2009 presented a systematic derivation and analysis of the equations of motion of water waves in the free surface of a channel of fluid over a variable bottom guyenne and nicholls 2007 presented a numerical method for simulation of nonlinear waves over a variable impermeable sea bed the higher order spectral method included contributions up to an arbitrary order with respect to the perturbation parameter for the uneven sea bed fourier transform method was appropriately utilized further chen et al 2019 considered a two dimensional continuum model for linear gravity waves propagating across an ice covered sea by assuming the floating sea ice as a homogeneous isotropic poro elastic material and the underlying ocean as a weakly compressible fluid they analyzed wave dispersion and attenuation in details recently chanda and bora 2020a investigated the impact of a porous sea bed on scattering of oblique water waves by a dual submerged porous barrier stokes 1847 examined waves proliferating in two superposed fluids without considering interaction with any structure it was lamb 1932 who showed that by considering a fixed frequency time harmonic gravity waves proliferate with two distinct wavenumbers modes one each along the interface and the free surface in two superposed fluids chamberlain and porter 2005 employed a variational technique with the help of linear wave theory to study water wave scattering in two superposed fluids of varying mean depth later through an application of green s integral theorem maiti and mandal 2006 investigated water wave scattering by a small undulating sea bed for a flow of two superposed fluids utilizing two different methods namely perturbation technique and fourier transform panda and martha 2014 studied wave scattering by a varying porous sea bed for the case of water waves propagating through two superposed fluids craig et al 2015 in a very important work considered the nonlinear interaction of internal waves and surface waves in a three dimensional two layer fluid by using hamiltonian perturbation theory it was established that long internal waves could be modeled by the kpii equation which generated a resonant interaction with modulated surface waves at resonant wavenumbers existence of two linear wave modes in the form of free surface and interfacial modes was clearly observed in all the above mentioned works the sea bed is considered to be either of an infinite depth or of a finite uniform depth may be impermeable or permeable however it is noticed that the flexibility of a sea bed which can be considered to be a very significant feature is not accounted for in these investigations the problems of wave structure interaction involving sea beds exhibiting some sort of flexibility have been taken up by a limited number of researchers an important impetus for investigation of water wave scattering or trapping for a set up containing an elastic sea bed is due to the utilization of these outcomes in the construction of structures such as underwater pipe bridges wave power devices vlfs etc some of the earlier works reflect that the properties and behavior of waves get significantly impacted when the sea bed possesses some elasticity it is known that for water waves proliferating over a bottom deformation water of uniform depth bounded below by a perfectly elastic soil of infinite depth possesses a shear representing a soft marine sediment mallard and dalrymple 1977 carried out an investigation on the wave propagation over a deformable bottom and established that the elasticity of the sea bed brought a reasonable change in the wave characteristics this affected the kinematics and dynamics of the wave as well as of the elastic behavior of the soil beneath the sea bed these results clearly emphasize that the soil displacement and stresses form the foundation in computing the estimates of the effects of a bottom deformation found on various underlying structures such as pipelines cables etc which are connected to the sea bed dawson 1978 investigated the propagation of water waves over a deformable bottom for the case where the soil beneath the water was regarded as an elastic solid the varying nature of bottom soil characteristics often brings in significant decay in wave amplitude when wave propagation takes place over continental shelves and also in the coastal waters these above mentioned works provide ample justification of the importance of the study of various aspects of an elastic sea bed with regard to various wave propagation problems while considering a deformable sea bed it has been observed that significant change takes place because of the sea bed elasticity utilizing the green s function technique in a homogeneous fluid sarangi and mohapatra 2018 studied the impacts of an elastic sea bed of varying depth on water wave diffraction recently the investigation of water wave propagation in two superposed fluids over a small undulating elastic sea bed has been studied by chanda and bora 2020b c and various outcomes have been presented regarding the effect of the elasticity of the sea bed attenuation of amplitude of water waves propagating in sea ice occurs mainly due to two reasons i a conservative scattering by ice floes which results in relocation of energy in all directions and ii a true dissipation due to friction viscosity inelastic collisions and the breakup of ice floes which actually results in relocation of the energy to the other parts of the associated system i e atmosphere ice water both processes need to be accommodated in any model of earth system or ice ocean or wave forecasting parametrization dissipation is important in planetary system models in which energy conversion takes place remarkable perversion of the penetrating ocean wave spectrum takes place due to the ice floes getting reflected and transmitted and them extracting energy from those waves with the aid of either an elastic flexure or an inter floe collision similarly water wave propagation in an ocean containing a floating ice sheet has received importance while developing effective reflectors of the incident wave energy which can be installed in order to protect coastal areas from dangerous waves near and in the polar regions such problems involving wave ice interaction arise naturally mainly in some parts of both arctic and antarctic regions as a result extensive interest has been evoked in the scientific community for dealing with ice wave interaction problems stemming from the current significant scientific and research activities thus there is a strong conviction among researchers that a possible and feasible next step forward is to try the initiation of modeling of scattering of water waves by an undulating elastic sea bed consequently there is a strong likelihood in providing impetus to researchers in getting a clear and proper understanding of the physical conditions arising naturally in areas such as oceanography coastal engineering offshore engineering arctic engineering and some other disciplines associated with ocean engineering the present article presents the problem and solution of water wave scattering by a small undulating elastic sea bed for two superposed fluids flowing under a floating ice sheet because of the presence of elasticity in upper and lower boundaries two linearized boundary conditions of fifth order come into existence at both the upper surface and the sea bed in contrast to the usually homogeneous neumann boundary condition that appear in many ocean engineering problems for this specific study there exist two time harmonic waves at a given frequency propagating with two distinct wavenumbers one at the ice sheet due to the lower wavenumber while the other at the interface due to the higher wavenumber employing linear water wave theory the aforementioned problem at hand is cast as a coupled boundary value problem bvp which involves a velocity potential in each layer of the two superposed fluids a very small parameter δ signifying the smallness of the bottom undulation is considered and subsequently a perturbation technique and fourier transform are utilized to solve the bvp by converting it to two bvps for demonstrating the theoretical results a patch of sinusoidal ripple is considered for representing such an undulating sea bed 2 formulation of scattering problem water wave propagation of small amplitude in response to the action of gravity and assuming small amplitude plate response is considered in incompressible inviscid two superposed fluids undergoing an irrotational motion and flowing underneath an infinitely extended floating ice sheet in horizontal directions in an ocean over an undulating elastic bed the surface tension effect at the separation of the fluids is not taken into account as its impact is considered inconsequential following euler bernoulli beam equation the floating ice sheet and elastic sea bed are considered to act as thin elastic plates as has also usually been considered by many other researchers for such studies the elastic plate is considered to be thin implying that the horizontal length of the plate is much larger in comparison to the thickness of the plate there is a strong conviction to idealize each of the plates as a thin and linear elastic plate possessing uniform mass density and thickness the justification of consideration of such elastic plates is explained in chanda and bora 2020c further to it it may be mentioned that fox and squire 1991 demonstrated the validity of thin plate theory for such type of problems interestingly similarity of such works can be seen with those of linear water wave interaction with vlfs as discussed in chen et al 2006 a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is adopted in such a way that the y axis points in vertical downward direction y h f and y 0 respectively represent the location of the floating ice sheet and the tranquil interface as displayed in fig 1 it is assumed that a small undulation given by y h b δ b x is located on the sea bed where b x denotes a differentiable function possessing compact support i e b x 0 as x signifying the shape of bottom undulation the non dimensional number δ 1 indicating the smallness of the undulation and h b the constant lower fluid depth on either side of the undulation here ρ 1 is the upper fluid density and ρ 2 ρ 1 is the lower fluid density and let the ratio ρ 1 ρ 2 1 of the two fluid densities be designated by ρ adopting linear water wave theory and accounting for all the above assumptions the time harmonic velocity potentials in the upper fluid and in the lower fluid can respectively be represented by re ψ x y exp i σ t and re ϕ x y exp i σ t for normal wave incidence where σ denotes the angular wave frequency of the incident wave re denotes the real part and i 1 now the physical problem is modeled in which the velocity potentials ψ and ϕ respectively satisfy the laplace s equation in the upper and lower fluids as follows 2 1 x y 2 ψ 0 x h f y 0 2 2 x y 2 ϕ 0 x 0 y h b δ b x the relevant boundary condition at the upper surface i e at the floating ice sheet is represented by 2 3 d 1 4 x 4 1 ϵ 1 k ψ y k ψ 0 on y h f where k σ 2 g g the gravitational constant d 1 q 1 ρ 1 g q 1 e 1 h 1 3 12 1 ν 1 2 denoting the flexural rigidity of the ice sheet e 1 young s modulus ν 1 poisson s ratio ϵ 1 ρ f ρ 1 h 1 with ρ f as the ice sheet density and h 1 the ice sheet thickness which is considered to be very small the interfacial conditions at y 0 are given by 2 4 ψ y ϕ y 2 5 k ψ ψ y 1 ρ k ϕ ϕ y the boundary condition at the lower surface i e at the elastic sea bed has the form 2 6 d 2 4 x 4 1 ϵ 2 k ϕ n k ϕ 0 on y h b δ b x with d 2 q 2 ρ 2 g where q 2 e 2 h 2 3 12 1 ν 2 2 is the flexural rigidity of the elastic sea bed e 2 and ν 2 are respectively young s modulus and poisson s ratio ϵ 2 ρ b ρ 2 h 2 where ρ b denotes the elastic sea bed density h 2 denotes the elastic sea bed thickness which is considered to be very small and n is the normal derivative to the sea bed at any point x y earlier mohapatra and sahoo 2011 considered surface gravity wave interaction with an elastic sea bed which was modeled as a thin elastic plate the linearized condition eq 2 6 satisfied at the undulating bottom can now be expressed by ignoring the higher order terms of δ in the following form 2 7 k ϕ δ b x ϕ y d 2 4 x 4 1 ϵ 2 k ϕ y δ x b x ϕ x o δ 2 0 on y h b since the above converted condition is satisfied at a uniform depth instead of a varying depth it will be much easier to solve the bvp now with the assumption of linear theory in two superposed fluids progressive waves propagating in the two layer fluid along the positive x direction have the following forms in the respective layers 2 8 ψ x y exp i u x f 1 u y in h f y 0 2 9 ϕ x y exp i u x f 2 u y in 0 y h b where 2 10 f 1 u y d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u cosh u y h f k sinh u y h f d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u sinh u h f k cosh u h f 2 11 f 2 u y k sinh u y h b d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u cosh u y h b k cosh u h b d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u sinh u h b it is to be noted that the wavenumber u satisfies the following dispersion equation 2 12 u 0 where 2 13 u d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u tanh u h f k d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u k k 2 tanh u h b d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u 2 tanh u h b k u ρ d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u tanh u h b k d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u k k 2 tanh u h f d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u 2 tanh u h f k u it is obvious that u 0 is a root of the dispersion equation 2 12 which has exactly two distinct positive and real zeros corresponding to a value of k let them be m and m where 0 m m in accordance with the propagating modes four pairs of complex zeros that correspond to the non propagating modes and also infinitely many purely imaginary zeros that relate to the evanescent modes since evidently the existence of exactly two positive zeros m and m of 2 12 is ensured as also observed in the works of saha and bora 2015 and maiti and mandal 2008 there exist two wave modes wavenumbers with one propagating at the ice sheet say flexural mode and the other at the interface say interfacial mode respectively along the positive x direction both wavenumbers exhibit increasing values when an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed is affected and they decrease corresponding to increasing values of the elastic parameter of the floating ice sheet the zeros of the complex dispersion equation 2 12 are evaluated numerically through the use of contour plots for the purpose of interpreting the behaviors of the wavenumbers as shown in fig 2 in order to compute these values of various parameters are considered in accordance with the following upper layer depth h f 10 m lower layer depth h b 10 m k 0 5 elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed are taken as d 1 h b 4 1 0 2 ϵ 1 h b 0 0001 and d 2 h b 4 1 0 2 ϵ 2 h b 0 0001 respectively unless otherwise mentioned a simple counting argument as used in fox and squire 1990 is followed here to find the nature of the zeros of 2 12 for finding the real zeros of the complex dispersion equation newton raphson method is used and initial guess for this method for each zero is acquired utilizing contour plot from fig 2 it is noticed that two pairs of real zeros of opposite signs namely m m m and m lie on the real axis and they can be referred as the progressive wave modes in flexural modes and internal modes the same feature related to the zeros was also observed by das et al 2016 when they considered flexural gravity wave motion over a poro elastic bed in a two layer fluid since the region of study is clearly symmetric about x 0 it is considered to be sufficient to study the wave characteristic corresponding to x 0 only fig 2 represents the nature of the complex zeros demonstrating that four pairs of complex zeros occurring as positive and negative of a complex conjugate pair namely u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 u 6 u 7 u 8 are situated in such a way that there are two zeros in each of the quadrants it needs to be mentioned that two pairs of complex zeros occur for the ice sheet and another two pairs occur for the elastic sea bed progressive normal waves in correspondence with wavenumber m flexural mode can be represented by where u in eqs 2 8 and 2 9 is replaced by m 2 14 ψ 0 x y exp i m x f 1 m y in h f y 0 2 15 ϕ 0 x y exp i m x f 2 m y in 0 y h b therefore if a normal wave of wavenumber m proliferating from the negative x direction interacts with the undulation of the sea bed for a two layer fluid flow then reflection and transmission occur for both flexural and interfacial modes when the train of waves hits the bottom undulation it experiences partial reflection and partial transmission and accordingly the asymptotic behaviors of ψ and ϕ can respectively be expressed as 2 16 ψ x y f 1 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 1 m y exp i m x x t m f 1 m y exp i m x t m f 1 m y exp i m x x 2 17 ϕ x y f 2 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 2 m y exp i m x x t m f 2 m y exp i m x t m f 2 m y exp i m x x the undetermined coefficients r m and r m introduced in eqs 2 16 and 2 17 respectively represent the reflection coefficients corresponding to the reflected waves of wavenumbers m and m for an incident wave of wavenumber m in a similar manner t m and t m respectively represent the transmission coefficients corresponding to the transmitted waves of wavenumbers m and m for an incident wave of wavenumber m next the progressive normal waves in correspondence with wavenumber m interfacial mode are given by 2 18 ψ 0 x y exp i m x f 1 m y in h f y 0 2 19 ϕ 0 x y exp i m x f 2 m y in 0 y h b accordingly for a normal wave of wavenumber m which is incident on the undulating sea bed the asymptotic forms of ψ and ϕ respectively are as follows 2 20 ψ x y f 1 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 1 m y exp i m x x t m f 1 m y exp i m x t m f 1 m y exp i m x x 2 21 ϕ x y f 2 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 2 m y exp i m x x t m f 2 m y exp i m x t m f 2 m y exp i m x x in eqs 2 20 and 2 21 the undetermined coefficients r m and r m represent the reflection coefficients related to the reflected wave of wavenumbers m and m respectively due to a normally incident waves of wavenumber m similarly t m and t m represent the transmission coefficients corresponding to the transmitted waves of wavenumbers m and m respectively due to an incident wave of wavenumber m the process involved in evaluating the analytical values of these aforementioned coefficients for both the flexural and interfacial wave modes for an arbitrary bottom topography is not quite elementary however under the assumption of small bottom topography a suitable perturbation expansion technique can be used to obtain the first order corrections to these undetermined coefficients the velocity potentials and the corresponding reflection and transmission coefficients for respective modes associated with the propagation of waves with different wavenumbers are going to be evaluated up to first order in the following section 3 evaluation of velocity potentials and relevant coefficients 3 1 perturbation method let a normal wave train of mode m be incident on the small undulation of an elastic sea bed for a sea bed without any bottom distortion the propagation of this wave train is not disturbed i e only transmission takes place along the positive x direction however when there some distortion is present on the sea bed the incident wave will undergo both reflection and transmission with all available information and conditions the velocity potentials ψ and ϕ as well as the reflection coefficients r m and r m and the transmission coefficients t m and t m can be written appropriately in perturbation series having perturbation parameter δ as follows 3 1 ψ ψ 0 δ ψ 1 o δ 2 3 2 ϕ ϕ 0 δ ϕ 1 o δ 2 3 3 r m δ r 1 m o δ 2 3 4 r m δ r 1 m o δ 2 3 5 t m 1 δ t 1 m o δ 2 3 6 t m δ t 1 m o δ 2 where ψ 0 and ϕ 0 are respectively given by 2 14 and 2 15 such perturbation expansions given by eqs 3 1 3 6 break down at bragg resonance which is a phenomenon when reflection coefficients take values higher than δ as mentioned in mei 1985 however the perturbation expansions 3 1 3 6 given above are considered to be valid throughout this work since bragg resonance is not taken into account substituting the expansions presented by eqs 3 1 3 6 into eqs 2 1 2 5 2 7 and 2 16 2 17 and comparing the first order terms of the perturbation parameter δ from both sides of the equations a new coupled boundary value problem in first order velocity potentials ψ 1 and ϕ 1 is formulated as follows 3 7 x y 2 ψ 1 0 in h f y 0 3 8 x

boundary value problems in ψ 1 and ϕ 1 the boundary value problem bvp for the first order velocity potentials ψ 1 and ϕ 1 as presented by eqs 3 7 3 13 along with the asymptotic forms 3 14 3 15 is now split into two separate boundary value problems for ψ 1 and ϕ 1 boundary value problem i for ψ 1 3 16 x y 2 ψ 1 0 in h f y 0 3 17 k ψ 1 d 1 4 x 4 1 ϵ 1 k ψ 1 y 0 on y h f 3 18 ψ 1 y η x on y 0 with

of fourier transform in order to solve the above two boundary value problems the technique of fourier transform is adopted fourier transforms of ψ 1 x y and ϕ 1 x y for the variable x are defined with

3 37 k ϕ 1 ρ ψ 1 ρ 1 η γ on y 0 and then using 3 30 and 3 36 into eq 3 37 to get 3 38 η γ k γ d 1 γ 4 1 ϵ 1 k γ sinh γ ˆ h f k cosh γ h f q γ γ where the function γ is given by 2 13 it is observed from eq 2 12 that γ possesses only two non zero positive zeros m and m on the real γ axis now upon substitution of η γ into eqs 3 30 and 3 36 and then employing inverse fourier transform the expressions for ψ 1 x y and ϕ 1 x y are acquired respectively in the following form 3 39 ψ 1 x y k 2 π k sinh γ y h f d 1 γ 4 1 ϵ 1 k γ cosh γ y h f γ q γ e i γ x d γ 3 40 ϕ 1 x y 1 2 π cosh γ y k d 1

γ 1 m and γ 2 m respectively on the positive real axis of γ the above integrals in 3 39 and 3 40 contain two simple poles at γ 1 and γ 2 as a result it is necessary that the path of integration in 3 39 and 3 40 is to be indented beneath the poles at γ 1 m and γ 2 m 3 4 determination of relevant coefficients the first order reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m t 1 m and r 1 m t 1 m corresponding to the flexural and interfacial modes for a normally incident proliferating wave of mode m is calculated by integrating with respect to γ in eqs 3 39 or 3 40 and then by letting x and comparing with those in the asymptotic expressions for the velocity potentials from eqs 3 19 or 3 23 gives the values in order to obtain the first order reflection coefficients we consider x in either eq 3 39 or eq 3 40 when x the behavior of ψ 1 x y or ϕ 1 x y is studied through a rotation of the path of the integral which contains the term q γ into a contour in the first quadrant so that the residue terms at the poles γ 1 and γ 2 can be incorporated similarly the path of the integral containing the term q γ in eq 3 39 or eq 3 40 is rotated into a contour this time in the fourth quadrant so that there is no contribution from this integral when x subsequently after comparing the resultant integral with eq 3 19 or eq 3 23 the eventual expression for r 1 m and r 1 m can respectively be obtained as 3 41 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f q m m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e 2 i m x b x d x 3 42 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f q m m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e i m m x b x d x adopting a similar procedure the first order transmission coefficients are evaluated by letting x in either eq 3 39 or eq 3 40 as x the behavior of ψ 1 x y or ϕ 1 x y is studied similarly like for x because of the fact that the integral containing the term q γ makes no contribution when x subsequently by comparison of the resultant integral with expressions in eq 3 19 or eq 3 23 the coefficients t 1 m and t 1 m can respectively be expressed as follows 3 43 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f q m m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m b x d x 3 44 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f q m m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e i m m x b x d x as the next step forward a train of normal waves of mode m is considered to be incident on the undulating elastic sea bed then the coefficients r 1 m r 1 m t 1 m and t 1 m are calculated by following the same procedure that was applied earlier for wave mode m in this case these coefficients are found as 3 45 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e i m m x b x d x 3 46 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e 2 i m x b x d x 3 47 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e i m m x b x d x 3 48 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m b x d x it can be observed that all these above coefficients are expressed in integral form which contains the uneven bed shape function b x and hence these can be computed for a given shape function in the next section the consequence of reflection and transmission is going to be investigated by considering a sinusoidal ripple bed 4 special form of undulating sea bed a specific function b x is taken up as an undulation in order to study wave reflection and transmission such shapes are similar to some familiar natural obstacles which usually get formed at the sea beds due to continuous sedimentation and ripple growth of sands while studying wave scattering by an uneven sea bed davies 1982 established that an undulating sea bed with sinusoidal undulation is capable of bouncing back the energy of the incident wave which plays a huge role in tasks connected to coastal protection and the probable growth of ripples because of such important physical significance of this type of bed topographies having sinusoidal ripples an appropriate shape as given below is considered for corroborating the general results obtained earlier considered below is b x consisting of a finite patch of sinusoidal ripples of amplitude a on the sea bed which is assumed to be flat otherwise 4 1 b x a sin l x n π l x n π l 0 elsewhere with l as the ripple wavenumber in n π l x n π l and n the number of ripples in this patch suppose that normal proliferating waves with wavenumber m flexural mode encounter the small undulation located on the elastic sea bed under consideration the first order reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m r 1 m t 1 m and t 1 m corresponding to the flexural and interfacial modes due to a normally incident propagating wave of mode m are calculated by substituting b x from eq 4 1 into eqs 3 41 3 44 in this case the coefficient t 1 m vanishes identically and the rest of the three coefficients are found as 4 2 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin 2 m n π l l 2 4 m 2 4 3 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 4 4 t 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 next normal propagating waves with wavenumber m interfacial mode is considered to be incident on the bottom undulation following a similar procedure the first order reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m r 1 m t 1 m and t 1 m for the normally incident proliferating wave of mode m are calculated by putting b x into eqs 3 45 3 48 this time the coefficient t 1 m vanishes identically and the other three coefficients are found as follows 4 5 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 4 6 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin 2 m n π l l 2 4 m 2 4 7 t 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 it can be observed from eqs 4 2 4 7 above that for a fixed number of ripples n an oscillatory nature is exhibited in these first order coefficients additionally it is noticed from 4 2 that in the event of the ripple wavenumber l and the incident wavenumber m satisfying the relation l 2 m the theory adopted here ceases and consequently generation of a large amount of reflected wave energy created by the undulating sea bed is visible in the neighborhood of this singularity the implication is that resonant interaction occurs between the incident wave and the sinusoidal ripples furthermore resonant interaction can occur between the incident wave and the ripple bed specifically when l m m and l m m respectively in 4 3 and 4 4 similarly resonance due to an incident wave of wavenumber m can be taken up it is seen that with occurrence of resonance the highest peak value of each coefficient has a linear variation with respect to ripple number n moreover those coefficients are also dependent on the values of elasticity parameters d 1 ϵ 1 of the ice sheet and d 2 ϵ 2 of the elastic sea bed next numerical computation of the coefficients demonstrated by 4 2 4 7 is performed with an eye to investigate the role of various parameters in the variation of wave energy in response to reflection and transmission 5 validation for carrying out the computational results that are acquired throughout this work it is deemed appropriate to connect those with some earlier work in this direction the result of chanda and bora 2020c is considered since it bears certain similarities with the present work to a reasonable level to validate the present result the available results of chanda and bora 2020c are considered when the ice sheet is not taken into consideration i e when d 1 h b 4 0 and ϵ 1 h b 0 by considering the density ratio as ρ 0 5 the depth ratio as h b h f 2 the ripple wavenumber as l h b 1 the amplitude of the ripples as a h b 0 1 number of ripples as n 3 the elastic parameter of the sea bed as d 2 h b 4 1 and ϵ 2 h b 0 001 the present problem reduces to the one in the work by chanda and bora 2020c for normal wave propagation to validate the present result the reflection coefficient r 1 m is plotted as a function of k h b for the result of chanda and bora 2020c and that also from the present one from which an excellent agreement is clearly observed fig 3 based on these outcomes a number of subsequent investigations are carried out by considering the present model to be an efficient one consequently it is believed that this model can be appropriately used for tackling such problems involving a two layer fluid an ice sheet and an undulating elastic sea bed in disciplines such as offshore and arctic engineering 6 results and discussion by devising an appropriate matlab program the influence of various parameters such as elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed number of ripples of the undulation etc on reflection as well as transmission coefficients for a patch of sinusoidal ripples on an elastic sea bed are examined the essential goal of the present investigation is to identify the pattern of incident wave energy distribution between the reflected and transmitted waves the graphs and the related interpretation for the evaluated first order reflection and transmission coefficients corresponding to the interfacial and flexural wave mode are presented for various values of different non dimensional parameters for computing purpose the following values are considered ρ 0 5 h b h f 1 l h b 1 a h b 0 1 ϵ 1 h b 0 0001 ϵ 2 h b 0 0001 unless otherwise mentioned before going further ahead it is felt essential to put forward some justification about the chosen value of the density ratio ρ it is known that for a two layer fluid consisting of fresh water and salt water the value of ρ would usually be around 0 97 the same qualitative features are observed for such a density ratio but the effects of the interface are much smaller and cannot be appreciated in this context the density ratio ρ is chosen to be 0 5 in order to observe the features clearly the same was followed by some other researchers including linton and mciver 1995 linton and cadby 2002 for the scattering problem in a two layer fluid with the density ratio chosen as 0 5 for the same reason in figs 4 12 the reflection and transmission coefficients are demonstrated versus non dimensional wavenumber k h b in accordance with a normally incident wave of mode m flexural mode on the undulating sea bed in figs 4 6 the graphs are plotted for various number of ripples n where the values of the elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed are considered as d 1 h b 4 1 and d 2 h b 4 1 respectively from fig 4 it is noted that the utmost values of the reflection coefficient r 1 m due to flexural wave influence for an incident wave of mode m i e for flexural wave mode striking the undulation normally increases in accordance with an increment in the values of n further it seems obvious from figs 5 and 6 that the utmost values for both the reflection and transmission coefficients of the waves due to the interfacial wave influence for a normally incident proliferating wave of wavenumber m increase when the value of n increases it is worthwhile to note that if the value of n rises then the coefficients corresponding to reflection and transmission turn out to be unbounded for some specific values of k h b this is what bragg resonance is as mentioned earlier if the value of n rises the graphs of reflection coefficient r 1 m and transmission coefficient t 1 m with regard to k h b show oscillatory pattern significantly with increase of number of zeros such oscillatory behavior arises as a result of the incident proliferating wave interacting multiple times with the undulating elastic sea bed ice sheet and the interface fig 5 shows that the utmost values of the first order reflection coefficient are higher as compared to those in the example of maiti and mandal 2008 this may have resulted because of the association of the elastic sea bed instead of an impermeable sea bed figs 7 9 show curves for reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m r 1 m and t 1 m corresponding to different sets of values of the elastic parameters of the ice sheet namely d 1 h b 4 1 2 3 and 4 with n 4 and elastic parameter of the sea bed taken as d 2 h b 4 1 it can be seen from fig 7 that the values of the reflection coefficient r 1 m for waves with wavenumber m i e for flexural mode due to a normal incident wave of wavenumber m reduce for increasing values of the elastic parameter d 1 h b 4 of the ice sheet next figs 8 and 9 respectively demonstrate the first order reflection and transmission coefficients of interfacial wave mode i e for wavenumber m due to a normal incident proliferating wave of wavenumber m it is exhibited that for increasing values of elastic parameter of the ice sheet both r 1 m and t 1 m decrease non zero values of both the first order reflection coefficient and the first order transmission coefficient exist due to the reflected waves and the transmitted waves respectively with wavenumber m corresponding to various values of elastic parameter of the ice sheet it establishes that energy conversion is always possible between the interfacial wave mode and the flexural wave mode to some extent it is also observed from figs 7 and 8 that the reflection coefficient corresponding to the reflected wave of wavenumber m i e for the case of interfacial wave mode is greater than that of the reflected wave with wavenumber m i e for the case of flexural wave mode another important observation is that corresponding to increasing values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet the rate of change of the transmission coefficients and reflection coefficients is found to be higher for both flexural and interfacial modes thus it can be inferred that for a train of normal propagating wave incident on the undulating elastic sea bed the energy associated with both reflection and transmission is very sensitive if variation of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet is affected the curves presented in figs 10 12 correspond to five different values of elastic parameter of the sea bed d 2 h b 4 0 1 3 4 5 and 5 5 where d 2 h b 4 0 is associated with the value ϵ 2 h b 0 while for other values of d 2 h b 4 the associated value of ϵ 2 h b is considered as 0 0001 as mentioned earlier with n 4 and the value of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet considered as d 1 h b 4 1 it is to be noted that the case d 2 h b 4 0 ϵ 2 h b 0 implies a rigid sea bed fig 10 depicts that for increasing values of the elastic parameters of the sea bed there is always an increase in the reflection coefficient r 1 m it can be seen from figs 11 and 12 that as we keep increasing the value of elastic parameter d 2 h b 4 of the sea bed we observe a gradual increment in r 1 m and t 1 m however the non zero values of both r 1 m and t 1 m with wavenumber m for different elastic specifications of the sea bed indicate that conversion of some amount of energy is feasible from one wavenumber to the other another important remark is that when an increase in the value of the elastic parameter of the sea bed is affected then rate of change of both reflection and transmission coefficients is higher for flexural wave mode that implies that the energy due to reflection and transmission is very sensitive in response to the variation in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed when the incident wave of flexural mode encounters the undulating elastic sea bed moreover it can be inferred that with increasing values of elastic parameter of the sea bed the value of first order reflection and transmission coefficients become much higher from figs 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 it is worthwhile to note that the number of zeros of reflection and transmission coefficients is smaller than those in the example of maiti and mandal 2008 it very likely happens due to the presence of the elastic sea bed a common observation in these figures is the oscillating behavior of the coefficient which is a function of the wavenumber k h b the case of a normally incident proliferating wave of wavenumber m interfacial mode represents a delightful circumstance due to the involvement of elasticity of the sea bed where the energy conversion takes place from one wave mode to the other correspondingly figs 13 21 represent the coefficients r 1 m r 1 m and t 1 m plotted with respect to k h b by considering density ratio ρ 0 5 depth ratio h b h f 1 ripple wavenumber l h b 1 amplitude of the sinusoidal ripples a h b 0 1 and non dimensional parameters ϵ 1 h b 0 0001 ϵ 2 h b 0 0001 the curves presented in figs 13 14 and 15 depict the coefficients for various sets of values of number of ripples with the values of the elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed fixed at d 1 h b 4 1 and d 2 h b 4 1 respectively it is clear from figs 13 and 15 that as we keep on increasing the number of ripples a gradual increment is observed in the peak values of r 1 m and t 1 m fig 14 establishes that if an increase in the values of n is affected then there is always an increase in the peak values of r 1 m corresponding to a normal incident wave of wavenumber m i e for the case of interfacial mode but for this case the reflection coefficient r 1 m takes values higher than those of the reflection coefficient r 1 m this occurs since the interface is somewhat beneath the floating ice sheet of the fluid and therefore the reflected energy of flexural wave influence is smaller than that due to interfacial wave movement it is noticed that when n becomes large then the reflection and transmission coefficients turn out to be inexhaustible for some specific values of k h b which represents nothing but occurrence of bragg resonance the curves in figs 16 18 present the coefficients for various sets of values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet namely d 1 h b 4 1 2 3 and 4 with n 4 and elastic parameter of the sea bed as d 2 h b 4 1 figs 16 and 17 clearly show that when the value of the elastic parameter d 1 h b 4 of the ice sheet increases the values of r 1 m and r 1 m decrease one important observation is that according to an increase in value of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet the rate of decrement of the first order reflection coefficients is quite insensitive this is due to the fact that since the interface is somewhat below the ice sheet there is not much affect on the interfacial wave due to the changes in the elastic parameter of the ice sheet consequently the floating ice sheet does not have much effect on the reflection coefficients due to interfacial wave movement and flexural wave influence in the fluid region for the normally incident wave of mode m proliferating along the interface fig 18 depicts reduction in the values of t 1 m according to an increase in the elastic parameter of the ice sheet thus the elastic parameter of the ice sheet influences transmission coefficient significantly in connection with the case of interfacial wave mode figs 19 21 demonstrate the reflection and transmission coefficients for different values of the elastic parameter d 2 h b 4 of the sea bed for this case n is taken as 4 and the values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet is considered as d 1 h b 4 1 figs 19 and 20 show that an increase in the value of the elastic parameters of the sea bed brings an increase in the values of reflection coefficients r 1 m and r 1 m one important observation is that with an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed the increasing rate of the first order reflection coefficients is found to be quite imperceptible it means that the elastic sea bed does not command significant influence on the reflected wave energy as a result of interfacial wave movement and the flexural wave influence in the fluid for the normally incident wave train with wavenumber m proliferating at the interface on the other hand fig 21 shows that the transmission coefficient t 1 m increases corresponding to an increase in the value of elastic parameter of the sea bed however non zero values of both first order reflection and transmission coefficients for a train of propagating waves of mode m suggest that some conversion of reflected as well as transmitted energy is almost always possible from interfacial wave mode to the flexural wave mode a present observation is that increasing the elastic parameters of the sea bed can significantly increase the values of reflection and transmission coefficients for both flexural and interfacial modes it may happen due to the interaction of waves in flexural and interfacial modes with the undulating elastic sea bed one observation from figs 10 12 and 19 21 is that when the sea bed is considered as a rigid one then wave reflection is higher and wave transmission is lower it is concluded that interfacial wave gets influenced more as compared to the flexural wave when the rigid sea bed is considered it may be due to the fact that the sea bed is located underneath the interface of the fluid whereas the ice sheet is above the interface to put it concisely in this work we present a hydroelastic model to treat the water wave propagation over a small bottom undulation located on an elastic sea bed for two superposed fluids flowing underneath a floating ice sheet to the best of our knowledge investigation of this kind of problems for an ice covered two superposed fluid flowing over an undulating elastic sea bed has not been considered till date there is an observation from fig 7 that an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet is associated with a reduction in the values of the reflection coefficient r 1 m on the other hand increase in the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients in both modes is noticed if the number of ripples of the undulating elastic sea bed increases it can also be seen that an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed results in the increase in the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients for both modes the current authors also made the same conclusion in their study in chanda and bora 2020c however the numerical estimates of the coefficients are not the same as a result of the difference in consideration of various different physical conditions in those works 7 conclusion in this article using linearized water wave theory we take up the problem of normal water wave scattering by a small undulation located on an elastic sea bed in two superposed fluids flowing underneath an infinitely extended floating ice sheet considering the well known euler bernoulli beam equation both the ice sheet and elastic sea bed are considered as thin elastic plates where the horizontal length of such a plate is considered to be much larger in comparison to its thickness under such circumstances there exist propagating waves at two distinct wavenumbers for any given frequency the one with the smaller wavenumber along the floating ice sheet corresponding to the flexural mode and the other one with the higher wavenumber along the interface corresponding to the interfacial mode the first order velocity potentials and the reflection and transmission coefficients are found by applying the technique of perturbation in conjunction with fourier transform wave energy conversion from one wave mode to the other is exhibited by providing graphical representation corresponding to various physical parameters of the system the complex resonant interactions are demonstrated concerning wave propagation in an ice covered two superposed fluids flowing over a rippled elastic sea bed as a result of action of flexural and interfacial modes the energy related to reflection and transmission in accordance with both flexural and interfacial mode is observed to reduce when the elasticity of the ice sheet increases on the other hand an opposite trend is observed for reflected and transmitted energy when the elasticity of the sea bed increases furthermore it is worthwhile to note that the peak value of the reflection and transmission coefficients goes upward when the total number of ripples of the bottom undulation on the sea bed increases this outcome may bear a significant implication for both coastal protection and of possible ripple growth on an erodible bed involving a two layer ocean covered by a thin ice sheet for an interfacial mode wave the reflection corresponding to the flexural wave influence and interfacial wave movement is not influenced by the variations in the elastic parameter of the floating ice sheet since the interface is quite below the ice sheet the interfacial wave is not much influenced by the changes in the elastic parameter of the floating ice sheet at the same time the transmission in accordance with the interfacial wave mode is significantly affected a remarkable significance is observed in the conversion of incident wave energy to the reflected and transmitted energy taking place between the higher mode interfacial mode and the smaller mode flexural mode because of the non zero values of reflection and transmission coefficients arising out of the flexural wave movement and interfacial wave influence in the fluid region it is expected that the results developed in this work may be utilized in an appropriate manner for tackling a large class of water wave scattering problems that appear in various disciplines of ocean engineering the model developed here based on a physical problem and its associated results will certainly be helpful in the development of wave power devices underwater pipe bridges mobile offshore base vlfs like floating oil storage bases for oceanographic purposes in connection with different advanced evolutions in the marine environment the conclusions drawn from the present study will be immensely helpful in the selection of the site for various large floating offshore infrastructures and to understand the pattern of coupling between waves and sea ice under various bed characteristics especially elasticity

21110,a hydroelastic model is taken up in this work to investigate the propagation of normal incident waves over a small undulation located on an elastic sea bed in a fluid flow for two superposed fluids where a floating ice sheet covers the upper fluid here both the floating ice sheet and elastic sea bed are approximated as thin elastic plates which follow the euler bernoulli beam equation familiar for such studies due to its minimal contribution the surface tension at the interface of the fluid layers is not accounted for the behavior of the roots of the associated complex dispersion relation is investigated through the application of a counting argument along with a contour plot the time harmonic waves for a given frequency are observed to propagate with exactly two wavenumbers such that the one corresponding to the smaller wavenumber propagates along the ice sheet while the other corresponding to the higher wavenumber along the interface by assuming the fluid to be incompressible and inviscid following an irrotational motion and then applying a perturbation technique the first order contribution to the velocity potentials in each layer is evaluated with the help of fourier transform following that the associated reflection and transmission coefficients are computed by carrying out appropriate integration for integrals containing a shape function depicting the sea bed undulation in order to validate the present model developed in this work one obtained result for reflection coefficient is validated against an available result which points towards a good agreement this validation establishes the model and the method followed in this work to be effective and allows subsequent investigation for this problem to be taken up for verification of the theory developed here one specific undulating bed topography is selected to assess the reflection as well as transmission coefficients which are depicted by graphical representations to examine and establish the energy conversion between the flexural wave mode and the interfacial wave mode present investigation demonstrates that the reflection and transmission of the waves exhibit an oscillatory behavior the reason for which is the outcome of multiple interaction of the incident wave with the elastic bottom undulation interface and the ice sheet it further shows that flexural wave moment is significantly affected as compared to the interfacial wave influence it is noted that significant variation in the elastic specification of the ice sheet and the elastic sea bed has a considerable influence for wave scattering by the undulating elastic sea bed it is observed that when water waves propagate over a deformable bottom the wave characteristics undergo a significant change this occurs due to the elasticity of the sea bed which immensely influences the kinematics and dynamics of the wave over and above providing the demonstration of the elastic behavior of the soil located below the elastic sea bed the approach adopted here is likely to be of immense significance in the design and construction of various types of floating breakwaters and very large floating structures vlfs for the purpose of various scientific activities mainly in polar regions further the solutions of problems like these dealing with a deformable sea bed will be beneficial in providing the required background to the researchers with respect to the incorporation of the characteristics of the infinite depth soil located below the sea bed keywords two superposed fluids ice sheet bottom undulation elastic sea bed perturbation technique fourier transform reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction it is very much known that the problems involving the scattering of water waves propagating in two superposed fluids by a floating structure or a submerged obstacle have pivotal significance on account of immense and reliable use in various areas of ocean engineering during the last few decades an extensive interest in pursuing investigation of this type of problems by scientific community has been observed in particular reflection of water waves by a small bed distortion has been accorded an ever increasing recognition due to its expansive effect in intensifying the way shore parallel bars or pipes function in the event of a train of water waves striking an obstacle located on a sea bed the wave gets reflected as well as transmitted fascinatingly some common obstacles such as sand swells are naturally available at the sea bottom that those obstacles exhibit smallness in some sense makes it possible for one to exploit a perturbation technique in order to compute the first order reflection and transmission coefficients in the last few years an increasing amount of interest has been recorded of investigations by various researchers on topics connected to water wave interaction with very large floating structures vlfs in order to utilize the ocean space this concern has arisen because of modified urban planning in a good number of countries due to increase in population resulting in shortage of land and also in countries having coastlines of long stretch such countries use the process of land reclamation from the ocean for the purpose of preventing overcrowding in the available land therefore authorities planners engineers and researchers recommend utilization of vlfs for human dwelling setting up of industrial area and storage space responding to the above stated demands it is known that vlfs is easy to design control and remove and has been beneficial owing to the fact that it can be artificially produced which makes it an easily floating space on water body and simultaneously has a minimal adverse environmental effect on the marine eco system the behavior of vlfs is usually supposed to be elastic because of the significance of the localized deflection or vibration of such a long structure resulting in small amplitude waves getting continuously excited this is despite of the fact that the thickness of such structures is much smaller than its length information on various recent enhancement on vlfs is available in the works of wang and tay 2011 lamas pardoa et al 2015 and the references cited therein an associated problem arises in the polar region where a vast region of the ocean surface is covered by thin sheets of ice extending up to the continental shelves in the present work the floating ice sheet under consideration is modeled as thin floating elastic plate following the familiar euler bernoulli beam equation and interestingly enough such plates are also found to be suitable for modeling vlfs in ocean engineering as a consequence the investigation of ice wave interaction plays a significant role in both arctic engineering and marine technology it is pertinent to mention that water waves in oceans propagate through the ice regions thereby weakening and rupturing continuous sea ice that has a huge impact on global climate due to the temporal adjustments in pack ice serving as a proxy for the factors affecting climate change of late a substantial fascination has been generated in the evaluation of ice wave interaction because of intensification of various scientific activities occurring mainly in the polar regions and also of reasonable amount of utilization in marine engineering another main objective is to figure out a suitable mechanism and the impact of wave propagation in the earthquake prone regions water wave interaction with a floating ice sheet of finite or infinite length using the model of thin elastic plate theory generates delightful mathematical problems for scientific marine research thereby bringing the attention of different kinds of practical problems for the purpose of obtaining their convenient solutions in a very important work fox and squire 1990 1994 studied water wave propagation from water region of a sea into a floating ice sheet and presented an acceptable linearized model to examine wave reflection and transmission particularly at the edges of the ice sheet marchenko 1999 investigated the excitation of flexural gravity edge waves in a fluid covered by an ice sheet having a discontinuity in this investigation it was noticed that the wave frequency and also the incident angle of the wave had a considerable impact on the generation of reflected and transmitted energy of the waves through the discontinuity in the form of a crack an extensive study on scattering of water waves due to the presence of floating ice sheets of non uniform of thickness is found in the analysis and description by bennetts 2007 and bennetts et al 2007 subsequently a detailed study on the important link between sea ice interaction and vlfs hydro elasticity was carried out by squire 2008 further watanabe et al 2004 and chen et al 2006 presented some significant developments in matters related to water wave interaction with flexible floating structures in homogeneous fluids of uniform water depth bhattacharjee et al 2007 and karmakar et al 2010 studied scattering of flexural gravity waves by a varying sea bottom using perturbation technique maiti and mandal 2008 investigated scattering of surface waves by an undulating sea bed in an ice covered ocean by adopting perturbation method and fourier transform mohapatra and bora 2012 investigated wave proliferation over an undulating sea bed for a fluid flow of two superposed fluids flowing underneath an infinitely extended floating ice sheet miles 1981 employed a perturbation method to analyze the occurrence of reflection and transmission for oblique waves scattered by an impermeable undulating sea bed for a homogeneous fluid utilizing the strategy of fourier transform davies 1982 considered a sinusoidal undulation at the sea bed to examine the reflection of incident surface waves heathershaw 1982 came up with an experimental proof in support of the theoretical results obtained for occurrence of reflection of wave energy which took place because of the resonant interactions between the waves and the undulating sea bed davies 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 showed the importance of bragg resonance which is the phenomenon occurring in the event of the wavenumber of the undulating sea bed being twice of that of the incident surface wave for a sea bed consisting of periodic undulations it is worthwhile noting that such resonant wave interaction has an immense and practical role to play in the development of surface waves in regions adjacent to the shore however any theory with a small perturbation parameter becomes invalid near the bragg resonance condition in order to modify a model which could get rid of this disadvantage mei 1985 established some pertinent results for the wave evolution and reflection theory which worked nicely for structures such as offshore sandbars set parallel to the coastline zhu 2001 employed galerkin eigenfunction expansion technique to study a refraction diffraction model within a porous structure located on a ripple sea bed in a homogeneous fluid employing green s second identity and modeling the mild slope equation of the sea bed numerically silva et al 2002 discussed linear wave scattering by a rapidly varying water depth with consideration of the thickness of the porous sea bed utilizing two different methods one comprising of perturbation and other comprising of fourier transform martha et al 2007 studied the scattering of linear oblique water waves by a small distortion on a sea bed possessing a reasonable porosity craig et al 2009 presented a systematic derivation and analysis of the equations of motion of water waves in the free surface of a channel of fluid over a variable bottom guyenne and nicholls 2007 presented a numerical method for simulation of nonlinear waves over a variable impermeable sea bed the higher order spectral method included contributions up to an arbitrary order with respect to the perturbation parameter for the uneven sea bed fourier transform method was appropriately utilized further chen et al 2019 considered a two dimensional continuum model for linear gravity waves propagating across an ice covered sea by assuming the floating sea ice as a homogeneous isotropic poro elastic material and the underlying ocean as a weakly compressible fluid they analyzed wave dispersion and attenuation in details recently chanda and bora 2020a investigated the impact of a porous sea bed on scattering of oblique water waves by a dual submerged porous barrier stokes 1847 examined waves proliferating in two superposed fluids without considering interaction with any structure it was lamb 1932 who showed that by considering a fixed frequency time harmonic gravity waves proliferate with two distinct wavenumbers modes one each along the interface and the free surface in two superposed fluids chamberlain and porter 2005 employed a variational technique with the help of linear wave theory to study water wave scattering in two superposed fluids of varying mean depth later through an application of green s integral theorem maiti and mandal 2006 investigated water wave scattering by a small undulating sea bed for a flow of two superposed fluids utilizing two different methods namely perturbation technique and fourier transform panda and martha 2014 studied wave scattering by a varying porous sea bed for the case of water waves propagating through two superposed fluids craig et al 2015 in a very important work considered the nonlinear interaction of internal waves and surface waves in a three dimensional two layer fluid by using hamiltonian perturbation theory it was established that long internal waves could be modeled by the kpii equation which generated a resonant interaction with modulated surface waves at resonant wavenumbers existence of two linear wave modes in the form of free surface and interfacial modes was clearly observed in all the above mentioned works the sea bed is considered to be either of an infinite depth or of a finite uniform depth may be impermeable or permeable however it is noticed that the flexibility of a sea bed which can be considered to be a very significant feature is not accounted for in these investigations the problems of wave structure interaction involving sea beds exhibiting some sort of flexibility have been taken up by a limited number of researchers an important impetus for investigation of water wave scattering or trapping for a set up containing an elastic sea bed is due to the utilization of these outcomes in the construction of structures such as underwater pipe bridges wave power devices vlfs etc some of the earlier works reflect that the properties and behavior of waves get significantly impacted when the sea bed possesses some elasticity it is known that for water waves proliferating over a bottom deformation water of uniform depth bounded below by a perfectly elastic soil of infinite depth possesses a shear representing a soft marine sediment mallard and dalrymple 1977 carried out an investigation on the wave propagation over a deformable bottom and established that the elasticity of the sea bed brought a reasonable change in the wave characteristics this affected the kinematics and dynamics of the wave as well as of the elastic behavior of the soil beneath the sea bed these results clearly emphasize that the soil displacement and stresses form the foundation in computing the estimates of the effects of a bottom deformation found on various underlying structures such as pipelines cables etc which are connected to the sea bed dawson 1978 investigated the propagation of water waves over a deformable bottom for the case where the soil beneath the water was regarded as an elastic solid the varying nature of bottom soil characteristics often brings in significant decay in wave amplitude when wave propagation takes place over continental shelves and also in the coastal waters these above mentioned works provide ample justification of the importance of the study of various aspects of an elastic sea bed with regard to various wave propagation problems while considering a deformable sea bed it has been observed that significant change takes place because of the sea bed elasticity utilizing the green s function technique in a homogeneous fluid sarangi and mohapatra 2018 studied the impacts of an elastic sea bed of varying depth on water wave diffraction recently the investigation of water wave propagation in two superposed fluids over a small undulating elastic sea bed has been studied by chanda and bora 2020b c and various outcomes have been presented regarding the effect of the elasticity of the sea bed attenuation of amplitude of water waves propagating in sea ice occurs mainly due to two reasons i a conservative scattering by ice floes which results in relocation of energy in all directions and ii a true dissipation due to friction viscosity inelastic collisions and the breakup of ice floes which actually results in relocation of the energy to the other parts of the associated system i e atmosphere ice water both processes need to be accommodated in any model of earth system or ice ocean or wave forecasting parametrization dissipation is important in planetary system models in which energy conversion takes place remarkable perversion of the penetrating ocean wave spectrum takes place due to the ice floes getting reflected and transmitted and them extracting energy from those waves with the aid of either an elastic flexure or an inter floe collision similarly water wave propagation in an ocean containing a floating ice sheet has received importance while developing effective reflectors of the incident wave energy which can be installed in order to protect coastal areas from dangerous waves near and in the polar regions such problems involving wave ice interaction arise naturally mainly in some parts of both arctic and antarctic regions as a result extensive interest has been evoked in the scientific community for dealing with ice wave interaction problems stemming from the current significant scientific and research activities thus there is a strong conviction among researchers that a possible and feasible next step forward is to try the initiation of modeling of scattering of water waves by an undulating elastic sea bed consequently there is a strong likelihood in providing impetus to researchers in getting a clear and proper understanding of the physical conditions arising naturally in areas such as oceanography coastal engineering offshore engineering arctic engineering and some other disciplines associated with ocean engineering the present article presents the problem and solution of water wave scattering by a small undulating elastic sea bed for two superposed fluids flowing under a floating ice sheet because of the presence of elasticity in upper and lower boundaries two linearized boundary conditions of fifth order come into existence at both the upper surface and the sea bed in contrast to the usually homogeneous neumann boundary condition that appear in many ocean engineering problems for this specific study there exist two time harmonic waves at a given frequency propagating with two distinct wavenumbers one at the ice sheet due to the lower wavenumber while the other at the interface due to the higher wavenumber employing linear water wave theory the aforementioned problem at hand is cast as a coupled boundary value problem bvp which involves a velocity potential in each layer of the two superposed fluids a very small parameter δ signifying the smallness of the bottom undulation is considered and subsequently a perturbation technique and fourier transform are utilized to solve the bvp by converting it to two bvps for demonstrating the theoretical results a patch of sinusoidal ripple is considered for representing such an undulating sea bed 2 formulation of scattering problem water wave propagation of small amplitude in response to the action of gravity and assuming small amplitude plate response is considered in incompressible inviscid two superposed fluids undergoing an irrotational motion and flowing underneath an infinitely extended floating ice sheet in horizontal directions in an ocean over an undulating elastic bed the surface tension effect at the separation of the fluids is not taken into account as its impact is considered inconsequential following euler bernoulli beam equation the floating ice sheet and elastic sea bed are considered to act as thin elastic plates as has also usually been considered by many other researchers for such studies the elastic plate is considered to be thin implying that the horizontal length of the plate is much larger in comparison to the thickness of the plate there is a strong conviction to idealize each of the plates as a thin and linear elastic plate possessing uniform mass density and thickness the justification of consideration of such elastic plates is explained in chanda and bora 2020c further to it it may be mentioned that fox and squire 1991 demonstrated the validity of thin plate theory for such type of problems interestingly similarity of such works can be seen with those of linear water wave interaction with vlfs as discussed in chen et al 2006 a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is adopted in such a way that the y axis points in vertical downward direction y h f and y 0 respectively represent the location of the floating ice sheet and the tranquil interface as displayed in fig 1 it is assumed that a small undulation given by y h b δ b x is located on the sea bed where b x denotes a differentiable function possessing compact support i e b x 0 as x signifying the shape of bottom undulation the non dimensional number δ 1 indicating the smallness of the undulation and h b the constant lower fluid depth on either side of the undulation here ρ 1 is the upper fluid density and ρ 2 ρ 1 is the lower fluid density and let the ratio ρ 1 ρ 2 1 of the two fluid densities be designated by ρ adopting linear water wave theory and accounting for all the above assumptions the time harmonic velocity potentials in the upper fluid and in the lower fluid can respectively be represented by re ψ x y exp i σ t and re ϕ x y exp i σ t for normal wave incidence where σ denotes the angular wave frequency of the incident wave re denotes the real part and i 1 now the physical problem is modeled in which the velocity potentials ψ and ϕ respectively satisfy the laplace s equation in the upper and lower fluids as follows 2 1 x y 2 ψ 0 x h f y 0 2 2 x y 2 ϕ 0 x 0 y h b δ b x the relevant boundary condition at the upper surface i e at the floating ice sheet is represented by 2 3 d 1 4 x 4 1 ϵ 1 k ψ y k ψ 0 on y h f where k σ 2 g g the gravitational constant d 1 q 1 ρ 1 g q 1 e 1 h 1 3 12 1 ν 1 2 denoting the flexural rigidity of the ice sheet e 1 young s modulus ν 1 poisson s ratio ϵ 1 ρ f ρ 1 h 1 with ρ f as the ice sheet density and h 1 the ice sheet thickness which is considered to be very small the interfacial conditions at y 0 are given by 2 4 ψ y ϕ y 2 5 k ψ ψ y 1 ρ k ϕ ϕ y the boundary condition at the lower surface i e at the elastic sea bed has the form 2 6 d 2 4 x 4 1 ϵ 2 k ϕ n k ϕ 0 on y h b δ b x with d 2 q 2 ρ 2 g where q 2 e 2 h 2 3 12 1 ν 2 2 is the flexural rigidity of the elastic sea bed e 2 and ν 2 are respectively young s modulus and poisson s ratio ϵ 2 ρ b ρ 2 h 2 where ρ b denotes the elastic sea bed density h 2 denotes the elastic sea bed thickness which is considered to be very small and n is the normal derivative to the sea bed at any point x y earlier mohapatra and sahoo 2011 considered surface gravity wave interaction with an elastic sea bed which was modeled as a thin elastic plate the linearized condition eq 2 6 satisfied at the undulating bottom can now be expressed by ignoring the higher order terms of δ in the following form 2 7 k ϕ δ b x ϕ y d 2 4 x 4 1 ϵ 2 k ϕ y δ x b x ϕ x o δ 2 0 on y h b since the above converted condition is satisfied at a uniform depth instead of a varying depth it will be much easier to solve the bvp now with the assumption of linear theory in two superposed fluids progressive waves propagating in the two layer fluid along the positive x direction have the following forms in the respective layers 2 8 ψ x y exp i u x f 1 u y in h f y 0 2 9 ϕ x y exp i u x f 2 u y in 0 y h b where 2 10 f 1 u y d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u cosh u y h f k sinh u y h f d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u sinh u h f k cosh u h f 2 11 f 2 u y k sinh u y h b d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u cosh u y h b k cosh u h b d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u sinh u h b it is to be noted that the wavenumber u satisfies the following dispersion equation 2 12 u 0 where 2 13 u d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u tanh u h f k d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u k k 2 tanh u h b d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u 2 tanh u h b k u ρ d 2 u 4 1 ϵ 2 k u tanh u h b k d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u k k 2 tanh u h f d 1 u 4 1 ϵ 1 k u 2 tanh u h f k u it is obvious that u 0 is a root of the dispersion equation 2 12 which has exactly two distinct positive and real zeros corresponding to a value of k let them be m and m where 0 m m in accordance with the propagating modes four pairs of complex zeros that correspond to the non propagating modes and also infinitely many purely imaginary zeros that relate to the evanescent modes since evidently the existence of exactly two positive zeros m and m of 2 12 is ensured as also observed in the works of saha and bora 2015 and maiti and mandal 2008 there exist two wave modes wavenumbers with one propagating at the ice sheet say flexural mode and the other at the interface say interfacial mode respectively along the positive x direction both wavenumbers exhibit increasing values when an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed is affected and they decrease corresponding to increasing values of the elastic parameter of the floating ice sheet the zeros of the complex dispersion equation 2 12 are evaluated numerically through the use of contour plots for the purpose of interpreting the behaviors of the wavenumbers as shown in fig 2 in order to compute these values of various parameters are considered in accordance with the following upper layer depth h f 10 m lower layer depth h b 10 m k 0 5 elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed are taken as d 1 h b 4 1 0 2 ϵ 1 h b 0 0001 and d 2 h b 4 1 0 2 ϵ 2 h b 0 0001 respectively unless otherwise mentioned a simple counting argument as used in fox and squire 1990 is followed here to find the nature of the zeros of 2 12 for finding the real zeros of the complex dispersion equation newton raphson method is used and initial guess for this method for each zero is acquired utilizing contour plot from fig 2 it is noticed that two pairs of real zeros of opposite signs namely m m m and m lie on the real axis and they can be referred as the progressive wave modes in flexural modes and internal modes the same feature related to the zeros was also observed by das et al 2016 when they considered flexural gravity wave motion over a poro elastic bed in a two layer fluid since the region of study is clearly symmetric about x 0 it is considered to be sufficient to study the wave characteristic corresponding to x 0 only fig 2 represents the nature of the complex zeros demonstrating that four pairs of complex zeros occurring as positive and negative of a complex conjugate pair namely u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 u 6 u 7 u 8 are situated in such a way that there are two zeros in each of the quadrants it needs to be mentioned that two pairs of complex zeros occur for the ice sheet and another two pairs occur for the elastic sea bed progressive normal waves in correspondence with wavenumber m flexural mode can be represented by where u in eqs 2 8 and 2 9 is replaced by m 2 14 ψ 0 x y exp i m x f 1 m y in h f y 0 2 15 ϕ 0 x y exp i m x f 2 m y in 0 y h b therefore if a normal wave of wavenumber m proliferating from the negative x direction interacts with the undulation of the sea bed for a two layer fluid flow then reflection and transmission occur for both flexural and interfacial modes when the train of waves hits the bottom undulation it experiences partial reflection and partial transmission and accordingly the asymptotic behaviors of ψ and ϕ can respectively be expressed as 2 16 ψ x y f 1 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 1 m y exp i m x x t m f 1 m y exp i m x t m f 1 m y exp i m x x 2 17 ϕ x y f 2 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 2 m y exp i m x x t m f 2 m y exp i m x t m f 2 m y exp i m x x the undetermined coefficients r m and r m introduced in eqs 2 16 and 2 17 respectively represent the reflection coefficients corresponding to the reflected waves of wavenumbers m and m for an incident wave of wavenumber m in a similar manner t m and t m respectively represent the transmission coefficients corresponding to the transmitted waves of wavenumbers m and m for an incident wave of wavenumber m next the progressive normal waves in correspondence with wavenumber m interfacial mode are given by 2 18 ψ 0 x y exp i m x f 1 m y in h f y 0 2 19 ϕ 0 x y exp i m x f 2 m y in 0 y h b accordingly for a normal wave of wavenumber m which is incident on the undulating sea bed the asymptotic forms of ψ and ϕ respectively are as follows 2 20 ψ x y f 1 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 1 m y exp i m x x t m f 1 m y exp i m x t m f 1 m y exp i m x x 2 21 ϕ x y f 2 m y exp i m x r m exp i m x r m f 2 m y exp i m x x t m f 2 m y exp i m x t m f 2 m y exp i m x x in eqs 2 20 and 2 21 the undetermined coefficients r m and r m represent the reflection coefficients related to the reflected wave of wavenumbers m and m respectively due to a normally incident waves of wavenumber m similarly t m and t m represent the transmission coefficients corresponding to the transmitted waves of wavenumbers m and m respectively due to an incident wave of wavenumber m the process involved in evaluating the analytical values of these aforementioned coefficients for both the flexural and interfacial wave modes for an arbitrary bottom topography is not quite elementary however under the assumption of small bottom topography a suitable perturbation expansion technique can be used to obtain the first order corrections to these undetermined coefficients the velocity potentials and the corresponding reflection and transmission coefficients for respective modes associated with the propagation of waves with different wavenumbers are going to be evaluated up to first order in the following section 3 evaluation of velocity potentials and relevant coefficients 3 1 perturbation method let a normal wave train of mode m be incident on the small undulation of an elastic sea bed for a sea bed without any bottom distortion the propagation of this wave train is not disturbed i e only transmission takes place along the positive x direction however when there some distortion is present on the sea bed the incident wave will undergo both reflection and transmission with all available information and conditions the velocity potentials ψ and ϕ as well as the reflection coefficients r m and r m and the transmission coefficients t m and t m can be written appropriately in perturbation series having perturbation parameter δ as follows 3 1 ψ ψ 0 δ ψ 1 o δ 2 3 2 ϕ ϕ 0 δ ϕ 1 o δ 2 3 3 r m δ r 1 m o δ 2 3 4 r m δ r 1 m o δ 2 3 5 t m 1 δ t 1 m o δ 2 3 6 t m δ t 1 m o δ 2 where ψ 0 and ϕ 0 are respectively given by 2 14 and 2 15 such perturbation expansions given by eqs 3 1 3 6 break down at bragg resonance which is a phenomenon when reflection coefficients take values higher than δ as mentioned in mei 1985 however the perturbation expansions 3 1 3 6 given above are considered to be valid throughout this work since bragg resonance is not taken into account substituting the expansions presented by eqs 3 1 3 6 into eqs 2 1 2 5 2 7 and 2 16 2 17 and comparing the first order terms of the perturbation parameter δ from both sides of the equations a new coupled boundary value problem in first order velocity potentials ψ 1 and ϕ 1 is formulated as follows 3 7 x y 2 ψ 1 0 in h f y 0 3 8 x

boundary value problems in ψ 1 and ϕ 1 the boundary value problem bvp for the first order velocity potentials ψ 1 and ϕ 1 as presented by eqs 3 7 3 13 along with the asymptotic forms 3 14 3 15 is now split into two separate boundary value problems for ψ 1 and ϕ 1 boundary value problem i for ψ 1 3 16 x y 2 ψ 1 0 in h f y 0 3 17 k ψ 1 d 1 4 x 4 1 ϵ 1 k ψ 1 y 0 on y h f 3 18 ψ 1 y η x on y 0 with

of fourier transform in order to solve the above two boundary value problems the technique of fourier transform is adopted fourier transforms of ψ 1 x y and ϕ 1 x y for the variable x are defined with the assumption of their existence they are denoted respectively by ψ 1 and ϕ 1 and defined as follows 3 25 ψ 1 γ y ψ 1 x y e i γ x d x 3 26 and ϕ 1 γ y ϕ 1 x y e i γ x d x utilization of fourier

follows 3 36 ϕ 1 γ y γ q γ cosh γ y η γ k sinh γ h b y d 2 γ 4 1 ϵ 2 k γ cosh γ h b y γ k cosh γ h b d 2 γ 4 1 ϵ 2 k γ sinh γ h b where η γ is determined by first applying fourier transform to eq 3 24 3 37 k ϕ 1 ρ ψ 1 ρ 1 η γ on y 0 and then using 3 30 and 3 36 into eq 3 37 to get 3 38 η γ k γ d 1 γ 4 1 ϵ 1 k γ sinh γ ˆ h f k cosh γ h f q γ γ where the function γ is given by 2 13 it is observed from eq 2 12 that γ possesses only two non zero positive zeros m and m on the real γ axis now upon substitution of η γ into eqs 3 30 and 3 36 and then employing inverse fourier transform the expressions for ψ 1 x y and ϕ 1 x y are acquired respectively in the following form 3 39 ψ 1 x y k 2 π k sinh γ y h f d 1 γ 4 1 ϵ 1 k γ cosh γ y h f γ q γ e i γ x d γ 3 40 ϕ 1 x y 1 2 π cosh γ y k d 1

γ 1 m and γ 2 m respectively on the positive real axis of γ the above integrals in 3 39 and 3 40 contain two simple poles at γ 1 and γ 2 as a result it is necessary that the path of integration in 3 39 and 3 40 is to be indented beneath the poles at γ 1 m and γ 2 m 3 4 determination of relevant coefficients the first order reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m t 1 m and r 1 m t 1 m corresponding to the flexural and interfacial modes for a normally incident proliferating wave of mode m is calculated by integrating with respect to γ in eqs 3 39 or 3 40 and then by letting x and comparing with those in the asymptotic expressions for the velocity potentials from eqs 3 19 or 3 23 gives the values in order to obtain the first order reflection coefficients we consider x in either eq 3 39 or eq 3 40 when x the behavior of ψ 1 x y or ϕ 1 x y is studied through a rotation of the path of the integral which contains the term q γ into a contour in the first quadrant so that the residue terms at the poles γ 1 and γ 2 can be incorporated similarly the path of the integral containing the term q γ in eq 3 39 or eq 3 40 is rotated into a contour this time in the fourth quadrant so that there is no contribution from this integral when x subsequently after comparing the resultant integral with eq 3 19 or eq 3 23 the eventual expression for r 1 m and r 1 m can respectively be obtained as 3 41 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f q m m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e 2 i m x b x d x 3 42 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m

eq 3 40 as x the behavior of ψ 1 x y or ϕ 1 x y is studied similarly like for x because of the fact that the integral containing the term q γ makes no contribution when x subsequently by comparison of the resultant integral with expressions in eq 3 19 or eq 3 23 the coefficients t 1 m and t 1 m can respectively be expressed as follows 3 43 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f q m m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m b x d x 3 44 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f q m m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e i m m x b x d x as the next step forward a train of normal waves of mode m is considered to be incident on the undulating elastic sea bed then the coefficients r 1 m r 1 m t 1 m and t 1 m are calculated by following the same procedure that was applied earlier for wave mode m in this case these coefficients are found as 3 45 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e i m m x b x d x 3 46 r 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e 2 i m x b x d x 3 47 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m e i m m x b x d x 3 48 t 1 m i k k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f s m m m b x d x it can be observed that all these above coefficients are expressed in integral form which contains the uneven bed shape function b x and hence these can be computed for a given shape function in the next section the consequence of reflection and transmission is going to be investigated by considering a sinusoidal ripple bed 4 special form of undulating sea bed a specific function b x is taken up as an undulation in order to study wave reflection and transmission such shapes are similar to some familiar natural obstacles which usually get formed at the sea beds due to continuous sedimentation and ripple growth of sands while studying wave scattering by an uneven sea bed davies 1982 established that an undulating sea bed with sinusoidal undulation is capable of bouncing back the energy of the incident wave which plays a huge role in tasks connected to coastal protection and the probable growth of ripples because of such important physical significance of this type of bed topographies having sinusoidal ripples an appropriate shape as given below is considered for corroborating the general results obtained earlier considered below is b x consisting of a finite patch of sinusoidal ripples of amplitude a on the sea bed which is assumed to be flat otherwise 4 1 b x a sin l x n π l x n π l 0 elsewhere with l as the ripple wavenumber in n π l x n π l and n the number of ripples in this patch suppose that normal proliferating waves with wavenumber m flexural mode encounter the small undulation located on the elastic sea bed under consideration the first order reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m r 1 m t 1 m and t 1 m corresponding to the flexural and interfacial modes due to a normally incident propagating wave of mode m are calculated by substituting b x from eq 4 1 into eqs 3 41 3 44 in this case the coefficient t 1 m vanishes identically and the rest of the three coefficients are found as 4 2 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin 2 m n π l l 2 4 m 2 4 3 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 4 4 t 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 next normal propagating waves with wavenumber m interfacial mode is considered to be incident on the bottom undulation following a similar procedure the first order reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m r 1 m t 1 m and t 1 m for the normally incident proliferating wave of mode m are calculated by putting b x into eqs 3 45 3 48 this time the coefficient t 1 m vanishes identically and the other three coefficients are found as follows 4 5 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 4 6 r 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin 2 m n π l l 2 4 m 2 4 7 t 1 m 1 n 2 a k l k cosh m h f d 1 m 4 1 ϵ 1 k m sinh m h f m s m m sin m m n π l l 2 m m 2 it can be observed from eqs 4 2 4 7 above that for a fixed number of ripples n an oscillatory nature is exhibited in these first order coefficients additionally it is noticed from 4 2 that in the event of the ripple wavenumber l and the incident wavenumber m satisfying the relation l 2 m the theory adopted here ceases and consequently generation of a large amount of reflected wave energy created by the undulating sea bed is visible in the neighborhood of this singularity the implication is that resonant interaction occurs between the incident wave and the sinusoidal ripples furthermore resonant interaction can occur between the incident wave and the ripple bed specifically when l m m and l m m respectively in 4 3 and 4 4 similarly resonance due to an incident wave of wavenumber m can be taken up it is seen that with occurrence of resonance the highest peak value of each coefficient has a linear variation with respect to ripple number n moreover those coefficients are also dependent on the values of elasticity parameters d 1 ϵ 1 of the ice sheet and d 2 ϵ 2 of the elastic sea bed next numerical computation of the coefficients demonstrated by 4 2 4 7 is performed with an eye to investigate the role of various parameters in the variation of wave energy in response to reflection and transmission 5 validation for carrying out the computational results that are acquired throughout this work it is deemed appropriate to connect those with some earlier work in this direction the result of chanda and bora 2020c is considered since it bears certain similarities with the present work to a reasonable level to validate the present result the available results of chanda and bora 2020c are considered when the ice sheet is not taken into consideration i e when d 1 h b 4 0 and ϵ 1 h b 0 by considering the density ratio as ρ 0 5 the depth ratio as h b h f 2 the ripple wavenumber as l h b 1 the amplitude of the ripples as a h b 0 1 number of ripples as n 3 the elastic parameter of the sea bed as d 2 h b 4 1 and ϵ 2 h b 0 001 the present problem reduces to the one in the work by chanda and bora 2020c for normal wave propagation to validate the present result the reflection coefficient r 1 m is plotted as a function of k h b for the result of chanda and bora 2020c and that also from the present one from which an excellent agreement is clearly observed fig 3 based on these outcomes a number of subsequent investigations are carried out by considering the present model to be an efficient one consequently it is believed that this model can be appropriately used for tackling such problems involving a two layer fluid an ice sheet and an undulating elastic sea bed in disciplines such as offshore and arctic engineering 6 results and discussion by devising an appropriate matlab program the influence of various parameters such as elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed number of ripples of the undulation etc on reflection as well as transmission coefficients for a patch of sinusoidal ripples on an elastic sea bed are examined the essential goal of the present investigation is to identify the pattern of incident wave energy distribution between the reflected and transmitted waves the graphs and the related interpretation for the evaluated first order reflection and transmission coefficients corresponding to the interfacial and flexural wave mode are presented for various values of different non dimensional parameters for computing purpose the following values are considered ρ 0 5 h b h f 1 l h b 1 a h b 0 1 ϵ 1 h b 0 0001 ϵ 2 h b 0 0001 unless otherwise mentioned before going further ahead it is felt essential to put forward some justification about the chosen value of the density ratio ρ it is known that for a two layer fluid consisting of fresh water and salt water the value of ρ would usually be around 0 97 the same qualitative features are observed for such a density ratio but the effects of the interface are much smaller and cannot be appreciated in this context the density ratio ρ is chosen to be 0 5 in order to observe the features clearly the same was followed by some other researchers including linton and mciver 1995 linton and cadby 2002 for the scattering problem in a two layer fluid with the density ratio chosen as 0 5 for the same reason in figs 4 12 the reflection and transmission coefficients are demonstrated versus non dimensional wavenumber k h b in accordance with a normally incident wave of mode m flexural mode on the undulating sea bed in figs 4 6 the graphs are plotted for various number of ripples n where the values of the elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed are considered as d 1 h b 4 1 and d 2 h b 4 1 respectively from fig 4 it is noted that the utmost values of the reflection coefficient r 1 m due to flexural wave influence for an incident wave of mode m i e for flexural wave mode striking the undulation normally increases in accordance with an increment in the values of n further it seems obvious from figs 5 and 6 that the utmost values for both the reflection and transmission coefficients of the waves due to the interfacial wave influence for a normally incident proliferating wave of wavenumber m increase when the value of n increases it is worthwhile to note that if the value of n rises then the coefficients corresponding to reflection and transmission turn out to be unbounded for some specific values of k h b this is what bragg resonance is as mentioned earlier if the value of n rises the graphs of reflection coefficient r 1 m and transmission coefficient t 1 m with regard to k h b show oscillatory pattern significantly with increase of number of zeros such oscillatory behavior arises as a result of the incident proliferating wave interacting multiple times with the undulating elastic sea bed ice sheet and the interface fig 5 shows that the utmost values of the first order reflection coefficient are higher as compared to those in the example of maiti and mandal 2008 this may have resulted because of the association of the elastic sea bed instead of an impermeable sea bed figs 7 9 show curves for reflection and transmission coefficients r 1 m r 1 m and t 1 m corresponding to different sets of values of the elastic parameters of the ice sheet namely d 1 h b 4 1 2 3 and 4 with n 4 and elastic parameter of the sea bed taken as d 2 h b 4 1 it can be seen from fig 7 that the values of the reflection coefficient r 1 m for waves with wavenumber m i e for flexural mode due to a normal incident wave of wavenumber m reduce for increasing values of the elastic parameter d 1 h b 4 of the ice sheet next figs 8 and 9 respectively demonstrate the first order reflection and transmission coefficients of interfacial wave mode i e for wavenumber m due to a normal incident proliferating wave of wavenumber m it is exhibited that for increasing values of elastic parameter of the ice sheet both r 1 m and t 1 m decrease non zero values of both the first order reflection coefficient and the first order transmission coefficient exist due to the reflected waves and the transmitted waves respectively with wavenumber m corresponding to various values of elastic parameter of the ice sheet it establishes that energy conversion is always possible between the interfacial wave mode and the flexural wave mode to some extent it is also observed from figs 7 and 8 that the reflection coefficient corresponding to the reflected wave of wavenumber m i e for the case of interfacial wave mode is greater than that of the reflected wave with wavenumber m i e for the case of flexural wave mode another important observation is that corresponding to increasing values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet the rate of change of the transmission coefficients and reflection coefficients is found to be higher for both flexural and interfacial modes thus it can be inferred that for a train of normal propagating wave incident on the undulating elastic sea bed the energy associated with both reflection and transmission is very sensitive if variation of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet is affected the curves presented in figs 10 12 correspond to five different values of elastic parameter of the sea bed d 2 h b 4 0 1 3 4 5 and 5 5 where d 2 h b 4 0 is associated with the value ϵ 2 h b 0 while for other values of d 2 h b 4 the associated value of ϵ 2 h b is considered as 0 0001 as mentioned earlier with n 4 and the value of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet considered as d 1 h b 4 1 it is to be noted that the case d 2 h b 4 0 ϵ 2 h b 0 implies a rigid sea bed fig 10 depicts that for increasing values of the elastic parameters of the sea bed there is always an increase in the reflection coefficient r 1 m it can be seen from figs 11 and 12 that as we keep increasing the value of elastic parameter d 2 h b 4 of the sea bed we observe a gradual increment in r 1 m and t 1 m however the non zero values of both r 1 m and t 1 m with wavenumber m for different elastic specifications of the sea bed indicate that conversion of some amount of energy is feasible from one wavenumber to the other another important remark is that when an increase in the value of the elastic parameter of the sea bed is affected then rate of change of both reflection and transmission coefficients is higher for flexural wave mode that implies that the energy due to reflection and transmission is very sensitive in response to the variation in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed when the incident wave of flexural mode encounters the undulating elastic sea bed moreover it can be inferred that with increasing values of elastic parameter of the sea bed the value of first order reflection and transmission coefficients become much higher from figs 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 it is worthwhile to note that the number of zeros of reflection and transmission coefficients is smaller than those in the example of maiti and mandal 2008 it very likely happens due to the presence of the elastic sea bed a common observation in these figures is the oscillating behavior of the coefficient which is a function of the wavenumber k h b the case of a normally incident proliferating wave of wavenumber m interfacial mode represents a delightful circumstance due to the involvement of elasticity of the sea bed where the energy conversion takes place from one wave mode to the other correspondingly figs 13 21 represent the coefficients r 1 m r 1 m and t 1 m plotted with respect to k h b by considering density ratio ρ 0 5 depth ratio h b h f 1 ripple wavenumber l h b 1 amplitude of the sinusoidal ripples a h b 0 1 and non dimensional parameters ϵ 1 h b 0 0001 ϵ 2 h b 0 0001 the curves presented in figs 13 14 and 15 depict the coefficients for various sets of values of number of ripples with the values of the elastic parameters of the ice sheet and the sea bed fixed at d 1 h b 4 1 and d 2 h b 4 1 respectively it is clear from figs 13 and 15 that as we keep on increasing the number of ripples a gradual increment is observed in the peak values of r 1 m and t 1 m fig 14 establishes that if an increase in the values of n is affected then there is always an increase in the peak values of r 1 m corresponding to a normal incident wave of wavenumber m i e for the case of interfacial mode but for this case the reflection coefficient r 1 m takes values higher than those of the reflection coefficient r 1 m this occurs since the interface is somewhat beneath the floating ice sheet of the fluid and therefore the reflected energy of flexural wave influence is smaller than that due to interfacial wave movement it is noticed that when n becomes large then the reflection and transmission coefficients turn out to be inexhaustible for some specific values of k h b which represents nothing but occurrence of bragg resonance the curves in figs 16 18 present the coefficients for various sets of values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet namely d 1 h b 4 1 2 3 and 4 with n 4 and elastic parameter of the sea bed as d 2 h b 4 1 figs 16 and 17 clearly show that when the value of the elastic parameter d 1 h b 4 of the ice sheet increases the values of r 1 m and r 1 m decrease one important observation is that according to an increase in value of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet the rate of decrement of the first order reflection coefficients is quite insensitive this is due to the fact that since the interface is somewhat below the ice sheet there is not much affect on the interfacial wave due to the changes in the elastic parameter of the ice sheet consequently the floating ice sheet does not have much effect on the reflection coefficients due to interfacial wave movement and flexural wave influence in the fluid region for the normally incident wave of mode m proliferating along the interface fig 18 depicts reduction in the values of t 1 m according to an increase in the elastic parameter of the ice sheet thus the elastic parameter of the ice sheet influences transmission coefficient significantly in connection with the case of interfacial wave mode figs 19 21 demonstrate the reflection and transmission coefficients for different values of the elastic parameter d 2 h b 4 of the sea bed for this case n is taken as 4 and the values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet is considered as d 1 h b 4 1 figs 19 and 20 show that an increase in the value of the elastic parameters of the sea bed brings an increase in the values of reflection coefficients r 1 m and r 1 m one important observation is that with an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed the increasing rate of the first order reflection coefficients is found to be quite imperceptible it means that the elastic sea bed does not command significant influence on the reflected wave energy as a result of interfacial wave movement and the flexural wave influence in the fluid for the normally incident wave train with wavenumber m proliferating at the interface on the other hand fig 21 shows that the transmission coefficient t 1 m increases corresponding to an increase in the value of elastic parameter of the sea bed however non zero values of both first order reflection and transmission coefficients for a train of propagating waves of mode m suggest that some conversion of reflected as well as transmitted energy is almost always possible from interfacial wave mode to the flexural wave mode a present observation is that increasing the elastic parameters of the sea bed can significantly increase the values of reflection and transmission coefficients for both flexural and interfacial modes it may happen due to the interaction of waves in flexural and interfacial modes with the undulating elastic sea bed one observation from figs 10 12 and 19 21 is that when the sea bed is considered as a rigid one then wave reflection is higher and wave transmission is lower it is concluded that interfacial wave gets influenced more as compared to the flexural wave when the rigid sea bed is considered it may be due to the fact that the sea bed is located underneath the interface of the fluid whereas the ice sheet is above the interface to put it concisely in this work we present a hydroelastic model to treat the water wave propagation over a small bottom undulation located on an elastic sea bed for two superposed fluids flowing underneath a floating ice sheet to the best of our knowledge investigation of this kind of problems for an ice covered two superposed fluid flowing over an undulating elastic sea bed has not been considered till date there is an observation from fig 7 that an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the ice sheet is associated with a reduction in the values of the reflection coefficient r 1 m on the other hand increase in the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients in both modes is noticed if the number of ripples of the undulating elastic sea bed increases it can also be seen that an increase in the values of the elastic parameter of the sea bed results in the increase in the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients for both modes the current authors also made the same conclusion in their study in chanda and bora 2020c however the numerical estimates of the coefficients are not the same as a result of the difference in consideration of various different physical conditions in those works 7 conclusion in this article using linearized water wave theory we take up the problem of normal water wave scattering by a small undulation located on an elastic sea bed in two superposed fluids flowing underneath an infinitely extended floating ice sheet considering the well known euler bernoulli beam equation both the ice sheet and elastic sea bed are considered as thin elastic plates where the horizontal length of such a plate is considered to be much larger in comparison to its thickness under such circumstances there exist propagating waves at two distinct wavenumbers for any given frequency the one with the smaller wavenumber along the floating ice sheet corresponding to the flexural mode and the other one with the higher wavenumber along the interface corresponding to the interfacial mode the first order velocity potentials and the reflection and transmission coefficients are found by applying the technique of perturbation in conjunction with fourier transform wave energy conversion from one wave mode to the other is exhibited by providing graphical representation corresponding to various physical parameters of the system the complex resonant interactions are demonstrated concerning wave propagation in an ice covered two superposed fluids flowing over a rippled elastic sea bed as a result of action of flexural and interfacial modes the energy related to reflection and transmission in accordance with both flexural and interfacial mode is observed to reduce when the elasticity of the ice sheet increases on the other hand an opposite trend is observed for reflected and transmitted energy when the elasticity of the sea bed increases furthermore it is worthwhile to note that the peak value of the reflection and transmission coefficients goes upward when the total number of ripples of the bottom undulation on the sea bed increases this outcome may bear a significant implication for both coastal protection and of possible ripple growth on an erodible bed involving a two layer ocean covered by a thin ice sheet for an interfacial mode wave the reflection corresponding to the flexural wave influence and interfacial wave movement is not influenced by the variations in the elastic parameter of the floating ice sheet since the interface is quite below the ice sheet the interfacial wave is not much influenced by the changes in the elastic parameter of the floating ice sheet at the same time the transmission in accordance with the interfacial wave mode is significantly affected a remarkable significance is observed in the conversion of incident wave energy to the reflected and transmitted energy taking place between the higher mode interfacial mode and the smaller mode flexural mode because of the non zero values of reflection and transmission coefficients arising out of the flexural wave movement and interfacial wave influence in the fluid region it is expected that the results developed in this work may be utilized in an appropriate manner for tackling a large class of water wave scattering problems that appear in various disciplines of ocean engineering the model developed here based on a physical problem and its associated results will certainly be helpful in the development of wave power devices underwater pipe bridges mobile offshore base vlfs like floating oil storage bases for oceanographic purposes in connection with different advanced evolutions in the marine environment the conclusions drawn from the present study will be immensely helpful in the selection of the site for various large floating offshore infrastructures and to understand the pattern of coupling between waves and sea ice under various bed characteristics especially elasticity

21111,an active multi strut assembly is used to attenuate vibration transmission from the shaft to the hull of underwater vehicles induced by the propeller forces the active assembly with embedded actuators is inserted between the stern bearing and the hull first the dynamic model of the shaft hull system is developed using the timoshenko beam theory and the frf frequency response function based synthesis method using the dynamic model the characteristics of power flow through the active assembly are analyzed next two control strategies that use three or six error transducers located evenly on the hull to measure vibrations are proposed and the feasibility of control is discussed finally the performance of vibration suppression is analyzed and the two control strategies are compared numerical results have shown that the active assembly is able to suppress the transmission of lateral vibration induced by the propeller forces and accordingly reduce the hull vibration moreover using six error transducers can lead to better control results in the low frequency range compared to using only three error transducers but at the cost of stronger channel coupling and heavier computation burden keywords shaft hull system active multi strut assembly lateral vibration transmission power flow 1 introduction underwater vehicles have attracted extensive attention for their ever increasing ability in exploration and detection however protection of the ocean environment by reducing underwater noise imposes requirements on the acoustic performance of underwater vehicles structural vibration induced by the propulsion system is an important factor to consider in the sound radiation of underwater vehicles caresta and kessissoglou 2010 chen et al 2017 li et al 2017 suppressing the vibration transmission from the propulsion system to the hull structure is an effective measure to reduce vibration and sound radiation and accordingly improves the acoustic performance of underwater vehicles merz et al 2009 su et al 2018 longitudinal vibration of the propulsion shafting system is dominant since its magnitude is about four times that of the lateral vibration however with the development of control measures for the propulsion shafting system the longitudinal vibration has been reduced significantly and hence contributes less to the radiated sound dylejko et al 2007 liu et al 2019 merz et al 2013 pan et al 2008 in this circumstance the influence of the lateral vibration becomes prominent as a result it is necessary to suppress the lateral vibration of the propulsion shafting system in order to reduce the vibration and sound radiation of the hull structure the transmission paths of the lateral vibration are diverse due to the multiple bearings in the shafting system and the complicated transfer characteristics qin et al 2020 xie et al 2019 in addition the fundamental function and shock resistance of the propulsion shafting system must be guaranteed no matter whether the vibration control is adopted therefore constraints and compromises will be inevitable in the lateral vibration control of the propulsion shafting system an accurate dynamic model of the propulsion shafting system is the basis for the investigation of the vibration characteristics of the shaft hull coupled system as well as the analysis and simulation of active control methods at present common modeling methods include analytical semi analytical methods chen et al 2015 qu et al 2013 2019 sun et al 2018 numerical methods huang et al 2017 li et al 2019 merz et al 2007 wang et al 2019 experimental methods leader et al 2013 and their combinations chen et al 2018 2019 note that analytical semi analytical methods are of higher computational efficiency than the numerical methods but they are usually restricted to simple structures meanwhile experimental methods can be inconvenient and time consuming therefore the combinations of analytical and numerical methods are often preferred in design stages the frf based synthesis method can divide the whole system into several subsystems whereby each subsystem can be modeled independently by the most suitable methods i e analytical semi analytical methods numerical methods and or experimental methods the frfs of subsystems can be synthesized to obtain the dynamic model of the whole system on the basis of ensuring computational efficiency and precision the frf based synthesis method is of higher flexibility and adaptability in dealing with large scale complicated systems with multiple elastic bodies there are many studies on active control strategies to control vibration transmission caresta and kessissoglou 2012 sutton et al 1997 wrona et al 2020 yang et al 2020 for active control of vibration and sound radiation of complex structures such as the propeller shafting system and hull of an underwater vehicle the strategy that directly controls the hull vibration with a large number of actuators and transducers is not applicable in most circumstances due to the cost and energy consumption therefore it is preferred to place actuators in the vibration transmission path from the shaft to the hull in this indirect control strategy both the number and the location of error transducers are of great influence on the power flow of vibration even so the consistency between the suppression of the responses of error transducers and the attenuation of the hull vibration should be guaranteed in active vibration control in order to suppress the transmission of lateral vibration in the shaft hull system excited by the propeller forces an active stern support of smooth spherical joints is proposed in xie et al 2020 and accordingly the friction in the spherical joints is neglected in the modeling however in practical applications smooth spherical joints are too hard to realize and can have a significant influence on the lateral vibration transmission in the case of smooth spherical joints lateral vibrations of the shafting system are transmitted to the hull structure mainly along the axis of each strut however if the joints are not smooth or the struts are rigidly connected lateral vibrations will transmit through the translational and rotational motion of the joints of the struts therefore it is necessary to take into account realistic operation conditions in the modeling and analysis of vibration transmission via the active struts in this paper an active multi strut assembly that is rigidly connected to the hull and the stern bearing is investigated the following discussion is organized in four sections in section 2 the dynamic model of the shaft hull system is developed using the frf based synthesis method in section 3 the power flow in the shaft hull system with the involvement of the active struts is analyzed the feasibility of active control and two strategies are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 modeling of the shaft hull system the shaft hull system is presented in fig 1 in this system the active multi strut assembly is proposed to replace the traditional stern bearing support and it is rigidly connected to the stern bearing housing and the annular end plate of the hull structure respectively this is different from that in xie et al 2020 where both ends of the assembly are connected by spherical joints in fig 1 the shaft is supported by three bearings i e the stern bearing the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing which are simplified into five radial springs an axial spring and an axial radial spring respectively the propeller and the flexible coupling are modeled as rigid disks while the shaft is modeled as a multi segment circular timoshenko beam the hull is simplified to a structure composed of conical cylindrical and hemi ellipsoidal shells to which evenly spaced ring stiffeners are attached vibration equations of the shaft hull coupled system are established using the timoshenko beam theory and the frf based synthesis method here the continuity conditions associated with the fixed joints are recast in the establishment of the vibration equations the fixed joints are represented by coupling points on the active struts the stern bearing housing and the hull respectively in the following modeling of the shaft hull system only the equations that are different from those in xie et al 2020 are described in detail 2 1 modeling of the active multi strut assembly for the vibration equation of the active multi strut assembly denoted by the superscript strut in the frequency domain the rotational angle and the moment have to be considered in the boundary conditions of each strut fig 2 is the model of a single active strut which is simplified into a three segment timoshenko beam of circular section and the electromagnetic actuator is represented by a mass spring actuation system f and m denote the force and the moment applied to the end of the strut respectively where the superscripts w and u denote the radial direction and the axial direction the subscripts i and o denote the input and the output respectively m a k a and f a denote the mass the stiffness and the active force of the actuator respectively 2 1 1 lateral vibration of a single strut in the derivation of the lateral vibration equation of the strut the relationships between the constant coefficients of mode shape functions of each segment are established using the timoshenko beam theory and the constant coefficients of all segments are evaluated subsequently according to the boundary conditions weaver et al 1990 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 the force and moment excitation at both ends are introduced into the boundary conditions which can be expressed as 1 e 1 i 1 φ 1 0 m i w κ 1 g 1 a 1 φ 1 0 w 1 0 f i w 2 e 3 i 3 φ 3 x 3 m o w κ 3 g 3 a 3 φ 3 x 3 w 3 x 3 f o w where w i x and φ i x denote the mode shape functions of the lateral

struts and the hull structure and the response points on the hull surface given the dynamic model of the shaft hull system the characteristics of power flow in the system and the feasibility of active control can be analyzed 3 analysis of power flow power flow reflects the ability for the interfacial force to do work on the interface and the transmission of vibration energy hambric 1990 xiong et al 2003 zhao et al 2015 which can be expressed as follows 24 p 1 2 re f v 1 2 re f v where f and v denote the interface force and velocity respectively and they are both complex numbers the superscript denotes conjugate and re denotes the real part lateral vibrations of the propulsion shafting system induced by the propeller forces transmit to the hull structure via the active multi strut assembly in this section the power flow at the ends of the active struts is evaluated for the placement of the error transducers and the validation of the active control strategy parameters of the shaft hull system are listed in table 1 suppose the shaft hull system is excited by a vertical force applied at the propeller and the axial acceleration at the end of each strut is taken as the response to be controlled error response the frfs associated with the disturbance and control channels can be initially computed moreover assume that the control forces of the six active struts are given so that the error responses are suppressed by 90 i e the attenuation is 20 db at each frequency then applying the disturbance force and the control forces simultaneously to the system the interfacial force moment and the velocity angular velocity of the connecting points between the active struts and the hull structure can be obtained according to eq 22 and eq 16 given the forces and velocities the power flow at the end of each strut can be calculated the directions of forces moments at the end of the active strut 1 are shown in fig 3 where f l denotes the interfacial force along the axis of the strut f h and f v denote the interfacial forces perpendicular to the axis of the strut m l m h and m v denote the interfacial moments with respect to the three local axes the power flow at the end of strut 1 before control is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the power flow generated by f l is dominant followed by the interfacial force f v and the interfacial moment m h the dominant power flow in the axial direction is attributed to the large axial stiffness rather than the small bending stiffness of each strut the result implies that control in the axial direction of each strut is important to vibration transmission suppression moreover the mode shapes of the shaft hull coupled system corresponding to the resonance frequencies marked in fig 4 are plotted in table 2 it can be seen that most of the mode shapes corresponding to the resonance frequencies are coupled bending modes of the shaft and the hull while the mode shape corresponding to f 10 is mainly a bending mode of the shaft the power flow at the end of strut 1 before and after control are given in fig 5 it can be seen that the power flow is reduced almost in the given frequency range except for the amplification at some frequencies the power flow generated by f l f v and m h is suppressed effectively in the low frequency range however the amplification near 200 hz implies that the control strategy aiming to reduce the axial acceleration cannot prevent power flow completely even though the axial acceleration responses vanish after control the above phenomenon applies to other struts and the results are not given here for the rigid connection the six degrees of freedom of two points are coupled completely therefore controlling the axial acceleration of each strut cannot stop the leakage of energy via other degrees of freedom however to improve the performance of control new control strategies are proposed here in which the error transducers are located evenly at the conical hull and close to the end of the active struts to suppress the normal vibration of the hull structure 4 the feasibility of active control two control strategies are considered and the placement of the error transducers is shown in fig 6 in the control strategy that uses three error transducers fig 6a the struts l1 and l6 operate in parallel so do the struts l2 and l3 l4 and l5 the three groups of struts respond to the three error transducers respectively in the control strategy that uses six error transducers fig 6b the struts l1 l6 respond to the six error transducers respectively the two control strategies of different placement of the error transducers are analyzed in this section to reveal the consistency between the control of error accelerations and the reduction of hull vibration the principle of active control of the shaft hull system with the active multi strut assembly is plotted in fig 7 in the figure only two channels are involved for the sake of simplicity h k a and h k p denote the frfs between the acceleration response of an arbitrary point on the hull and the control forces of the active struts and the disturbance force respectively a a and a k denote the acceleration responses of the error transducers and an arbitrary point on the hull respectively the cross coupling between control channels is considered suppose an ideal multi channel control is applied that is the error responses are suppressed to zero in this circumstance the control forces of the six struts can be given as 25 f a 1 f a 2 f a n i d e a l h a 1 a 1 h a 1 a 2 h a 1 a n h a 2 a 1 h a 2 a 2 h a 2 a n h a n a 1 h a n a 2 h a n a n h a 1 p h a 2 p h a n p f p n 3 o r 6 and the acceleration response of an arbitrary point on the hull surface can be expressed as 26 a k h k p f p j 1 n h k a j f a j j 1 2 n in order to obtain the whole vibration characteristics of the hull structure the boundary element model of the hull structure is built by the software virtual lab as shown in fig 8 which consists of 3960 nodes and 3962 elements with the structural vibration responses of the hull surface is obtained the direct boundary element method is adopted to calculate the mean square velocities of the hull before and after control the unit vertical force 1 n is applied at the propeller and the frfs of the disturbance and control channels are evaluated the representative frfs of the control channels for two control strategies are given in fig 9 i e a the frfs between the acceleration responses of three error transducers a1 a3 and the control force of the struts l1 l6 fa1 and b the frfs between the acceleration responses of six error transducers a1 a6 and the control force of the struts l1 fa1 in fig 9a the driving point response is not dominant within 300 hz and the cross coupling between control channels is strong in fig 9b more modes are involved in the responses and the driving point response is not dominant either and resultingly the cross coupling between control channels are stronger which poses a great challenge to active control algorithms the mean square velocities of the hull surface before and after the ideal control are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the hull vibration can be reduced almost in the entire frequency band except for a few frequencies compared to the control strategy with three error transducers more attenuation can be achieved in the low frequency range for the control strategy with six error transducers but amplification still exists at some frequencies in summary the hull vibration can be reduced by indirectly controlling the responses of the three six error transducers which indicates that the two control strategies are feasible for vibration suppression and superior to the control strategy that controls the axial acceleration of each strut compared with the control strategy using three error transducers the influence of using six error transducers is as follows 1 the cross coupling between control channels becomes stronger and the amount of computation becomes larger the number of involved channels in control increases from 3 3 to 6 6 and the driving point response is not dominant which greatly increase the control effort meanwhile the algorithm needs more computation to deal with the cross coupling 2 six error transducers can perceive high order modes of the system but the control performance is not necessarily superior to the strategy with three error transducers this observation needs to be validated by experiments 5 conclusions an active multi strut assembly is proposed to attenuate vibration transmission from the propulsion shafting system to the hull of an underwater vehicle the struts of the assembly are assumed to be rigidly connected to the stern bearing housing and the hull as a result the power flow at the ends of each strut involves translational and rotational dofs and the transmission of vibration cannot be suppressed by merely controlling the axial vibration of each strut two control strategies that use three six transducers located evenly on the hull are proposed to bypass this difficulty the controllability and the control performance are evaluated numerical results have demonstrated that the transmission of lateral vibration can be suppressed and the hull vibration can be reduced accordingly using six transducers involves stronger coupling and heavier computational burden but can lead to better control performance in the low frequency range credit authorship contribution statement xiling xie methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing original

21111,an active multi strut assembly is used to attenuate vibration transmission from the shaft to the hull of underwater vehicles induced by the propeller forces the active assembly with embedded actuators is inserted between the stern bearing and the hull first the dynamic model of the shaft hull system is developed using the timoshenko beam theory and the frf frequency response function based synthesis method using the dynamic model the characteristics of power flow through the active assembly are analyzed next two control strategies that use three or six error transducers located evenly on the hull to measure vibrations are proposed and the feasibility of control is discussed finally the performance of vibration suppression is analyzed and the two control strategies are compared numerical results have shown that the active assembly is able to suppress the transmission of lateral vibration induced by the propeller forces and accordingly reduce the hull vibration moreover using six error transducers can lead to better control results in the low frequency range compared to using only three error transducers but at the cost of stronger channel coupling and heavier computation burden keywords shaft hull system active multi strut assembly lateral vibration transmission power flow 1 introduction underwater vehicles have attracted extensive attention for their ever increasing ability in exploration and detection however protection of the ocean environment by reducing underwater noise imposes requirements on the acoustic performance of underwater vehicles structural vibration induced by the propulsion system is an important factor to consider in the sound radiation of underwater vehicles caresta and kessissoglou 2010 chen et al 2017 li et al 2017 suppressing the vibration transmission from the propulsion system to the hull structure is an effective measure to reduce vibration and sound radiation and accordingly improves the acoustic performance of underwater vehicles merz et al 2009 su et al 2018 longitudinal vibration of the propulsion shafting system is dominant since its magnitude is about four times that of the lateral vibration however with the development of control measures for the propulsion shafting system the longitudinal vibration has been reduced significantly and hence contributes less to the radiated sound dylejko et al 2007 liu et al 2019 merz et al 2013 pan et al 2008 in this circumstance the influence of the lateral vibration becomes prominent as a result it is necessary to suppress the lateral vibration of the propulsion shafting system in order to reduce the vibration and sound radiation of the hull structure the transmission paths of the lateral vibration are diverse due to the multiple bearings in the shafting system and the complicated transfer characteristics qin et al 2020 xie et al 2019 in addition the fundamental function and shock resistance of the propulsion shafting system must be guaranteed no matter whether the vibration control is adopted therefore constraints and compromises will be inevitable in the lateral vibration control of the propulsion shafting system an accurate dynamic model of the propulsion shafting system is the basis for the investigation of the vibration characteristics of the shaft hull coupled system as well as the analysis and simulation of active control methods at present common modeling methods include analytical semi analytical methods chen et al 2015 qu et al 2013 2019 sun et al 2018 numerical methods huang et al 2017 li et al 2019 merz et al 2007 wang et al 2019 experimental methods leader et al 2013 and their combinations chen et al 2018 2019 note that analytical semi analytical methods are of higher computational efficiency than the numerical methods but they are usually restricted to simple structures meanwhile experimental methods can be inconvenient and time consuming therefore the combinations of analytical and numerical methods are often preferred in design stages the frf based synthesis method can divide the whole system into several subsystems whereby each subsystem can be modeled independently by the most suitable methods i e analytical semi analytical methods numerical methods and or experimental methods the frfs of subsystems can be synthesized to obtain the dynamic model of the whole system on the basis of ensuring computational efficiency and precision the frf based synthesis method is of higher flexibility and adaptability in dealing with large scale complicated systems with multiple elastic bodies there are many studies on active control strategies to control vibration transmission caresta and kessissoglou 2012 sutton et al 1997 wrona et al 2020 yang et al 2020 for active control of vibration and sound radiation of complex structures such as the propeller shafting system and hull of an underwater vehicle the strategy that directly controls the hull vibration with a large number of actuators and transducers is not applicable in most circumstances due to the cost and energy consumption therefore it is preferred to place actuators in the vibration transmission path from the shaft to the hull in this indirect control strategy both the number and the location of error transducers are of great influence on the power flow of vibration even so the consistency between the suppression of the responses of error transducers and the attenuation of the hull vibration should be guaranteed in active vibration control in order to suppress the transmission of lateral vibration in the shaft hull system excited by the propeller forces an active stern support of smooth spherical joints is proposed in xie et al 2020 and accordingly the friction in the spherical joints is neglected in the modeling however in practical applications smooth spherical joints are too hard to realize and can have a significant influence on the lateral vibration transmission in the case of smooth spherical joints lateral vibrations of the shafting system are transmitted to the hull structure mainly along the axis of each strut however if the joints are not smooth or the struts are rigidly connected lateral vibrations will transmit through the translational and rotational motion of the joints of the struts therefore it is necessary to take into account realistic operation conditions in the modeling and analysis of vibration transmission via the active struts in this paper an active multi strut assembly that is rigidly connected to the hull and the stern bearing is investigated the following discussion is organized in four sections in section 2 the dynamic model of the shaft hull system is developed using the frf based synthesis method in section 3 the power flow in the shaft hull system with the involvement of the active struts is analyzed the feasibility of active control and two strategies are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 modeling of the shaft hull system the shaft hull system is presented in fig 1 in this system the active multi strut assembly is proposed to replace the traditional stern bearing support and it is rigidly connected to the stern bearing housing and the annular end plate of the hull structure respectively this is different from that in xie et al 2020 where both ends of the assembly are connected by spherical joints in fig 1 the shaft is supported by three bearings i e the stern bearing the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing which are simplified into five radial springs an axial spring and an axial radial spring respectively the propeller and the flexible coupling are modeled as rigid disks while the shaft is modeled as a multi segment circular timoshenko beam the hull is simplified to a structure composed of conical cylindrical and hemi ellipsoidal shells to which evenly spaced ring stiffeners are attached vibration equations of the shaft hull coupled system are established using the timoshenko beam theory and the frf based synthesis method here the continuity conditions associated with the fixed joints are recast in the establishment of the vibration equations the fixed joints are represented by coupling points on the active struts the stern bearing housing and the hull respectively in the following modeling of the shaft hull system only the equations that are different from those in xie et al 2020 are described in detail 2 1 modeling of the active multi strut assembly for the vibration equation of the active multi strut assembly denoted by the superscript strut in the frequency domain the rotational angle and the moment have to be considered in the boundary conditions of each strut fig 2 is the model of a single active strut which is simplified into a three segment timoshenko beam of circular section and the electromagnetic actuator is represented by a mass spring actuation system f and m denote the force and the moment applied to the end of the strut respectively where the superscripts w and u denote the radial direction and the axial direction the subscripts i and o denote the input and the output respectively m a k a and f a denote the mass the stiffness and the active force of the actuator respectively 2 1 1 lateral vibration of a single strut in the derivation of the lateral vibration equation of the strut the relationships between the constant coefficients of mode shape functions of each segment are established using the timoshenko beam theory and the constant coefficients of all segments are evaluated subsequently according to the boundary conditions weaver et al 1990 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 the force and moment excitation at both ends are introduced into the boundary conditions which can

where ς 1 k w h w w s h a f t k w h w w h o u s i n g i fx ς 2 k m h m m s h a f t k m h m m h u l l i according to eq 22 the relationships between the interfacial force moment at the connecting points and the propeller force the active force can be evaluated as a result the displacements of any points can be obtained by solving eq 16 which include the connecting points between the active struts and the hull structure and the response points on the hull surface given the dynamic model of the shaft hull system the characteristics of power flow in the system and the feasibility of active control can be analyzed 3 analysis of power flow power flow reflects the ability for the interfacial force to do work on the interface and the transmission of vibration energy hambric 1990 xiong et al 2003 zhao et al 2015 which can be expressed as follows 24 p 1 2 re f v 1 2 re f v where f and v denote the interface force and velocity respectively and they are both complex numbers the superscript denotes conjugate and re denotes the real part lateral vibrations of the propulsion shafting system induced by the propeller forces transmit to the hull structure via the active multi strut assembly in this section the power flow at the ends of the active struts is evaluated for the placement of the error transducers and the validation of the active control strategy parameters of the shaft hull system are listed in table 1 suppose the shaft hull system is excited by a vertical force applied at the propeller and the axial acceleration at the end of each strut is taken as the response to be controlled error response the frfs associated with the disturbance and control channels can be initially computed moreover assume that the control forces of the six active struts are given so that the error responses are suppressed by 90 i e the attenuation is 20 db at each frequency then applying the disturbance force and the control forces simultaneously to the system the interfacial force moment and the velocity angular velocity of the connecting points between the active struts and the hull structure can be obtained according to eq 22 and eq 16 given the forces and velocities the power flow at the end of each strut can be calculated the directions of forces moments at the end of the active strut 1 are shown in fig 3 where f l denotes the interfacial force along the axis of the strut f h and f v denote the interfacial forces perpendicular to the axis of the strut m l m h and m v denote the interfacial moments with respect to the three local axes the power flow at the end of strut 1 before control is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the power flow generated by f l is dominant followed by the interfacial force f v and the interfacial moment m h the dominant power flow in the axial direction is attributed to the large axial stiffness rather than the small bending stiffness of each strut the result implies that control in the axial direction of each strut is important to vibration transmission suppression moreover the mode shapes of the shaft hull coupled system corresponding to the resonance frequencies marked in fig 4 are plotted in table 2 it can be seen that most of the mode shapes corresponding to the resonance frequencies are coupled bending modes of the shaft and the hull while the mode shape corresponding to f 10 is mainly a bending mode of the shaft the power flow at the end of strut 1 before and after control are given in fig 5 it can be seen that the power flow is reduced almost in the given frequency range except for the amplification at some frequencies the power flow generated by f l f v and m h is suppressed effectively in the low frequency range however the amplification near 200 hz implies that the control strategy aiming to reduce the axial acceleration cannot prevent power flow completely even though the axial acceleration responses vanish after control the above phenomenon applies to other struts and the results are not given here for the rigid connection the six degrees of freedom of two points are coupled completely therefore controlling the axial acceleration of each strut cannot stop the leakage of energy via other degrees of freedom however to improve the performance of control new control strategies are proposed here in which the error transducers are located evenly at the conical hull and close to the end of the active struts to suppress the normal vibration of the hull structure 4 the feasibility of active control two control strategies are considered and the placement of the error transducers is shown in fig 6 in the control strategy that uses three error transducers fig 6a the struts l1 and l6 operate in parallel so do the struts l2 and l3 l4 and l5 the three groups of struts respond to the three error transducers respectively in the control strategy that uses six error transducers fig 6b the struts l1 l6 respond to the six error transducers respectively the two control strategies of different placement of the error transducers are analyzed in this section to reveal the consistency between the control of error accelerations and the reduction of hull vibration the principle of active control of the shaft hull system with the active multi strut assembly is plotted in fig 7 in the figure only two channels are involved for the sake of simplicity h k a and h k p denote the frfs between the acceleration response of an arbitrary point on the hull and the control forces of the active struts and the disturbance force respectively a a and a k denote the acceleration responses of the error transducers and an arbitrary point on the hull respectively the cross coupling between control channels is considered suppose an ideal multi channel control is applied that is the error responses are suppressed to zero in this circumstance the control forces of the six struts can be given as 25 f a 1 f a 2 f a n i d e a l h a 1 a 1 h a 1 a 2 h a 1 a n h a 2 a 1 h a 2 a 2 h a 2 a n h a n a 1 h a n a 2 h a n a n h a 1 p h a 2 p h a n p f p n 3 o r 6 and the acceleration response of an arbitrary point on the hull surface can be expressed as 26 a k h k p f p j 1 n h k a j f a j j 1 2 n in order to obtain the whole vibration characteristics of the hull structure the boundary element model of the hull structure is built by the software virtual lab as shown in fig 8 which consists of 3960 nodes and 3962 elements with the structural vibration responses of the hull surface is obtained the direct boundary element method is adopted to calculate the mean square velocities of the hull before and after control the unit vertical force 1 n is applied at the propeller and the frfs of the disturbance and control channels are evaluated the representative frfs of the control channels for two control strategies are given in fig 9 i e a the frfs between the acceleration responses of three error transducers a1 a3 and the control force of the struts l1 l6 fa1 and b the frfs between the acceleration responses of six error transducers a1 a6 and the control force of the struts l1 fa1 in fig 9a the driving point response is not dominant within 300 hz and the cross coupling between control channels is strong in fig 9b more modes are involved in the responses and the driving point response is not dominant either and resultingly the cross coupling between control channels are stronger which poses a great challenge to active control algorithms the mean square velocities of the hull surface before and after the ideal control are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the hull vibration can be reduced almost in the entire frequency band except for a few frequencies compared to the control strategy with three error transducers more attenuation can be achieved in the low frequency range for the control strategy with six error transducers but amplification still exists at some frequencies in summary the hull vibration can be reduced by indirectly controlling the responses of the three six error transducers which indicates that the two control strategies are feasible for vibration suppression and superior to the control strategy that controls the axial acceleration of each strut compared with the control strategy using three error transducers the influence of using six error transducers is as follows 1 the cross coupling between control channels becomes stronger and the amount of computation becomes larger the number of involved channels in control increases from 3 3 to 6 6 and the driving point response is not dominant which greatly increase the control effort meanwhile the algorithm needs more computation to deal with the cross coupling 2 six error transducers can perceive high order modes of the system but the control performance is not necessarily superior to the strategy with three error transducers this observation needs to be validated by experiments 5 conclusions an active multi strut assembly is proposed to attenuate vibration transmission from the propulsion shafting system to the hull of an underwater vehicle the struts of the assembly are assumed to be rigidly connected to the stern bearing housing and the hull as a result the power flow at the ends of each strut involves translational and rotational dofs and the transmission of vibration cannot be suppressed by merely controlling the axial vibration of each strut two control strategies that use three six transducers located evenly on the hull are proposed to bypass this difficulty the controllability and the control performance are evaluated numerical results have demonstrated that the transmission of lateral vibration can be suppressed and the hull vibration can be reduced accordingly using six transducers involves stronger coupling and heavier computational burden but can lead to better control performance in the low frequency range credit authorship contribution statement xiling xie methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing original

and the temporal and spatial distribution of the typhoon waves generated by typhoons according to the results of the coupled wrf and swan model a corresponding relationship between typhoon wind speed and wave height was obtained which was combined with the statistical data of typhoon occurring in the scs during 1949 2019 the distribution characteristics of typhoon wave in the scs had been simulated the statistical data grid with a spatial accuracy of 0 5 degree of typhoon waves in the scs had been established and then the statistical wave height of typhoon in the scs based on the

wave model to simulate the wave field generated by typhoon the diagnostic model is very high in the quantity and quality of the measured data however there are few in situ observation positions for the wind field and difficult to get the measured data accurately in ocean it is very difficult to get the accurate measured data and the cost of observation data is expensive if we want to simulate the waves field of a long time series of large domain it is impossible for us to get reasonable wide and long time series wind data by the diagnostic analysis the typhoon wind field by using the empirical model although can simply reflect the characteristic of typhoon wind field but for the wind field structure for complex topography meteorologic condition and other factors and the relative complexity of the underdevelopment of the typhoon there is a big difference between the typhoon wind field by using the empirical model and the actual situation no feedback is considered in uncoupled atmosphere model or wave model liu et al 2011 and some key factors such as air sea interaction are not considered it is difficult to accurately simulate the actual ocean dynamic process under the influence of typhoon when utilized wave model only which leads to the deviation between results of numerical simulation and the real physical process therefore in order to better understand the processes that contribute to typhoon intensity it is necessary to employ a coupled atmosphere wave model which considers various air sea interaction processes chen et al 2007 fan et al 2012 it is an effective way to improve the accuracy and reliability of typhoon wave numerical simulation that the results utilized by mesoscale atmospheric model had provided to the wave model coupled atmosphere

forecasted fields the tropical cyclone information from japan meteorological agency jma substantiated the estimated and observed track intensity and strength of the three typhoons for the typhoon kai

the typhoon rammasun 1409 whereas the simulation period from august 20 2017 to august 24 2017 12 00 utc for the typhoon hato 1713 2 2 wave model the wave model based on the energy balance equation can used to simulate wave in large region and long time series at present by developing and improving the dynamic equation the energy balance equation model has gone through the first generation and the second generation wave model and has developed into a state of the art third generation wave model represented by the swan model in view of the simulation zone of extreme wave in the south china sea region is large in order to reasonably describe the evolution of typhoon wave growth and propagation the third generation wave model swan has be used to simulate the typhoon waves due to the energy balance equation can effectively simulate the large scale wave evolution process swan is a third generation wave model developed by delft university of technology that simulates wind wave generation and propagation in coastal regions rogers et al 2003 liu et al 2015 the selection of wind field is an important factor for the accurate simulation of the typhoon waves based on the swan model in the previous study three categories of wind field are used to provide the swan model the first category is based on the theoretical model or empirical formula such as the myers model holland model and jelesnianski model condon and sheng 2012 yin et al 2016 murty et al 2016 the second is based on reanalysis wind field data such as ncep reanalysis wind field data ching piao et al 2012 arkhipkin et al 2014 era interim dataset neill and hashemi 2013 van vledder and akpinar 2015 qscat ncep blended wind field data muraleedharan et al 2009 yang and zhang 2013 lv et al 2014 and ccmp cross calibrated multi platform wind field zheng and li 2015 the third is based on the mesoscale meteorological model such as the mm5 model and the wrf model etc the wind field data obtained from mesoscale meteorological models have the advantage of high accuracy and can better reflect the characteristics of wind fields which can provide reasonable forced conditions for the simulation of typhoon waves therefore in the numerical study of typhoon waves many scholars utilize the mm5 wrf model and other mesoscale meteorological models to obtain high accuracy wind data and then provide to the forced conditions for the wave model in this paper a mesoscale meteorological model wrf is used to provide wind field for the swan model based on the mct the model coupling toolkit larson et al 2005 a real time two way coupled atmosphere and wave model in the south china sea has been established in this study swan adopted the same horizontal grid as wrf inner domain d02 of approximately 5 km horizontal resolution fig 1 the topography data is from etopo global relief model data and coastline data is from global self consistent hierarchical high resolution shorelines gshhs https www ngdc noaa gov mgg shorelines the wave model uses a time step of 300 s the numbers of directions is 36 which means the angular resolution is 10 the lowest and highest frequencies in swan model are equal to 0 04 hz and 1 hz respectively which means that the time of the simulated waves are between 1 s and 25 s 2 3 simulation procedures usually in the numerical calculation of the typhoon wave the effect of the surface wind field on the wave is generally considered which means that the wind field had been calculated by the atmosphere model and was provided to the wave model this coupled atmosphere wave model is generally called the one way coupled atmosphere and wave model with the further understanding of the air sea dynamic process and interface fluxes many scholars began to consider the forced effect of the atmosphere on the ocean waves and the feedback effect of ocean waves on the atmosphere model this coupled atmosphere wave model is generally referred to as the two way coupled atmosphere and wave model in this study the wrf model and swan model are coupled to each other through the model coupling toolkit mct which was used as the basis for the coawst model warner et al 2010 2012 2014 as well as the coupler for the cawoms by liu et al 2011 a schematic illustration depicting the coupled wrf swan model is given in fig 3 the wrf model provides 10 m surface winds u10 and v10 to the swan model and the swan model provides significant wave height hgt wave length len and wave period per to the wrf model warner et al 2010 the wrf model uses these wave values to compute an enhanced sea surface roughness ssr based on the taylor and yelland 2001 1 z 0 1200 h g t h g t l e n 4 5 0 11 υ u where hgt and len represent the significant wave height and wave length respectively υ is the viscosity and u is the surface stress the coupled wrf swan model is simulated from typhoon kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 into the south china sea the simulation time reflects the process of generation propagation and disappearance of the typhoon waves for the typhoon kai tak the model initialization started from august 15 2012 until august 18 2012 00 00 utc total of 78 h and the model initial conditions covered the period from august 12 2014 until august 20 2014 00 00 utc for the typhoon rammasun total of 192 h whereas the simulation period from august 20 2017 to august 24 2017 12 00 utc for the typhoon hato total of 108 h the outer domain d01 and the inner domain d02 time step in the wrf model is 60 s and 20 s respectively and the time step in the swan model is 300 s in order to facilitate the transmission and exchange of real time data the synchronization time step of the mct coupler should be set as a multiple of the time step of the wrf model and the swan model the time step of the mct is determined to be 600 s in this paper which means that the data of the wrf model and the swan model were exchanged every 600 s to achieve the purpose of real time two way coupling 2 4 cases description typhoon kai tak 1213 was a mild tropical cyclone that affected south china sea it formed in the east of philippines above the latitude of 16 5 n on 06 utc of august 12 2012 this low pressure system got more intensified and moved northwestward with sea level pressure of 985 hpa after 48 h at 06 utc of 16 august the storm cyclones got more intensified and became a typhoon in the scs and then at 17 august it landfall in the southeastern coastal zone of zhanjiang above the latitude of 18 7 n and the longitude of 118 2 e the maximum wind speed near the center of typhoon was 40 m s and the lowest pressure was 970 hpa at 21 utc of 17 august the typhoon kai kai landfall again on the border between china and vietnam then it began to weaken and gradually dissipated on 18 august typhoon kai tak caused heavy rainfall in most parts of southern china causing floods and other disasters and serious losses the typhoon caused heavy damage in china s two provinces killing one person and causing a great economic loss typhoon rammasun 1409 was the record and one of only three category 5 super typhoons in the scs song et al 2010 formed in the northwest pacific having passed through the islands of micronesia the system turned west and quickly moved under the influence of a subtropical ridge str rammasun posed a significant threat to the philippine island and it through philippines into the scs 15th july rammasun continued to move northwest got more intensified and became to a super typhoon and landed in wenchang hainan in august 18 2014 the minimum sea level pressure was 888 hpa the wind speed reached 72 m s when landing breaking the record from typhoon saomai 0608 which is the server strongest typhoon since 1949 in china see fig 4 c from fig 4 c we can see that the typhoon rammasun appeared twice increased dramatically before the crossing of central of philippines and hainan island and had a very serious impact on hainan guangdong and guangxi in china typhoon hato 1713 known in the philippines as tropical storm isang was a strong tropical cyclone that struck the scs in august 2017 hato formed as a tropical depression over the east of luzon on august 19 the system further developed and became a tropical storm the next day on august 21 hato emerged over the northern portion of the south china sea and reached typhoon intensity rapid intensification ensued on august 23 and hato became a category 3 equivalent typhoon before making landfall over jinwan zhuhai in guangdong the storm further weakened over land and dissipated on august 24 3 simulation results the coupled wrf swan model is used to investigate the typhoon wave generated by three typhoon systems kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 the track and intensity strength of these typhoon systems have been simulated due to the results of pressure wind field and wave height field under typhoon kai tak and typhoon hato is similar with these field characteristics generated by typhoon rammasun this study focuses on the simulation and analysis of wave height under the typhoons in the scs we only show the wind field pressure field and the wave height field under the influence of typhoon rammasun in this section 3 1 pressure and wind fields fig 5 shows the sea level pressure and the wind field generated by typhoon rammasun derived from wrf model these results indicate the track of rammasun from august 16 to 19 the results record the wind and pressure fields evolution process of rammasun from philippines into the scs and finally landfall in hainan and guangdong we can see that the wind field increased significantly and maintained the wind speed for more than 30 m s after rammasun moved into the scs from fig 5 along the coastline of hainan the intensity of the typhoon continues to increase the wind speed increased and the central pressure reduced the wind speed near the center is more than 60 m s it was then quickly landfall on guangdong and still maintained high wind speed causing serious losses to hainan and guangdong from the spatial distribution of the wind speed and sea level pressure the wind speed on the right side of the typhoon track is obviously larger than the wind speed on the left side and the wind speed on the right is about 1 5 times 2 times that of the left wind speed that is to say there is a very obvious asymmetrical distribution of wind field generated by typhoon rammasun in the space because the cyclone in the process of movement by the impact caused by the coriolis force 3 2 comparison of simulation and observation the simulated wave heights are compared with observations from a buoy near the coast fig 4 a and satellite altimeter jason 2 in fig 6 the wave height near the observation station calculated by the coupled wrf swan model is compared with the observation in fig 6 a it shows no obvious differences among the simulations compared with observations the data of satellite altimeter published by aviso https www aviso altimetry fr en data html is used to verify the accuracy of the results of the coupled wrf swan model in this paper during the impact of typhoon rammasun on the scs the jason 2 satellite passed through the scs and recorded data the results obtained from the simulation results are compared with the results of the jason 2 satellite altimeter in fig 6 b it can be seen from fig 6 b that the results obtained from the simulation are in good agreement with the results of the jason 2 altimeter that is to say the results of the numerical simulation are compared with the results of the field observation and the satellite altimeter of jason 2 the verification results show that the coupled wrf swan model has a high accuracy in the simulation of extreme waves under the influence of typhoon rammasun in the scs 3 3 wave results one of the direct consequences of typhoon rammasun blowing over the scs is the energy or momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the sea which generates typhoon waves fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of significant wave heights in the coupled wrf swan model during the typhoon rammasun it can be seen from the diagram that an obvious wave field has been generated in the scs under the influence of the typhoon rammasun we can see that at 00 utc of july 17 2014 typhoon wave generated by rammasun began to increase significantly from fig 7 c which entered the scs through the philippines with the movement and development of the typhoon rammasun typhoon wave height increases gradually and there is zone of a diameter of over 400 km height greater than 8 m in the northern of scs the maximum wave height of the typhoon center reaches more than 10 m when the typhoon rammasun landfall in hainan and guangdong the maximum wave height of the typhoon wave remained at about 10 m it can be seen that the wave height on the right side of the center of typhoon track is larger than the left side wave height in fig 7 that is to say the spatial distribution of typhoon wave also shows the asymmetry distribution characteristic there are two main reasons for this phenomenon on the one hand it is the asymmetry characteristic of the typhoon wind field itself we can see in section 3 1 because of the tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere under the influence of the coriolis force the typhoon itself has the characteristics that the strength of the right of typhoon track is greater than the left the typhoon waves also have asymmetric spatial distribution on the other hand due to the wave at the right front of the typhoon center can continue to gain energy from the typhoon wind field resulting in the wave height increasing while the typhoon wave located at the left rear of the typhoon center cannot obtain continuous energy therefore the wave height on the left side of the typhoon track is smaller than the right wave height 4 discussions the scs is one of the most seriously affected regions of the world by typhoon hazards the corresponding relationship between wave height and wind speed has been established based on the results of simulation from the coupled wrf swan model in this section the statistical data of typhoon duration in the scs from 1949 to 2019 were obtained a statistical data grid with a spatial accuracy of 0 5 degree of typhoon waves in the scs had been established based on the relationship between wave height and wind speed and the statistical data of long term typhoon an attempt is made to calculate the typhoon wave of statistical frequency in some specially designated positions 4 1 relationship between wave height and wind speed based on the results of the coupled wrf swan model the relationship between the wave height and wind speed in different times of different three typhoons is analyzed fig 8 gives the corresponding relationship between wave height and typhoon wind speed generated by typhoon rammasun in the scs at the time is 24th hour 48th hour 72nd hour 96th hour 120th hour and 144th hour respectively fig 9 shows the corresponding relationships between wave height and wind speed in different locations of the scs during the typhoon kai tak rammasun and hato by linear fitting the relationships between wave height and wind speed is obtained as following formulas 2 4 2 y 0 27295x 0 40279 r2 0 85252 for kai tak 3 y 0 27162x 0 69388 r2 0 83473 for rammasun 4 y 0 24581x 0 50544 r2 0 78293 for hato it can see from the fig 9 the time of maximum wave height generated by the three different typhoon kai tak rammasun and hato was 48th hour 144th hour and 60th hour respectively at the generation stage of typhoon for the typhoon kai tak fig 9 a when the time is at 12th hour the statistical wave height below the fitting line which indicates that although the wind speed is relatively large at this time but the typhoon wave height is small and correspondingly at the decay stage of typhoon action the statistical wave height at this time appears above of the fitting line which indicates that although the wind speed is relatively small but the wave height is comparatively large the results of simulation of the wave height and wind speed generated by the three different typhoons are summed up and the data are fitted to get the relationship between the ware height and wind speed as the following formula 5 y 0 24557x 0 53043 r2 0 77730 from the above analysis it can be seen that the wave height generated by typhoon also affected by wind distance and wind time in addition to wind speed but from the total fitting results the fitting correlation coefficient r2 is 0 7773 which indicates that the fitting result can be used to analysis to the wave height generated by other typhoon systems 4 2 characteristic of tropical cyclones in the scs a low depression system in the tropical oceans called tropical cyclone tc the tracks of all tropical cyclones in the near china sea ncs from 1949 to 2019 are given in fig 10 according to the typhoon information provided by the tropical cyclone data center of the china meteorological administration typhoon online http www typhoon org cn it can be seen from the fig 10 that the tropical cyclones in the ncs is mostly produced in the sea area of 5 n 25 n and 110 e 170 e fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of tropical cyclones the intensity reached to the severe typhoon category the wind speed greater than 43 5 m s in the scs for the last 71 years from 1949 to 2019 it can be seen from the figure that the spatial distribution of severe typhoons in the scs mainly occurred in the north central region of the scs the black dashed line to the north in fig 11 which is 12 n 20 n 112 e 120 e 4 3 calculation of typhoon wave by a statistical method in order to calculate the statistical distribution of wave height generated by tropical cyclones in the scs a total of 71 years of statistical data of tropical cyclones from 1949 to 2019 were obtained and statistically analyzed fig 12 gives the spatial distribution and intensity distribution of all tropical cyclones in the scs over the last 71 years the relationship between wind speed and wave height generated by the three different typhoons based on the coupled wrf and swan model is obtained in formula 5 with statistical data of tropical cyclones in the scs from 1949 to 2019 the relationship between the wave height and the wind speed under the influence of tropical cyclones in the scs is established and then attempt to get the wave height distribution of tropical cyclones in the scs in order to count up the number of one selected position and calculate the distribution of typhoon wave height in this selected position a statistical grid of typhoon wave height in the scs is set up as shown in fig 13 it 0 5 degrees of spatial accuracy in this study we use the average value in the range of 0 5 0 5 as a unit to evaluate the local wave height that is to say when the typhoon wave height in one characteristic position is calculated the position of the four corners of the world around the direction of typhoon data within the range of 0 5 was selected as the representative data the statistical value of typhoon wave height in any position in the scs can be calculated in this paper the statistical analysis of typhoon wave height with eight characteristic positions is carried out and the selected position is given in fig 13 position a in the southern sea of taiwan position b is the southern pearl river estuary position c is luzon strait position d is the beibuwan gulf position e f and g is paracel islands spratly islands and dongsha islands respectively position h represents for the midriff of the scs in order to calculate the typhoon wave height of a certain characteristic frequency all the typhoon waves that occur at this selected position are statistically analyzed according to the statistical speed of the typhoon in the region the corresponding wave height of each wind speed are calculated and the statistical sequence of the typhoon wave height in this region is formed the n statistical typhoon wave height are sequentially ordered and the cumulative probability of typhoon waves in the order of m is as follows 6 f h m m n 1 100 cumulative frequency curves are required for the cumulative frequency of typhoon wave height in the calculation platform in extreme wave analysis the commonly used subpackage functions include the gumble distribution the weibull distribution the log normal distribution and the pearson type iii distribution isaacson and mackenzie 1981 hennemuth et al 2013 in this paper the pearson type iii distribution is used to calculate the statistical frequency of typhoon wave height and the probability density function is as follows 7 f h β γ α h α 0 α 1 e β h α 0 8 α 4 c s 2 β 2 h c v c s α 0 h 1 2 c v c s there c v is a discrete coefficient and c s is a partial coefficient and usually the c s is a multiple of c v and calculated by the following formula 9 c v i 1 n h i h 2 n 1 h 2 i 1 n k i 1 2 n 1 c s i 1 n k i 1 3 n 3 c v 3 there k i h i h is the modulus ratio the value distribution function of the excess value is 10 p h h i h i f h d h the pearson type iii distribution of typhoon wave height of the eight different selected positions in the scs are given in fig 14 as can be seen from the figure the fitting results of pearson type iii curve are in good agreement what needs to be explained is that the curve in fig 14 c in the cumulative frequency of less than 99 when it appeared less than zero meter of wave height this is due to the frequency of typhoon wave occurred by typhoon near the luzon strait is very high near spratly islands the pearson type iii curve is close to linear relation in the fig 14 f because the frequency of the extreme waves near the spratly islands occurred by typhoon is low and the statistical data is less it can be seen from fig 14 the highest frequency and the hugest height of typhoon wave is near the luzon strait the average of typhoon wave height is reached 9 2 m the second is southern taiwan position a in the eight different selected positions and the statistical average value of typhoon wave height is close to 8 0 m comparison of the paracel islands spratly islands and dongsha islands the smallest statistical value of the typhoon wave height is the waves in spratly islands with a mean value of 3 0 m and the statistical mean value of typhoon wave height near the paracel islands and dongsha islands are about 6 0 m table 2 shows the typhoon wave height in different statistical frequency in the southern taiwan position a based on the data of tropical cyclones from 1949 to 2019 it can be seen from table 2 that the corresponding typhoon wave height are 6 85 m 8 03 m when the cumulative frequency is from 40 to 50 in the southern taiwan on the other hand there are about two to three typhoons have entered the scs through this location on an average which means that the annual typhoon wave height in this region can reach above 7 0 m table 3 shows the distribution of typhoon wave height in different statistical frequency of the eight selected positions which we can see the corresponding wave height in the different accumulative frequencies of the eight selected positions because the frequency of extreme wave by tropical cyclones near the luzon strait position c is very high the existing in above typhoon wave height was negative when the statistical frequency greater than 99 so there is some missing values in table 3 based on the statistical results combined with the frequency of typhoon in the region the distribution of typhoon wave height can be calculated at any location in the scs and it can be provide to some references for the design of the coastal and ocean engineering 5 conclusion the coupled atmosphere wave model is established in the south china sea based on the mesoscale meteorological model wrf and the third generation wave model swan the air sea interaction have been considered in the coupled model the wrf model provides high resolution wind field data to the swan model and swan model transforms the calculated wave height wavelength and wave period to the wrf model so as to achieve real time two way coupled atmospheric wave model the coupled wrf swan model is applied to the numerical simulation of the extreme waves generated by the typhoon kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 respectively the two way nested domain is used to simulate several typhoons in this study the outer domain has a grid resolution of 15 km and the inner domain of 5 km resolution along the east west and north south directions respectively with 35 vertical levels for each domain the time step of outer domain and inner domain is 60 s and 20 s respectively the calculation domain of the swan model is the same as the inner domain of the wrf model and the time step is 300 s the number of directions is 36 which means the angular resolution is 10 the lowest and highest frequencies in swan model are equal to 0 04 hz and 1 hz respectively the time step of the mct is determined to be 600 s in this paper the results of wind field pressure and typhoon wave generated by the typhoon kai tak rammasun and hato have been simulated based on the coupled wrf swan model respectively the results of the numerical simulation are compared with the results of the field observation and the satellite altimeter the verification results show that the coupled wrf swan model shows high accuracy in the simulation of typhoon wave in the scs from the spatial distribution of the wind speed sea level pressure and wave height we can find that the distribution of typhoon wind field and wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is obviously larger than the left side there are two main reasons for this phenomenon on the one hand it is the asymmetry characteristic of the typhoon wind field itself affected by the coriolis force on the other hand due to the wave at the right front of the typhoon center can continue to gain energy from the typhoon wind field resulting in the wave height increasing therefore the wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than the left the relationship between the wind speed and the wave height generated by typhoons is obtained based on the results of the simulation form the coupled wrf swan model total of 71 years of statistical data of tropical cyclones from 1949 to 2019 were obtained and statistically analyzed according to the relationship between wind speed and wave height combined with the statistical data of tropical cyclones in the scs a statistical data grid of typhoon waves in the scs with accuracy of 0 5 is established the pearson type iii distribution is utilized to calculate the statistical frequency of extreme wave height generated by typhoons in the scs eight characteristic locations have been identified in the scs the highest frequency and the hugest height of typhoon wave is near the luzon strait the average of typhoon wave height is reached 9 2 m the second is southern taiwan in the eight different selected positions and the statistical average value of typhoon wave height is close to 8 0 m comparison of the paracel islands spratly islands and dongsha islands the smallest statistical value of the typhoon wave height is the waves in spratly islands with a mean value of 3 0 m and the statistical mean value of typhoon wave height near the paracel islands and dongsha islands are about 6 0 m based on the statistical results combined with the frequency of typhoon in the region the distribution of typhoon wave height can be calculated at any location in the scs and

the field observation and the satellite altimeter the verification results show that the coupled wrf swan model has a high accuracy in the simulation of typhoon waves under the influence of typhoons in the scs the results of the simulation reveal the asymmetrical distribution of wind speed and typhoon wave height generated by typhoons in the space the intensity of the typhoon on the right is greater than that on the left of the typhoon track the real time two way coupled atmosphere wave model based on the wrf model and the swan model can accurately simulate the dynamic process of typhoon and the temporal and spatial distribution of the typhoon waves generated by typhoons according to the results of the coupled wrf and swan model a corresponding relationship between typhoon wind speed and wave height was obtained which was combined with the statistical data of typhoon occurring in the scs during 1949 2019 the distribution characteristics of typhoon wave in the scs had been simulated the statistical data grid with a spatial accuracy of 0 5 degree of typhoon waves in the scs had been established and then the statistical wave height of typhoon in the scs based on the

impact of typhoon waves is almost all over the coastal areas of china typhoon waves may cause serious damage to coastal buildings such as ports seawall and other coastal engineering ou et al 2002 tsai et al 2006 mase et al 2013 wu et al 2019b c causing huge threat to the safety of life and property it is of great scientific significance and social value to study the simulation of extreme waves under the influence of typhoons chen et al 2012 sandhya et al 2014 mori and takemi 2016 chen and yu 2017 2018 marine environmental prediction mainly aims at solving the prediction problems of extreme weather such as typhoons and so on chen et al 2019 mori et al 2014 g wu et al 2018 r wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 ma et al 2019 however due to the relative lack of marine data the research on such problems is mainly based on numerical simulation in recent years the third generation wave model swan has been widely applied to the study of numerical simulation of typhoon waves based on the swan model hsu et al 2005 mori et al 2010 huang et al 2013 coastal vulnerability due to extreme waves based on historical tropical cyclones in the bay of bengal have been carried out by the swan model nayak and bhaskaran 2014 the swan model and buoy observations were used to investigate the response of surface wave fields to tropical cyclone wind forcing on the australian by drost et al 2017 coupled adcirc and swan models were used to investigate the effects of typhoon intensification on storm surges and waves in pearl river estuary china yin et al 2017 blended wind fields of era interim dataset and holland model for simulation of extreme waves generated by 29 tropical cyclones in the scs and ecs shao et al 2018 most of the above studies use the diagnostic model rogers et al 2003 akpınar et al 2012 2013 rusu and onea 2013 or theoretical and empirical models ou et al 2002 bhaskaran et al 2013 shao et al 2018 to obtain wind field and pressure field of typhoon and provide to the wave model to simulate the wave field generated by typhoon the diagnostic model is very high in the quantity and quality of the measured data however there are few in situ observation positions for the wind field and difficult to get the measured data accurately in ocean it is very difficult to get the accurate measured data and the cost of observation data is expensive if we want to simulate the waves field of a long time series of large domain it is impossible for us to get reasonable wide and long time series wind data by the diagnostic analysis the typhoon wind field by using the empirical model although can simply reflect the characteristic of typhoon wind field but for the wind field structure for complex topography meteorologic condition and other factors and the relative complexity of the underdevelopment of the typhoon there is a big difference between the typhoon wind field by using the empirical model and the actual situation no feedback is considered in uncoupled atmosphere model or wave model liu et al 2011 and some key factors such as air sea interaction are not considered it is difficult to accurately simulate the actual ocean dynamic process under the influence of typhoon when utilized wave model only which leads to the deviation between results of numerical simulation and the real physical process therefore in order to better understand the processes that contribute to typhoon intensity it is necessary to employ a coupled atmosphere wave model which considers various air sea interaction processes chen et al 2007 fan et al 2012 it is an effective way to improve the accuracy and reliability of typhoon wave numerical simulation that the results utilized by mesoscale atmospheric model had provided to the wave model coupled atmosphere ocean wave model had been established by the wrf roms swan warner et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 zambon et al 2014 and wrf pom swan liu et al 2011 respectively blended wind fields of holland model and atmospheric model wrams with data assimilation were used to drive wave hindcasts using coupled delft3d swan hydrodynamic bennett and mulligan 2017 the results of these coupled studies show that it has obvious effect on improving the accuracy of the numerical prediction by the coupled atmosphere wave model a real time two way coupled atmosphere wave model in the south china sea scs has been established based on the mesoscale atmosphere model wrf and the third generation wave model swan in this paper numerical studies on the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the typhoon wave are carried out 2 numerical method and cases description the present study utilizes a suite of state of the art atmosphere and wave models we implement a nested computational grid along the scs in the swan model and utilize the wrf model to provide high resolution mesoscale wind field and pressure field over the scs under the influence of typhoons 2 1 atmosphere model the weather research

by the ncar and ncep the wrf arw advanced research wrf version 3 9 1 is used to simulate the high resolution field data of typhoon kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 in this study the wrf arw is a fully compressible non hydrostatic mesoscale model lakshmi et al 2017 which uses terrain following hybrid sigma pressure vertical coordinates and staggered arakawa c grid laprise 1992 several options need to be determined for the numerical simulation of typhoon in the wrf model such as horizontal and vertical grid resolution nesting and lateral boundary conditions the micro physics cloudy convective physics boundary layer long and short wave radiation components in order to accurate simulate these typhoons tracks dynamic process and obtain high resolution field data of wind and pressure provided to the swan model a two way interactive nested domain is used to simulate several typhoons in this study fig 1 the outer domain d01 has a grid resolution of 15 km 216 226 no of grids the inner domain of 5 km resolution 535 286 no of grids along the east west and north south directions respectively with 35 vertical levels for each domain the case study of kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 used the single moment 6 class microphysics wsm6 scheme for micro physical processes hong and lim 2006 the kain fritsch kf eta kain 2004 scheme for cumulus convection the yonsei university ysu hong et al 2006 scheme for pbl processes rapid radiation transfer model rrtm for long wave radiation mlawer et al 1997 and dudhia 1989 scheme for shortwave parameters the table 1 provides major configuration and schemes in the wrf model for typhoons in the present study the wrf model with the above mentioned configuration and schemes shown in table 1 simulated the field data of typhoon kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 with two way nested domains the specification of topography for the study region at 5 arcmin and 2 arcmin resolutions respectively for the two domains the topography data is from etopo global relief model data fig 2 https www ngdc noaa gov mgg global the initial and boundary conditions of the wrf model used the fnl reanalysis data provided by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep which has a spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 along the lateral boundary time varying conditions are derived at every 6 h from fnl 1 0 1 0 forecasted fields the tropical cyclone information from japan meteorological agency jma substantiated the estimated and observed track intensity and strength of the three typhoons for the typhoon kai tak 1213 the model initialization started from august 15 2012 until august 18 2012 00 00 utc and the model initial conditions covered the period from august 12 2014 until august 20 2014 00 00 utc for the typhoon rammasun 1409 whereas the simulation period from august 20 2017 to august 24 2017 12 00 utc for the typhoon hato 1713 2 2 wave model the wave model based on the energy balance equation can used to simulate wave in large region and long time series at present by developing and improving the dynamic equation the energy balance equation model has gone through the first generation and the second generation wave model and has developed into a state of the art third generation wave model represented by the swan model in view of the simulation zone of extreme wave in the south china sea region is large in order to reasonably describe the evolution of typhoon wave growth and propagation the third generation wave model swan has be used to simulate the typhoon waves due to the energy balance equation can effectively simulate the large scale wave evolution process swan is a third generation wave model developed by delft university of technology that simulates wind wave generation and propagation in coastal regions rogers et al 2003 liu et al 2015 the selection of wind field is an important factor for the accurate simulation of the typhoon waves based on the swan model in the previous study three categories of wind field are used to provide the swan model the first category is based on the theoretical model or empirical formula such as the myers model holland model and jelesnianski model condon and sheng 2012 yin et al 2016 murty et al 2016 the second is based on reanalysis wind field data such as ncep reanalysis wind field data ching piao et al 2012 arkhipkin et al 2014 era interim dataset neill and hashemi 2013 van vledder and akpinar 2015 qscat ncep blended wind field data muraleedharan et al 2009 yang and zhang 2013 lv et al 2014 and ccmp cross calibrated multi platform wind field zheng and li 2015 the third is based on the mesoscale meteorological model such as the mm5 model and the wrf model etc the wind field data obtained from mesoscale meteorological models have the advantage of high accuracy and can better reflect the characteristics of wind fields which can provide reasonable forced conditions for the simulation of typhoon waves therefore in the numerical study of typhoon waves many scholars utilize the mm5 wrf model and other mesoscale meteorological models to obtain high accuracy wind data and then provide to the forced conditions for the wave model in this paper a mesoscale meteorological model wrf is used to provide wind field for the swan model based on the mct the model coupling toolkit larson et al 2005 a real time two way coupled atmosphere and wave model in the south china sea has been established in this study swan adopted the same horizontal grid as wrf inner domain d02 of approximately 5 km horizontal resolution fig 1 the topography data is from etopo global relief model data and coastline data is from global self consistent hierarchical high resolution shorelines gshhs https www ngdc noaa gov mgg shorelines the wave model uses a time step of 300 s the numbers of directions is 36 which means the angular resolution is 10 the lowest and highest frequencies in swan model are equal to 0 04 hz and 1 hz respectively which means that the time of the simulated waves are between 1 s and 25 s 2 3 simulation procedures usually in the numerical calculation of the typhoon wave the effect of the surface wind field on the wave is generally considered which means that the wind field had been calculated by the atmosphere model and was provided to the wave model this coupled atmosphere wave model is generally called the one way coupled atmosphere and wave model with the further understanding of the air sea dynamic process and interface fluxes many scholars began to consider the forced effect of the atmosphere on the ocean waves and the feedback effect of ocean waves on the atmosphere model this coupled atmosphere wave model is generally referred to as the two way coupled atmosphere and wave model in this study the wrf model and swan model are coupled to each other through the model coupling toolkit mct which was used as the basis for the coawst model warner et al 2010 2012 2014 as well as the coupler for the cawoms by liu et al 2011 a schematic illustration depicting the coupled wrf swan model is given in fig 3 the wrf model provides 10 m surface winds u10 and v10 to the swan model and the swan model provides significant wave height hgt wave length len and wave period per to the wrf model warner et al 2010 the wrf model uses these wave values to compute an enhanced sea surface roughness ssr based on the taylor and yelland 2001 1 z 0 1200 h g t h g t l e n 4 5 0 11 υ u where hgt and len represent the significant wave height and wave length respectively υ is the viscosity and u is the surface stress the coupled wrf swan model is simulated from typhoon kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 into the south china sea the simulation time reflects the process of generation propagation and disappearance of the typhoon waves for the typhoon kai tak the model initialization started from august 15 2012 until august 18 2012 00 00 utc total of 78 h and the model initial conditions covered the period from august 12 2014 until august 20 2014 00 00 utc for the typhoon rammasun total of 192 h whereas the simulation period from august 20 2017 to august 24 2017 12 00 utc for the typhoon hato total of 108 h the outer domain d01 and the inner domain d02 time step in the wrf model is 60 s and 20 s respectively and the time step in the swan model is 300 s in order to facilitate the transmission and exchange of real time data the synchronization time step of the mct coupler should be set as a multiple of the time step of the wrf model and the swan model the time step of the mct is determined to be 600 s in this paper which means that the data of the wrf model and the swan model were exchanged every 600 s to achieve the purpose of real time two way coupling 2 4 cases description typhoon kai tak 1213 was a mild tropical cyclone that affected south china sea it formed in the east of philippines above the latitude of 16 5 n on 06 utc of august 12 2012 this low pressure system got more intensified and moved northwestward with sea level pressure of 985 hpa after 48 h at 06 utc of 16 august the storm cyclones got more intensified and became a typhoon in the scs and then at 17 august it landfall in the southeastern coastal zone of zhanjiang above the latitude of 18 7 n and the longitude of 118 2 e the maximum wind speed near the center of typhoon was 40 m s and the lowest pressure was 970 hpa at 21 utc of 17 august the typhoon kai kai landfall again on the border between china and vietnam then it began to weaken and gradually dissipated on 18 august typhoon kai tak caused heavy rainfall in most parts of southern china causing floods and other disasters and serious losses the typhoon caused heavy damage in china s two provinces killing one person and causing a great economic loss typhoon rammasun 1409 was the record and one of only three category 5 super typhoons in the scs song et al 2010 formed in the northwest pacific having passed through the islands of micronesia the system turned west and quickly moved under the influence of a subtropical ridge str rammasun posed a significant threat to the philippine island and it through philippines into the scs 15th july rammasun continued to move northwest got more intensified and became to a super typhoon and landed in wenchang hainan in august 18 2014 the minimum sea level pressure was 888 hpa the wind speed reached 72 m s when landing breaking the record from typhoon saomai 0608 which is the server strongest typhoon since 1949 in china see fig 4 c from fig 4 c we can see that the typhoon rammasun appeared twice increased dramatically before the crossing of central of philippines and hainan island and had a very serious impact on hainan guangdong and guangxi in china typhoon hato 1713 known in the philippines as tropical storm isang was a strong tropical cyclone that struck the scs in august 2017 hato formed as a tropical depression over the east of luzon on august 19 the system further developed and became a tropical storm the next day on august 21 hato emerged over the northern portion of the south china sea and reached typhoon intensity rapid intensification ensued on august 23 and hato became a category 3 equivalent typhoon before making landfall over jinwan zhuhai in guangdong the storm further weakened over land and dissipated on august 24 3 simulation results the coupled wrf swan model is used to investigate the typhoon wave generated by three typhoon systems kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 the track and intensity strength of these typhoon systems have been simulated due to the results of pressure wind field and wave height field under typhoon kai tak and typhoon hato is similar with these field characteristics generated by typhoon rammasun this study focuses on the simulation and analysis of wave height under the typhoons in the scs we only show the wind field pressure field and the wave height field under the influence of typhoon rammasun in this section 3 1 pressure and wind fields fig 5 shows the sea level pressure and the wind field generated by typhoon rammasun derived from wrf model these results indicate the track of rammasun from august 16 to 19 the results record the wind and pressure fields evolution process of rammasun from philippines into the scs and finally landfall in hainan and guangdong we can see that the wind field increased significantly and maintained the wind speed for more than 30 m s after rammasun moved into the scs from fig 5 along the coastline of hainan the intensity of the typhoon continues to increase the wind speed increased and the central pressure reduced the wind speed near the center is more than 60 m s it was then quickly landfall on guangdong and still maintained high wind speed causing serious losses to hainan and guangdong from the spatial distribution of the wind speed and sea level pressure the wind speed on the right side of the typhoon track is obviously larger than the wind speed on the left side and the wind speed on the right is about 1 5 times 2 times that of the left wind speed that is to say there is a very obvious asymmetrical distribution of wind field generated by typhoon rammasun in the space because the cyclone in the process of movement by the impact caused by the coriolis force 3 2 comparison of simulation and observation the simulated wave heights are compared with observations from a buoy near the coast fig 4 a and satellite altimeter jason 2 in fig 6 the wave height near the observation station calculated by the coupled wrf swan model is compared with the observation in fig 6 a it shows no obvious differences among the simulations compared with observations the data of satellite altimeter published by aviso https www aviso altimetry fr en data html is used to verify the accuracy of the results of the coupled wrf swan model in this paper during the impact of typhoon rammasun on the scs the jason 2 satellite passed through the scs and recorded data the results obtained from the simulation results are compared with the results of the jason 2 satellite altimeter in fig 6 b it can be seen from fig 6 b that the results obtained from the simulation are in good agreement with the results of the jason 2 altimeter that is to say the results of the numerical simulation are compared with the results of the field observation and the satellite altimeter of jason 2 the verification results show that the coupled wrf swan model has a high accuracy in the simulation of extreme waves under the influence of typhoon rammasun in the scs 3 3 wave results one of the direct consequences of typhoon rammasun blowing over the scs is the energy or momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the sea which generates typhoon waves fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of significant wave heights in the coupled wrf swan model during the typhoon rammasun it can be seen from the diagram that an obvious wave field has been generated in the scs under the influence of the typhoon rammasun we can see that at 00 utc of july 17 2014 typhoon wave generated by rammasun began to increase significantly from fig 7 c which entered the scs through the philippines with the movement and development of the typhoon rammasun typhoon wave height increases gradually and there is zone of a diameter of over 400 km height greater than 8 m in the northern of scs the maximum wave height of the typhoon center reaches more than 10 m when the typhoon rammasun landfall in hainan and guangdong the maximum wave height of the typhoon wave remained at about 10 m it can be seen that the wave height on the right side of the center of typhoon track is larger than the left side wave height in fig 7 that is to say the spatial distribution of typhoon wave also shows the asymmetry distribution characteristic there are two main reasons for this phenomenon on the one hand it is the asymmetry characteristic of the typhoon wind field itself we can see in section 3 1 because of the tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere under the influence of the coriolis force the typhoon itself has the characteristics that the strength of the right of typhoon track is greater than the left the typhoon waves also have asymmetric spatial distribution on the other hand due to the wave at the right front of the typhoon center can continue to gain energy from the typhoon wind field resulting in the wave height increasing while the typhoon wave located at the left rear of the typhoon center cannot obtain continuous energy therefore the wave height on the left side of the typhoon track is smaller than the right wave height 4 discussions the scs is one of the most seriously affected regions of the world by typhoon hazards the corresponding relationship between wave height and wind speed has been established based on the results of simulation from the coupled wrf swan model in this section the statistical data of typhoon duration in the scs from 1949 to 2019 were obtained a statistical data grid with a spatial accuracy of 0 5 degree of typhoon waves in the scs had been established based on the relationship between wave height and wind speed and the statistical data of long term typhoon an attempt is made to calculate the typhoon wave of statistical frequency in some specially designated positions 4 1 relationship between wave height and wind speed based on the results of the coupled wrf swan model the relationship between the wave height and wind speed in different times of different three typhoons is analyzed fig 8 gives the corresponding relationship between wave height and typhoon wind speed generated by typhoon rammasun in the scs at the time is 24th hour 48th hour 72nd hour 96th hour 120th hour and 144th hour respectively fig 9 shows the corresponding relationships between wave height and wind speed in different locations of the scs during the typhoon kai tak rammasun and hato by linear fitting the relationships between wave height and wind speed is obtained as following formulas 2 4 2 y 0 27295x 0 40279 r2 0 85252 for kai tak 3 y 0 27162x 0 69388 r2 0 83473 for rammasun 4 y 0 24581x 0 50544 r2 0 78293 for hato it can see from the fig 9 the time of maximum wave height generated by the three different typhoon kai tak rammasun and hato was 48th hour 144th hour and 60th hour respectively at the generation stage of typhoon for the typhoon kai tak fig 9 a when the time is at 12th hour the statistical wave height below the fitting line which indicates that although the wind speed is relatively large at this time but the typhoon wave height is small and correspondingly at the decay stage of typhoon action the statistical wave height at this time appears above of the fitting line which indicates that although the wind speed is relatively small but the wave height is comparatively large the results of simulation of the wave height and wind speed generated by the three different typhoons are summed up and the data are fitted to get the relationship between the ware height and wind speed as the following formula 5 y 0 24557x 0 53043 r2 0 77730 from the above analysis it can be seen that the wave height generated by typhoon also affected by wind distance and wind time in addition to wind speed but from the total fitting results the fitting correlation coefficient r2 is 0 7773 which indicates that the fitting result can be used to analysis to the wave height generated by other typhoon systems 4 2 characteristic of tropical cyclones in the scs a low depression system in the tropical oceans called tropical cyclone tc the tracks of all tropical cyclones in the near china sea ncs from 1949 to 2019 are given in fig 10 according to the typhoon information provided by the tropical cyclone data center of the china meteorological administration typhoon online http www typhoon org cn it can be seen from the fig 10 that the tropical cyclones in the ncs is mostly produced in the sea area of 5 n 25 n and 110 e 170 e fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of tropical cyclones the intensity reached to the severe typhoon category the wind speed greater than 43 5 m s in the scs for the last 71 years from 1949 to 2019 it can be seen from the figure that the spatial distribution of severe typhoons in the scs mainly occurred in the north central region of the scs the black dashed line to the north in fig 11 which is 12 n 20 n 112 e 120 e 4 3 calculation of typhoon wave by a statistical method in order to calculate the statistical distribution of wave height generated by tropical cyclones in the scs a total of 71 years of statistical data of tropical cyclones from 1949 to 2019 were obtained and statistically analyzed fig 12 gives the spatial distribution and intensity distribution of all tropical cyclones in the scs over the last 71 years the relationship between wind speed and wave height generated by the three different typhoons based on the coupled wrf and swan model is obtained in formula 5 with statistical data of tropical cyclones in the scs from 1949 to 2019 the relationship between the wave height and the wind speed under the influence of tropical cyclones in the scs is established and then attempt to get the wave height distribution of tropical cyclones in the scs in order to count up the number of one selected position and calculate the distribution of typhoon wave height in this selected position a statistical grid of typhoon wave height in the scs is set up as shown in fig 13 it 0 5 degrees of spatial accuracy in this study we use the average value in the range of 0 5 0 5 as a unit to evaluate the local wave height that is to say when the typhoon wave height in one characteristic position is calculated the position of the four corners of the world around the direction of typhoon data within the range of 0 5 was selected as the representative data the statistical value of typhoon wave height in any position in the scs can be calculated in this paper the statistical analysis of typhoon wave height with eight characteristic positions is carried out and the selected position is given in fig 13 position a in the southern sea of taiwan position b is the southern pearl river estuary position c is luzon strait position d is the beibuwan gulf position e f and g is paracel islands spratly islands and dongsha islands respectively position h represents for the midriff of the scs in order to calculate the typhoon wave height of a certain characteristic frequency all the typhoon waves that occur at this selected position are statistically analyzed according to the statistical speed of the typhoon in the region the corresponding wave height of each wind speed are calculated and the statistical sequence of the typhoon wave height in this region is formed the n statistical typhoon wave height are sequentially ordered and the cumulative probability of typhoon waves in the order of m is as follows 6 f h m m n 1 100 cumulative frequency curves are required for the cumulative frequency of typhoon wave height in the calculation platform in extreme wave analysis the commonly used subpackage functions include the gumble distribution the weibull distribution the log normal distribution and the pearson type iii distribution isaacson and mackenzie 1981 hennemuth et al 2013 in this paper the pearson type iii distribution is used to calculate the statistical frequency of typhoon wave height and the probability density function is as follows 7 f h β γ α h α 0 α 1 e β h α 0 8 α 4 c s 2 β 2 h c v c s α 0 h 1 2 c v c s there c v is a discrete coefficient and c s is a partial coefficient and usually the c s is a multiple of c v and calculated by the following formula 9 c v i 1 n h i h 2 n 1 h 2 i 1 n k i 1 2 n 1 c s i 1 n k i 1 3 n 3 c v 3 there k i h i h is the modulus ratio the value distribution function of the excess value is 10 p h h i h i f h d h the pearson type iii distribution of typhoon wave height of the eight different selected positions in the scs are given in fig 14 as can be seen from the figure the fitting results of pearson type iii curve are in good agreement what needs to be explained is that the curve in fig 14 c in the cumulative frequency of less than 99 when it appeared less than zero meter of wave height this is due to the frequency of typhoon wave occurred by typhoon near the luzon strait is very high near spratly islands the pearson type iii curve is close to linear relation in the fig 14 f because the frequency of the extreme waves near the spratly islands occurred by typhoon is low and the statistical data is less it can be seen from fig 14 the highest frequency and the hugest height of typhoon wave is near the luzon strait the average of typhoon wave height is reached 9 2 m the second is southern taiwan position a in the eight different selected positions and the statistical average value of typhoon wave height is close to 8 0 m comparison of the paracel islands spratly islands and dongsha islands the smallest statistical value of the typhoon wave height is the waves in spratly islands with a mean value of 3 0 m and the statistical mean value of typhoon wave height near the paracel islands and dongsha islands are about 6 0 m table 2 shows the typhoon wave height in different statistical frequency in the southern taiwan position a based on the data of tropical cyclones from 1949 to 2019 it can be seen from table 2 that the corresponding typhoon wave height are 6 85 m 8 03 m when the cumulative frequency is from 40 to 50 in the southern taiwan on the other hand there are about two to three typhoons have entered the scs through this location on an average which means that the annual typhoon wave height in this region can reach above 7 0 m table 3 shows the distribution of typhoon wave height in different statistical frequency of the eight selected positions which we can see the corresponding wave height in the different accumulative frequencies of the eight selected positions because the frequency of extreme wave by tropical cyclones near the luzon strait position c is very high the existing in above typhoon wave height was negative when the statistical frequency greater than 99 so there is some missing values in table 3 based on the statistical results combined with the frequency of typhoon in the region the distribution of typhoon wave height can be calculated at any location in the scs and it can be provide to some references for the design of the coastal and ocean engineering 5 conclusion the coupled atmosphere wave model is established in the south china sea based on the mesoscale meteorological model wrf and the third generation wave model swan the air sea interaction have been considered in the coupled model the wrf model provides high resolution wind field data to the swan model and swan model transforms the calculated wave height wavelength and wave period to the wrf model so as to achieve real time two way coupled atmospheric wave model the coupled wrf swan model is applied to the numerical simulation of the extreme waves generated by the typhoon kai tak 1213 rammasun 1409 and hato 1713 respectively the two way nested domain is used to simulate several typhoons in this study the outer domain has a grid resolution of 15 km and the inner domain of 5 km resolution along the east west and north south directions respectively with 35 vertical levels for each domain the time step of outer domain and inner domain is 60 s and 20 s respectively the calculation domain of the swan model is the same as the inner domain of the wrf model and the time step is 300 s the number of directions is 36 which means the angular resolution is 10 the lowest and highest frequencies in swan model are equal to 0 04 hz and 1 hz respectively the time step of the mct is determined to be 600 s in this paper the results of wind field pressure and typhoon wave generated by the typhoon kai tak rammasun and hato have been simulated based on the coupled wrf swan model respectively the results of the numerical simulation are compared with the results of the field observation and the satellite altimeter the verification results show that the coupled wrf swan model shows high accuracy in the simulation of typhoon wave in the scs from the spatial distribution of the wind speed sea level pressure and wave height we can find that the distribution of typhoon wind field and wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is obviously larger than the left side there are two main reasons for this phenomenon on the one hand it is the asymmetry characteristic of the typhoon wind field itself affected by the coriolis force on the other hand due to the wave at the right front of the typhoon center can continue to gain energy from the typhoon wind field resulting in the wave height increasing therefore the wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than the left the relationship between the wind speed and the wave height generated by typhoons is obtained based on the results of the simulation form the coupled wrf swan model total of 71 years of statistical data of tropical cyclones from 1949 to 2019 were obtained and statistically analyzed according to the relationship between wind speed and wave height combined with the statistical data of tropical cyclones in the scs a statistical data grid of typhoon waves in the scs with accuracy of 0 5 is

21113,this paper investigates the dynamical analysis and control synthesis for fractional order pitch roll system of marine vessels under regular waves suppression of the effects of roll and pitch motions is critical in improving maneuverability and stability of marine vessels with ensuring the safety of cargo and comfort to sailors the pitch roll mode shows complex behaviours such as period 2 motion symmetry breaking torus attractor and resonance depending on initial conditions natural frequencies wave frequencies and wave amplitudes specifically the nonlinear behaviours are characterized by phase portraits bifurcation diagrams and stability analysis the nonlinear vibration patterns are observed even under regular waves because the pitch roll motions are strongly coupled with two perpendicular directions to secure the upright position of the vessels in heavy weather adaptive fractional order sliding mode control afosmc scheme has been employed to effectively regulate pitch roll modes against extreme sea states the closed stability of the ship pitch roll system has been guaranteed by the lyapunov theory numerical simulations have been extensively conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms to design more comfortable and safe vessels this study presents pitch roll resonance eliminations stabilization and the challenges associated with robust vessel design keywords pitch roll motion fractional order calculus adaptive sliding mode control bifurcation diagram resonance wave excitations 1 introduction marine vessel motion should be controlled by active mechanisms during rough seas or heavy weather sailing when it comes to passing the heavy seas it is difficult to expect ship safety and comfortable life in the accommodation area due to its complex dynamical behaviours such as chaotic roll oscillations lee et al 2020a zhou and chen 2020 and parametric roll phenomenon yu et al 2019 sakai et al 2019 especially the vessel motions based on the single degree of freedom sdof model such as a two point mooring vessel system lee and you 2018a 2018c lee et al 2020b and roll system lee and you 2018b lee et al 2020a show the complex dynamical behaviours like harmonic sub harmonic and aperiodic quasi periodic and chaotic motions due to its strong nonlinearity of restoring terms in addition the sdof vessel system exhibits severe nonlinear characteristics such as chaos and limit cycles even in the regular waves the stability of that system is highly sensitive to initial conditions and wave excitations it is notable that chaos appears at the end of stable responses in the case of regular waves lee et al 2020a as containership may encounter rough weather the cargoes are subjected to the rolling and pitching motion of the ship the dynamic coupling influence between the roll and the pitch motions of a vessel in heavy waves plays a key role in determining its responses pitch and roll movements are produced by various means of handling and transportation at sea external dynamics due to winds and waves are coupled to induce the complex pitch roll modes of the vessel motions which present additional dynamical behaviours and challenging control problems consequently the pitch roll system governed by a two degree of freedom 2dof model provides various dynamical patterns depending on several parameters such as initial conditions natural frequencies wave encounter frequencies and the amplitudes of wave excitations since the pitch roll system is highly coupled with the perpendicular direction for pitch and roll modes the unexpected nonlinear oscillations can be observed even in regular waves the stability analysis bifurcations jump phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems are of significant interests when the natural frequency of pitch motion is twice that of the natural frequency of roll motion vessel response leads to the large amplitude in roll mode under moderate to extreme sea conditions it is noteworthy that the pitch roll system under internal resonance condition announces big jump for roll angle in some specific parameters resulting in the capsizing of marine vessels the complicated vessel behaviours are often characterized via bifurcation diagram phase portrait and stability analysis there exist many reports on pitch roll dynamics under waves focused on the resonance phenomenon nayfeh et al 1973 bifurcation analysis kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 modulated excitation pan and devies 1996 multiple scale perturbation sayed and hamed 2011 and singularity analysis li et al 2019 manipulating the risky ship s motions based on the vibration mitigation mechanisms is one of the crucial issues in the safety field of ocean going ships in order to cope with pitch and roll modes sliding mode control smc strategy can be one of the practical control algorithms for nonlinear dynamical systems ensuring robust performance as well as stability against parameter uncertainties and exogenous disturbances there is a significant difficulty in implementing smc due to its inherent dynamic property as a major drawback so called chattering problem which describes a harmful phenomenon of finite frequency and finite amplitude oscillations appearing in controller implementations the chattering phenomenon turns out to be the destructive failure of actuators with fatigue loads due to the high frequency of switching actions it may lead to lower control accuracy or incur the unwanted wear of mechanical components of marine vessels these intrinsic problems of chattering in conventional smc can be mitigated by suitable actions of the control structure recently higher order smc strategies such as super twisting control algorithms with adaptation shtessel et al 2012 have been successfully applied to the marine vessels lee et al 2019 2020a or supply chain system xu et al 2020 however this method requires a considerable amount of effort to ensure stability due to many control parameters on the other hand the fractional order method has been favoured in the dynamical analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear dynamic systems the fractional calculus in controller tuning provides the advantages of generalizing the classical integer orders to non integer in fact the orders can be any real or even complex number not only the integer orders which are actually special cases of fractional order fractional order calculus gives a better depiction of the natural phenomena than integer order it provides greater advantages and more flexibility in modelling and control of dynamic systems compared to the integer order counterpart adaptive fractional order sliding mode control afosmc has shown its applicability in multi degree of freedom systems such as synchronous motor hosseini and tabatabaei 2020 quadrotor with a varying load vahdanipour and khodabandeh 2019 the robotic manipulator wang et al 2019 dumlu 2018 and gyroscope model fei and lu 2018 it s worth noting that the diverse control scheme based on smc also provides satisfactory results in some restricted conditions in that case it can show the lack of consistency for the control performance results in other situations in this paper afosmc has been implemented to deal with the modified 2dof marine vessel system as well as to reveal the detailed dynamical phenomena according to the various conditions under a realistic ocean environment this paper aims to stabilize the coupled pitch roll modes focusing on resonance phenomenon leading to the complex behaviours and dangerous maneuvers for marine vessels subjected to the regular waves several cases of initial conditions and wave excitations will be considered for dynamical analysis afosmc scheme is taken into account for vessel motions ensuring robust performance and stability against uncertainties the key contribution of this work is to make up for the weakness of the fractional order control method and strengthen the advantages of novel afosmc for pitch roll modes under wave excitations especially the difficulty of suppressing resonance modes can be successfully solved by the proposed control strategies without excessive costs in addition this paper reveals the limitation of integer order smc as well as advantages of fractional order control synthesis with adaptive law the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the pitch roll system governed by two degree of freedom 2dof model then afosmc has been applied to suppress pitch roll motions and the closed loop stability is formerly proved using the lyapunov theory additionally afopid scheme with supervisory controller is presented to compare its performance with sliding mode controllers in section 3 a dynamical analysis of the uncontrolled pitch roll system will be illustrated using a bifurcation diagram and time series curves section 4 presents extensive simulation results for dynamical behaviours and resonance phenomena then control activities of the proposed algorithms based on two scenarios will be provided finally the concluding remarks will be made in section 5 2 vessel model and control synthesis 2 1 pitch roll dynamical model the coupled pitch roll motion has been a long challenging problem for complex dynamical behaviours of vessels at seas in this study the pitch and roll motions and their couplings are only considered for simplicity ignoring other vessel dynamics the 2dof pitch roll motion of a marine vessel under regular waves is modelled starting from the following differential equations nayfeh et al 1973 1 j y θ m m 0 cos ω e 1 t j x φ k k o cos ω e 2 t where θ and φ denote the pitch and roll orientations respectively j y and j x represent the mass moment of inertia for pitch and roll axis m and k describe the pitch and roll moments related to the ship s oscillations in calm weather which are analytic functions of θ φ and their derivatives m 0 and k 0 denote the constant amplitudes of moments produced by the wave excitations in the pitch and roll modes respectively ω e 1 and ω e 2 are the wave encounter frequencies for pitch and roll modes by introducing the quadratic term in roll motion the hydrodynamic moments m and k can be assumed by following analytic expressions 2 m m θ θ m θ θ m θ θ m θ θ θ 2 m φ φ φ 2 k k φ φ k φ φ k φ φ φ φ k φ φ k φ θ φ θ where m θ and k φ denote the hydrodynamic added mass m θ k φ and k φ φ describe the linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping coefficients m θ and k φ are hydrostatic linear coefficient terms for 1st order restoring motion m θ θ m φ φ and k φ θ indicate 2nd order coupling restoring motions k φ θ φ θ affects the auto parametric phenomenon for roll motion due to its coupled pitch exciting term in order to make the dynamical pitch roll system the additional term m θ θ θ 2 is introduced in pitch motion compared to the general pitch roll model pan and davies 1996 sayed and hamed 2011 kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 li and zhang 2019 generally auto parametric roll resonance coupled with other motions follows the mechanism described above perturbation techniques are widely used to find approximate analytic solutions to nonlinear problems that can t be solved exactly the differential equations that are not explicitly solvable request an approximate solution these techniques deal with the non dimensionalizing step for variables and the transformation step for solvable cases using a small quantity of the perturbation parameter the perturbation analysis has been conducted on the coupled pitch roll system by many researchers nayfeh et al 1974 neves and rodríguez 2006 2009 kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 li et al 2013 substituting 2 into 1 with the perturbation analysis nayfeh and oh 1995 oh et al 2000 the coupled pitch roll model for a marine vessel under harmonic excitation can be expressed as nonlinear differential equations pan and davies 1996 sayed and hamed 2011 kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 li and zhang 2019 3 θ ω n 1 2 θ ε 2 ξ 1 θ σ 1 θ 2 σ 2 φ 2 f 1 cos ω e 1 t φ ω n 2 2 φ ε 2 ξ 2 φ ξ 3 φ φ σ 3 φ θ f 2 cos ω e 2 t where the perturbation theory is applied with respect to the small dimensionless oscillation parameter ε in the transformed equation of motion 3 the coefficients and system parameters which are generally the complicated functions of the various moments of inertia fluid parameters etc are given by ω n 1 m θ j y m θ ξ 1 m θ j y m θ σ 1 m θ θ j y m θ f 1 m 0 j y m θ ω n 2 k φ j x k φ ξ 2 k φ j x k φ σ 2 m φ φ j x k φ f 2 k 0 j x k φ ξ 3 k φ k φ j x k φ σ 3 k φ θ j x k φ where ξ 1 ξ 2 and ξ 3 are the damping coefficients ω n 1 and ω n 2 indicate the natural angular frequencies for pitch and roll modes respectively σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 denote the nonlinear restoring coefficients ω e 1 and ω e 2 are the wave encounter frequencies for pitch and roll modes f 1 and f 2 are the amplitudes of wave excitations with respect to pitch and roll modes after dividing the inertia terms respectively the dynamical behaviours of such a vessel system can be extremely complicated when natural frequencies and excitation frequencies meet certain resonance modes kamel 2007 reported the pitch roll resonance modes for combination case ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 ω n 2 and internal case ω n 1 2 ω n 2 under harmonic excitations using the multiple scale method it is noted that the wave spectrum seen from the marine vessel is called the wave encounter spectrum then the frequency of encounter ω e i is experienced from the marine vessel for the pitch roll resonance modes it is extremely difficult to predict dynamical responses due to the complexity of the vessel wave interactions and its sensitivity 2 2 general concept of fractional calculus the preliminaries of fractional calculus are introduced to analyse the dynamical analysis and realize the control theory the first appearance of a fractional derivative d n d x n f x can be accepted by a question from l hospital in 1695 the fractional order calculus is to provide effective tools for many issues related to fractal dimension infinite memory chaotic behaviour etc fractional calculus is a generalization of differential and integral operators to a non integer order operator in which fractional order involves the computation of a derivative or integral of any real order generally the fractional order of integral and derivative operator d a t α is defined as seyed et al 2019 4 d a t α d α d t α r e α 0 1 r e α 0 i α 0 t d t α r e α 0 where α is the fractional order derivative a and t are the lower and upper bounds of the calculus operations in case of the fractional integral of order a 0 it is noted by d α or i α shabnam and mohammadali 2016 assuming that the fractional order α ℝ is a positive real number in the operator d a t α the caputo function which is one of mostly used fractional derivatives can be written as 5 d a t α x t d t υ α d υ d t υ x t 1 γ υ α a t t τ υ α 1 x υ τ d τ where υ 1 α υ υ ℤ the set of all positive integers and υ is the smallest integer number that is equal or greater than α if x t c υ 0 with υ 1 α υ ℤ is the space of functions υ th derivatives which are absolutely continuous some properties can be listed for reference li and deng 2007 seyed et al 2019 and the euler gamma function is defined as γ α 0 e t t α 1 d t based on the fractional calculus this paper is proposing a potentially more accurate methodology which closely represents the dynamical behaviours of pitch roll modes they include the integer or fractional order of either plant or controller or both currently the use of fractional calculus in system dynamics has been gaining more and more attractiveness in both modelling and identification as well as in the controller fine tuning 2 3 oustaloup filter parameters in first the laplace transform the caputo fractional derivative is defined by means of the gamma function 6 0 e s t d α f t d t s α f s k 0 υ 1 s α k 1 d k f 0 where f s is a laplace transform of f t it is useful for realizing the fractional integral differential operators of the fractional order controller for simulation purposes one of the common ways to convert them with integer order transfer function oustaloup s recursive approximation algorithm is used since it is easy to implement the system dynamics in the frequency domain as follows 7 s α k k n n s ω k s ω k in this algorithm the sets of synthesis formulas for zeros poles and gain are defined by ω k ω b ω h ω b k n 1 2 1 α 2 n 1 ω k ω b ω h ω b k n 1 2 1 α 2 n 1 k ω h α where ω h and ω b denote the high and low transitional frequencies and 2 n 1 is an order of the filter if any function f t is satisfied with the filter the filter output can be considered as an approximation to the fractional integral or differentiated signal 2 4 control system setup severe vessel vibration motions are the undesired behaviours so they must be actively attenuated or controlled to ensure more comfortable and safe maneuvers rudders horizontal hydroplanes and fins vertical hydroplanes are the main control devices for the pitch roll modes of the marine vessels it is well known that the roll dynamics can be controlled by means of anti rolling ideas such as bilge keels water tanks rudder roll stabilization gyrostabilizers moving weights and fin stabilizers moradi and malekizade 2013 wang et al 2017 in addition there has been reported for pitch control devices using a pi rudder canted rudders and passive or active fins kaplan 1981 kaplan and clark 1984 for the coupled pitch roll stabilization two pairs of active fins are seldom introduced kim and kim 2011 huang et al 2018a as pointed out by perez and blanke 2012 marine vessels frequently experience the changes in trim conditions and roll natural frequency and the adaptive control mechanism plays an important role in the pitch roll stabilization by the active fins also the controlled pitch roll performances mainly depend on the controller design by considering the wave excitation terms with amplitudes of f 1 and f 2 as time varying environment disturbances d d 1 d 2 t the active control system represents a forced pitch roll system by adding the actuation input vector u u 1 u 2 t 8 θ 2 ε ξ 1 θ ω n 1 2 θ ε σ 1 θ 2 ε σ 2 φ 2 d 1 u 1 φ 2 ε ξ 2 φ ε ξ 3 φ φ ω n 2 2 φ ε σ 3 φ θ d 2 u 2 for coping with undesirable pitch roll characteristics the active control is important to achieve satisfactory stabilizing efforts by the combined actions of rudders and fins the dynamic characteristics of hydraulic machinery of control hydrofoils are important since they can impose constraints on the control actions for simplicity those actuator dynamics are neglected in this control synthesis for the vector of state variables denoted as v θ θ φ φ v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 the governing equation for pitch roll motions can be described as the following state space representation 9 v t h v h v t t i u t j d where the vector matrix components are given by t h 0 1 0 0 ω n 1 2 2 ε ξ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ω n 2 2 2 ε ξ 2 t i t j 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 h v t 0 ε σ 1 v 1 2 ε σ 2 v 3 2 0 ε ξ 3 v 4 v 4 ε σ 3 v 1 v 3 as shown in fig 1 the proposed controller is employed to handle the error dynamics of the coupled pitch roll modes under wave excitations 2 5 adaptive fractional order sliding mode controller design by introducing the tracking errors as e e 1 e 2 t v 1 v d 1 v 3 v d 3 t the fractional order sliding variables are described as follows 10 s s 1 s 2 λ 1 d α e 1 λ 2 e 1 λ 3 e 1 τ d τ λ 4 d α e 2 λ 5 e 2 λ 6 e 2 τ d τ where λ i is positive constant ℜ which relates to the accuracy and rate of convergence for the pitch roll motions also the sliding mode dynamics can be derived as 11 s s 1 s 2 λ 1 d α 1 p 1 d 1 u 1 λ 2 e 1 λ 3 e 1 λ 4 d α 1 p 2 d 2 u 2 λ 5 e 2 λ 6 e 2 where p 1 p 2 ω n 1 2 v 1 2 ε ξ 1 v 2 ε σ 1 v 1 2 ε σ 2 v 3 2 ω n 2 2 v 3 2 ε ξ 2 v 4 ε ξ 3 v 4 v 4 ε σ 3 v 1 v 3 the control objective is to achieve the robust performance of sliding mode dynamics ensuring asymptotic stability according to the smc theory in order to accomplish the design goal the active controller u is realized with the equivalent parts and switching parts u s w 1 u s w 2 as follows 12 u u 1 u 2 p 1 λ 2 λ 1 d 2 α e 1 λ 3 λ 1 d 1 α e 1 u s w 1 p 2 λ 5 λ 4 d 2 α e 2 λ 6 λ 4 d 1 α e 2 u s w 2 this two stage control scheme is intended to achieve better robustness and tracking performance to significant uncertainties thus the sliding mode dynamics in equation 11 can be rewritten as 13 s s 1 s 2 λ 1 d α 1 d 1 u s w 1 λ 4 d α 1 d 2 u s w 2 in order to solve the chattering phenomenon smc techniques is implemented where the discontinuous term on the controller is replaced by a continuous smooth approximation particularly smooth control action can be realized by u s w i s s η in which free parameter η can be chosen arbitrarily by the system designer shtessel et al 2014 cuong et al 2020 in this scheme the equivalent part is deduced from the relationship between the sliding mode variables to ensure the state of pitch roll system along the sliding surface the switching part is synthesized to compensate for uncertainty and external disturbance to guarantee the state of system within the sliding surface for stability proof the disturbance vector is bounded by a positive constant ρ i satisfying d i ρ i i 1 2 the switching controller is considered as 14 u s w u s w 1 u s w 2 d α 1 ρ 1 sgn s 1 d α 1 ρ 2 sgn s 2 where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are sufficiently large positive constant ℜ theorem 1 the state vector v of the pitch roll motions of marine vessel system 9 is regulated to track the reference signals v d asymptotically as t for all initials with the sliding surface 10 by active controllers specifically the afosmc control algorithm is realized as follows 15 u u 1 u 2 p 1 λ 2 λ 1 d 2 α e 1 λ 3 λ 1 d 1 α e 1 d α 1 ρ ˆ 1 sgn s 1 p 2 λ 5 λ 4 d 2 α e 2 λ 6 λ 4 d 1 α e 2 d α 1 ρ ˆ 2 sgn s 2 where the term d 2 α e i equals to d 1 α e i ρ ˆ i represents the estimate on the parameter ρ i consequently the adaptive mechanism is implemented as the following update laws for the estimated control gains 16 ρ ˆ ρ ˆ 1 ρ ˆ 2 t γ 1 e 1 ς 1 s 1 γ 2 e 2 ς 2 s 2 t where the leakage terms ς 1 ς 2 are used to adjust the adaptive law proof to prove the closed loop stability the lyapunov function candidate is considered as follows 17 v s 1 s 2 1 2 s t w s 1 2 ρ t q ρ where w i 2 2 and q d i a g λ 1 λ 1 λ 4 λ 2 ρ ρ ˆ 1 ρ 1 ρ ˆ 2 ρ 2 t is the estimation error vector of the control gain vector ρ and ρ i is the nominal value of the estimated parameter ρ ˆ i the time derivative of v is obtained by 18 v s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 λ 1 γ 1 ρ ˆ 1 ρ 1 ρ ˆ 1 λ 4 γ 2 ρ ˆ 2 ρ 2 ρ ˆ 2 substituting 11 and 15 into 18 leads to 19 v s 1 λ 1 d 1 α d 1 d α 1 ρ ˆ 1 sgn s 1 λ 1 γ 1 ρ ˆ 1 ρ 1 ρ ˆ 1 s 2 λ 4 d 1 α d 2 d α 1 ρ ˆ 2 sgn s 2 λ 4 γ 2 ρ ˆ 2 ρ 2 ρ ˆ 2 using the property s s sgn s and adaptive update law 16 it yields v s 1 λ 1 d 1 α d 1 s 1 λ 1 ρ 1 e 1 ς 1 s 2 λ 4 d 1 α d 2 s 2 λ 4 ρ 2 e 2 ς 2 s 1 λ 1 d 1 α d 1 ρ 1 e 1 ς 1 20 s 2 λ 4 d 1 α d 2 ρ 2 e 2 ς 2 then v can be a negative definite when the switching gain ρ i is chosen as follows 21 d 1 α d 1 ρ 1 e 1 ς 1 0 d 1 α d 2 ρ 2 e 2 ς 2 0 further it will lead to 22 ρ 1 d 1 α d 1 e 1 ς 1 ρ 2 d 1 α d 2 e 2 ς 2 since the disturbance vector d is bounded the term d 1 α d is also bounded then it is possible to choose the appropriate parameter ρ such that ρ 1 d 1 α d 1 e 1 ς 1 and ρ 2 d 1 α d 2 e 2 ς 2 by lyapunov s stability theory the time convergence of tracking error lim t e t 0 is guaranteed against disturbances this completes the proof 2 6 adaptive fractional order pid scheme with supervisory controller on the other hand adaptive fractional order pi λ d μ method with supervisory controller will be considered to compare the control performance in accordance with similar procedures the external disturbances are described by d d 1 d 2 t in addition three positive upper bounds ℜ are proposed for stability proof on some functions t h v u and v u satisfying t h v t h v u and h v v u where the vector norms have with appropriate dimensions the disturbance vector is bounded by a positive constant β satisfying d β let e e 1 e 2 t be the error vector between the desired values v d v d 1 v d 3 t and the actual output v then the error vector is rewritten as follows 23 e v v d v 1 v d 1 v 3 v d 3 t then the error dynamics are given by 24 e t h e v d h e v d d u based on the error dynamics 24 the active control algorithms are designed to ensure that the error dynamics are asymptotically stable for all initial conditions i e lim t e i t 0 for all e i 0 ℜ the active control action in equation 24 is given by 25 u u s u a f o p i d where u a f o p i d is the vector of adaptive fractional order pid controller afopid this controller acts as the main controller to suppress the pitch roll responses in addition u s is an extra supervisory control vector chang and yan 2005 which will be activated when the system state exceeds some bounds it refers to a high level of overall monitoring of individual process controllers to allow integration of vessel operations when a number of states exceed certain thresholds under uncertainty and disturbance causing overshoots or increasing response time then supervisory control will help to eliminate these phenomena ensuring the closed loop stability the schematic diagram of the pitch roll system with the afopid with supervisory controller is illustrated in fig 2 to design the supervisory controller the lyapunov function ensuring positive definite is considered as follows 26 v e e 1 2 e t p s e where p s is a positive definite symmetric matrix for any positive definite symmetric matrix q there exists a unique positive definite symmetric matrix p s which is the solution of the following lyapunov equation 27 t h t p s p s t h q taking the time derivative of v e along the error closed loop system 24

adaptation mechanism the negative gradient rule is used for tuning three control gains k p k i k d this adaptive law utilizes a gradient approach to minimize the cost function which is a squared model error function chang and yan 2005 for the pitch roll system the adaptive fractional order pid control afopid algorithm is rewritten as 31 u a f o p i d k ˆ p e k ˆ i d λ e k ˆ d d μ e where the

conditions wave encounter frequencies ω e 1 ω e 2 and wave excitation amplitudes f 1 f 2 as well as natural angular frequencies ω n 1 ω n 2 the practical values of main parameters for the pitch roll model are selected as ξ 1 0 1 s 1 ξ 2 0 2 s 1 ξ 3 0 1 rad 1 ω n 2 0 84 rad s 1 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 ε 0 01 σ 1 1 rad 1 s 2 σ 2 1 rad 1 s 2 and σ 3 2 rad 1 s 2 the above data used are realistic and common for pitch roll model extensive numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach the chosen parameters are included in the internal resonance case ω n 1 2 ω n 2 throughout the simulation as observed by william froude in 1863 if the pitch natural frequency ω n 1 is twice that of roll natural frequency ω n 2 the unexpected roll motion will occur due to autoparametric resonance naik and ross 2017 moreover if the wave encounter frequencies are near the pitch natural frequency the pitch responses are oscillating nayfeh et al 1973 even if the amplitudes of wave excitations increase gradually large amplitude of roll motions can be seen due to the transition of surplus energy from pitch to roll mode also time varying changes in the roll restoring term resulted in the parametric roll resonance recently international maritime organization imo copes with the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc for preventing parametric roll phenomena bu et al 2019 sakai et al 2019 the main parameters and two kinds of disturbances are set in order to show the aforementioned characteristics of the coupled pitch roll system to take into account the effect of practical ocean environment two different maneuvering scenarios on disturbances and two initial conditions for pitch roll system will be considered in detail as follows disturbances case 1 f 1 0 1 rad s 2 f 2 0 004 rad s 2 case 2 f 1 0 03 rad s 2 f 2 0 03 rad s 2 initial conditions ic case 1 θ 0 θ 0 φ 0 φ 0 0 01 rad 0 rad s 1 0 01 rad 0 rad s 1 case 2 θ 0 θ 0 φ 0 φ 0 0 1 rad 0 rad s 1 0 1 rad 0 rad s 1 whenever a marine vessel floats on the ocean there is nothing strange about the heeling conditions of pitch and roll angle thus the initial conditions of pitch angle and roll angle are given by combination of 0 01 rad or 0 1 rad as described above two amplitudes of wave excitation forces are considered to demonstrate the influence of parameters in which two amplitudes can be used to predict vessel responses both for small and for large excitations the primary excitation force is the wave amplitude of longitudinal direction for pitch motion the secondary smaller excitation force can be considered as the hydrodynamic interactions when other ships are passing through ocean in transversal direction the first case or case 1 for disturbances is described as follows big primary force f 1 0 1 in the longitudinal direction and low secondary force f 2 0 004 in the transversal direction the other case or case 2 for disturbances is the magnitude of excitation f 1 f 2 0 03 the amplitudes of wave excitation forces have been increased as f 1 f 2 0 03 for demonstrating the most dangerous situations affected by the wave excitations in fact marine vessels are hardly subjected by the same magnitude of both longitudinal and transversal waves however ocean environmental disturbances can be considered to accommodate all aspects of navigational conditions such as waves winds ice covered waters currents and ship to ship interaction forces in close proximity lee 2017a 2017b or unexpected impact power as the transversal exciting forces the parametric roll system is automatically triggered by pitch excitation however pitch and roll motions are subjected to separate modes of harmonic excitations respectively two regular forces are acted on the vessel system in longitudinal and transversal direction as disturbances thus the complicated vibrational phenomenon is expected for both pitch and roll responses firstly the uncontrolled pitch roll responses are illustrated under regular waves in figs 3 13 specifically bifurcation diagrams on control parameter ω e for the pitch roll motions are depicted in figs 3 5 3 1 bifurcation analysis as control parameter is smoothly or rapidly changed a bifurcation shows the sudden appearance of qualitatively different solutions for the coupled pitch roll system bifurcation analysis has been widely used for system stability such as in marine vessel system lee and you 2018a 2018b 2018c lee et al 2020a boiling microchannel system nam et al 2019 and machine tool spindle system nam et al 2020 figs 3 5 illustrate the dynamical behaviours for the different values of encounter frequencies ω e where the dynamic responses of pitch and roll angles θ φ are plotted at every period of bifurcation parameters the wave encounter frequencies ω e 1 ω e 2 are considered as the bifurcation parameters for pitch and roll responses the wave encounter frequencies can be designated as ω e for situating the bifurcation parameter on the abscissa when no control action is employed or u 0 in equation 8 the pitch roll motions show various modes of oscillations depending on the initial conditions and the amplitudes of wave excitations even in regular waves especially one can see that the pitch response is more sensitive to the initial conditions due to its additional terms by means of bifurcation diagram of fig 3 the symmetrical breaking bifurcation for pitch angle is based on the value of encounter frequency of ω e 0 842 on increasing the value of initial conditions to 0 1 rad such symmetry breaking feature is changing in pitch responses as depicted in fig 3 b note that pitch angle is suddenly twisted by varying ω e whereas the maximum range of roll angle sharply increases more than five times as large as previous responses near ω e 0 842 as compared with fig 4 a 3 2 pitch and roll resonance phenomena the pitch roll system has resonance frequencies such as ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 for pitch motion and ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 for roll motion at these points marine vessels undergo enormous jump in pitch and roll directions the response patterns of pitch and roll angles around ω e 0 842 and 1 68 are dependent on the amplitudes of wave excitation forces and the initial conditions in case of pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 the forecastle of the ship may deeply slams on the water surface during pitch mode oscillations therefore marine vessels should avoid the critical value of wave encounter frequency to prevent the bottom hull crack and tremendous water on deck also when the magnitude of wave encountering forces increases to near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 the maximum roll angle near the value of ω e 0 842 can be reached to the capsizing limit of the ship fig 4 a shows the pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 1 and f 2 0 004 case 1 for disturbances fig 4 b shows the pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 03 and f 2 0 03 case 2 for disturbances the bifurcation diagrams are obtained by varying the frequency ω e from 1 6 to 1 75 for the disturbances case 1 and ic case 1 on crossing the value of ω e 1 68 the qualitative behaviour of pitch resonance can be seen as bifurcation control parameters are varied fig 5 a shows the roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 1 and f 2 0 004 case 1 for disturbances fig 5 b shows the roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 03 and f 2 0 03 case 2 for disturbances roll angle represents the skyrocketing phenomenon near ω e 0 842 as shown in fig 5 3 3 dynamic characteristics near roll resonance in addition to the qualitative illustrations of ship responses the oscillatory patterns over time can be described using the time history curves in section 3 3 one can see the unrealistic ship responses in pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 in reality roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 is considered as the most dangerous case for the pitch roll system therefore this paper deals with the practical pitch roll responses in roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 the values of wave encounter frequencies ω e 1 ω e 2 are selected as 0 842 0 86 and 0 9 for the disturbances of case 1 f 1 0 1 f 2 0 004 and case 2 f 1 f 2 0 03 pitch responses show various oscillatory patterns such as period 2 motion in fig 6 a torsional pattern in fig 6 b pitch instability in fig 6 c and irregular torsional behaviours in fig 6 d naturally these responses vary depending on the initial conditions thus the pitch motion seems to be difficult to suppress not only the pitch resonance ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 but also the roll resonance ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 parametric roll resonance can be seen as a modest increase in fig 7 a and a dramatic rise in fig 6 c contrary to pitch responses roll motions repeat the increasing and decreasing patterns at regular intervals on increasing the value of wave encounter frequencies roll angle oscillates more frequently as shown in fig 7 b and d finally it is hard to say that external disturbances acting on the ship such as the big longitudinal wave and weak beam wave are safer in the pitch roll modes both disturbances of case 1 and case 2 are dangerous as time goes to infinity in specific parameters 4 control performance under active controllers when the harmonic waves are excited on marine vessels the pitch roll system exhibits the complex dynamical behaviours the novel control schemes are aiming to solve the control problems of robust stabilization and performance with convergence of pitch and roll modes and chattering reduction within finite times simultaneously since marine vessels easily capsize due to the unexpected roll motion rather than pitch motion control synthesis will be realized based on the situation of roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 also careful attention is necessary for pitch control because complex dynamical behaviours appear near roll resonance frequency the numerical tests are conducted based on the disturbances of case 1 f 1 0 1 f 2 0 004 ω e 1 ω e 2 0 842 and disturbances of case 2 f 1 0 03 f 2 0 03 ω e 1 ω e 2 0 9 with ic of case 1 θ 0 0 01 θ 0 0 φ 0 0 01 φ 0 0 the transient response can be described by two important factors the swiftness and the accuracy of the responses the dynamic characteristics of the desired performance are usually specified in terms of time domain quantities it is noted that fractional order models are superset of integer order models generally more complicated dynamics and high sensitivity to initial conditions can be observed in fractional order control systems compared to integer order counterparts 4 1 optimal parameters based on best practices approach in this simulation the controllers are activated at 230 s for both pitch and roll modes in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of fractional order derivative α in equation 15 the time domain responses for fosmc asmc and afosmc are presented in figs 8 15 in which adaptive sliding mode control asmc is the control strategy for the integer order of α 1 0 in the numerical simulation some parameters in equation 15 for control algorithms are selected as afosmc method α 0 1 λ 1 10 λ 2 250 λ 3 0 1 λ 4 5 λ 5 15 λ 6 0 2 γ 1 70 γ 2 30 ς 1 1 8 ς 2 4 and η 1 asmc method α 1 0 λ 1 20 λ 2 75 λ 3 0 5 λ 4 4 λ 5 8 λ 6 0 5 γ 1 70 γ 2 30 ς 1 2 ς 2 8 and η 1 fosmc method α 0 1 λ 1 30 λ 2 200 λ 3 0 2 λ 4 50 λ 5 10 and λ 6 30 also the afopid method will be illustrated for performance comparison as selecting following parameter values afopid method λ 0 1 μ 0 1 pitch α k 1 500 α k 2 0 1 α k 3 0 1 roll α k 4 1 2 α k 5 0 5 α k 6 0 4 these parameters are chosen through many trials based on the following criteria controlled systems should be converged in finite time by the selected parameters peak phenomena of pitch and roll motion should be avoided as much as possible the second criterion means that some parameters resulted in strong convergence of pitch and roll responses however an extreme peak phenomenon emerged at the control action especially in implementing a fractional order smc controller due to its fragile feature it is possible to bring a slamming impact on the hull in pitch motion or excessive heeling condition to the ship s side so this paper proposed the novel adaptive law including leakage term in fractional order smc method therefore asmc also shows satisfactory convergence of pitch and roll motions in specific parameters using novel adaptation law however intense shortcomings turned out in the sliding surface control parameters are selected as the optimal selection considering main goals in the parts of states convergences peak phenomena control activities sliding surfaces in order to select the superb parameters for each control method it is worthwhile to start at the reference values as low as possible then the system designer can consider the both λ 2 λ 1 λ 3 λ 1 λ 5 λ 4 and λ 6 λ 4 with various values in equation 15 in general the parameters λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 λ 5 λ 6 ℜ in sliding variables determine the accuracy and speed of convergence for control algorithms it can be advantageous for the control designer to choose the bigger denominator and lower numerator rather than vice versa in the proposed afosmc the integral term in equation 10 helps to suppress the unstable amplification in infinite times as well as reduction of peak phenomena especially for the fractional order control method also some parameters of the adaptive law including leakage term γ 1 γ 2 ς 1 ς 2 are related to the smooth convergence and the peak phenomena of pitch and roll responses in order to solve the chattering the discontinuous term is replaced by continuous smooth approximation using the value of free parameter η 1 0 4 2 state convergence and control activity fig 8 depicts the controlled responses of pitch angle and angular speed respectively it can be observed that the pitch oscillations decrease effectively by all three controllers except rate control by afopid even though afopid shows more strengths than other controllers in pitch and roll angle suppression it is vulnerable to the rate control especially primary big head waves disturbances of case1 fig 8 b reveals the peak phenomena of fosmc at the control action due to the fragile feature of the fractional order control method this problem is considered as one of the hardships in suppressing the pitch rate however afosmc has achieved the goal of fast convergence with peak amplitude reduction fig 9 shows the controlled pitch motion under the disturbances of case 2 afopid does not shrink from comparison with other fosmc asmc and afosmc in case of pitch angle fosmc also illustrates good performance in pitch rate control due to the relatively weaker disturbances therefore adaptive law is helpful in controlling big wave excitations owing to adaptation law in equation 16 angle rate control by asmc has treated properly in both disturbances of case 1 and 2 as shown in figs 8 and 9 as for roll angle suppression all four controllers accomplished the control goals within a 5 s period as illustrated in fig 10 a and 11 a even though the roll rate is reduced by afopid as illustrated in fig 10 b it has the limit of the elimination of all errors in the coupled pitch roll system one can see a better performance of control accuracy in steady state responses by the proposed afosmc from the magnification zoom of a part of responses in fig 10 a and 11 a when the control designer is eager to reduce the amounts of errors via fosmc and asmc algorithms the other parts will be deteriorated eventually figs 12 and 13 shows the control activities for pitch and roll motions by the combined actions of rudders and fins discontinuous high frequency phenomena are not observed in the system responses the switching part of the control law in equation 14 guides the state trajectories on the sliding surface no matter what disturbances excite lee et al 2020a the chattering is almost attenuated with a smooth approximation step and fractional order scheme since the switching control action could cause the failure of actuators with fatigue loads chattering mitigation is important when exploiting the smc based control schemes figs 12 15 demonstrates that the control burden is an inevitable factor for integer order control method or non adaptive control approach in a susceptible pitch roll system under two regular disturbances only a small amount of control cost is enough to suppress the pitch roll motions by afosmc whereas high control activities are necessary to obtain better performance results in case of non integer asmc method or non adaptive fosmc as shown in figs 12 and 13 if the parameter values increase by asmc it shows better convergence of four state variables however control activities increase exponentially it is regarded as a fundamental disadvantage of the non integer asmc method control activities highly depend on the variations of the sliding variables the sum of position error and rate error quickly go down to zero within finite times using the proposed controllers figs 14 and 15 illustrate the sliding surface of pitch and roll motions by fosmc asmc and afosmc non integer asmc depicts 30 to 90 times larger than the result of afosmc it means that non integer order control demands more control loads for suppressing the pitch and roll rate as shown in the magnification zoom of figs 14 and 15 zigzag behaviours are not observed after arriving at the sliding surface thus the control action achieves the second goal of alleviating the chattering of actuators and sliding variables by the fractional order control synthesis 4 3 performance evaluation for optimizing the vessel control system an appropriate objective function is needed to better evaluate the system performance and check design objectives the control performance of the dynamical system is usually assessed based on its transient behaviours such as peak magnitude and settling time generally two types of assessment indices and cost functions by utilizing the error signals can be expressed as 38 i s e 0 e t 2 d t 39 i a e 0 e t d t where the ise represents the integral squared error and iae means the integral of absolute error ise penalizes the large errors more and would be preferred if the system designers have constraint on the maximum error however iae measures the increased error in the pitch roll system table 1 indicates the numerical values of performance indices for the control method under disturbances of case 1 afopid and afosmc show the best control quality for pitch and roll angle suppression whereas fosmc asmc and afosmc represent good performances in rate stabilization as described in table 2 the proposed afosmc performs better in terms of angle and rate suppression it is clear that the problem of pitch rate suppression can be effectively treated by adaptation law and fractional order approach 4 4 effects of initial conditions on the controlled system performance the pitch roll system is subjected to the longitudinal and transversal waves disturbances of case 1 and 2 affected by the initial conditions especially in pitch angle and pitch rate the effects of initial conditions on pitch responses are clearly illustrated in the phase planes in figs 16 and 17 where control action starts at t 230 sec when the magnitude of wave excitation force changes to f 1 f 2 0 03 the pitch angle responses of the ic of case 1 dash line decrease whereas the responses by the ic of case 2 dot line are amplified more than doubled in addition these phenomena are portrayed in the pitch angular velocity in fig 17 therefore it needs to be aware of initial conditions resulting in the doubled oscillations even under the same disturbances from these characteristics it is notable that marine vessels are exposed to the potential danger due to the inherent practical conditions such as heeling degrees as well as wave excitation forces in the ocean environment 4 5 effects of fractional order on the controlled system performance one of the advantages of afosmc is exploiting the diversity of the fractional order calculus fig 18 portrayed the pitch and roll responses under disturbances of case 1 and ic of case 1 there are no severe peaks for the system responses when the control action begins in case of α 0 1 as shown in the magnification zoom of fig 18 a decrease in the number of fractional order derivatives leads to an increase in the control performances such as error reduction and fast convergence especially on increasing the value of the fractional order derivative roll angle hardly converges to zero within finite times when it comes to using afosmc it is necessary to check the vessel responses after arriving at the desired values 4 6 controlled pitch roll system figs 19 and 20 show the controlled phase portraits of the pitch roll system one can see the qualitative features including the periodic orbits of the pitch roll motions on the phase plane the trajectories starting from any initial positions go down to the center position eventually the symmetry breaking features period 2 motion and torus attractor can be observed in pitch motion depending on the initial conditions depicted in fig 19 the magnitude of roll motion is highly dependent on the wave encounter frequencies including resonance phenomena and wave excitation forces acting on the transversal direction finally the controlled pitch and roll responses show insensitive to the initial conditions since pitch and roll modes are subject to the surface equation itself 5 conclusions the novel fractional order control synthesis has been presented for suppressing complex pitch and roll oscillations of marine vessels under two regular waves since 2dof pitch roll modes are strongly coupled with each other for dynamic maneuvering at sea various dynamical patterns can be observed in fact the pitch and roll responses are greatly dependent on the initial conditions wave encounter frequencies natural frequencies and wave excitation forces the pitch and roll resonance phenomena are systematically illustrated by using phase portraits and the bifurcation techniques numerous design schemes afopid fosmc asmc and afosmc of controller have been realized in order to provide robust performance and stability for marine vessels against exogenous disturbances extensive simulation results support the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes in addition the control strategies are evaluated by appropriate comparisons demonstrating satisfactory results as well as advantages finally the afosmc algorithm is one of the powerful methods for alleviating coupled pitch and roll

21113,this paper investigates the dynamical analysis and control synthesis for fractional order pitch roll system of marine vessels under regular waves suppression of the effects of roll and pitch motions is critical in improving maneuverability and stability of marine vessels with ensuring the safety of cargo and comfort to sailors the pitch roll mode shows complex behaviours such as period 2 motion symmetry breaking torus attractor and resonance depending on initial conditions natural frequencies wave frequencies and wave amplitudes specifically the nonlinear behaviours are characterized by phase portraits bifurcation diagrams and stability analysis the nonlinear vibration patterns are observed even under regular waves because the pitch roll motions are strongly coupled with two perpendicular directions to secure the upright position of the vessels in heavy weather adaptive fractional order sliding mode control afosmc scheme has been employed to effectively regulate pitch roll modes against extreme sea states the closed stability of the ship pitch roll system has been guaranteed by the lyapunov theory numerical simulations have been extensively conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms to design more comfortable and safe vessels this study presents pitch roll resonance eliminations stabilization and the challenges associated with robust vessel design keywords pitch roll motion fractional order calculus adaptive sliding mode control bifurcation diagram resonance wave excitations 1 introduction marine vessel motion should be controlled by active mechanisms during rough seas or heavy weather sailing when it comes to passing the heavy seas it is difficult to expect ship safety and comfortable life in the accommodation area due to its complex dynamical behaviours such as chaotic roll oscillations lee et al 2020a zhou and chen 2020 and parametric roll phenomenon yu et al 2019 sakai et al 2019 especially the vessel motions based on the single degree of freedom sdof model such as a two point mooring vessel system lee and you 2018a 2018c lee et al 2020b and roll system lee and you 2018b lee et al 2020a show the complex dynamical behaviours like harmonic sub harmonic and aperiodic quasi periodic and chaotic motions due to its strong nonlinearity of restoring terms in addition the sdof vessel system exhibits severe nonlinear characteristics such as chaos and limit cycles even in the regular waves the stability of that system is highly sensitive to initial conditions and wave excitations it is notable that chaos appears at the end of stable responses in the case of regular waves lee et al 2020a as containership may encounter rough weather the cargoes are subjected to the rolling and pitching motion of the ship the dynamic coupling influence between the roll and the pitch motions of a vessel in heavy waves plays a key role in determining its responses pitch and roll movements are produced by various means of handling and transportation at sea external dynamics due to winds and waves are coupled to induce the complex pitch roll modes of the vessel motions which present additional dynamical behaviours and challenging control problems consequently the pitch roll system governed by a two degree of freedom 2dof model provides various dynamical patterns depending on several parameters such as initial conditions natural frequencies wave encounter frequencies and the amplitudes of wave excitations since the pitch roll system is highly coupled with the perpendicular direction for pitch and roll modes the unexpected nonlinear oscillations can be observed even in regular waves the stability analysis bifurcations jump phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems are of significant interests when the natural frequency of pitch motion is twice that of the natural frequency of roll motion vessel response leads to the large amplitude in roll mode under moderate to extreme sea conditions it is noteworthy that the pitch roll system under internal resonance condition announces big jump for roll angle in some specific parameters resulting in the capsizing of marine vessels the complicated vessel behaviours are often characterized via bifurcation diagram phase portrait and stability analysis there exist many reports on pitch roll dynamics under waves focused on the resonance phenomenon nayfeh et al 1973 bifurcation analysis kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 modulated excitation pan and devies 1996 multiple scale perturbation sayed and hamed 2011 and singularity analysis li et al 2019 manipulating the risky ship s motions based on the vibration mitigation mechanisms is one of the crucial issues in the safety field of ocean going ships in order to cope with pitch and roll modes sliding mode control smc strategy can be one of the practical control algorithms for nonlinear dynamical systems ensuring robust performance as well as stability against parameter uncertainties and exogenous disturbances there is a significant difficulty in implementing smc due to its inherent dynamic property as a major drawback so called chattering problem which describes a harmful phenomenon of finite frequency and finite amplitude oscillations appearing in controller implementations the chattering phenomenon turns out to be the destructive failure of actuators with fatigue loads due to the high frequency of switching actions it may lead to lower control accuracy or incur the unwanted wear of mechanical components of marine vessels these intrinsic problems of chattering in conventional smc can be mitigated by suitable actions of the control structure recently higher order smc strategies such as super twisting control algorithms with adaptation shtessel et al 2012 have been successfully applied to the marine vessels lee et al 2019 2020a or supply chain system xu et al 2020 however this method requires a considerable amount of effort to ensure stability due to many control parameters on the other hand the fractional order method has been favoured in the dynamical analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear dynamic systems the fractional calculus in controller tuning provides the advantages of generalizing the classical integer orders to non integer in fact the orders can be any real or even complex number not only the integer orders which are actually special cases of fractional order fractional order calculus gives a better depiction of the natural phenomena than integer order it provides greater advantages and more flexibility in modelling and control of dynamic systems compared to the integer order counterpart adaptive fractional order sliding mode control afosmc has shown its applicability in multi degree of freedom systems such as synchronous motor hosseini and tabatabaei 2020 quadrotor with a varying load vahdanipour and khodabandeh 2019 the robotic manipulator wang et al 2019 dumlu 2018 and gyroscope model fei and lu 2018 it s worth noting that the diverse control scheme based on smc also provides satisfactory results in some restricted conditions in that case it can show the lack of consistency for the control performance results in other situations in this paper afosmc has been implemented to deal with the modified 2dof marine vessel system as well as to reveal the detailed dynamical phenomena according to the various conditions under a realistic ocean environment this paper aims to stabilize the coupled pitch roll modes focusing on resonance phenomenon leading to the complex behaviours and dangerous maneuvers for marine vessels subjected to the regular waves several cases of initial conditions and wave excitations will be considered for dynamical analysis afosmc scheme is taken into account for vessel motions ensuring robust performance and stability against uncertainties the key contribution of this work is to make up for the weakness of the fractional order control method and strengthen the advantages of novel afosmc for pitch roll modes under wave excitations especially the difficulty of suppressing resonance modes can be successfully solved by the proposed control strategies without excessive costs in addition this paper reveals the limitation of integer order smc as well as advantages of fractional order control synthesis with adaptive law the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the pitch roll system governed by two degree of freedom 2dof model then afosmc has been applied to suppress pitch roll motions and the closed loop stability is formerly proved using the lyapunov theory additionally afopid scheme with supervisory controller is presented to compare its performance with sliding mode controllers in section 3 a dynamical analysis of the uncontrolled pitch roll system will be illustrated using a bifurcation diagram and time series curves section 4 presents extensive simulation results for dynamical behaviours and resonance phenomena then control activities of the proposed algorithms based on two scenarios will be provided finally the concluding remarks will be made in section 5 2 vessel model and control synthesis 2 1 pitch roll dynamical model the coupled pitch roll motion has been a long challenging problem for complex dynamical behaviours of vessels at seas in this study the pitch and roll motions and their couplings are only considered for simplicity ignoring other vessel dynamics the 2dof pitch roll motion of a marine vessel under regular waves is modelled starting from the following differential equations nayfeh et al 1973 1 j y θ m m 0 cos ω e 1 t j x φ k k o cos ω e 2 t where θ and φ denote the pitch and roll orientations respectively j y and j x represent the mass moment of inertia for pitch and roll axis m and k describe the pitch and roll moments related to the ship s oscillations in calm weather which are analytic functions of θ φ and their derivatives m 0 and k 0 denote the constant amplitudes of moments produced by the wave excitations in the pitch and roll modes respectively ω e 1 and ω e 2 are the wave encounter frequencies for pitch and roll modes by introducing the quadratic term in roll motion the hydrodynamic moments m and k can be assumed by following analytic expressions 2 m m θ θ m θ θ m θ θ m θ θ θ 2 m φ φ φ 2 k k φ φ k φ φ k φ φ φ φ k φ φ k φ θ φ θ where m θ and k φ denote the hydrodynamic added mass m θ k φ and k φ φ describe the linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping coefficients m θ and k φ are hydrostatic linear coefficient terms for 1st order restoring motion m θ θ m φ φ and k φ θ indicate 2nd order coupling restoring motions k φ θ φ θ affects the auto parametric phenomenon for roll motion due to its coupled pitch exciting term in order to make the dynamical pitch roll system the additional term m θ θ θ 2 is introduced in pitch motion compared to the general pitch roll model pan and davies 1996 sayed and hamed 2011 kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 li and zhang 2019 generally auto parametric roll resonance coupled with other motions follows the mechanism described above perturbation techniques are widely used to find approximate analytic solutions to nonlinear problems that can t be solved exactly the differential equations that are not explicitly solvable request an approximate solution these techniques deal with the non dimensionalizing step for variables and the transformation step for solvable cases using a small quantity of the perturbation parameter the perturbation analysis has been conducted on the coupled pitch roll system by many researchers nayfeh et al 1974 neves and rodríguez 2006 2009 kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 li et al 2013 substituting 2 into 1 with the perturbation analysis nayfeh and oh 1995 oh et al 2000 the coupled pitch roll model for a marine vessel under harmonic excitation can be expressed as nonlinear differential equations pan and davies 1996 sayed and hamed 2011 kamel 2007 zhou and chen 2008 li and zhang 2019 3 θ ω n 1 2 θ ε 2 ξ 1 θ σ 1 θ 2 σ 2 φ 2 f 1 cos ω e 1 t φ ω n 2 2 φ ε 2 ξ 2 φ ξ 3 φ φ σ 3 φ θ f 2 cos ω e 2 t where the perturbation theory is applied with respect to the small dimensionless oscillation parameter ε in the transformed equation of motion 3 the coefficients and system parameters which are generally the complicated functions of the various moments of inertia fluid parameters etc are given by ω n 1 m θ j y m θ ξ 1 m θ j y m θ σ 1 m θ θ j y m θ f 1 m 0 j y m θ ω n 2 k φ j x k φ ξ 2 k φ j x k φ σ 2 m φ φ j x k φ f 2 k 0 j x k φ ξ 3 k φ k φ j x k φ σ 3 k φ θ j x k φ where ξ 1 ξ 2 and ξ 3 are the damping coefficients ω n 1 and ω n 2 indicate the natural angular frequencies for pitch and roll modes respectively σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 denote the nonlinear restoring coefficients ω e 1 and ω e 2 are the wave encounter frequencies for pitch and roll modes f 1 and f 2 are the amplitudes of wave excitations with respect to pitch and roll modes after dividing the inertia terms respectively the dynamical behaviours of such a vessel system can be extremely complicated when natural frequencies and excitation frequencies meet certain resonance modes kamel 2007 reported the pitch roll resonance modes for combination case ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 ω n 2 and internal case ω n 1 2 ω n 2 under harmonic excitations using the multiple scale method it is noted that the wave spectrum seen from the marine vessel is called the wave encounter spectrum then the frequency of encounter ω e i is experienced from the marine vessel for the pitch roll resonance modes it is extremely difficult to predict dynamical responses due to the complexity of the vessel wave interactions and its sensitivity 2 2 general concept of fractional calculus the preliminaries of fractional calculus are introduced to analyse the dynamical analysis and realize the control theory the first appearance of a fractional derivative d n d x n f x can be accepted by a question from l hospital in 1695 the fractional order calculus is to provide effective tools for many issues related to fractal dimension infinite memory chaotic behaviour etc fractional calculus is a generalization of differential and integral operators to a non integer order operator in which fractional order involves the computation of a derivative or integral of any real order generally the fractional order of integral and derivative operator d a t α is defined as seyed et al 2019 4 d a t α d α d t α r e α 0 1 r e α 0 i α 0 t d t α r e α 0 where α is the fractional order derivative a and t are the lower and upper bounds of the calculus operations in case of the fractional integral of order a 0 it is noted by d α or i α shabnam and mohammadali 2016 assuming that the fractional order α ℝ is a positive real number in the operator d a t α the caputo function which is one of mostly used fractional derivatives can be written as 5 d a t α x t d t υ α d υ d t υ x t 1 γ υ α a t t τ υ α 1 x υ τ d τ where υ 1 α υ υ ℤ the set of all positive integers and υ is the smallest integer number that is equal or greater than α if x t c υ 0 with υ 1 α υ ℤ is the space of functions υ th derivatives which are absolutely continuous some properties can be listed for reference li and deng 2007 seyed et al 2019 and the euler gamma function is defined as γ α 0 e t t α 1 d t based on the fractional calculus this paper is proposing a potentially more accurate methodology which closely represents the dynamical behaviours of pitch roll modes they include the integer or fractional order of either plant or controller or both currently the use of fractional calculus in system dynamics has been gaining more and more attractiveness in both modelling and identification as well as in the controller fine tuning 2 3 oustaloup filter parameters in first the laplace transform the caputo fractional derivative is defined by means of the gamma function 6 0 e s t d α f t d t s α f s k 0 υ 1 s α k 1 d k f 0 where f s is a laplace transform of f t it is useful for realizing the fractional integral differential operators of the fractional order controller for simulation purposes one of the common ways to convert them with integer order transfer function oustaloup s recursive approximation algorithm is used since it is easy to implement the system dynamics in the frequency domain as follows 7 s α k

denote the high and low transitional frequencies and 2 n 1 is an order of the filter if any function f t is satisfied with the filter the filter output can be considered as an approximation to the fractional integral or differentiated signal 2 4 control system setup severe vessel vibration motions are the undesired behaviours so they must be actively attenuated or controlled to ensure more comfortable and safe maneuvers rudders horizontal hydroplanes and fins vertical hydroplanes are the main control devices for the pitch roll modes of the marine vessels it is well known that the roll dynamics can be controlled by means of anti rolling ideas such as bilge keels water tanks rudder roll stabilization gyrostabilizers moving weights and fin stabilizers moradi and malekizade 2013 wang et al 2017 in addition there has been reported for pitch control devices using a pi rudder canted rudders and passive or active fins kaplan 1981 kaplan and clark 1984 for the coupled pitch roll stabilization two pairs of active fins are seldom introduced kim and kim 2011 huang et al 2018a as pointed out by perez and blanke 2012 marine vessels frequently experience the changes in trim conditions and roll natural frequency and the adaptive control mechanism plays an important role in the pitch roll stabilization by the active fins also the controlled pitch roll performances mainly depend on the controller design by considering the wave excitation terms with amplitudes of f 1 and f 2 as time varying environment disturbances d d 1 d 2 t the active control system represents a forced pitch roll system by adding the actuation input vector u u 1 u 2 t 8 θ 2 ε ξ 1 θ ω n 1 2 θ ε σ 1 θ 2 ε σ 2 φ 2 d 1 u 1 φ 2 ε ξ 2 φ ε ξ 3 φ φ ω n 2 2 φ ε σ 3 φ θ d 2 u 2 for coping with undesirable pitch roll characteristics the active control is important to achieve satisfactory stabilizing efforts by the combined actions of rudders and fins the dynamic characteristics of hydraulic machinery of control hydrofoils are important since they can impose constraints on the control actions for simplicity those actuator dynamics are neglected in this control synthesis for the vector of state variables denoted as v θ θ φ φ v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 the governing equation for pitch roll motions can be described as the following state space representation 9 v t h v h v t t i u t j d where the vector matrix components are given by t h 0 1 0 0 ω n 1 2 2 ε ξ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ω n 2 2 2 ε ξ 2 t i t j 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 h v t 0 ε σ 1 v 1 2 ε σ 2 v 3 2 0 ε ξ 3 v 4 v 4 ε σ 3 v 1 v 3 as shown in fig

the tracking errors as e e 1 e 2 t v 1 v d 1 v 3 v d 3 t the fractional order sliding variables are described as follows 10 s s 1 s 2 λ 1 d α e 1 λ 2 e 1 λ 3 e 1 τ d τ λ 4 d α e 2 λ 5 e 2 λ 6 e 2 τ d τ where λ i is positive constant ℜ which relates to the accuracy and rate of convergence for the pitch roll motions also the sliding mode dynamics can be derived as 11 s s 1 s 2 λ 1 d α 1 p 1 d 1 u 1 λ 2 e 1 λ 3 e 1 λ 4 d α 1 p 2 d 2 u 2 λ 5 e 2 λ 6 e 2 where p 1 p 2 ω n 1 2 v 1 2 ε ξ 1 v 2 ε σ 1 v 1 2 ε σ 2 v 3 2 ω n 2 2 v 3 2 ε ξ 2 v 4 ε ξ 3 v 4 v 4 ε σ 3 v 1 v 3 the control objective is to achieve the robust performance of sliding mode dynamics ensuring asymptotic stability according to the smc theory in order to accomplish the design goal the active controller u is realized with the equivalent parts and switching parts u s w 1 u s w 2 as follows 12 u u 1 u 2 p 1 λ 2 λ 1 d 2 α e 1 λ 3 λ 1 d 1 α e 1 u s w 1 p 2 λ 5 λ 4 d 2 α e 2 λ 6 λ 4 d 1 α e 2 u s w 2 this two stage control scheme is intended to achieve better robustness and tracking performance to significant uncertainties thus the sliding mode dynamics in equation 11 can be rewritten as 13 s s 1 s 2 λ 1 d α 1 d 1 u s w 1 λ 4 d α 1 d 2 u s w 2 in order to solve the chattering phenomenon smc techniques is implemented where the discontinuous term on the controller is replaced by a continuous smooth approximation particularly smooth control action can be realized by u s w i s s η in which free parameter η can be chosen arbitrarily by the system designer shtessel et al 2014 cuong et al 2020 in this scheme the equivalent part is deduced from the relationship between the sliding mode variables to ensure the state of pitch roll system along the sliding surface the switching part is synthesized to compensate for uncertainty and external disturbance to guarantee the state of system within the sliding surface for stability proof the disturbance vector is bounded by a positive constant ρ i satisfying d i ρ i i 1 2 the switching controller is considered as 14 u s w u s w 1 u s w 2 d α 1 ρ 1 sgn s 1 d α 1 ρ 2 sgn s 2 where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are sufficiently large positive constant ℜ theorem 1 the state vector v of the pitch roll motions of marine vessel system 9 is regulated to track the reference signals v d asymptotically as t for all initials with the sliding surface 10 by active controllers specifically the afosmc control algorithm is realized as follows 15 u u 1 u 2 p 1 λ 2 λ 1 d 2 α e 1 λ 3 λ 1 d 1 α e 1 d α 1 ρ ˆ 1 sgn s 1 p 2 λ 5 λ 4 d 2 α e 2 λ 6 λ 4 d 1 α e 2 d α 1 ρ ˆ 2 sgn s 2 where the term d 2 α e i equals to d 1 α e i ρ ˆ i represents the estimate on the parameter ρ i consequently the adaptive mechanism is implemented as the following update laws for the estimated control gains 16 ρ ˆ ρ ˆ 1 ρ ˆ 2 t γ 1 e 1 ς 1 s 1 γ 2 e 2 ς 2 s 2 t where the leakage terms ς 1 ς 2 are used to adjust the adaptive law proof to prove the closed loop stability the lyapunov function candidate is considered as follows 17 v s 1 s 2 1 2 s t w s 1 2 ρ t q ρ where w i 2 2 and q d i a g λ 1 λ 1 λ 4 λ 2 ρ ρ ˆ 1 ρ 1 ρ ˆ 2 ρ 2 t is the estimation error vector of the control gain vector ρ and ρ i is the nominal value of the estimated parameter ρ ˆ i the time derivative of v is obtained by 18 v s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 λ 1 γ 1 ρ ˆ 1 ρ 1 ρ ˆ 1 λ 4 γ 2 ρ ˆ 2 ρ 2 ρ ˆ 2 substituting 11 and 15 into 18 leads to 19 v s 1 λ 1 d 1 α d 1 d α 1 ρ ˆ 1 sgn s 1 λ 1 γ 1 ρ ˆ 1 ρ 1 ρ ˆ 1 s 2 λ 4 d 1 α d 2 d α 1 ρ ˆ 2 sgn s 2 λ 4 γ 2 ρ ˆ 2 ρ 2 ρ ˆ 2 using the property s s sgn s and adaptive update law 16 it yields v s 1 λ 1 d 1 α d 1 s 1 λ 1 ρ 1 e 1 ς 1 s 2 λ 4 d 1 α d 2 s 2 λ 4 ρ 2 e 2 ς 2 s 1 λ 1 d 1 α d 1 ρ 1 e 1 ς 1 20 s 2 λ 4 d 1 α d 2 ρ 2 e 2 ς 2 then v can be a negative definite when the switching gain ρ i is chosen as follows 21 d 1 α d 1 ρ 1 e 1 ς 1 0 d 1 α d 2 ρ 2 e 2 ς 2 0 further it will lead to 22 ρ 1 d 1 α d 1 e 1 ς 1 ρ 2 d 1 α d 2 e 2 ς 2 since the disturbance vector d is bounded the term d 1 α d is also bounded then it is possible to choose the appropriate parameter ρ such that ρ 1 d 1 α d 1 e 1 ς 1 and ρ 2 d 1 α d 2 e 2 ς 2 by lyapunov s stability theory the time convergence of tracking error lim t e t 0 is guaranteed against disturbances this completes the proof 2 6 adaptive fractional order pid scheme with supervisory controller on the other hand adaptive fractional order pi λ d μ method with supervisory controller will be considered to compare the control performance in accordance with similar procedures the external disturbances are described by d d 1 d 2 t in addition three positive upper bounds ℜ are proposed for stability proof on some functions t h v u and v u satisfying t h v t h v u and h v v u where the vector norms have with appropriate dimensions the disturbance vector is bounded by a positive constant β satisfying d β let e e 1 e 2 t be the error vector between the desired values v d v d 1 v d 3 t and the actual output v then the error vector is rewritten as follows 23 e v v d v 1 v d 1 v 3 v d 3 t then the error dynamics are given by 24 e t h e v d h e v d d u based on the error dynamics 24 the active control algorithms are designed to ensure that the error dynamics are asymptotically stable for all initial conditions i e lim t e i t 0 for all e i 0 ℜ the active control action in equation 24 is given by 25 u u s u a f o p i d where u a f o p i d is the vector of adaptive fractional order pid controller afopid this controller acts as the main controller to suppress the pitch roll responses in addition u s is an extra supervisory control vector chang and yan 2005 which will be activated when the system state exceeds some bounds it refers to a high level of overall monitoring of individual process controllers to allow integration of vessel operations when a number of states exceed certain thresholds under uncertainty and disturbance causing overshoots or increasing response time then supervisory control will help to eliminate these phenomena ensuring the closed loop stability the schematic diagram of the pitch roll system with the afopid with supervisory controller is illustrated in fig 2 to design the supervisory controller the lyapunov function ensuring positive definite is considered as follows 26 v e e 1 2 e t p s e where p s is a positive definite symmetric matrix for any positive definite symmetric matrix q there exists a unique positive definite symmetric matrix p s which is the solution of the following lyapunov equation 27 t h t p s p s t h q taking the time derivative of v e along the error closed loop system 24

adaptation mechanism the negative gradient rule is used for tuning three control gains k p k i k d this adaptive law utilizes a gradient approach to minimize the cost function which is a squared model error function chang and yan 2005 for the pitch roll system the adaptive fractional order pid control afopid algorithm is rewritten as 31 u a f o p i d k ˆ p e k ˆ i d λ e k ˆ d d μ e where the updated gains are denoted by k ˆ p k ˆ i and k ˆ d the adaptive laws for tuning three control gains are given by 32 k ˆ p α k 1 e t e k ˆ i α k 2 e t e d t k ˆ d α k 3 e t e where α k i is a learning rate i 1 2 3 the gains are adjusted in such a way that the cost function is minimized and it is reasonable to change the gains in the direction of the negative gradient theorem 2 consider the pitch roll system in equation 8 with known constants then the afopid algorithm and supervisory control in equation 25 assures asymptotic stability for the error dynamics in equation 24 that is the time convergence of tracking error is guaranteed or lim t e i t 0 proof to prove the closed loop stability consider the lyapunov function candidate for the error dynamics as 33 v e e 1 2 e t h e where h is

the combined effect of pitch and roll motions under ocean environmental disturbances the pitch roll modes exhibit the complex nonlinear behaviours depending on various parameters such as the initial conditions wave encounter frequencies ω e 1 ω e 2 and wave excitation amplitudes f 1 f 2 as well as natural angular frequencies ω n 1 ω n 2 the practical values of main parameters for the pitch roll model are selected as ξ 1 0 1 s 1 ξ 2 0 2 s 1 ξ 3 0 1 rad 1 ω n 2 0 84 rad s 1 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 ε 0 01 σ 1 1 rad 1 s 2 σ 2 1 rad 1 s 2 and σ 3 2 rad 1 s 2 the above data used are realistic and common for pitch roll model extensive numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach the chosen parameters are included in the internal resonance case ω n 1 2 ω n 2 throughout the simulation as observed by william froude in 1863 if the pitch natural frequency ω n 1 is twice that of roll natural frequency ω n 2 the unexpected roll motion will occur due to autoparametric resonance naik and ross 2017 moreover if the wave encounter frequencies are near the pitch natural frequency the pitch responses are oscillating nayfeh et al 1973 even if the amplitudes of wave excitations increase gradually large amplitude of roll motions can be seen due to the transition of surplus energy from pitch to roll mode also time varying changes in the roll restoring term resulted in the parametric roll resonance recently international maritime organization imo copes with the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc for preventing parametric roll phenomena bu et al 2019 sakai et al 2019 the main parameters and two kinds of disturbances are set in order to show the aforementioned characteristics of the coupled pitch roll system to take into account the effect of practical ocean environment two different maneuvering scenarios on disturbances and two initial conditions for pitch roll system will be considered in detail as follows disturbances case 1 f 1 0 1 rad s 2 f 2 0 004 rad s 2 case 2 f 1 0 03 rad s 2 f 2 0 03 rad s 2 initial conditions ic case 1 θ 0 θ 0 φ 0 φ 0 0 01 rad 0 rad s 1 0 01 rad 0 rad s 1 case 2 θ 0 θ 0 φ 0 φ 0 0 1 rad 0 rad s 1 0 1 rad 0 rad s 1 whenever a marine vessel floats on the ocean there is nothing strange about the heeling conditions of pitch and roll angle thus the initial conditions of pitch angle and roll angle are given by combination of 0 01 rad or 0 1 rad as described above two amplitudes of wave excitation forces are considered to demonstrate the influence of parameters in which two amplitudes can be used to predict vessel responses both for small and for large excitations the primary excitation force is the wave amplitude of longitudinal direction for pitch motion the secondary smaller excitation force can be considered as the hydrodynamic interactions when other ships are passing through ocean in transversal direction the first case or case 1 for disturbances is described as follows big primary force f 1 0 1 in the longitudinal direction and low secondary force f 2 0 004 in the transversal direction the other case or case 2 for disturbances is the magnitude of excitation f 1 f 2 0 03 the amplitudes of wave excitation forces have been increased as f 1 f 2 0 03 for demonstrating the most dangerous situations affected by the wave excitations in fact marine vessels are hardly subjected by the same magnitude of both longitudinal and transversal waves however ocean environmental disturbances can be considered to accommodate all aspects of navigational conditions such as waves winds ice covered waters currents and ship to ship interaction forces in close proximity lee 2017a 2017b or unexpected impact power as the transversal exciting forces the parametric roll system is automatically triggered by pitch excitation however pitch and roll motions are subjected to separate modes of harmonic excitations respectively two regular forces are acted on the vessel system in longitudinal and transversal direction as disturbances thus the complicated vibrational phenomenon is expected for both pitch and roll responses firstly the uncontrolled pitch roll responses are illustrated under regular waves in figs 3 13 specifically bifurcation diagrams on control parameter ω e for the pitch roll motions are depicted in figs 3 5 3 1 bifurcation analysis as control parameter is smoothly or rapidly changed a bifurcation shows the sudden appearance of qualitatively different solutions for the coupled pitch roll system bifurcation analysis has been widely used for system stability such as in marine vessel system lee and you 2018a 2018b 2018c lee et al 2020a boiling microchannel system nam et al 2019 and machine tool spindle system nam et al 2020 figs 3 5 illustrate the dynamical behaviours for the different values of encounter frequencies ω e where the dynamic responses of pitch and roll angles θ φ are plotted at every period of bifurcation parameters the wave encounter frequencies ω e 1 ω e 2 are considered as the bifurcation parameters for pitch and roll responses the wave encounter frequencies can be designated as ω e for situating the bifurcation parameter on the abscissa when no control action is employed or u 0 in equation 8 the pitch roll motions show various modes of oscillations depending on the initial conditions and the amplitudes of wave excitations even in regular waves especially one can see that the pitch response is more sensitive to the initial conditions due to its additional terms by means of bifurcation diagram of fig 3 the symmetrical breaking bifurcation for pitch angle is based on the value of encounter frequency of ω e 0 842 on increasing the value of initial conditions to 0 1 rad such symmetry breaking feature is changing in pitch responses as depicted in fig 3 b note that pitch angle is suddenly twisted by varying ω e whereas the maximum range of roll angle sharply increases more than five times as large as previous responses near ω e 0 842 as compared with fig 4 a 3 2 pitch and roll resonance phenomena the pitch roll system has resonance frequencies such as ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 for pitch motion and ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 for roll motion at these points marine vessels undergo enormous jump in pitch and roll directions the response patterns of pitch and roll angles around ω e 0 842 and 1 68 are dependent on the amplitudes of wave excitation forces and the initial conditions in case of pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 the forecastle of the ship may deeply slams on the water surface during pitch mode oscillations therefore marine vessels should avoid the critical value of wave encounter frequency to prevent the bottom hull crack and tremendous water on deck also when the magnitude of wave encountering forces increases to near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 the maximum roll angle near the value of ω e 0 842 can be reached to the capsizing limit of the ship fig 4 a shows the pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 1 and f 2 0 004 case 1 for disturbances fig 4 b shows the pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 03 and f 2 0 03 case 2 for disturbances the bifurcation diagrams are obtained by varying the frequency ω e from 1 6 to 1 75 for the disturbances case 1 and ic case 1 on crossing the value of ω e 1 68 the qualitative behaviour of pitch resonance can be seen as bifurcation control parameters are varied fig 5 a shows the roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 1 and f 2 0 004 case 1 for disturbances fig 5 b shows the roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 for f 1 0 03 and f 2 0 03 case 2 for disturbances roll angle represents the skyrocketing phenomenon near ω e 0 842 as shown in fig 5 3 3 dynamic characteristics near roll resonance in addition to the qualitative illustrations of ship responses the oscillatory patterns over time can be described using the time history curves in section 3 3 one can see the unrealistic ship responses in pitch resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 in reality roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 is considered as the most dangerous case for the pitch roll system therefore this paper deals with the practical pitch roll responses in roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 the values of wave encounter frequencies ω e 1 ω e 2 are selected as 0 842 0 86 and 0 9 for the disturbances of case 1 f 1 0 1 f 2 0 004 and case 2 f 1 f 2 0 03 pitch responses show various oscillatory patterns such as period 2 motion in fig 6 a torsional pattern in fig 6 b pitch instability in fig 6 c and irregular torsional behaviours in fig 6 d naturally these responses vary depending on the initial conditions thus the pitch motion seems to be difficult to suppress not only the pitch resonance ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 1 2 ω n 2 but also the roll resonance ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 parametric roll resonance can be seen as a modest increase in fig 7 a and a dramatic rise in fig 6 c contrary to pitch responses roll motions repeat the increasing and decreasing patterns at regular intervals on increasing the value of wave encounter frequencies roll angle oscillates more frequently as shown in fig 7 b and d finally it is hard to say that external disturbances acting on the ship such as the big longitudinal wave and weak beam wave are safer in the pitch roll modes both disturbances of case 1 and case 2 are dangerous as time goes to infinity in specific parameters 4 control performance under active controllers when the harmonic waves are excited on marine vessels the pitch roll system exhibits the complex dynamical behaviours the novel control schemes are aiming to solve the control problems of robust stabilization and performance with convergence of pitch and roll modes and chattering reduction within finite times simultaneously since marine vessels easily capsize due to the unexpected roll motion rather than pitch motion control synthesis will be realized based on the situation of roll resonance near ω e 1 ω e 2 ω n 2 also careful attention is necessary for pitch control because complex dynamical behaviours appear near roll resonance frequency the numerical tests are conducted based on the disturbances of case 1 f 1 0 1 f 2 0 004 ω e 1 ω e 2 0 842 and disturbances of case 2 f 1 0 03 f 2 0 03 ω e 1 ω e 2 0 9 with ic of case 1 θ 0 0 01 θ 0 0 φ 0 0 01 φ 0 0 the transient response can be described by two important factors the swiftness and the accuracy of the responses the dynamic characteristics of the desired performance are usually specified in terms of time domain quantities it is noted that fractional order models are superset of integer order models generally more complicated dynamics and high sensitivity to initial conditions can be observed in fractional order control systems compared to integer order counterparts 4 1 optimal parameters based on best practices approach in this simulation the controllers are activated at 230 s for both pitch and roll modes in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of fractional order derivative α in equation 15 the time domain responses for fosmc asmc and afosmc are presented in figs 8 15 in which adaptive sliding mode control asmc is the control strategy for the integer order of α 1 0 in the numerical simulation some parameters in equation 15 for control algorithms are selected as afosmc method α 0 1 λ 1 10 λ

3 0 2 λ 4 50 λ 5 10 and λ 6 30 also the afopid method will be illustrated for performance comparison as selecting following parameter values afopid method λ 0 1 μ 0 1 pitch α k 1 500 α k 2 0 1 α k 3 0 1 roll α k 4 1 2 α k 5 0 5 α k 6 0 4 these parameters are chosen through many trials based on the following criteria controlled systems should be converged in finite time by the selected parameters peak phenomena of pitch and roll motion should be avoided as much as possible the second criterion means that some parameters resulted in strong convergence of pitch and roll responses however an extreme peak phenomenon emerged at the control action especially in implementing a fractional order smc controller due to its fragile feature it is possible to bring a slamming impact on the hull in pitch motion or excessive heeling condition to the ship s side so this paper proposed the novel adaptive law including leakage term in fractional order smc method therefore asmc also shows satisfactory convergence of pitch and roll motions in specific parameters using novel adaptation law however intense shortcomings turned out in the sliding surface control parameters are selected as the optimal selection considering main goals in the parts of states convergences peak phenomena control activities sliding surfaces in order to select the superb parameters for each control method it is worthwhile to start at the reference values as low as possible then the system designer can consider the both λ 2 λ 1 λ 3 λ 1 λ 5 λ 4 and λ 6 λ 4 with various values in equation 15 in general the parameters λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 λ 5 λ 6 ℜ in sliding variables determine the accuracy and speed of convergence for control algorithms it can be advantageous for the control designer to choose the bigger denominator and lower numerator rather than vice versa in the proposed afosmc the integral term in equation 10 helps to suppress the unstable amplification in infinite times as well as reduction of peak phenomena especially for the fractional order control method also some parameters of the adaptive law including leakage term γ 1 γ 2 ς 1 ς 2 are related to the smooth convergence and the peak phenomena of pitch and roll responses in order to solve the chattering the discontinuous term is replaced by continuous smooth approximation using the value of free parameter η 1 0 4 2 state convergence and control activity fig 8 depicts the controlled responses of pitch angle and angular speed respectively it can be observed that the pitch oscillations decrease effectively by all three controllers except rate control by afopid even though afopid shows more strengths than other controllers in pitch and roll angle suppression it is vulnerable to the rate control especially primary big head waves disturbances of case1 fig 8 b reveals the peak phenomena of fosmc at the control action due to the fragile feature of the fractional order control method this problem is considered as one of the hardships in suppressing the pitch rate however afosmc has achieved the goal of fast convergence with peak amplitude reduction fig 9 shows the controlled pitch motion under the disturbances of case 2 afopid does not shrink from comparison with other fosmc asmc and afosmc in case of pitch angle fosmc also illustrates good performance in pitch rate control due to the relatively weaker disturbances therefore adaptive law is helpful in controlling big wave excitations owing to adaptation law in equation 16 angle rate control by asmc has treated properly in both disturbances of case 1 and 2 as shown in figs 8 and 9 as for roll angle suppression all four controllers accomplished the control goals within a 5 s period as illustrated in fig 10 a and 11 a even though the roll rate is reduced by afopid as illustrated in fig 10 b it has the limit of the elimination of all errors in the coupled pitch roll system one can see a better performance of control accuracy in steady state responses by the proposed afosmc from the magnification zoom of a part of responses in fig 10 a and 11 a when the control designer is eager to reduce the amounts of errors via fosmc and asmc algorithms the other parts will be deteriorated eventually figs 12 and 13 shows the control activities for pitch and roll motions by the combined actions of rudders and fins discontinuous high frequency phenomena are not observed in the system responses the switching part of the control law in equation 14 guides the state trajectories on the sliding surface no matter what disturbances excite lee et al 2020a the chattering is almost attenuated with a smooth approximation step and fractional order scheme since the switching control action could cause the failure of actuators with fatigue loads chattering mitigation is important when exploiting the smc based control schemes figs 12 15 demonstrates that the control burden is an inevitable factor for integer order control method or non adaptive control approach in a susceptible pitch roll system under two regular disturbances only a small amount of control cost is enough to suppress the pitch roll motions by afosmc whereas high control activities are necessary to obtain better performance results in case of non integer asmc method or non adaptive fosmc as shown in figs 12 and 13 if the parameter values increase by asmc it shows better convergence of four state variables however control activities increase exponentially it is regarded as a fundamental disadvantage of the non integer asmc method control activities highly depend on the variations of the sliding variables the sum of position error and rate error quickly go down to zero within finite times using the proposed controllers figs 14 and 15 illustrate the sliding surface of pitch and roll motions by fosmc asmc and afosmc non integer asmc depicts 30 to 90 times larger than the result of afosmc it means that non integer order control demands more control loads for suppressing the pitch and roll rate as shown in the magnification zoom of figs 14 and 15 zigzag behaviours are not observed after arriving at the sliding surface thus the control action achieves the second goal of alleviating the chattering of actuators and sliding variables by the fractional order control synthesis 4 3 performance evaluation for optimizing the vessel control system an appropriate objective function is needed to better evaluate the system performance and check design objectives the control performance of the dynamical system is usually assessed based on its transient behaviours such as peak magnitude and settling time generally two types of assessment indices and cost functions by utilizing the error signals can be expressed as 38 i s e 0 e t 2 d t 39 i a e 0 e t d t where the ise represents the integral squared error and iae means the integral of absolute error ise penalizes the large errors more and would be preferred if the system designers have constraint on the maximum error however iae measures the increased error in the pitch roll system table 1 indicates the numerical values of performance indices for the control method under disturbances of case 1 afopid and afosmc show the best control quality for pitch and roll angle suppression whereas fosmc asmc and afosmc represent good performances in rate stabilization as described in table 2 the proposed afosmc performs better in terms of angle and rate suppression it is clear that the problem of pitch rate suppression can be effectively treated by adaptation law and fractional order approach 4 4 effects of initial conditions on the controlled system performance the pitch roll system is subjected to the longitudinal and transversal waves disturbances of case 1 and 2 affected by the initial conditions especially in pitch angle and pitch rate the effects of initial conditions on pitch responses are clearly illustrated in the phase planes in figs 16 and 17 where control action starts at t 230 sec when the magnitude of wave excitation force changes to f 1 f 2 0 03 the pitch angle responses of the ic of case 1 dash line decrease whereas the responses by the ic of case 2 dot line are amplified more than doubled in addition these phenomena are portrayed in the pitch angular velocity in fig 17 therefore it needs to be aware of initial conditions resulting in the doubled oscillations even under the same disturbances from these characteristics it is notable that marine vessels are exposed to the potential danger due to the inherent practical conditions such as heeling degrees as well as wave excitation forces in the ocean environment 4 5 effects of fractional order on the controlled system performance one of the advantages of afosmc is exploiting the diversity of the fractional order calculus fig 18 portrayed the pitch and roll responses under disturbances of case 1 and ic of case 1 there are no severe peaks for the system responses when the control action begins in case of α 0 1 as shown in the magnification zoom of fig 18 a decrease in the number of fractional order derivatives leads to an increase in the control performances such as error reduction and fast convergence especially on increasing the value of the fractional order derivative roll angle hardly converges to zero within finite times when it comes to using afosmc it is necessary to check the vessel responses after arriving at the desired values 4 6 controlled pitch roll system figs 19 and 20 show the controlled phase portraits of the pitch roll system one can see the qualitative features including the periodic orbits of the pitch roll motions on the phase plane the trajectories starting from any initial positions go down to the center position eventually the symmetry breaking features period 2 motion and torus attractor can be observed in pitch motion depending on the initial conditions depicted in fig 19 the magnitude of roll motion is highly dependent on the wave encounter frequencies including resonance phenomena and wave excitation forces acting on the transversal direction finally the controlled pitch and roll responses show insensitive to the initial conditions since pitch and roll modes are subject to the surface equation itself 5 conclusions the novel fractional order control synthesis has been presented for suppressing complex pitch and roll oscillations of marine vessels under two regular waves since 2dof pitch roll modes are strongly coupled with each other for dynamic maneuvering at sea various dynamical patterns can be observed in fact the pitch and roll responses are greatly dependent on the initial conditions wave encounter frequencies natural frequencies and wave excitation forces the pitch and roll resonance phenomena are systematically illustrated by using phase portraits and the bifurcation techniques numerous design schemes afopid fosmc asmc and afosmc of controller have been realized in order to provide robust performance and stability for marine vessels against exogenous disturbances extensive simulation results support the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes in addition the control strategies are evaluated by appropriate comparisons demonstrating satisfactory results as well as advantages finally the afosmc algorithm is one of the powerful methods for alleviating coupled pitch and roll

21114,the understanding of the internal gaseous flow of artificially ventilated supercavities is developed using a locally homogenous multiphase computational fluid dynamics model that is benchmarked using experimental data the solutions indicate that gas leakage from a ventilated supercavity originates from the gaseous shear layers forming at the gas water interface not only do these observations corroborate previous theory developed for cavities with toroidal closure they also display evidence that shear layer mechanisms remain important for cavities in the twin vortex regime and when interacting with bodies it is also found that the treatment of turbulence in these shear layers affects the outcome of computational fluid dynamics approaches lastly a semi empirical model considering these shear layers is proposed results from the model indicate an improved prediction capability of the relationship between cavity size and ventilation rate for steady twin vortex supercavities keywords supercavitation ventilation turbulence multiphase cfd 1 introduction in a typical supercavitation application a submerged vehicle is enveloped in a gaseous cavity with the overall goal of drag reduction this drag reduction is achieved by significantly reducing the wetted area of a vehicle hull which consequentially reduces viscous drag such a concept can be considered for application to high speed marine vehicles one method to form these gaseous cavities is through vaporous cavitation the alternative referred to as artificial supercavitation relies on the injection of a non condensable gas such as air to form the cavity the present effort only considers air ventilated artificial supercavities for artificially supercavitating vehicles gas entrainment impacts range and cavity shape control in steady operation mass conservation demands that the ventilation requirement is equal to the amount of gas entrained from the cavity through this requirement the gas entrainment rate correlates to ventilation demands a relationship between the cavity shape and ventilation rate is thus closed through models of the gas entrainment rate leaving the cavity models that relate input parameters i e ventilation rate to the cavity size are critical for designing hull forms positioning control surfaces and vehicle controller models the cavity closure mode is important to gas entrainment the cavities considered here are restricted to those formed downstream of a wetted cavitator which may be approximated as a circular disk with the surrounding liquid flow moving horizontally such that the cavity forms under the vertical influence of gravity for these conditions supercavities have three basic closure patterns defined as 1 twin vortex 2 toroidal vortex and 3 pulsation twin vortex cavities are those most strongly influenced by buoyancy and are characterized by a pair of relativity stable axially aligned gaseous vortices that form at the cavity closure point campbell and hilborne 1958 cox and clayden 1955 epshtein 1970 1973 logvinovich 1972 these vortices form the main path for air entrainment and are driven by buoyant forces on the cavity toroidal vortex closing cavities have less influence from buoyancy and are best described as the large scale shedding of toroidal shaped pockets of gas campbell and hilborne 1958 semenenko 2001 using what appears to be an empirical basis campbell and hilborne 1958 approximate that the delineator of twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities are established when the product of the cavitation number σ c p p c 0 5 ρ v 2 and froude number f n v g d n is equal to unity when σ c f r n values are less than unity the twin vortex closure appears for values greater than unity toroidal vortex closure is expected note that d n is the cavitator diameter and is the length scale normally used in supercavitation beyond this work the transition between twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities has been explored in several other efforts karn et al 2016 karn and rosiejka 2017 kawakami and arndt 2011 m p kinzel et al 2007 wosnik et al 2003 lastly cavity pulsation is a third type of closure exhibiting strong oscillations that periodically influence the entire length of the cavity paryshev 2006 skidmore 2012 song 1962 when designing supercavitation applications cavity closure regime is important for example switching from twin vortex to toroidal vortex cavities leads to a large change in cavity size cavity stability and cavity ventilation requirements not only do these factors impact loading complexity they also relate to ventilation storage requirements as these cavities can transition in between any of these modes during operation designers must consider them all thus there is a strong need to understand how to model each cavity type the present work focuses on improving the state of the art of both computational fluid dynamics cfd and semi empirical modeling of gas entrainment from toroidal and twin vortex cavities that directly correlates to the ventilation requirements here we briefly review present models of supercavities with respect to gas entrainment models first consider the nondimensional parameters established as relevant for the behavior of ventilated supercavities in general the cavitation number σ c is the prime parameter of interest as it relates to cavity shape and cavitator drag logvinovich 1972 may 1975 semenenko 2001 the gas ventilation rate q can be considered as a method of altering σ c q can be nondimensionalized by the cavitator diameter d n and the free stream speed v resulting in the gas entrainment coefficient c q c q q v d n 2 the connection between c q and σ c is the gas entrainment rate for a steady state cavity the gas entrained i e escaping from the cavity is equivalent to the ventilation rate hence there is a relation between c q and σ c that drives the need to model gas entrainment rate several models for c q as a function of σ c have been developed throughout the literature campbell and hilborne 1958 cox and clayden 1955 epshtein 1970 spurk 2002 in general the dependency is defined as the ventilation requirement to sustain a cavity having a specific value of σ c such models describe the c q σ c relationship and have f r n re and weber number dependencies note that the surface tension related weber number dependency is more related to micro scale interfacial wave length scales epshtein 1970 one important point about these relations is that the models are closure specific i e twin vortex or toroidal cavity hence correctly capturing these features over a range of cavity sizes and scales presents a challenge for model development first consider modeling gas entrainment from a twin vortex cavity in such cavity which closes with two axially aligned gas tubes the amount of air entrained is often based on approximating the gas flow rate in those tubes the size of the tubes can be calculated using the circulation about the centerline of a cavity driven by the cavity buoyant force when the circulation is conserved about the twin vortex tubes the area of the twin vortices can be estimated closure of the model demands the mean axial velocity through the tube v vt multiplying v vt by this area yields the gas entrainment rate campbell and hilborne 1958 the model has been redefined kinzel et al 2009 in terms of the cavity dimension correlations of r c and l c from semenenko 2001 the result is a physically identically model with different underlying cavity size correlations the modified model for air entrainment rate is given as 1 c q c h m π a 2 1 σ c 2 47 6 k f r n d i s k 4 σ c 4 v v t v note that a and k are empirical parameters that are roughly 2 0 and 1 0 respectively semenenko 2001 the remaining unclosed parameter is v vt which does not have a formal model and is generally assumed to be v campbell and hilborne 1958 it is believed that this is an important gap to be closed in air entrainment modeling for twin vortex cavities the gas entrainment from cavities closing in a toroidal vortex pattern occurs via gaseous toroidal shaped shedding cavities the gas entrainment of these cavities was demonstrated to occur through the reentrant jet splashing on the cavity walls creating micro cavities that eventually exit the cavity through these toroidal vortical structures epshtein 1973 these micro cavities and the resultant gas entrainment rate were shown to be influenced by both viscous and surface tension effects a more recent theory correlates the gas drawn by interfacial shear layers to the gas entrained by toroidal cavities spurk 2002 spurk argues that the gas is pulled to the aft end of the cavity via shear mechanisms at the cavity interface and that the resultant gaseous shear layer dominates the air entrained by the large scale toroidal cavities thus spurk quantifies the air entrainment through the physical approximations to the gaseous shear layers at the cavity interface predictions using the theory of spurk agree with experimental measurements over a range of conditions building compelling evidence that in a limiting condition i e long cavities with no transverse gravity field toroidal cavity gas entrainment is dependent on interfacial shear layers the model reduces to the following semi empirical form 2 c q s p a r k k q 1 σ c σ c 1 σ c l n 1 σ c application of the model implies using experimental measurements of c q and σ c from a single cavity instance to solve for k q which enables an empirical model that can be extrapolated to other ventilation rates this model has shown to perform well against many experimental measurements an aspect that is not clear is that spurk s theory emphasizes a strong relationship between gas shear layers and air entrainment from toroidal cavities but theory does not directly consider these effects for twin vortex cavities in this work cfd simulations are used to develop an understanding of the gaseous regions of a supercavitating flow and utilize this insight to improve modeling to develop confidence in the cfd the gas entrainment predictions are benchmarked against experimental measurements the resulting cfd flow fields are then interrogated with a goal of extracting physical insight into the gas entrainment process these observations are then used to discuss difficulties of traditional cfd in predicting the gas entrainment rate additionally the physical insights are used to guide the development of a new gas entrainment model that incorporates air entrainment theory for toroidal vortex cavities into theory for twin vortex cavities i e with a goal of improving the model for v v t the resulting semi empirical model helps to bridge a gap between closure patterns i e twin vortex to toroidal this work advances the previous effort of kinzel et al 2009 in the description of the of gaseous shear layers provides an improved physical based model of gas entrainment and benchmarks the model with respect to a broader set of experimental data 2 methods the cfd method used in this work is based on the cfd code uncle m which has an established pedigree in simulating supercavtating flows an overview of the model formulation and numerical schemes are well documented in other works kunz et al 2003 stinebring et al 2001 in general the cfd code is a finite volume formulation that solves the locally homogeneous gas liquid mixture navier stokes equations the present cfd simulations use higher order numerics formally third order accurate in space second order accurate in time turbulence models spanning from reynolds averaged navier stokes rans to detached eddy simulation des and structured overset grids in addition spatial and temporal requirements have already been determined kinzel 2008 and are used in the context of the present work note that as demanded in the eddy resolving des model the time step size ensures courant numbers u δ t δ x smaller than unity in the turbulent cavity region we draw on this developed experience base to provide the insight on supercavitating flows with reasonable confidence in terms of the multiphase flow aspects of the solver the bulk of the simulations in this work are based on liquid water and air as the ventilation gas it is argued that the character observed for air should be extendable to other supply gases but does not directly apply to gas generated and lost due to evaporation and condensation processes hence the present efforts have an underlying assumption of operation at depth hence such natural cavitation phenomena relevant to shallow running vehicles are not considered such an assumption is common for idealized artificial supercavitation scenarios at depth and enables the focus on air entrainment processes 3 results and discussion the following cfd results are used to highlight and improve the understanding of the mechanisms of gas entrainment from a supercavity the overall process develops a cfd model benchmarking process against experimental data using a combination of these benchmarked results combined with extension of the model to other closure types detailed insight into the flow inside a gaseous cavity is developed the overall results are interpreted to understand both cfd turbulence model performance and identify missing phenomena within air entrainment models for twin vortex cavities 3 1 benchmark gas entrainment prediction on supercavitating body in this section the ability to predict the gas entrainment rate is established against experimental measurements schauer 2003 wosnik et al 2003 the subject article is the supercavitating body shown in fig 1 the cfd model simulates the test with free stream conditions corresponding to a re n ρvd n μ of 56 000 and a fr n of 26 7 simulated within a water tunnel i e the walls are included these simulations are performed for a range of ventilation c q values additionally the support strut was included for several selected cases c q 0 125 and 0 25 the validation metric demands correlation between the experiment and cfd in the prediction of the cavity pressure variation with respect to ventilation rate i e c q σ relation in these assessments two turbulence model approaches are evaluated the first is based on an unsteady rans urans formulation lindau et al 2002 with a time step size corresponding to 0 05 d n v while the second uses a des approach m kinzel et al 2007 with a time step size of 0 005 d n v both models are within the temporal requirements demanded for supercavitation kinzel 2008 for the ventilated cavity fig 2 contains a survey of water tunnel experimental measurements and computational evaluations over a range of conditions with and without a strut as is typical in supercavitation reporting cavitation number is plotted on the horizontal axis and c q is plotted on the vertical axis recall c q is a dimensionless ventilation rate that as determined via mass conservation is equivalent to the entrainment rate in a steady cavity fig 2 a contains computational results from the urans approach in this plot two modeled configurations are compared to the experiment 1 the isolated cavitator body configuration and 2 the as tested cavitator body configuration supported with a strut to estimate the effect of the entire range of the urans model results with a strut the two modeled strut cases were used to calibrate the no strut results in fig 2 b a similar comparison for des is provided as discussed below these results are used to understand the influence of turbulence models with respect to the experiments in the evaluation of fig 2 first consider results from the present urans formulation plotted in fig 2 a the results suggest that the urans model without the inclusion of the strut predicts the experimental behavior well however when the urans based model considers a more faithful geometry that includes the strut the predictions significantly deviate from the experiment this result suggests that 1 the urans model without a strut compared well with the experiment by chance and that 2 the urans model fails in an accurate representation of the experiment hence when the present urans formulation is applied to supercavitation it appears to have a model bias in the cavity response to the ventilation rate alternatively consider the des model results presented in fig 2 b there the strut included cfd better approximates the experimental measurements hence in the context of this test case and turbulence model des appears to captures the salient physics required for the prediction of air entrainment whereas this urans model completely fails such a finding suggests that the c q σ prediction may be sensitive to the turbulence model approach such a model issue will be explored in additional detail from physical perspectives an evaluation of differences between the urans and des focuses on the differences in the predicted eddy viscosity ν t in a boussinesq based urans approach the turbulence affects the mean flow via the turbulent eddy viscosity ν t in the des model approach ν t is reduced in regions where the mesh can support unsteady simulation of eddy structures in fig 3 the predicted ν t is plotted for the des and urans simulations at identical conditions both cases exhibit elevated ν t values near the interface however the des simulation exhibits significantly lower ν t values than the urans case the results tend to suggest that the reduced ν t values relate to the improved results observed in fig 2 3 2 observed gas entrainment behavior in fig 4 the cfd solutions are interrogated to ascertain the dominant mechanisms of air entrainment in the figure the body is colored gray and the inlet ports are colored pink a grayscale contour plot of the gas volume fraction along the symmetry plane is used to provide insight on the location of the supercavity where the black indicates gas and gray indicates liquid in order to highlight regions of axial moving gas a local rate of gas entrainment is defined as 3 c q 1 α g u v here α g is the gas volume fraction u is the axial velocity and v is the reference free stream velocity scalar c q l indicates the local aft wards moving gas through a cavity note that a time averaged surface integral of c q l over any plane perpendicular to the axial direction and aft of the cavitator is equal to the overall gas entrainment rate divided by the free stream velocity this parameter is used to illustrate the gas entrainment processes the results from c q l are plotted on the colored contour plots at the axial location at the maximum cavity diameter in addition streamlines are plotted to provide insight into the flow path of the entrained gas red and recirculated gas purple a useful result from computations for supercavity applications would be the differentiation of leakage behavior when the cavity closure is interrupted by interaction with a body the plots in fig 4 highlight the gaseous flow inside the cavity at two steady ventilation rates 1 c q 0 45 where a partial cavity is formed and interacts with the body fig 4 a and b and 2 c q 1 0 which has a supercavity that fully envelopes the body fig 4 c and d note that the ventilation rate was increasing from lower values in both of these simulations in the results of fig 4 the contour plots of c q l indicate elevated positive values near the cavity interface this indicates that gas shear layers form at the cavity interface although the negative values of c q l are not shown in the contour levels they do exist in the regions near the body the reverse flow can still be observed in the recirculating streamlines in comparing fig 4 a and c the red streamlines entrained gas are traced from the cavity interface region for both partial and supercavities the streamlines indicate a most direct path from ventilation ports into the shear layers and out of the cavity in fig 4 b and d the purple streamlines are seeded within the core of the cavity in both cases the streamlines indicate that the cavity gas within this region remains nearly isolated and recirculatory these results affirm the hypothesis that shear layers remain important spurk 2002 with and without cavity body interactions the next case considers air entrainment from a twin vortex cavity for a configuration with a small body that is expected to not affect gas entrainment an illustration of the conical shaped cavitator is in fig 5 such a 15 half angle cavitator has been previously studied experimentally kiceniuk 1954 may 1975 note the existence of a small body that is anticipated to be negligible to the air entrainment process to extend the evaluations to another condition the cavitator is set to a lifting configuration by pitching the cavitator 4 4 deg providing a lift coefficient of roughly 0 1 the corresponding conditions are re n 3 2 10 7 fr n 72 0 and c q 1 0 using this particular case validation of the current computational approach for determining cavitator forces has been established kinzel 2008 such a lifting condition is known to alter the cavity and closure behavior the goal is to display similar physical mechanisms with such variations a series of visualizations the cavity shape and internal gas flow inside a twin vortex type cavity are provided in fig 6 a gray scale contour plots the gas volume fraction along the symmetry plane to highlight the cavity location here black indicates high content of gas gray indicates gas liquid mixtures and pure liquid is white the cavity clearly envelopes the small body within in the cavity also colored white there are also several streamlines plotted selectively positioned to highlight the origin of the gas passing through various points in the cavity the points the streamlines pass through are highlighted with the large symbols additionally the streamlines are colored by a normalized axial pressure gradient d n c p x which indicates the pressure force acting on the gas negative values imply forcing the fluid downstream whereas positive values force the gas upstream note that c p is the pressure coefficient given as c p p p 1 2 ρ v 2 lastly the colored contour plots lines of c q l are plotted on several axial planes along the length of the supercavity these contour plots indicate the axial flow distribution of gas through the cavity for these contours negative values of c q l highlight regions where gas moves upstream and positive values highlight where gas flows aftward additionally although the three dimensional cavity outline is not plotted the extents of these c q l contours indicate the outline of the supercavity the plot also indicates the axial position where the twin vortex character forms which is best observed in the lower portion of the c q l contour plots shifting upwards due to the buoyant forces elevating the cavity these plots are to be used to construct a picture of the air entrainment process consider the c q l contour plots in fig 6 a recall that the colored spectrum contour line plots at select axial locations indicate the c q l profile along the cavity axis the values of c q l are most positive near the gas liquid interface and tend towards negative in the core of the cavity such behavior indicates that the aftward gaseous flow is dominated by physics local to the interface region there are two obvious mechanisms that can lead to the aftward flow through the cavity 1 the water at the interface pulling the gas via viscous mechanisms or 2 the initial momentum of the jet from the ventilation gas it is argued that the aftward forcing from the water acting on the gas is the dominate factor which is suggested through three mechanisms observed in the results first the jet is expected to quickly dissipate its momentum in the cavity which is not a sustained force through the cavity secondly gas moving upstream is observed to be fully redirected downstream by the water pulling on the cavity gas fig 4 a third the gas is also observed to be pulled into these cavity shear layers from the recirculatory portions of the cavity that do not have an initial momentum from the jet fig 4 b and d now consider the behavior of the gas as it approaches the end of the cavity as displayed in figs 4 d and fig 6 b it is observed that as the gas transverses along the cavity interface to the aft end of the cavity near the end of the cavity the gas encounters an increasing pressure indicated by the positive pressure gradient it is believed that this increased pressure is due to the converging of streamlines interestingly at this position in the cavity some of the gas appears to be redirected upstream based on these results gas can either 1 remain attached and continue to be pulled out of the cavity through the twin vortex tubes or 2 be redirected back into the cavity by the changing pressure in fig 6 quasi steady streamlines are used to demonstrate the flow history of gas present in the aft end of the cavity these streamlines were actually constructed from their terminal point and constructed backward in time at various c q l magnitudes originating from the penultimate c q l contour plot the terminal points origins of construction of these streamlines are shown by red and green spheres the planar section chosen near the closure of the cavity is expected to be representative of the sampled gas ultimate path i e exit or remain in the cavity hence in the aft most planes the regions colored by green contours indicate gas with the strongest tendency to exit the cavity i e highlights the entrained gas in fig 6 a the streamlines are intended to indicate entraining gas by seeding the streamlines at high c q l levels at c q l 0 2 note that numerical diffusion of α g leads to a deficit in c q l approaching the interfaces nevertheless the aim is to highlight the origin of entraining air and these plots indicates the regions where the bulk of the entrained air originates from interestingly the streamlines originate directly from the injection port thus the injected gas is entrained directly into cavity boundary shear layers and out of the cavity in fig 6 b the quasi steady streamlines highlight gas that is recirculated back into the cavity these streamlines are traced from a point with the most negative c q l values at c q l 0 6 the results indicate that the gas in the cavity core behaves like a separated wake region that interacts with the interface shear layer interpreting the plots constructed in fig 6 helps to identify key features not present in current gas entrainment models specifically theory indicates the importance of interfacial shear layers spurk 2002 however it is observed for twin vortex cavities that on average a net portion of this shear layer gas is stripped and recirculated back into the cavity as it approaches the cavity terminus such a thinning shear layer corresponds to an increasing pressure note the axial pressure gradient color on the streamlines suggesting that there may be a streamline that stagnations at the end of the wake region similar to that described in paryshev 2006 such stagnation streamlines are expected to occur at the delineation between entrained gas from the cavity and the recirculating gas interior to the stagnation streamlines the interfacial shear gas is recovered into the cavity alternatively gas exterior to the stagnation streamlines is entrained from the cavity such a process appears to be critical to air entrainment and is not considered in models the present observations indicate that cavity shear layers are important for gas entrainment from twin vortex supercavities as shear layers typically scale with viscous effects reynolds number scaling may also be evident in general the physical models applied to modeling air entrainment from twin vortex cavities ignore viscous effects and reynolds number scaling logvinovich 1972 may 1975 semenenko 2001 models of air entrainment from toroidal supercavities on the other hand have in the past considered reynolds number scaling epshtein 1970 semenenko 2001 spurk 2002 in fig 7 the aftward moving gas moving rightward in the figure is again highlighted using computed c q l inside cavities formed behind disk cavitators the solutions are shown at identical ventilation rates and froude numbers but vary re n from 1 0 10 5 to 1 0 10 7 note that such a study aims to focus the impact of viscous effects on the artificial supercavity these solutions are all based on the des methodology it is observed that the velocity character within the supercavity shear layers is a function of the reynolds number specifically as would be expected a thickened shear layer can be observed when the reynolds number decreases as indicated by the thicker dark regions along cavity interfaces from these reynolds numbers varying simulations velocity profiles were extracted inside the supercavity at several axial stations these profiles are plotted in fig 8 in this plot the axial velocity normalized by v is added to the axial position providing insight into the velocity profiles in general the inside of the cavity generally has a velocity near zero with respect to the cavitator approaching the cavity interface a shear layer is formed and the velocity increases to roughly v additionally in the plot are several blow ups intended to show more detail of the shear layer profiles each of these blow ups consistently displays the shear layer occurring at the gas liquid interface as well as its relative thickness for the various reynolds numbers as expected there is an inverse relationship with the shear layer thickness and reynolds number as a first order assumption reynolds number is not considered in supercavitation these results indicate that there is a possibility that reynolds number may have some impact especially for small scale testing although not evaluated it is hypothesized that such an influence can also occur for body filled cavities with tight clearances for such conditions the body can potentially interfere with the shear layer such a factor would become increasingly important for low reynolds numbers the cfd results indicate that shear mechanisms of toroidal cavities spurk 2002 are of similar importance in the gas entrainment from twin vortex cavities this is therefore a key physical process relevant to gas entrainment modeling of supercavitation these observations have extended beyond the present effort and have also been observed in more recent efforts fronzeo et al 2017 kinzel et al 2017 accurate modeling of gas entrainment requires that liquid attached gas shear layer including the effect of shear layer thinning in the aft regions of the cavity be accurately captured thus in the following sections these attributes are assessed and addressed in the context of both cfd models and semi empirical theory 3 3 air entrainment sensitivity to turbulence model in this section turbulence model sensitivity is evaluated with respect to the insight developed within the previous section the specific aim is to show that turbulence modeling greatly influences resolved cavity shear layers and hence will greatly influence any result using cfd to predict air entrainment it has been found that the predictions of the c q σ c relation using viscous cfd is sensitive to turbulence modeling kinzel m p et al 2007 such sensitivities are highlighted in fig 2 where the urans model poorly captures the c q σ c relation but the des model appears much more accurate evaluations of these results are used to develop insight into turbulence modeling and its relation to air entrainment in order to understand cfd model sensitivity with respect to turbulence modeling observed in fig 2 the modeled levels of turbulence are bounded in cfd simulations of a supercavitating flow these turbulence level bounding model evaluations focus on the cavity gas behavior near the cavity interface for this evaluation we explore a non buoyant axisymmetric toroidal supercavity this case has with few physics distracting focus from the cavity shear layer is simulated using identical computational meshes free stream conditions and ventilation rates two simulations are performed 1 a rans turbulence model k ε is used to obtain results at one extreme and 2 no turbulence model no tm is used to obtain results on the other extreme note that the no tm case is not intended to be a direct numerical simulation but a lower bound on the modeled turbulence the goal of this study is to measure the sensitivity to turbulence modeling by isolating its aggregate effects on gas entrainment results for this study are presented in fig 9 where the extracted velocity profiles at an axial location 20 8 radii downstream of the cavitator are plotted the plot specifically compares the velocity profiles of the rans to no tm results here the horizontal axis is a measure of the axial gas velocity plotted as s i g n u v v where positive values yield gas traveling aftward and negative values indicate recirculating gas the vertical axis represents the distance from the cavity interface into the cavity deviations in the predictions indicate the effect of the turbulence model on the cavity gas flow first consider the near interface behaviors i e at d d n 0 0 the initial behavior moving away from this point indicates that the no tm and rans model results differ for the rans model result the gas sustains a velocity near that of the interfacial velocity for a much larger distance than that of the no tm indicating thicker shear layers and additional shear layer entrainment away from the interface this simulations display an interesting character in comparing the amounts of reverse flow in figs 8 and 9 the reverse flow in fig 8 i e the regions where the axial velocity profiles are left of the base of the arrows is much less than observed in fig 9 i e where the axial velocity profile is left of the dashed line at zero on the x axis it making such a comparison it is important to realize that the cavity in fig 8 is a twin vortex one modeled using des while the cavity in fig 9 is toroidal and modeled with the bounding turbulence models no tm and rans since the des model result does not appear to fall between the rans and no tm cases it may suggest that twin vortex cavities have a lower axial flow however additional evaluations are necessary to make a developed conclusion secondly and specific to the simulations depicted in fig 9 the no tm simulation was supplied gas beyond what the cavity shear layers could support the result is a transition process of the recirculating gas flow to an axial gas flow through the center of the supercavity transition to axial flow is the cause for the sharp change in the no tm curve at the s i g n u v v value of 0 45 because of this it is difficult to measure the thickness of the shear layers hence we focus to the shear layer character near the interface near the interface the no tm solution solid line displays a significantly thinner shear layer than that of the rans model dashed line this is indicated in the lower values of s i g n u v v that the no tm result predicts as compared to with the rans model the gap between the shear layer entrained gas is indicated in fig 9 which highlights how a standard rans model leads to an increased airentrainment the generalized effect implies that 1 predicting gas entrainment processes i e the c q σ c relation using cfd is sensitive to the turbulence model and 2 rans models tend to increases the entrainment of gas in the shear layer the clear link between turbulence modeling and modeled air entrainment is now established and assessed in the context of the benchmark case fig 2 recall from fig 2 a for a given ventilation rate urans yields a cavity that is too small however the des obtained c q σ c fig 2 b closely approximates the experimental measurements it is believed that the urans approach yields excessive entrainment in shear layers thus des should lie somewhere between the rans and no tm these observations suggest that the reduced eddy viscosities in the des model observed in fig 3 enables the accurate c q σ c predictions and indicates that a urans formulation over estimates the eddy viscosity in these interfacial shear layers consider the cause for this over production of turbulence within the interfacial shear layer a typical turbulence model is well tuned for wall bounded flows but not formulated specifically to an interfacial shear layer flow the turbulence model constants are generally calibrated for different types of shear layers and further controlled using damping functions to match boundary conditions however the gas liquid interface of a supercavity is a different kind of shear layer almost like a wall bounded layer for the gas flow but not exactly as the modeling constants are not tuned nor is a damping function applied to satisfy a boundary condition at the interface such an over prediction may be expected additionally this issue has previously been observed and corrected in similar multiphase flow scenarios in the work of lo et al 2010 such sensitivities suggest that in the vicinity of gas liquid interfaces caution must be taken in applying turbulence models and imply obvious issues that beg further modeling 3 4 improved models of gas entrainment the present simulations suggest that an air entrainment theory developed in consideration of toroidal cavities spurk 2002 can be applied at least partly to twin vortex cavities accordingly widely accepted gas entrainment models are adapted to include shear layer thinning effects into twin vortex cavities the goal of incorporating these physical mechanisms into gas entrainment models is to provide a more physically accurate model 3 4 1 concept overview a model of gas entrainment combining the theory based for toroidal vortex spurk 2002 and twin vortex campbell and hilborne 1958 air entrainment is developed where the theories are linked through a concept of a thinning shear layer consider the model components for a twin vortex cavity in fig 10 therein the gray regions represent the gas within the interfacial shear layers the white regions represent the cavity regions outside the shear layer fig 10 a indicates a near horizontal plane cut through the cavity such that it indicates the cavitator cavity and both vortex tubes fig 10 b highlights two selected axial planes a a through the maximum cavity radius location and b b is through one of the vortex tubes the estimations of the shear layer displacement thickness are gray colored regions that consists of gas carried at the liquid velocity v sl entrained gas due to shear for simplicity v sl is assumed to be equal to v the core of the cavity is colored white and is the wake like cavity flow region this region contains ventilation gas not entrained by shear layers in this region one can consider two regions the first is the main cavity where mass conservation drives the velocity to be a function of the cross sectional area one characterization of this region is the velocity at the maximum cavity diameter which is given as v c the second region is defined at the vortex cores here the representative velocity is given as v vt p at the point where v vt p is significant correlates to a point where gas entrainment due to pressure gradient effects c q p also exist cavity closure type will impact the behavior of all the regions described within fig 10 in a toroidal cavity ignoring body and ventilation system interactions the agreement of spurk s theory with experimental measurements enables an assumption of a net zero axial flow within the white cavity region hence the gray regions fully compose the entrained gas alternatively the twin vortex model is more complex at one extreme it is limited by the case of no net entrainment outside of the shear layers v vt p 0 c q c q sl in this condition the vortex tubes only have sufficient cross sectional area to relieve the gas within the shear layers the dimensions of these vortices are assumed to be established by circulatory considerations campbell and hilborne 1958 and behave like rigid ducts and are impermeable to the gas considering the mass balance further modeling is needed if ventilation is greater or less than this unique value 3 4 1 1 thinning shear layer tsl cavity thinning of the shear layer occurs when c q c q sl which is a condition where the vortex tubes are overwhelmed by the shear layer entrained gas note that the vortex tube dimensions are determined by circulatory effects driving liquid motion to the air the liquid is similar to a rigid wall thus accommodation of the gas flow rate must require either an acceleration of gas into the tubes or lessening of the entrained air it seems reasonable to approximate the flow rate in the vortex tube displacement layer to be at the free stream velocity i e v vt v thus as already suggested it is assumed that the liquid entrained shear layer thins upstream of the tubes the cfd results support this conjecture a mass balance of the dashed control volume in fig 10 indicates that the air in the vortex tube is determined by c q sl less the gas recovered via shear layer thinning recovered gas therefore establishes a recirculating cavity behavior yielding conditions of v c 0 and v vt p 0 3 4 1 2 pressure driven pd cavity this is a hypothetical condition expected to occur for conditions where c q c q sl in this condition the vortex tubes provide excessive space for the shear layer gas providing free flow through the vortex tubes and eliminating the adverse pressure gradient at the cavity closure region in this condition it is anticipated that the flow acts more like a pipe flow forming a negative axial pressure gradient and a downstream axial flow throughout the cavity and vortex tubes such a process is consistent with the theory of cox clayden spurk 2002 and is expected to occur for large cavities forming at high ventilation rates in this condition a net positive cavity flow forms yielding average axial velocities in the cavity where v c 0 and v vt p 0 the described processes are used to shape a new model for gas entrainment the model is composed of two components given by 4 c q c q s l c q p here c q sl is the contribution from shear layer effects paralleling toroidal closure models cox and clayden 1955 c q p is driven by an axial pressure gradient between the cavity and the vortex core combining the pressure gradients concepts campbell and hilborne 1958 with a model of the twin vortex geometry campbell and hilborne 1958 3 4 2 shear layer gas entrainment although the approach of spurk fully accounts for gas entrained into shear layers it does not consider shear layer thinning or twin vortex cavities consider the application of eq 2 and experimental measurements campbell and hilborne 1958 in fig 11 a those experiments include hysteretic phenomena with twin vortex and toroidal cavity closures for a ventilated circular disk cavitator at fr n 15 5 and re n 172 800 eq 2 yields an excellent prediction for the toroidal cavities right portion of the curve however in the twin vortex regime eq 2 displays an over prediction of the ventilation rate c q required for a given cavity pressure σ c based on insight from the cfd the inclusion of a shear layer thinning model may address this discrepancy in order to approximately model c q s l a recovery factor is introduced that quantifies the shear layer gas that is recovered back into the cavity specifically this recovery factor is the ratio of the spurk theory gas that does not escape through the vortex tubes the shear layer flow rate is obtained using eq 2 which is calibrated to a toroidal cavity for a given fr n and re n the recovery factor k r q is then defined through the following relation 5 c q s l 1 k r q c q s p u r k k r q 1 c q s l c q s p u r k here c q s l is used rather than c q as it represents the air entrainment due to shear layer driven processes physically k rq is the fraction by volume of the gas stripped from the cavity shear layer and must be less than unity for physical relevance to cavity shear layers when k rq is between zero and one a portion of the cavity shear layer gas is recovered into the cavity when k rq is zero shear layers are fully entrained and the c q spurk model predicts the gas entrainment well negative k rq values indicate that the cavity is entraining more gas than entrained by the boundary layers alone presumably in this condition a favorable axial pressure gradient exists corresponding to the pd type cavity the k rq quantities from the experiment are plotted in fig 11 b these values are computed though establishing the constant in eq 2 in the toroidal vortex regime then solving eq 5 for k rq in the toroidal and twin vortex cavity regimes the trends of k rq σ c are as anticipated in the toroidal regime k rq is near zero indicating the spurk model predicts the air entrainment rate consistently throughout that region for twin vortex cavities k rq is positive indicating that the shear layers are recovered into the twin vortex cavity moreover although the data does not span a range to definitively support this it appears that k rq is approaching zero as the cavitation number decreases further in the twin vortex regime in the twin vortex hysteretic regime i e the q decreasing curve the values of k rq peaks and asymptotes to a value of 0 65 prior to recovering to the toroidal vortex cavity in the context of this experimental setup containing partial and twin vortex cavitation the peak value indicates that gas recovery from the shear layers is maximized in the hysteresis regime in the toroidal vortex hysteretic regime i e the q increasing curve k rq takes on small negative values such result indicates that the shear layer model underpredicts the gas entrainment rate hence toroidal structures are probably extracting gas advected from the main cavity as well within this regime the approach used in eq 5 to quantity k rq appears to provide valuable insight into the theory of spurk with respect to other conditions yielding evidence that this is a potentially valid approach the goal is to develop a model for the observed behavior using physical arguments and experimental data ultimately this model will provide the recovery factor k rq consider k rq with respect to c q σc there are essentially two modes that need to be considered 1 toroidal and 2 twin vortex a path to approximate these behaviors is proposed first using the empirically determined twin vortex to toroidal vortex transition criterion campbell and hilborne 1958 the toroidal regime can be estimated then in the toroidal regions k rq is set to zero a heaviside function can be used to enforce this transition criterion and revert the model to c q spurk when σfr values are greater than unity in the twin vortex range a simple model for the recovery is constructed based on the size of twin vortex and an effective shear layer thickness a diagram describing the basis of the model is provided in fig 12 from figs 10 and 12 represents conditions where the twin vortex tubes are smaller than the shear layer gas in fig 12 a the fully developed shear layers are indicated which are based on the cfd observations from fig 7 the gas in this region is determined by c q spurk eq 2 in fig 12 b the model is depicted at the arrival of the gas at the twin vortex closure the diagram is an interpretation of the cfd results figs 4 and 6 that indicate separate regions of entrained and recirculated gas specifically the model aims to quantify the gas that recirculates as indicated in the streamlines of fig 6 a second way of visualizing such behavior is through the c q l contours of fig 6 where the most aft contour plot indicates the converging of the shear layer flow in green with a recirculated gas in blue i e gas moving upstream that separated from the cavity shear layer moving back to the model the entrained gas appears in fig 12 c i e the twin vortex cores the model heuristic is a region of converging shear layers with a demarcating stagnation streamline as indicated in fig 12 b the concept of a stagnation streamline originates from conditions where the air entrainment exceeds the cavity shear layer gas such conditions demand flow reversal of part of the cavity shear layer gas note that this is similar to the model of jet gas entrainment model proposed by paryshev 2006 on the cavity interface side of the stagnation streamline the gas is entrained on the other side the gas is returned to the cavity in order to develop the model several parameters from fig 12 need to be defined it is hypothesized that the converging stagnation streamlines are located a distance from the cavity interface equal to the radius of the twin vortices this distance can be estimated via eq 1 which relates to the area of the two twin vortices and axial velocity through the tubes i e 2 a v t v c q c h m v d n 2 where a v t π r v t 2 rearranging these relations a normalized vortex tube radius r vt r n is determined 6 r v t r n 2 c q c h m π note that surface tension effects could be introduced in this part of the model through a modified vortex radius but are neglected in this relation as application scale is often at high weber numbers i e w e ρ v d n σ for reference epshtein 1970 suggests that for conditions where we is greater than 1000 0 surface tension is unimportant which captures most application scale conditions an effective shear layer thickness δ can also be computed in order to approximate δ a power law based shear layer profile is introduced 7 v v 1 r c r δ 1 n in the context of this approximation it is assumed that velocity approaches v at the interface and zero at a distance δ inward from the cavity interface here as indicated in fig 12 a r is the radius from the cavity centerline and r c is the cavity radius this model is equivalent the power law model with a power of n for a turbulent boundary layer in the corrected reference frame of the cavity interface the approximation is then related to the model of eq 2 8 c q s p u r k 2 π v d n 2 r c δ r c r v 1 r c r δ 1 n d r our aim is to find the stagnation streamline based of geometric restrictions of the cavity approaching the twin vortex tubes hence as indicated in fig 12 the shear layer can be split into two portions as the main concern is the air entrainment behavior near the vortex tubes we focus on δ near the aft end of the cavity at a point near where the vortex tubes form fig 12 b in this model we argue that if the shear layer thickness is less than the vortex radius i e δ r v t the shear layer gas is unaffected the model aims to account for conditions where the shear layer is thicker than the vortex tube i e δ r v t which is the conditions when the shear layer gas is likely to be recovered in approximately quantifying the recirculated gas consider the threshold point of the cavity indicated in fig 12 b i e where r c δ upstream of this point the entrainment model of spurk 2002 yields a condition that c q s p u r k 2 π v d n 2 0 δ r v 1 δ r δ 1 n d r which can be solved as follows 9 c q s p u r k π 3 n 1 4 n 2 6 n 2 δ 2 r n 2 the shear layer thickness near the vortex tubes may then be determined 10 δ r n 1 π 4 n 2 6 n 2 3 n 1 c q s p u r k as indicated in the shear layer diagrams in fig 12 the entrained gas unshaded remains attached to the interface and exits the cavity the recovered gas shaded is gas that the vortex core cannot support and returns to the cavity it is assumed that the boundary layer thickness remains unchanged and that the stagnation streamline delineating these flow paths is defined geometrically by the distance r vt from the cavity interface in this case the entrained gas c q can be computed using the assumption that r c δ and through the integration of the shear layer i e c q 2 π v d n 2 0 r v t r v 1 δ r δ 1 n d r then the recovery factor is the ratio of recovered gas the gray region from fig 10 b to the total gas in the shear layer

the just introduced power law coefficient for the boundary layer is then a complete model of the recovery of shear layer gas in fig 13 the amount of shear layer entrained gas i e c q sl as given from eq 9 obtained using the just derived recovery factor k rq is presented with a subset of the experimental measurements campbell and hilborne 1958 note that the subset of the experiment used for this fit had employed a 0 0127 m cavitator diameter and a free stream velocity of 5 49 m s corresponding to r e n of 172 8 10 3 and f r n of 15 5 the profile coefficient n was set equal to 9 based on a least squares fit of the model from eq 5 supplemented with eq 12 to the data shown in fig 13 note that model results provide reasonable agreement for n values between 4 and 15 the model does not precisely predict the transitional regime near the arrow pointing downward and to the right but is however capable of reproducing trends similar to the experimental data and display a significant improvement over previous models in this region in addition at the highest ventilation values the model approaches that of campbell and hilborne with an underlying assumption that the velocity in the vortex is roughly the free stream velocity throughout the core it is believed that in a pd cavity the ventilation rates can exceed those values thus the aforementioned behavior is not ideal 3 4 3 pressure driven gas entrainment to complete model development the pressure gradient driven component or c q p must be defined the process is to simply adopt the air entrainment model from campbell hilborne denoted by c q chm but limit its application to the appropriate regime c q p is simply assumed to be the maximum given by eq 13 this implies that the pressure gradient component is only significant when the model twin vortices are sufficiently large to entrain the entirety of hypothesized shear layer entrained gas 13 c q p max c q c h m c q s p u r k 0 h the results of the combination of eqns 5 and 13 substituted into the proposed model eq 4 are plotted in fig 14 note that the prediction conforms nicely to the data for toroidal and twin vortex cavities and behaves as expected approaching high c q values 3 4 4 application of model the considered air entrainment models and the final form of the presently developed model are summarized in table 1 the present model can be considered as a composite of previously proposed gas entrainment models based on shear layer entrainment spurk 2002 twin vortex volume capture spurk 2002 the present model employs a shear layer power law with an n value of 9 these models are now to be compared with respect to various experimental datasets the application of the model is extended to other archival datasets campbell and hilborne 1958 the semi empirical nature of the present model requires some calibration using the entire data sets of campbell and hilborne it was found that the twin vortex to toroidal transition criterion of σfr n 1 1 was more accurate than the previously established value of σfr n 1 0 the spurk model coefficient k q which is a function of reynolds number and experimental setup could be determined analytically or empirically this effort chose the empirical approach using a subset of each dataset based on the lowest fr number case the underlying k q correlation takes a form that scales like the model of spurk which is given as k q d 1 e d 2 f r n here d 1 and d 2 are constants that are used to empirically match these lower f r n results in all cases d 1 0 0316 and d 2 0 1226 which in the context of the series of studies to be discussed yields k q values ranging from 0 004 to 0 012 from the empirical database compared to 0 0042 in fig 11 note that future estimations of this correlation may need to consider reynolds number as well nevertheless using this correlation we can estimate shear layer content as a function of f r n in fig 15 experimental data in the twin vortex regime campbell and hilborne 1958 are presented along with results from the model and its constitutive parts the full model results are provided in fig 15 a in general the results agree well with the experimental measurements for a range of conditions in particular the model predicts the air entrainment rate well for smaller twin vortex cavities to the authors knowledge these results are the first reasonable reduced physics predictions of air entrainment within the hysteresis region twin vortex cavity for high fr values the transition is not as well predicted as at low fr such lack of agreement is due to a deficit in the transition criterion additionally note the sharp deviation in the model that is not observed in the experiment that feature is the model transitioning to a prediction of the toroidal vortex solution in fig 15 c similar prediction parity comparisons are made for the models of campbell and hiborne fig 15 b and epshtein given in equation 1 17 in kinzel 2008 with respect to results from those models the present model indicates a significant improvement in fig 16 an overview of the effectiveness of the present model and archival models in prediction parity form is given in these plots each discrete point indicates the predicted value of an experimental condition versus the experimental measurement of that same condition as the goal of the model is to predict similar values to the measurements an ideal curve is also presented that indicates perfect agreement between the model and experiment models with strong correlation to experiment will have data points on or near the ideal line whereas poor correlation will deviate significantly from the ideal line first consider fig 16 a which compares the prediction parity for all three models against the entire campbell and hilborne 1958 dataset the present model results clearly concur with experimental results at lower flow rates and diverge at higher ventilation rates over the data set the model exhibits less than 8 error in comparison with results obtained using the campbell and hilborne and the epshtein models the present approach appears to be an improvement in fig 16 b d the comparison is expanded to additional data sets epshtein 1973 swanson and o neill 1951 in fig 16 b the prediction parity for the present model is shown the overall results indicate a reasonable correlation to both the swanson and o neill and epshtein data sets when compared to the campbell and hilborne and the epshtein models evaluated using the same original data in fig 16 c and d respectively the current model appears clearly better in the context of this comparison it is important to mention that such comparisons are limited to data available in the literature which tends to be small scale cavitators i e low reynolds number at these small scales the shear layers are thicker and the cases highlight scenarios where the models we focus on are most prevalent for this reason the epshtein model for example does not compare well with the data such discrepancies are not expected over broader data sets covering large scale cavitators an area of concern appears at increased ventilation rates where the model tends to under predict the measurements such an under prediction could plausibly be due to the model not predicting the transition from tsl to pd cavities well or assumptions embedded in the campbell and hilborne model the impact of the transition from tsl to pd cavities can be best understood using the individual model constituents plotted in fig 15 b and d in terms of these data both c q chm and c q spurk tend to over predict the experimental measurements compared to the under prediction of the present model in addition we note that k r q remains active in all conditions causing the deficit with respect to the model constituents in the current state there are two potential issues 1 the model of k r q is breaking down for pd cavities or 2 the underlying assumptions of the campbell and hilborne model notable the gas velocity in the tubes is breaking down additional evaluation of these model components is a subject of future research 4 conclusions the gaseous flow within the cavity forming behind a ventilated cavitator has been analyzed using cfd it was found that the cavity gas entrainment process strongly depends on the shear layers forming on the cavity interface corroborating previous theory spurk 2002 the investigations also found that such shear layer mechanisms also contribute to gas entrainment from twin vortex cavities and cavities interacting with bodies the implication of this cfd based observation involves many aspects of modeling twin vortex cavities in supercavitation the insight gathered from the cfd is used to update models of gas entrainment understand cfd modeling of supercavitation and develop a more detailed understanding of ventilation gas flow in a supercavity it is found that the gas entrainment process from a twin vortex supercavity is consistent with the theory of spurk specifically ventilation gas is entrained into shear layers on the cavity interface providing a mechanism to pull the gas towards the aft end of the cavity the process initiates just aft of the cavitator where gas is drawn into these shear layers from the cavity and ventilation ports as the shear layer pulls gas downstream the shear layers thicken until roughly the maximum radius of the cavity thereafter a shear layer thinning mechanism begins adverse pressure gradients form as the shear layer gas approaches the aft end of the cavity however the attached layer is pulled in the reverse direction by the reverse cavity flow therefore these gradients are shear thinning and stabilize the attached shear layer it is the general conclusion that if the closure mechanism is a toroidal vortex the shear layer entrained gas at the closure will exit unabated through the shedding of toroidal cavities if the closure mechanism is twin vortex further shear thinning appears to occur at the formation of the twin vortex at that point a rapid convergence in the cavity appears to lead to portions of shear layers to be stripped off and recovered back to the cavity the observations from cfd helped to identify issues with cfd turbulence modeling approaches suggests potential scaling issues for supercavitation and guided the formulation of improved models of gas entrainment when applied straightforwardly rans models tend to over predict the amount of gas entrained within cavity shear layers leading to an over predicted ventilation rate the over prediction appears to be due to the seemingly erroneous high levels of modeled eddy viscosity at interfaces approaches that aim to reduce the rans model eddy viscosity within the cavity such as des are thus sensible additionally as we are finding that cavity shear layers are critical to precise gas entrainment studies reynolds number effects typically considered of lesser importance may also be important when investigating ventilation requirements thus data obtained at low reynolds number may not provide accurate air entrainment prediction at full scale this would likely become more significant when considering cavities that close partly or fully on solid bodies as there may be interactions of the shear layer with the body lastly an updated gas entrainment model has been proposed the model is a physically guided combination of archival regime specific models campbell and hilborne 1958 combined with a model of shear layer gas recovery in addition it was tested for a range of experimental data the updated model results correlate well with experimental measurements for the air entrainment rate from a twin vortex cavity over a wide range of froude numbers experimental configurations and ventilation rates there is however a limit in that the model does not perform well for high ventilation rates the present results highlight several areas where physical numerical models still falls short first the significance of gaseous shear layer mechanisms and their effect on air entrainment from a cavity closing on a body was identified a proper model of the resulting interactions and physical processes is important to understand air entrainment for partial cavitation second cfd rans turbulence models have not been developed that properly model turbulence in the region of gas liquid interfacial flows this is a requirement for cfd to accurately and reliably capture air entrainment physics the present results indicate that a des based turbulence model may fortuitously predict air entrainment but not for physically sound reliable reasons hence turbulences adapted to gas liquid interfacial flow would greatly improve the usefulness of supercavitation cfd thirdly the updated model of air entrainment exhibits an improvement compared to the archival models however the updated model still falls short specifically the updated model does not capture high ventilation rates at rates where other physics greatly augment shear layers mechanisms a further update of the present model should enable the model to capture the full range of buoyant supercavities lastly the lack of experimental data suitable to measure ventilated supercavity gas entrainment in a real environment is an issue the proposed model is validated using historical yet seminal experimental measurements experiments that measure air entrainment at multiple scales for various cavitator types and spanning multiple regimes in a tunnel without blockage are a present

21114,the understanding of the internal gaseous flow of artificially ventilated supercavities is developed using a locally homogenous multiphase computational fluid dynamics model that is benchmarked using experimental data the solutions indicate that gas leakage from a ventilated supercavity originates from the gaseous shear layers forming at the gas water interface not only do these observations corroborate previous theory developed for cavities with toroidal closure they also display evidence that shear layer mechanisms remain important for cavities in the twin vortex regime and when interacting with bodies it is also found that the treatment of turbulence in these shear layers affects the outcome of computational fluid dynamics approaches lastly a semi empirical model considering these shear layers is proposed results from the model indicate an improved prediction capability of the relationship between cavity size and ventilation rate for steady twin vortex supercavities keywords supercavitation ventilation turbulence multiphase cfd 1 introduction in a typical supercavitation application a submerged vehicle is enveloped in a gaseous cavity with the overall goal of drag reduction this drag reduction is achieved by significantly reducing the wetted area of a vehicle hull which consequentially reduces viscous drag such a concept can be considered for application to high speed marine vehicles one method to form these gaseous cavities is through vaporous cavitation the alternative referred to as artificial supercavitation relies on the injection of a non condensable gas such as air to form the cavity the present effort only considers air ventilated artificial supercavities for artificially supercavitating vehicles gas entrainment impacts range and cavity shape control in steady operation mass conservation demands that the ventilation requirement is equal to the amount of gas entrained from the cavity through this requirement the gas entrainment rate correlates to ventilation demands a relationship between the cavity shape and ventilation rate is thus closed through models of the gas entrainment rate leaving the cavity models that relate input parameters i e ventilation rate to the cavity size are critical for designing hull forms positioning control surfaces and vehicle controller models the cavity closure mode is important to gas entrainment the cavities considered here are restricted to those formed downstream of a wetted cavitator which may be approximated as a circular disk with the surrounding liquid flow moving horizontally such that the cavity forms under the vertical influence of gravity for these conditions supercavities have three basic closure patterns defined as 1 twin vortex 2 toroidal vortex and 3 pulsation twin vortex cavities are those most strongly influenced by buoyancy and are characterized by a pair of relativity stable axially aligned gaseous vortices that form at the cavity closure point campbell and hilborne 1958 cox and clayden 1955 epshtein 1970 1973 logvinovich 1972 these vortices form the main path for air entrainment and are driven by buoyant forces on the cavity toroidal vortex closing cavities have less influence from buoyancy and are best described as the large scale shedding of toroidal shaped pockets of gas campbell and hilborne 1958 semenenko 2001 using what appears to be an empirical basis campbell and hilborne 1958 approximate that the delineator of twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities are established when the product of the cavitation number σ c p p c 0 5 ρ v 2 and froude number f n v g d n is equal to unity when σ c f r n values are less than unity the twin vortex closure appears for values greater than unity toroidal vortex closure is expected note that d n is the cavitator diameter and is the length scale normally used in supercavitation beyond this work the transition between twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities has been explored in several other efforts karn et al 2016 karn and rosiejka 2017 kawakami and arndt 2011 m p kinzel et al 2007 wosnik et al 2003 lastly cavity pulsation is a third type of closure exhibiting strong oscillations that periodically influence the entire length of the cavity paryshev 2006 skidmore 2012 song 1962 when designing supercavitation applications cavity closure regime is important for example switching from twin vortex to toroidal vortex cavities leads to a large change in cavity size cavity stability and cavity ventilation requirements not only do these factors impact loading complexity they also relate to ventilation storage requirements as these cavities can transition in between any of these modes during operation designers must consider them all thus there is a strong need to understand how to model each cavity type the present work focuses on improving the state of the art of both computational fluid dynamics cfd and semi empirical modeling of gas entrainment from toroidal and twin vortex cavities that directly correlates to the ventilation requirements here we briefly review present models of supercavities with respect to gas entrainment models first consider the nondimensional parameters established as relevant for the behavior of ventilated supercavities in general the cavitation number σ c is the prime parameter of interest as it relates to cavity shape and cavitator drag logvinovich 1972 may 1975 semenenko 2001 the gas ventilation rate q can be considered as a method of altering σ c q can be nondimensionalized by the cavitator diameter d n and the free stream speed v resulting in the gas entrainment coefficient c q c q q v d n 2 the connection between c q and σ c is the gas entrainment rate for a steady state cavity the gas entrained i e escaping from the cavity is equivalent to the ventilation rate hence there is a relation between c q and σ c that drives the need to model gas entrainment rate several models for c q as a function of σ c have been developed throughout the literature campbell and hilborne 1958 cox and clayden 1955 epshtein 1970 spurk 2002 in general the dependency is defined as the ventilation requirement to sustain a cavity having a specific value of σ c such models describe the c q σ c relationship and have f r n re and weber number dependencies note that the surface tension related weber number dependency is more related to micro scale interfacial wave length scales epshtein 1970 one important point about these relations is that the models are closure specific i e twin vortex or toroidal cavity hence correctly capturing these features over a range of cavity sizes and scales presents a challenge for model development first consider modeling gas entrainment from a twin vortex cavity in such cavity which closes with two axially aligned gas tubes the amount of air entrained is often based on approximating the gas flow rate in those tubes the size of the tubes can be calculated using the circulation about the centerline of a cavity driven by the cavity buoyant force when the circulation is conserved about the twin vortex tubes the area of the twin vortices can be estimated closure of the model demands the mean axial velocity through the tube v vt multiplying v vt by this area yields the gas entrainment rate campbell and hilborne 1958 the model has been redefined kinzel et al 2009 in terms of the cavity dimension correlations of r c and l c from semenenko 2001 the result is a physically identically model with different underlying cavity size correlations the modified model for air entrainment rate is given as 1 c q c h m π a 2 1 σ c 2 47 6 k f r n d i s k 4 σ c 4 v v t v note that a and k are empirical parameters that are roughly 2 0 and 1 0 respectively semenenko 2001 the remaining unclosed parameter is v vt which does not have a formal model and is generally assumed to be v campbell and hilborne 1958 it is believed that this is an important gap to be closed in air entrainment modeling for twin vortex cavities the gas entrainment from cavities closing in a toroidal vortex pattern occurs via gaseous toroidal shaped shedding cavities the gas entrainment of these cavities was demonstrated to occur through the reentrant jet splashing on the cavity walls creating micro cavities that eventually exit the cavity through these toroidal vortical structures epshtein 1973 these micro cavities and the resultant gas entrainment rate were shown to be influenced by both viscous and surface tension effects a more recent theory correlates the gas drawn by interfacial shear layers to the gas entrained by toroidal cavities spurk 2002 spurk argues that the gas is pulled to the aft end of the cavity via shear mechanisms at the cavity interface and that the resultant gaseous shear layer dominates the air entrained by the large scale toroidal cavities thus spurk quantifies the air entrainment through the physical approximations to the gaseous shear layers at the cavity interface predictions using the theory of spurk agree with experimental measurements over a range of conditions building compelling evidence that in a limiting condition i e long cavities with no transverse gravity field toroidal cavity gas entrainment is dependent on interfacial shear layers the model reduces to the following semi empirical form 2 c q s p a r k k q 1 σ c σ c 1 σ c l n 1 σ c application of the model implies using experimental measurements of c q and σ c from a single cavity instance to solve for k q which enables an empirical model that can be extrapolated to other ventilation rates this model has shown to perform well against many experimental measurements an aspect that is not clear is that spurk s theory emphasizes a strong relationship between gas shear layers and air entrainment from toroidal cavities but theory does not directly consider these effects for twin vortex cavities in this work cfd simulations are used to develop an understanding of the gaseous regions of a supercavitating flow and utilize this insight to improve modeling to develop confidence in the cfd the gas entrainment predictions are benchmarked against experimental measurements the resulting cfd flow fields are then interrogated with a goal of extracting physical insight into the gas entrainment process these observations are then used to discuss difficulties of traditional cfd in predicting the gas entrainment rate additionally the physical insights are used to guide the development of a new gas entrainment model that incorporates air entrainment theory for toroidal vortex cavities into theory for twin vortex cavities i e with a goal of improving the model for v v t the resulting semi empirical model helps to bridge a gap between closure patterns i e twin vortex to toroidal this work advances the previous effort of kinzel et al 2009 in the description of the of gaseous shear layers provides an improved physical based model of gas entrainment and benchmarks the model with respect to a broader set of experimental data 2 methods the cfd method used in this work is based on the cfd code uncle m which has an established pedigree in simulating supercavtating flows an overview of the model formulation and numerical schemes are well documented in other works kunz et al 2003 stinebring et al 2001 in general the cfd code is a finite volume formulation that solves the locally homogeneous gas liquid mixture navier stokes equations the present cfd simulations use higher order numerics formally third order accurate in space second order accurate in time turbulence models spanning from reynolds averaged navier stokes rans to detached eddy simulation des and structured overset grids in addition spatial and temporal requirements have already been determined kinzel 2008 and are used in the context of the present work note that as demanded in the eddy resolving des model the time step size ensures courant numbers u δ t δ x smaller than unity in the turbulent cavity region we draw on this developed experience base to provide the insight on supercavitating flows with reasonable confidence in terms of the multiphase flow aspects of the solver the bulk of the simulations in this work are based on liquid water and air as the ventilation gas it is argued that the character observed for air should be extendable to other supply gases but does not directly apply to gas generated and lost due to evaporation and condensation processes hence the present efforts have an underlying assumption of operation at depth hence such natural cavitation phenomena relevant to shallow running vehicles are not considered such an assumption is common for idealized artificial supercavitation scenarios at depth and enables the focus on air entrainment processes 3 results and discussion the following cfd results are used to highlight and improve the understanding of the mechanisms of gas entrainment from a supercavity the overall process develops a cfd model benchmarking process against experimental data using a combination of these benchmarked results combined with extension of the model to other closure types detailed insight into the flow inside a gaseous cavity is developed the overall results are interpreted to understand both cfd turbulence model performance and identify missing phenomena within air entrainment models for twin vortex cavities 3 1 benchmark gas entrainment prediction on supercavitating body in this section the ability to predict the gas entrainment rate is established against experimental measurements schauer 2003 wosnik et al 2003 the subject article is the supercavitating body shown in fig 1 the cfd model simulates the test with free stream conditions corresponding to a re n ρvd n μ of 56 000 and a fr n of 26 7 simulated within a water tunnel i e the walls are included these simulations are performed for a range of ventilation c q values additionally the support strut was included for several selected cases c q 0 125 and 0 25 the validation metric demands correlation between the experiment and cfd in the prediction of the cavity pressure variation with respect to ventilation rate i e c q σ relation in these assessments two turbulence model approaches are evaluated the first is based on an unsteady rans urans formulation lindau et al 2002 with a time step size corresponding to 0 05 d n v while the second uses a des approach m kinzel et al 2007 with a time step size of 0 005 d n v both models are within the temporal requirements demanded for supercavitation kinzel 2008 for the ventilated cavity fig 2 contains a survey of water tunnel experimental measurements and computational evaluations over a range of conditions with and without a strut as is typical in supercavitation reporting cavitation number is plotted on the horizontal axis and c q is plotted on the vertical axis recall c q is a dimensionless ventilation rate that as determined via mass conservation is equivalent to the entrainment rate in a steady cavity fig 2 a contains computational results from the urans approach in this plot two modeled configurations are compared to the experiment 1 the isolated cavitator body configuration and 2 the as tested cavitator body configuration supported with a strut to estimate the effect of the entire range of the urans model results with a strut the two modeled strut cases were used to calibrate the no strut results in fig 2 b a similar comparison for des is provided as discussed below these results are used to understand the influence of turbulence models with respect to the experiments in the evaluation of fig 2 first consider results from the present urans formulation plotted in fig 2 a the results suggest that the urans model without the inclusion of the strut predicts the experimental behavior well however when the urans based model considers a more faithful geometry that includes the strut the predictions significantly deviate from the experiment this result suggests that 1 the urans model without a strut compared well with the experiment by chance and that 2 the urans model fails in an accurate representation of the experiment hence when the present urans formulation is applied to supercavitation it appears to have a model bias in the cavity response to the ventilation rate alternatively consider the des model results presented in fig 2 b there the strut included cfd better approximates the experimental measurements hence in the context of this test case and turbulence model des appears to captures the salient physics required for the prediction of air entrainment whereas this urans model completely fails such a finding suggests that the c q σ prediction may be sensitive to the turbulence model approach such a model issue will be explored in additional detail from physical perspectives an evaluation of differences between the urans and des focuses on the differences in the predicted eddy viscosity ν t in a boussinesq based urans approach the turbulence affects the mean flow via the turbulent eddy viscosity ν t in the des model approach ν t is reduced in regions where the mesh can support unsteady simulation of eddy structures in fig 3 the predicted ν t is plotted for the des and urans simulations at identical conditions both cases exhibit elevated ν t values near the interface however the des simulation exhibits significantly lower ν t values than the urans case the results tend to suggest that the reduced ν t values relate to the improved results observed in fig 2 3 2 observed gas entrainment behavior in fig 4 the cfd solutions are interrogated to ascertain the dominant mechanisms of air entrainment in the figure the body is colored gray and the inlet ports are colored pink a grayscale contour plot of the gas volume fraction along the symmetry plane is used to provide insight on the location of the supercavity where the black indicates gas and gray indicates liquid in order to highlight regions of axial moving gas a local rate of gas entrainment is defined as 3 c q 1 α g u v here α g is the gas volume fraction u is the axial velocity and v is the reference free stream velocity scalar c q l indicates the local aft wards moving gas through a cavity note that a time averaged surface integral of c q l over any plane perpendicular to the axial direction and aft of the cavitator is equal to the overall gas entrainment rate divided by the free stream velocity this parameter is used to illustrate the gas entrainment processes the results from c q l are plotted on the colored contour plots at the axial location at the maximum cavity diameter in addition streamlines are plotted to provide insight into the flow path of the entrained gas red and recirculated gas purple a useful result from computations for supercavity applications would be the differentiation of leakage behavior when the cavity closure is interrupted by interaction with a body the plots in fig 4 highlight the gaseous flow inside the cavity at two steady ventilation rates 1 c q 0 45 where a partial cavity is formed and interacts with the body fig 4 a and b and 2 c q 1 0 which has a supercavity that fully envelopes the body fig 4 c and d note that the ventilation rate was increasing from lower values in both of these simulations in the results of fig 4 the contour plots of c q l indicate elevated positive values near the cavity interface this indicates that gas shear layers form at the cavity interface although the negative values of c q l are not shown in the contour levels they do exist in the regions near the body the reverse flow can still be observed in the recirculating streamlines in comparing fig 4 a and c the red streamlines entrained gas are traced from the cavity interface region for both partial and supercavities the streamlines indicate a most direct path from ventilation ports into the shear layers and out of the cavity in fig 4 b and d the purple streamlines are seeded within the core of the cavity in both cases the streamlines indicate that the cavity gas within this region remains nearly isolated and recirculatory these results affirm the hypothesis that shear layers remain important spurk 2002 with and without cavity body interactions the next case considers air entrainment from a twin vortex cavity for a configuration with a small body that is expected to not affect gas entrainment an illustration of the conical shaped cavitator is in fig 5 such a 15 half angle cavitator has been previously studied experimentally kiceniuk 1954 may 1975 note the existence of a small body that is anticipated to be negligible to the air entrainment process to extend the evaluations to another condition the cavitator is set to a lifting configuration by pitching the cavitator 4 4 deg providing a lift coefficient of roughly 0 1 the corresponding conditions are re n 3 2 10 7 fr n 72 0 and c q 1 0 using this particular case validation of the current computational approach for determining cavitator forces has been established kinzel 2008 such a lifting condition is known to alter the cavity and closure behavior the goal is to display similar physical mechanisms with such variations a series of visualizations the cavity shape and internal gas flow inside a twin vortex type cavity are provided in fig 6 a gray scale contour plots the gas volume fraction along the symmetry plane to highlight the cavity location here black indicates high content of gas gray indicates gas liquid mixtures and pure liquid is white the cavity clearly envelopes the small body within in the cavity also colored white there are also several streamlines plotted selectively positioned to highlight the origin of the gas passing through various points in the cavity the points the streamlines pass through are highlighted with the large symbols additionally the streamlines are colored by a normalized axial pressure gradient d n c p x which indicates the pressure force acting on the gas negative values imply forcing the fluid downstream whereas positive values force the gas upstream note that c p is the pressure coefficient given as c p p p 1 2 ρ v 2 lastly the colored contour plots lines of c q l are plotted on several axial planes along the length of the supercavity these contour plots indicate the axial flow distribution of gas through the cavity for these contours negative values of c q l highlight regions where gas moves upstream and positive values highlight where gas flows aftward additionally although the three dimensional cavity outline is not plotted the extents of these c q l contours indicate the outline of the supercavity the plot also indicates the axial position where the twin vortex character forms which is best observed in the lower portion of the c q l contour plots shifting upwards due to the buoyant forces elevating the cavity these plots are to be used to construct a picture of the air entrainment process consider the c q l contour plots in fig 6 a recall that the colored spectrum contour line plots at select axial locations indicate the c q l profile along the cavity axis the values of c q l are most positive near the gas liquid interface and tend towards negative in the core of the cavity such behavior indicates that the aftward gaseous flow is dominated by physics local to the interface region there are two obvious mechanisms that can lead to the aftward flow through the cavity 1 the water at the interface pulling the gas via viscous mechanisms or 2 the initial momentum of the jet from the ventilation gas it is argued that the aftward forcing from the water acting on the gas is the dominate factor which is suggested through three mechanisms observed in the results first the jet is expected to quickly dissipate its momentum in the cavity which is not a sustained force through the cavity secondly gas moving upstream is observed to be fully redirected downstream by the water pulling on the cavity gas fig 4 a third the gas is also observed to be pulled into these cavity shear layers from the recirculatory portions of the cavity that do not have an initial momentum from the jet fig 4 b and d now consider the behavior of the gas as it approaches the end of the cavity as displayed in figs 4 d and fig 6 b it is observed that as the gas transverses along the cavity interface to the aft end of the cavity near the end of the cavity the gas encounters an increasing pressure indicated by the positive pressure gradient it is believed that this increased pressure is due to the converging of streamlines interestingly at this position in the cavity some of the gas appears to be redirected upstream based on these results gas can either 1 remain attached and continue to be pulled out of the cavity through the twin vortex tubes or 2 be redirected back into the cavity by the changing pressure in fig 6 quasi steady streamlines are used to demonstrate the flow history of gas present in the aft end of the cavity these streamlines were actually constructed from their terminal point and constructed backward in time at various c q l magnitudes originating from the penultimate c q l contour plot the terminal points origins of construction of these streamlines are shown by red and green spheres the planar section chosen near the closure of the cavity is expected to be representative of the sampled gas ultimate path i e exit or remain in the cavity hence in the aft most planes the regions colored by green contours indicate gas with the strongest tendency to exit the cavity i e highlights the entrained gas in fig 6 a the streamlines are intended to indicate entraining gas by seeding the streamlines at high c q l levels at c q l 0 2 note that numerical diffusion of α g leads to a deficit in c q l approaching the interfaces nevertheless the aim is to highlight the origin of entraining air and these plots indicates the regions where the bulk of the entrained air originates from interestingly the streamlines originate directly from the injection port thus the injected gas is entrained directly into cavity boundary shear layers and out of the cavity in fig 6 b the quasi steady streamlines highlight gas that is recirculated back into the cavity these streamlines are traced from a point with the most negative c q l values at c q l 0 6 the results indicate that the gas in the cavity core behaves like a separated wake region that interacts with the interface shear layer interpreting the plots constructed in fig 6 helps to identify key features not present in current gas entrainment models specifically theory indicates the importance of interfacial shear layers spurk 2002 however it is observed for twin vortex cavities that on average a net portion of this shear layer gas is stripped and recirculated back into the cavity as it approaches the cavity terminus such a thinning shear layer corresponds to an increasing pressure note the axial pressure gradient color on the streamlines suggesting that there may be a streamline that stagnations at the end of the wake region similar to that described in paryshev 2006 such stagnation streamlines are expected to occur at the delineation between entrained gas from the cavity and the recirculating gas interior to the stagnation streamlines the interfacial shear gas is recovered into the cavity alternatively gas exterior to the stagnation streamlines is entrained from the cavity such a process appears to be critical to air entrainment and is not considered in models the present observations indicate that cavity shear layers are important for gas entrainment from twin vortex supercavities as shear layers typically scale with viscous effects reynolds number scaling may also be evident in general the physical models applied to modeling air entrainment from twin vortex cavities ignore viscous effects and reynolds number scaling logvinovich 1972 may 1975 semenenko 2001 models of air entrainment from toroidal supercavities on the other hand have in the past considered reynolds number scaling epshtein 1970 semenenko 2001 spurk 2002 in fig 7 the aftward moving gas moving rightward in the figure is again highlighted using computed c q l inside cavities formed behind disk cavitators the solutions are shown at identical ventilation rates and froude numbers but vary re n from 1 0 10 5 to 1 0 10 7 note that such a study aims to focus the impact of viscous effects on the artificial supercavity these solutions are all based on the des methodology it is observed that the velocity character within the supercavity shear layers is a function of the reynolds number specifically as would be expected a thickened shear layer can be observed when the reynolds number decreases as indicated by the thicker dark regions along cavity interfaces from these reynolds numbers varying simulations velocity profiles were extracted inside the supercavity at several axial stations these profiles are plotted in fig 8 in this plot the axial velocity normalized by v is added to the axial position providing insight into the velocity profiles in general the inside of the cavity generally has a velocity near zero with respect to the cavitator approaching the cavity interface a shear layer is formed and the velocity increases to roughly v additionally in the plot are several blow ups intended to show more detail of the shear layer profiles each of these blow ups consistently displays the shear layer occurring at the gas liquid interface as well as its relative thickness for the various reynolds numbers as expected there is an inverse relationship with the shear layer thickness and reynolds number as a first order assumption reynolds number is not considered in supercavitation these results indicate that there is a possibility that reynolds number may have some impact especially for small scale testing although not evaluated it is hypothesized that such an influence can also occur for body filled cavities with tight clearances for such conditions the body can potentially interfere with the shear layer such a factor would become increasingly important for low reynolds numbers the cfd results indicate that shear mechanisms of toroidal cavities spurk 2002 are of similar importance in the gas entrainment from twin vortex cavities this is therefore a key physical process relevant to gas entrainment modeling of supercavitation these observations have extended beyond the present effort and have also been observed in more recent efforts fronzeo et al 2017 kinzel et al 2017 accurate modeling of gas entrainment requires that liquid attached gas shear layer including the effect of shear layer thinning in the aft regions of the cavity be accurately captured thus in the following sections these attributes are assessed and addressed in the context of both cfd models and semi empirical theory 3 3 air entrainment sensitivity to turbulence model in this section turbulence model sensitivity is evaluated with respect to the insight developed within the previous section the specific aim is to show that turbulence modeling greatly influences resolved cavity shear layers and hence will greatly influence any result using cfd to predict air entrainment it has been found that the predictions of the c q σ c relation using viscous cfd is sensitive to turbulence modeling kinzel m p et al 2007 such sensitivities are highlighted in fig 2 where the urans model poorly captures the c q σ c relation but the des model appears much more accurate evaluations of these results are used to develop insight into turbulence modeling and its relation to air entrainment in order to understand cfd model sensitivity with respect to turbulence modeling observed in fig 2 the modeled levels of turbulence are bounded in cfd simulations of a supercavitating flow these turbulence level bounding model evaluations focus on the cavity gas behavior near the cavity interface for this evaluation we explore a non buoyant axisymmetric toroidal supercavity this case has with few physics distracting focus from the cavity shear layer is simulated using identical computational meshes free stream conditions and ventilation rates two simulations are performed 1 a rans turbulence model k ε is used to obtain results at one extreme and 2 no turbulence model no tm is used to obtain results on the other extreme note that the no tm case is not intended to be a direct numerical simulation but a lower bound on the modeled turbulence the goal of this study is to measure the sensitivity to turbulence modeling by isolating its aggregate effects on gas entrainment results for this study are presented in fig 9 where the extracted velocity profiles at an axial location 20 8 radii downstream of the cavitator are plotted the plot specifically compares the velocity profiles of the rans to no tm results here the horizontal axis is a measure of the axial gas velocity plotted as s i g n u v v where positive values yield gas traveling aftward and negative values indicate recirculating gas the vertical axis represents the distance from the cavity interface into the cavity deviations in the predictions indicate the effect of the turbulence model on the cavity gas flow first consider the near interface behaviors i e at d d n 0 0 the initial behavior moving away from this point indicates that the no tm and rans model results differ for the rans model result the gas sustains a velocity near that of the interfacial velocity for a much larger distance than that of the no tm indicating thicker shear layers and additional shear layer entrainment away from the interface this simulations display an interesting character in comparing the amounts of reverse flow in figs 8 and 9 the reverse flow in fig 8 i e the regions where the axial velocity profiles are left of the base of the arrows is much less than observed in fig 9 i e where the axial velocity profile is left of the dashed line at zero on the x axis it making such a comparison it is important to realize that the cavity in fig 8 is a twin vortex one modeled using des while the cavity in fig 9 is toroidal and modeled with the bounding turbulence models no tm and rans since the des model result does not appear to fall between the rans and no tm cases it may suggest that twin vortex cavities have a lower axial flow however additional evaluations are necessary to make a developed conclusion secondly and specific to the simulations depicted in fig 9 the no tm simulation was supplied gas beyond what the cavity shear layers could support the result is a transition process of the recirculating gas flow to an axial gas flow through the center of the supercavity transition to axial flow is the cause for the sharp change in the no tm curve at the s i g n u v v value of 0 45 because of this it is difficult to measure the thickness of the shear layers hence we focus to the shear layer character near the interface near the interface the no tm solution solid line displays a significantly thinner shear layer than that of the rans model dashed line this is indicated in the lower values of s i g n u v v that the no tm result predicts as compared to with the rans model the gap between the shear layer entrained gas is indicated in fig 9 which highlights how a standard rans model leads to an increased airentrainment the generalized effect implies that 1 predicting gas entrainment processes i e the c q σ c relation using cfd is sensitive to the turbulence model and 2 rans models tend to increases the entrainment of gas in the shear layer the clear link between turbulence modeling and modeled air entrainment is now established and assessed in the context of the benchmark case fig 2 recall from fig 2 a for a given ventilation rate urans yields a cavity that is too small however the des obtained c q σ c fig 2 b closely approximates the experimental measurements it is believed that the urans approach yields excessive entrainment in shear layers thus des should lie somewhere between the rans and no tm these observations suggest that the reduced eddy viscosities in the des model observed in fig 3 enables the accurate c q σ c predictions and indicates that a urans formulation over estimates the eddy viscosity in these interfacial shear layers consider the cause for this over production of turbulence within the interfacial shear layer a typical turbulence model is well tuned for wall bounded flows but not formulated specifically to an interfacial shear layer flow the turbulence model constants are generally calibrated for different types of shear layers and further controlled using damping functions to match boundary conditions however the gas liquid interface of a supercavity is a different kind of shear layer almost like a wall bounded layer for the gas flow but not exactly as the modeling constants are not tuned nor is a damping function applied to satisfy a boundary condition at the interface such an over prediction may be expected additionally this issue has previously been observed and corrected in similar multiphase flow scenarios in the work of lo et al 2010 such sensitivities suggest that in the vicinity of gas liquid interfaces caution must be taken in applying turbulence models and imply obvious issues that beg further modeling 3 4 improved models of gas entrainment the present simulations suggest that an air entrainment theory developed in consideration of toroidal cavities spurk 2002 can be applied at least partly to twin vortex cavities accordingly widely accepted gas entrainment models are adapted to include shear layer thinning effects into twin vortex cavities the goal of incorporating these physical mechanisms into gas entrainment models is to provide a more physically accurate model 3 4 1 concept overview a model of gas entrainment combining the theory based for toroidal vortex spurk 2002 and twin vortex campbell and hilborne 1958 air entrainment is developed where the theories are linked through a concept of a thinning shear layer consider the model components for a twin vortex cavity in fig 10 therein the gray regions represent the gas within the interfacial shear layers the white regions represent the cavity regions outside the shear layer fig 10 a indicates a near horizontal plane cut through the cavity such that it indicates the cavitator cavity and both vortex tubes fig 10 b highlights two selected axial planes a a through the maximum cavity radius location and b b is through one of the vortex tubes the estimations of the shear layer displacement thickness are gray colored regions that consists of gas carried at the liquid velocity v sl entrained gas due to shear for simplicity v sl is assumed to be equal to v the core of the cavity is colored white and is the wake like cavity flow region this region contains ventilation gas not entrained by shear layers in this region one can consider two regions the first is the main cavity where mass conservation drives the velocity to be a function of the cross sectional area one characterization of this region is the velocity at the maximum cavity diameter which is given as v c the second region is defined at the vortex cores here the representative velocity is given as v vt p at the point where v vt p is significant correlates to a point where gas entrainment due to pressure gradient effects c q p also exist cavity closure type will impact the behavior of all the regions described within fig 10 in a toroidal cavity ignoring body and ventilation system interactions the agreement of spurk s theory with experimental measurements enables an assumption of a net zero axial flow within the white cavity region hence the gray regions fully compose the entrained gas alternatively the twin vortex model is more complex at one extreme it is limited by the case of no net entrainment outside of the shear layers v vt p 0 c q c q sl in this condition the vortex tubes only have sufficient cross sectional area to relieve the gas within the shear layers the dimensions of these vortices are assumed to be established by circulatory considerations campbell and hilborne 1958 and behave like rigid ducts and are impermeable to the gas considering the mass balance further modeling is needed if ventilation is greater or less than this unique value 3 4 1 1 thinning shear layer tsl cavity thinning of the shear layer occurs when c q c q sl which is a condition where the vortex tubes are overwhelmed by the shear layer entrained gas note that the vortex tube dimensions are determined by circulatory effects driving liquid motion to the air the liquid is similar to a rigid wall thus accommodation of the gas flow rate must require either an acceleration of gas into the tubes or lessening of the entrained air it seems reasonable to approximate the flow rate in the vortex tube displacement layer to be at the free stream velocity i e v vt v thus as already suggested it is assumed that the liquid entrained shear layer thins upstream of the tubes the cfd results support this conjecture a mass balance of the dashed control volume in fig 10 indicates that the air in the vortex tube is determined by c q sl less the gas recovered via shear layer thinning recovered gas therefore establishes a recirculating cavity behavior yielding conditions of v c 0 and v vt p 0 3 4 1 2 pressure driven pd cavity this is a hypothetical condition expected to occur for conditions where c q c q sl in this condition the vortex tubes provide excessive space for the shear layer gas providing free flow through the vortex tubes and eliminating the adverse pressure gradient at the cavity closure region in this condition it is anticipated that the flow acts more like a pipe flow forming a negative axial pressure gradient and a downstream axial flow throughout the cavity and vortex tubes such a process is consistent with the theory of cox clayden spurk 2002 and is expected to occur for large cavities forming at high ventilation rates in this condition a net positive cavity flow forms yielding average axial velocities in the cavity where v c 0 and v vt p 0 the described processes are used to shape a new model for gas entrainment the model is composed of two components given by 4 c q c q s l c q p here c q sl is the contribution from shear layer effects paralleling toroidal closure models cox and clayden 1955 c q p is driven by an axial pressure gradient between the cavity and the vortex core combining the pressure gradients concepts campbell and hilborne 1958 with a model of the twin vortex geometry campbell and hilborne 1958 3 4 2 shear layer gas entrainment although the approach of spurk fully accounts for gas entrained into shear layers it does not consider shear layer thinning or twin vortex cavities consider the application of eq 2 and experimental measurements campbell and hilborne 1958 in fig 11 a those experiments include hysteretic phenomena with twin vortex and toroidal cavity closures for a ventilated circular disk cavitator at fr n 15 5 and re n 172 800 eq 2 yields an excellent prediction for the toroidal cavities right portion of the curve however in the twin vortex regime eq 2 displays an over prediction of the ventilation rate c q required for a given cavity pressure σ c based on insight from the cfd the inclusion of a shear layer thinning model may address this discrepancy in order to approximately model c q s l a recovery factor is introduced that quantifies the shear layer gas that is recovered back into the cavity specifically this recovery factor is the ratio of the spurk theory gas that does not escape through the vortex tubes the shear layer flow rate is obtained using eq 2 which is calibrated to a toroidal cavity for a given fr n and re n the recovery factor k r q is then defined through the following relation 5 c q s l 1 k r q c q s p u r k k r q 1 c q s l c q s p u r k here c q s l is used rather than c q as it represents the air entrainment due to shear layer driven processes physically k rq is the fraction by volume of the gas stripped from the cavity shear layer and must be less than unity for physical relevance to cavity shear layers when k rq is between zero and one a portion of the cavity shear layer gas is recovered into the cavity when k rq is zero shear layers are fully entrained and the c q spurk model predicts the gas entrainment well negative k rq values indicate that the cavity is entraining more gas than entrained by the boundary layers alone presumably in this condition a favorable axial pressure gradient exists corresponding to the pd type cavity the k rq quantities from the experiment are plotted in fig 11 b these values are computed though establishing the constant in eq 2 in the toroidal vortex regime then solving eq 5 for k rq in the toroidal and twin vortex cavity regimes the trends of k rq σ c are as anticipated in the toroidal regime k rq is near zero indicating the spurk model predicts the air entrainment rate consistently throughout that region for twin vortex cavities k rq is positive indicating that the shear layers are recovered into the twin vortex cavity moreover although the data does not span a range to definitively support this it appears that k rq is approaching zero as the cavitation number decreases further in the twin vortex regime in the twin vortex hysteretic regime i e the q decreasing curve the values of k rq peaks and asymptotes to a value of 0 65 prior to recovering to the toroidal vortex cavity in the context of this experimental setup containing partial and twin vortex cavitation the peak value indicates that gas recovery from the shear layers is maximized in the hysteresis regime in the toroidal vortex hysteretic regime i e the q increasing curve k rq takes on small negative values such result indicates that the shear layer model underpredicts the gas entrainment rate hence toroidal structures are probably extracting gas advected from the main cavity as well within this regime the approach used in eq 5 to quantity k rq appears to provide valuable insight into the theory of spurk with respect to other conditions yielding evidence that this is a potentially valid approach the goal is to develop a model for the observed behavior using physical arguments and experimental data ultimately this model will provide the recovery factor k rq consider k rq with respect to c q σc there are essentially two modes that need to be considered 1 toroidal and 2 twin vortex a path to approximate these behaviors is proposed first using the empirically determined twin vortex to toroidal vortex transition criterion campbell and hilborne 1958 the toroidal regime can be estimated then in the toroidal regions k rq is set to zero a heaviside function can be used to enforce this transition criterion and revert the model to c q spurk when σfr values are greater than unity in the twin vortex range a simple model for the recovery is constructed based on the size of twin vortex and an effective shear layer thickness a diagram describing the basis of the model is provided in fig 12 from figs 10 and 12 represents conditions where the twin vortex tubes are smaller than the shear layer gas in fig 12 a the fully developed shear layers are indicated which are based on the cfd observations from fig 7 the gas in this region is determined by c q spurk eq 2 in fig 12 b the model is depicted at the arrival of the gas at the twin vortex closure the diagram is an interpretation of the cfd results figs 4 and 6 that indicate separate regions of entrained and recirculated gas specifically the model aims to quantify the gas that recirculates as indicated in the streamlines of fig 6 a second way of visualizing such behavior is through the c q l contours of fig 6 where the most aft contour plot indicates the converging of the shear layer flow in green with a recirculated gas in blue i e gas moving upstream that separated from the cavity shear layer moving back to the model the entrained gas appears in fig 12 c i e the twin vortex cores the model heuristic is a region of converging shear layers with a demarcating stagnation streamline as indicated in fig 12 b the concept of a stagnation streamline originates from conditions where the air entrainment exceeds the cavity shear layer gas such conditions demand flow reversal of part of the cavity shear layer gas note that this is similar to the model of jet gas entrainment model proposed by paryshev 2006 on the cavity interface side of the stagnation streamline the gas is entrained on the other side the gas is returned to the cavity in order to develop the model several parameters from fig 12 need to be defined it is hypothesized that the converging stagnation streamlines are located a distance from the cavity interface equal to the radius of the twin vortices this distance can be estimated via eq 1 which relates to the area of the two twin vortices and axial velocity through the tubes i e 2 a v t v c q c h m v d n 2 where a v t π r v t 2 rearranging these relations a normalized vortex tube radius r vt r n is determined 6 r v t r n 2 c q c h m π note that surface tension effects could be introduced in this part of the model through a modified vortex radius but are neglected in this relation as application scale is often at high weber numbers i e w e ρ v d n σ for reference epshtein 1970 suggests that for conditions where we is greater than 1000 0 surface tension is unimportant which captures most application scale conditions an effective shear layer thickness δ can also be computed in order to approximate δ a power law based shear layer profile is introduced 7 v v 1 r c r δ 1 n in the context of this approximation it is assumed that velocity approaches v at the interface and zero at a distance δ inward from the cavity interface here as indicated in fig 12 a r is the radius from the cavity centerline and r c is the cavity radius this model is equivalent the power law model with a power of n for a turbulent boundary layer in the corrected reference frame of the cavity interface the approximation is then related to the model of eq 2 8 c q s p u r k 2 π v d n 2 r c δ r c r v 1 r c r δ 1 n d r our aim is to find the stagnation streamline based of geometric restrictions of the cavity approaching the twin vortex tubes hence as indicated in fig 12 the shear layer can be split into two portions as the main concern is the air entrainment behavior near the vortex tubes we focus on δ near the aft end of the cavity at a point near where the vortex tubes form fig 12 b in this model we argue that if the shear layer thickness is less than the vortex radius i e δ r v t the shear layer gas is unaffected the model aims to account for conditions where the shear layer is thicker than the vortex tube i e δ r v t which is the conditions when the shear layer gas is likely to be recovered in approximately quantifying the recirculated gas consider the threshold point of the cavity indicated in fig 12 b i e where r c δ upstream of this point the entrainment model of spurk 2002 yields a condition that c q s p u r k 2 π v d n 2 0 δ r v 1 δ r δ 1 n d r which can be solved as follows 9 c q s p u r k π 3 n 1 4 n 2 6 n 2 δ 2 r n 2 the shear layer thickness near the vortex tubes may then be determined 10 δ r n 1 π 4 n 2 6 n 2 3 n 1 c q s p u r k as indicated in the shear layer diagrams in fig 12 the entrained gas unshaded remains attached to the interface and exits the cavity the recovered gas shaded is gas that the vortex core cannot support and returns to the cavity it is assumed that the boundary layer thickness remains unchanged and that the stagnation streamline delineating these flow paths is defined geometrically by the distance r vt from the cavity interface in this case the entrained gas c q can be computed using the assumption that r c δ and through the integration of the shear layer i e c q 2 π v d n 2 0 r v t r v 1 δ r δ 1 n d r then the recovery factor is the ratio of recovered gas the gray region from fig 10 b to the total gas in the shear layer

the just introduced power law coefficient for the boundary layer is then a complete model of the recovery of shear layer gas in fig 13 the amount of shear layer entrained gas i e c q sl as given from eq 9 obtained using the just derived recovery factor k rq is presented with a subset of the experimental measurements campbell and hilborne 1958 note that the subset of the experiment used for this fit had employed a 0 0127 m cavitator diameter and a free stream velocity of 5 49 m s corresponding to r e n of 172 8 10 3 and f r n of 15 5 the profile coefficient n was set equal to 9 based on a least squares fit of the model from eq 5 supplemented with eq 12 to the data shown in fig 13 note that model results provide reasonable agreement for n values between 4 and 15 the model does not precisely predict the transitional regime near the arrow pointing downward and to the right but is however capable of reproducing trends similar to the experimental data and display a significant improvement over previous models in this region in addition at the highest ventilation values the model approaches that of campbell and hilborne with an underlying assumption that the velocity in the vortex is roughly the free stream velocity throughout the core it is believed that in a pd cavity the ventilation rates can exceed those values thus the aforementioned behavior is not ideal 3 4 3 pressure driven gas entrainment to complete model development the pressure gradient driven component or c q p must be defined the process is to simply adopt the air entrainment model from campbell hilborne denoted by c q chm but limit its application to the appropriate regime c q p is simply assumed to be the maximum given by eq 13 this implies that the pressure gradient component is only significant when the model twin vortices are sufficiently large to entrain the entirety of hypothesized shear layer entrained gas 13 c q p max c q c h m c q s p u r k 0 h the results of the combination of eqns 5 and 13 substituted into the proposed model eq 4 are plotted in fig 14 note that the prediction conforms nicely to the data for toroidal and twin vortex cavities and behaves as expected approaching high c q values 3 4 4 application of model the considered air entrainment models and the final form of the presently developed model are summarized in table 1 the present model can be considered as a composite of previously proposed gas entrainment models based on shear layer entrainment spurk 2002 twin vortex volume capture spurk 2002 the present model employs a shear layer power law with an n value of 9 these models are now to be compared with respect to various experimental datasets the application of the model is extended to other archival datasets campbell and hilborne 1958 the semi empirical nature of the present model requires some calibration using the entire data sets of campbell and hilborne it was found that the twin vortex to toroidal transition criterion of σfr n 1 1 was more accurate than the previously established value of σfr n 1 0 the spurk model coefficient k q which is a function of reynolds number and experimental setup could be determined analytically or empirically this effort chose the empirical approach using a subset of each dataset based on the lowest fr number case the underlying k q correlation takes a form that scales like the model of spurk which is given as k q d 1 e d 2 f r n here d 1 and d 2 are constants that are used to empirically match these lower f r n results in all cases d 1 0 0316 and d 2 0 1226 which in the context of the series of studies to be discussed yields k q values ranging from 0 004 to 0 012 from the empirical database compared to 0 0042 in fig 11 note that future estimations of this correlation may need to consider reynolds number as well nevertheless using this correlation we can estimate shear layer content as a function of f r n in fig 15 experimental data in the twin vortex regime campbell and hilborne 1958 are presented along with results from the model and its constitutive parts the full model results are provided in fig 15 a in general the results agree well with the experimental measurements for a range of conditions in particular the model predicts the air entrainment rate well for smaller twin vortex cavities to the authors knowledge these results are the first reasonable reduced physics predictions of air entrainment within the hysteresis region twin vortex cavity for high fr values the transition is not as well predicted as at low fr such lack of agreement is due to a deficit in the transition criterion additionally note the sharp deviation in the model that is not observed in the experiment that feature is the model transitioning to a prediction of the toroidal vortex solution in fig 15 c similar prediction parity comparisons are made for the models of campbell and hiborne fig 15 b and epshtein given in equation 1 17 in kinzel 2008 with respect to results from those models the present model indicates a significant improvement in fig 16 an overview of the effectiveness of the present model and archival models in prediction parity form is given in these plots each discrete point indicates the predicted value of an experimental condition versus the experimental measurement of that same condition as the goal of the model is to predict similar values to the measurements an ideal curve is also presented that indicates perfect agreement between the model and experiment models with strong correlation to experiment will have data points on or near the ideal line whereas poor correlation will deviate significantly from the ideal line first consider fig 16 a which compares the prediction parity for all three models against the entire campbell and hilborne 1958 dataset the present model results clearly concur with experimental results at lower flow rates and diverge at higher ventilation rates over the data set the model exhibits less than 8 error in comparison with results obtained using the campbell and hilborne and the epshtein models the present approach appears to be an improvement in fig 16 b d the comparison is expanded to additional data sets epshtein 1973 swanson and o neill 1951 in fig 16 b the prediction parity for the present model is shown the overall results indicate a reasonable correlation to both the swanson and o neill and epshtein data sets when compared to the campbell and hilborne and the epshtein models evaluated using the same original data in fig 16 c and d respectively the current model appears clearly better in the context of this comparison it is important to mention that such comparisons are limited to data available in the literature which tends to be small scale cavitators i e low reynolds number at these small scales the shear layers are thicker and the cases highlight scenarios where the models we focus on are most prevalent for this reason the epshtein model for example does not compare well with the data such discrepancies are not expected over broader data sets covering large scale cavitators an area of concern appears at increased ventilation rates where the model tends to under predict the measurements such an under prediction could plausibly be due to the model not predicting the transition from tsl to pd cavities well or assumptions embedded in the campbell and hilborne model the impact of the transition from tsl to pd cavities can be best understood using the individual model constituents plotted in fig 15 b and d in terms of these data both c q chm and c q spurk tend to over predict the experimental measurements compared to the under prediction of the present model in addition we note that k r q remains active in all conditions causing the deficit with respect to the model constituents in the current state there are two potential issues 1 the model of k r q is breaking down for pd cavities or 2 the underlying assumptions of the campbell and hilborne model notable the gas velocity in the tubes is breaking down additional evaluation of these model components is a subject of future research 4 conclusions the gaseous flow within the cavity forming behind a ventilated cavitator has been analyzed using cfd it was found that the cavity gas entrainment process strongly depends on the shear layers forming on the cavity interface corroborating previous theory spurk 2002 the investigations also found that such shear layer mechanisms also contribute to gas entrainment from twin vortex cavities and cavities interacting with bodies the implication of this cfd based observation involves many aspects of modeling twin vortex cavities in supercavitation the insight gathered from the cfd is used to update models of gas entrainment understand cfd modeling of supercavitation and develop a more detailed understanding of ventilation gas flow in a supercavity it is found that the gas entrainment process from a twin vortex supercavity is consistent with the theory of spurk specifically ventilation gas is entrained into shear layers on the cavity interface providing a mechanism to pull the gas towards the aft end of the cavity the process initiates just aft of the cavitator where gas is drawn into these shear layers from the cavity and ventilation ports as the shear layer pulls gas downstream the shear layers thicken until roughly the maximum radius of the cavity thereafter a shear layer thinning mechanism begins adverse pressure gradients form as the shear layer gas approaches the aft end of the cavity however the attached layer is pulled in the reverse direction by the reverse cavity flow therefore these gradients are shear thinning and stabilize the attached shear layer it is the general conclusion that if the closure mechanism is a toroidal vortex the shear layer entrained gas at the closure will exit unabated through the shedding of toroidal cavities if the closure mechanism is twin vortex further shear thinning appears to occur at the formation of the twin vortex at that point a rapid convergence in the cavity appears to lead to portions of shear layers to be stripped off and recovered back to the cavity the observations from cfd helped to identify issues with cfd turbulence modeling approaches suggests potential scaling issues for supercavitation and guided the formulation of improved models of gas entrainment when applied straightforwardly rans models tend to over predict the amount of gas entrained within cavity shear layers leading to an over predicted ventilation rate the over prediction appears to be due to the seemingly erroneous high levels of modeled eddy viscosity at interfaces approaches that aim to reduce the rans model eddy viscosity within the cavity such as des are thus sensible additionally as we are finding that cavity shear layers are critical to precise gas entrainment studies reynolds number effects typically considered of lesser importance may also be important when investigating ventilation requirements thus data obtained at low reynolds number may not provide accurate air entrainment prediction at full scale this would likely become more significant when considering cavities that close partly or fully on solid bodies as there may be interactions of the shear layer with the body lastly an updated gas entrainment model has been proposed the model is a physically guided combination of archival regime specific models campbell and hilborne 1958 combined with a model of shear layer gas recovery in addition it was tested for a range of experimental data the updated model results correlate well with experimental measurements for the air entrainment rate from a twin vortex cavity over a wide range of froude numbers experimental configurations and ventilation rates there is however a limit in that the model does not perform well for high ventilation rates the present results highlight several areas where physical numerical models still falls short first the significance of gaseous shear layer mechanisms and their effect on air entrainment from a cavity closing on a body was identified a proper model of the resulting interactions and physical processes is important to understand air entrainment for partial cavitation second cfd rans turbulence models have not been developed that properly model turbulence in the region of gas liquid interfacial flows this is a requirement for cfd to accurately and reliably capture air entrainment physics the present results indicate that a des based turbulence model may fortuitously predict air entrainment but not for physically sound reliable reasons hence turbulences adapted to gas liquid interfacial flow would greatly improve the usefulness of supercavitation cfd thirdly the updated model of air entrainment exhibits an improvement compared to the archival models however the updated model still falls short specifically the updated model does not capture high ventilation rates at rates where other physics greatly augment shear layers mechanisms a further update of the present model should enable the model to capture the full range of buoyant supercavities lastly the lack of experimental data suitable to measure ventilated supercavity gas entrainment in a real environment is an issue the proposed model is validated using historical yet seminal experimental measurements experiments that measure air entrainment at multiple scales for various cavitator types and spanning multiple regimes in a tunnel without blockage are a present
