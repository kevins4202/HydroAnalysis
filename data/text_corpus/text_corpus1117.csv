5585,tides and river water affect the groundwater vertical flow in the shallow soil in estuary areas which in turn determines the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes the groundwater vertical flow under the influence of the interaction of saltwater and freshwater is very complicated and includes upward porewater flow driven by evapotranspiration and downward groundwater drainage in this study in situ experiments were conducted to investigate the groundwater vertical flow direction and rate in four macrophytes zones of salt marsh macrophytes in the yellow river estuarine nature reserve this study found that there are significant differences in groundwater vertical flow among these four macrophytes zones 1 in the bare flat zone the downward drainage of groundwater and the upward porewater movement process frequently alternate the processes of accumulation of and reduction in shallow soil salinity frequently alternate and it is difficult for salt to accumulate continuously 2 the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone is mainly affected by tides there are long periods of continuous porewater upward movement or groundwater downward drainage and salinity in the shallow soils continues to accumulate or decrease during these periods 3 in the chinese tamarisk zone the groundwater table is deep and the moisture content of the shallow soil is low the groundwater vertical flow is mainly an upward porewater process caused by evapotranspiration and the shallow soil salinity accumulates gradually 4 in the staggered growth zone the groundwater vertical flow characteristics of both the bare flat zone and the chinese tamarisk zone are evident in general in the salt marshes of the yellow river estuary the tides and the yellow river recharge affect the characteristics of the salt marsh groundwater the salt marsh macrophytes are affected by the interactions of water and salt in the shallow soil which form band shaped macrophytes zones keywords groundwater salt marsh macrophytes zonation estuarine 1 introduction salt marsh is a high productivity ecosystem with important ecological service functions and ecological values mostly distributed in coastal and estuary areas mitsch and gosselink 2000 boorman 2003 sun et al 2015 the estuary salt marsh plays a key role in water storage and flood control maintaining the regional water balance protecting biodiversity and maintaining the ecological integrity of the river ge et al 2015 2016 in a salt marsh ecosystem the environmental gradient is obvious and the species composition is relatively simple the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes living in the estuary often shows a characteristic band distribution emery et al 2001 zheng et al 2016 salt marsh macrophytes under natural conditions are generally divided into five macrophytes zones from low to high elevation 1 the pioneer macrophyte zone 2 the low tide beach zone 3 the middle tide beach zone 4 the high tide beach zone and 5 the transition zone the main features of macrophytes at the lower elevations are salt tolerance and flood resistance pioneer macrophytes gradually transition to higher elevations as mesophytes boorman 2003 the band distribution characteristics of salt marsh macrophytes have important reference value in the ecological restoration of salt marsh wetlands at present the ecological restoration of salt marsh wetlands in estuarine areas mainly occurs through water recharge and hydrological regulation fraaije et al 2015 therefore it is urgent to conduct research on the ecological and hydrological aspects of estuarine salt marsh wetlands and provide technical support for restoration the study of the factors affecting the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes and its mechanisms is of particular significance to ecological protection and restoration work in the estuary area nicholls 2004 the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes is controlled by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors huckle et al 2002 in the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors abiotic factors have a decisive role in the ecological division of salt marsh macrophytes while biotic factors mostly have local effects alicia et al 2015 macrophyte interspecific competition pennings and silliman 2005 transpiration effects on microclimate moffett et al 2012 enrichment of soil elements and nutrient uptake morris 1980 2006 marani et al 2013 affect the habitat of salt marsh macrophytes which in turn affects their ecological zonation in addition mammals furbish and albano 1994 birds zhao et al 2003 insects daehler and strong 1997 fish benthic animals silliman et al 2004 and microbial communities mchugh and dighton 2004 fisher et al 2005 also directly and indirectly affect the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes salt marshes are highly heterogeneous ecosystems they are influenced by tidal regularity and by abiotic factors closely related to tides such as salinity inundation time and frequency nutrient availability soil granularity and oxygen tolerance abiotic factors also exhibit changes along environmental gradients thus leading to changes in the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes along a gradient adam 1990 current research divides abiotic factors into resource factors and conditional factors begon et al 2006 the study of resource factors focuses on the nutrient availability of salt marsh soils which directly affects the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes emery et al 2001 ewanchuk and bertness 2004 brown et al 2006 the study of conditional factors focuses on two factors inundation and salinity noe and zedler 2000 noe 2002 for the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes frequent and prolonged inundation and high salinity are the two most important stress inducing and influential factors snow and vince 1984 long term high frequency inundation can reduce soil oxygen content and reduce soil nutrient availability thereby limiting macrophyte growth and affecting macrophyte zonation in salt marshes bertness et al 1992 crawford 1992 ewanchuk and bertness 2004 on the one hand soil salinity is affected by tidal waves climatic effects such as evapotranspiration and rainfall and rivers entering the estuary on the other hands the influence degree of these factors varies with the surface elevation changes in salinity with elevation are complicated mahal and park 1976 adam 1990 soil salinity can determine the osmotic pressure of the environment in which macrophytes are located and has significant effects on physiological processes such as the seed germination photosynthesis and growth of salt marsh macrophytes pearcy and ustin 1984 rozema and diggelen 1991 noe and zedler 2000 noe 2002 different salt marsh macrophytes have different tolerances to salinity so the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes is significantly affected by soil salinity julkowska and testerink 2015 xue et al 2018 many studies have shown that these abiotic factors are related to the elevation and hydrological processes of salt marshes silvestri et al 2005 especially in relation to groundwater processes in shallow soil gardner 1973 hemond and fifield 1982 harvey et al 1987 harvey and odum 1990 nuttle and harvey 1995 groundwater process is the main route of solute migration in soil guo et al 2008 2011 2013 2014 2016 2019 famiglietti 2014 groundwater characteristics and drainage rates are major factors affecting abiotic factors in salt marsh wetlands gardner 2005 2007 xin et al 2009 2010 2011 wilson and morris 2012 the gradient distribution of abiotic factors under different groundwater regimes controls the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes wilson et al 2011 moffett et al 2012 xin et al 2013 however most of the current research focuses on coastal salt marsh wetlands and their tidal driven groundwater characteristics which control the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes alicia et al 2015 there are significant differences between estuarine salt marsh wetlands and coastal salt marsh wetlands which are mainly reflected in the fact that the soil groundwater vertical flow characteristics of the estuary salt marsh are affected by the tide xie et al 2017 the river flowing into the sea also has a significant impact chen et al 2004 chen et al 2006 changes in runoff can affect river groundwater recharge relationships and recharge intensity thereby changing soil groundwater characteristics suzuki 1990 zheng et al 2004 the estuarine salt marsh also shows an obvious macrophyte band distribution along the sea land river gradient qi 2018 at present there are few reports on the ecological zonation and impact factors of estuarine salt marsh macrophytes under the influence of tides and rivers the control effect of estuarine salt marsh groundwater vertical flow characteristics on the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes needs to be studied in this study groundwater monitoring wells and water level recorders were used to continuously measure groundwater head data in situ thus providing an explanation based on soil groundwater processes rather than on statistical significance for the ecological zonation of estuarine salt marsh macrophytes combined with statistical analysis this method detects the hydrogeological characteristics of the root area of salt marsh macrophytes in estuarine areas and the differences in hydrogeological characteristics among different macrophyte zones the research area of this study is the yellow river estuarine nature reserve this study aims to answer three scientific questions 1 what are the differences in groundwater vertical flow characteristics between different salt marsh macrophyte zones in the estuary 2 what effect do the estuarine groundwater vertical flow characteristics have on the hydrogeological parameters in the root area of salt marsh macrophytes 3 what are the mechanisms by which the estuarine groundwater vertical flow characteristics control the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes 2 methods 2 1 study area the yellow river estuarine nature reserve fig 1 is located in the estuarine area of the yellow river in north eastern dongying city shandong province bordering the bohai sea in the north and laizhou bay in the east the geographical coordinates are 37 35 38 12 n 118 33 119 20 e and the total study area covered 15 3 104 hm2 2 2 field methods this study carried out field monitoring in the experimental area for 28 days july 2 to july 29 2019 in the salt marsh a transect a a with a length of approximately 4000 m was set along the sea land yellow river gradient fig 1 on this gradient there are band distribution characteristics of salt marsh plants the north side of the transect was the ocean which is affected by tides the south side of the transect was the yellow river channel in early july the yellow river was in a period of water and sediment regulation and the water level surged in this transect it is divided into five macrophytes zones according to the dominant plant species bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone staggered growth zone chinese tamarisk zone and reed zone and groundwater monitoring sites were set in each macrophyte zone in bare flat zone there is almost no plant growth and there is a small amount of suaeda heteroptera kitag scattered sporadically in suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the dominant species is suaeda heteroptera kitag which is mainly carpet like distribution in staggered growth zone suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk are staggered distribution in chinese tamarisk zone the dominant species is chinese tamarisk which is mainly patchy distribution in reed zone the dominant species is reed w1 was set in the bare flat zone w3 was set in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone w5 was set in the staggered growth zone and w10 was set in the chinese tamarisk zone each groundwater monitoring site was provided with two groundwater monitoring wells with screen depths of 0 5 1 m and 2 2 5 m fig 2 some pre investigations had been carried out on this transect during march to june 2019 the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil were monitored on the 25th of each month in these pre investigations the reed zone was small and the shallow soil salinity was extremely low and hardly changed therefore this study only considered the bare flat zone the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the staggered growth zone and the chinese tamarisk zone in this study the tidal level monitoring site and the yellow river water level monitoring site were set on the tidal creek a and the yellow river bank a respectively the tide levels and the yellow river water levels were recorded separately using capacitive tube type water level recorders dataflow odyssey capacitive water level water temperature recorders in this study in situ monitoring of shallow soil moisture content and salinity was carried out 10 times at every groundwater monitoring site the monitoring data were taken on july 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 and 29 2019 considering that the shallow soil moisture content and salinity of salt marshes have significant effects on the roots of salt marsh macrophytes and that the roots of salt marsh macrophytes are shallow xin et al 2013 this study collected soil samples from 0 to 40 cm deep during each sampling period 3 soil samples were collected from each zone for a total of 15 samples and measured moisture content and salinity in the laboratory after the experimental determination the mean value of 3 samples in each zone was taken as moisture content and salinity a total of 150 soil samples were collected in this study the method for determining the moisture content of the shallow soil was the drying weighing method and the method for determining the salinity was the leaching method one way analysis of variance anova was a statistical test which makes a single overall decision as to whether a significant difference is present among three or more sample means anova was used to analyze the difference in the salinity and moisture content across the different macrophytes zones 2 3 hydraulic analyses the hydraulic analysis in this study focused on the vertical flow characteristics of groundwater in shallow soils including the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow the water level recorders were placed in the groundwater monitoring wells with different screen depths at each groundwater monitoring site before july 2 9 during july 10 16 and after july 17 29 the yellow river water and sediment regulation period groundwater monitoring was carried out the groundwater level data were continuously recorded and the time step of each record was 1 h the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow were determined by analysing groundwater head data from two groundwater monitoring wells with different screen depths at different groundwater monitoring sites hemond and fifield 1982 the groundwater vertical water level difference dh was used as an analytical indicator to indicate the groundwater level difference between the two groundwater monitoring wells with different screen depths at each groundwater monitoring site the formula is 1 dh h d h s where dh is the groundwater vertical water head difference m hd is the groundwater head m measured by the groundwater monitoring well with the screen position of 2 2 5 m and hs is the groundwater head m measured by the groundwater monitoring well with the screen position of 0 5 1 m according to the darcy formula when dh is positive the vertical flow direction of groundwater is upward when dh is negative the vertical flow direction of groundwater is downward the magnitude of dh is proportional to the rate of vertical flow of the groundwater fetter 2001 2 4 synergistic relationship analyses using the data from in situ monitoring in july 2019 redundancy analysis rda was used to study the relationship between the explanatory variables the shallow soil moisture content and salinity and the environmental variables the groundwater salinity the groundwater depth the surface elevation the distance from the yellow river the yellow river water level the tide level and the tidal range and to understand the water salt synergistic relationship between the groundwater and the shallow soil considering that soil salinity is a process of accumulation he et al 2009 the rda analysis of the synergistic relationship between groundwater and shallow soil in this study was performed from two perspectives 1 the existing state es and 2 the change between continuous monitoring points ccm the instantaneous values of both explanatory and environmental variables are used in the analysis of es the analysis of ccm uses the change in the instantaneous value between two consecutives in situ monitoring points time interval is 72 h and δ h the cumulative value of dh over 72 h represents the change in dh during the monitoring period since the units of the explanatory variables and the environmental variables are different all variables needed to be normalized before rda analysis this study used a z score standardization method with the following formula 2 z x μ σ where is the case value z is the normalized result of the case μ is the population mean and σ is the standard deviation of the population 3 result 3 1 groundwater characteristics in different macrophytes zone groundwater and soil properties monitored by groundwater monitoring wells represent groundwater and soil properties in macrophytes zones the monitoring results fig 3 a showed that there are differences in the salinity and moisture content of the shallow soil among the bare flat zone w1 suaeda heteroptera kitag zone w3 staggered growth zone w5 chinese tamarisk zone w7 and reed zone w10 from the sea to the land the shallow soil salinity first increases and then decreases reaching a maximum in the chinese tamarisk zone moisture content shows the opposite pattern the salinity and moisture content of the shallow soil in the bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and staggered growth zone were similar and the shallow soil salinity in these zones was significantly lower than that in the chinese tamarisk zone the shallow soil moisture content in these zones was significantly higher than that in the chinese tamarisk zone the soil salinity of the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone near the ocean is lower the moisture content is higher and the range of variation is smaller than those of the other zones in contrast the salinity of the chinese tamarisk zone near the yellow river is higher the moisture content is lower and the range of variation is larger than those of the other zones the salinity and moisture content of the staggered growth zone located between the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and chinese tamarisk zone are more consistent with those of the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone as a transitional zone the salinity and moisture content of the staggered growth zone is in a suitable range for suaeda heteroptera kitag and the staggered growth zone has a wide range of moisture content and salinity variation which provides an ecological niche for chinese tamarisk the chinese tamarisk zone has the highest salinity and it is near the high tide beaches salt marsh research on the southern atlantic coast of the united states also found that the salinity of salt marshes on the middle and high tide beaches is often much higher than that of the nearby low lying beach salt marshes creating a peak of salinity in the middle and high tide beaches wang et al 2010 pennings and silliman 2005 the phenomenon of salinity reaching its peak on middle and high tide beach salt marshes is found globally he et al 2009 time series plot of shallow soil salinity monitoring results are shown in fig 3 b during the yellow river water and sediment regulation period july 10 16 shallow soil salinity appeared minimum value at groundwater monitoring sites w5 and w7 compared with the period before and after the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the decrease of shallow soil salinity at w7 is very obvious the yellow river water and sediment has an impact on salinity decline in chinese tamarisk zone however the effect on salinity in other zones is not obvious time series plot of shallow soil salinity monitoring results are shown in fig 3 c there is no obvious relationship between the yellow river water and sediment and moisture content the anova analysis results of shallow soil salinity and moisture content are provided in table 1 at 95 confidence level p value of shallow soil salinity is 0 000 0 05 p value of shallow soil moisture content is 0 001 0 05 at 95 confidence level there is a significant difference in the salinity and moisture content across the different zones the monitoring results of the tide and the yellow river water levels fig 4 indicate that there is a continuous influence of the spring neap tide at site a on the transect the tidal cycle is approximately 14 days the spring tide appears around july 6 and 18 and the neap tide appears around july 12 and 26 the water level of the yellow river at site a of the transect was greatly disturbed by humans and the water level fluctuated sharply before july 2 9 during july 10 16 and after july 17 29 the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the water level change was significant during the regulation period the water level of the yellow river surged and the water level fluctuated greatly before and after the period the water level was lower on the a a transect the anova analysis results of dh are provided in table 2 at 95 confidence level p value of dh is 0 000 0 05 at 95 confidence level the groundwater characteristics of the bare flat zone w1 suaeda heteroptera kitag zone w3 staggered growth zone w5 and chinese tamarisk zone w7 are significantly different in the bare flat zone fig 5 a the vertical flow direction of the groundwater alternates frequently during the 14 day tidal cycle and the vertical flow rate changes periodically the vertical flow direction of groundwater is significantly affected by the tides the frequent alternation of the groundwater flow direction occurs mostly around the neap tide day and the process dominated by the downward flow frequently occurs around the spring tide day the 24 h moving average of dh before and after the first neap tide day is positive but the 24 h moving average of dh before and after the second neap tide day is negative and the general direction of groundwater vertical flow is opposite on the two neap tide days the rate of vertical groundwater vertical flow is also significantly affected by the tides the rate of vertical groundwater vertical flow shows a continuous trend from the neap tide days to the spring tide days and from the spring tide days to the neap tide days the rate of vertical groundwater vertical flow decreases first and then increases the variation process is characterized by fluctuations the rate of groundwater vertical flow before and after the spring and neap tide days appears to be extremely high in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone fig 5 b the groundwater characteristics are also affected by tides and are significantly different from the groundwater characteristics in the bare flat zone the groundwater characteristics in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone were similar to those in the bare flat zone in the 14 day period of the tide but the alternation frequency of the vertical flow direction of the groundwater was significantly reduced the rate of vertical flow changes periodically and the change range increases around the neap tide day and the second spring tide day the upward porewater process and the downward groundwater process both continue for a period of time which is the biggest difference from the pattern in the bare flat zone this difference was also observed in the staggered growth zone and the chinese tamarisk zone in the chinese tamarisk zone fig 5 d the groundwater characteristics are significantly different from those of both the bare flat zone and the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone which are controlled by tides the yellow river recharge in the chinese tamarisk zone is the main controlling factor of groundwater during the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the yellow river water level suddenly increases the direction of groundwater vertical flow is upward and the rate of groundwater vertical flow increases with the rise of the water level the staggered growth zone fig 5 c is an area dominated by two salt marsh macrophytes the groundwater characteristics are the same as those in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone when the water level of the yellow river is high during the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the groundwater characteristics in the staggered zone and the chinese tamarisk zone are the same the water level of the yellow river is lower before and after yellow river water and sediment regulation and the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone and the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone are similar 3 2 synergistic relationship between groundwater and shallow soil the rda results for shallow soil moisture content and salinity with the existing state environmental factors fig 6 a show that the eigenvalues of the first two sorting axes are 0 7539 and 0 2275 respectively and the total eigenvalue is 98 14 there is a good explanation for the shallow soil moisture content and salinity in the existing state the distance from the yellow river and the depth of groundwater are the main factors influencing the moisture content of the shallow soil the groundwater depth is negatively correlated with the moisture content of the shallow soil and the distance from the yellow river is positively correlated with the moisture content of the shallow soil the contributions of other environmental factors are small this result indicates that the tides and yellow river recharges affect the shallow soil moisture content by affecting the depth of groundwater and the influence of tides on the shallow soil moisture content is greater than that of the yellow river considering that the depth of the collected shallow soil samples is above the groundwater level the soil samples monitored in this study are all unsaturated soils and the relationship between shallow soil moisture content and groundwater depth should be consistent with the shallow soil unsaturated soil water retention curve the formula is 3 θ exp α φ where θ is the soil moisture content φ is the pressure head m where φ z h h is the groundwater depth m z is the buried depth of the measuring point and both and α are parameters in this study the moisture content of the 0 40 cm shallow soil was monitored after integrating eq 3 the formula for the average moisture content θr of the 0 40 cm soil on the sample strip is 4 θ r 0 4 0 4 0 e x p α z h d z based on the results of the field monitoring of the shallow soil moisture content and the groundwater depth at the four sites the value of is 0 429 and the value of α is 0 8 the regression coefficient obtained by the regression test is r2 0 763 and the fitting degree to the monitoring data is high therefore the relationship between the moisture content of the shallow soil in the yellow river delta and the groundwater depth is 5 θ r 1 0725 0 4 0 e x p 0 8 z h d z there is a clear correlation between surface elevation tide level and shallow soil salinity however other environmental factors have less impact on shallow soil salinity however although the tide level has a significant negative correlation with shallow soil salinity the degree of interpretation is extremely low there is a positive correlation between surface elevation and shallow soil salinity this may be because the higher the elevation is the longer the surface exposure time therefore evapotranspiration causes the saltwater in the soil to evaporate and more salt is left in the soil it is worth noting that the correlation between groundwater salinity and shallow soil salinity is very weak surface evapotranspiration removes water from the shallow soil and leaves the salt within the soil this result proves that soil salinity changes are less affected by changes in groundwater salinity the change in salt is gradually accumulated or reduced considering the relationship between soil salinity and environmental factors in the existing state the salinity of shallow soil cannot be accurately quantified by environmental factors therefore the study also examined the changes during continuous monitoring fig 6 b the results show that the feature values of the first two sorting axes are 0 7531 and 0 1244 respectively and the total eigenvalue is 87 75 the changes in environmental factors during continuous monitoring can explain the changes in shallow soil moisture during continuous monitoring well it is worth noting that the change in the shallow soil salinity during continuous monitoring was significantly positively correlated with the cumulative value of the change in dh during continuous monitoring according to the results of the linear regression analysis fig 7 the change in the shallow soil salinity during continuous monitoring has a significant linear relationship with the cumulative value of the change in dh during continuous monitoring the regression coefficient is 0 838 the formula can be expressed as 6 dss 0 9152 δ h 10 6 where dss is the change in the shallow soil salinity during continuous monitoring ppt and δ h d h represents the cumulative value of the change in dh during continuous monitoring m shallow soil salinity ss can be expressed as 7 ss s s 0 d s s ss 0 0 9152 δ h 10 6 where ss0 is the shallow soil salinity ppt at first monitoring this indicates that dh can characterize the accumulation of or the reduction in soil salinity to some extent this indicates that the salt accumulation and reduction process in the shallow soil is closely related to the groundwater characteristics according to darcy s law the positive and negative state of dh can characterize the vertical flow direction of groundwater and the magnitude of dh is proportional to the rate of vertical flow of groundwater fetter 2001 when δ h is greater than 0 the groundwater vertical flow net direction is upward under these conditions net salinity increase is greater than zero and the salinity accumulates in the shallow soil the larger the δ h the higher the salinity accumulation in the shallow soil when δ h is 0 the groundwater vertical flow direction is downward net salinity increase is greater less than zero and the salinity of the shallow soil is reduced the greater the δ h the more the salinity of the shallow soil decreases δ h represents the net direction of groundwater flow over time the upward porewater flow causes the accumulation of salt in the shallow soil while the downward drainage of the groundwater leads to a decrease in the salt in the shallow soil 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the tides and river recharge on groundwater characteristics the groundwater characteristics of the salt marsh in the estuary area are affected by tides and rivers tidal inundation and rainfall recharge are the main reasons for groundwater vertical flow from top to bottom this downward flow of groundwater is a drainage process the upward movement of soil water caused by high water level replenishment in the yellow river and evapotranspiration is the main reason for the upward flow of groundwater the upward flow of groundwater is a porewater process under the influence of tides and yellow river recharge the relative intensity of the groundwater porewater and drainage processes determines the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow in the bare flat zone the vertical flow direction of the groundwater around the spring tide day is mainly downward and the alternation frequency is very low this is because the range of the tides is large and the frequency of fluctuations is low which causes the surface to be inundated for a long time around the spring tide and the groundwater to drain around the neap tide the vertical flow direction of the groundwater alternates often this is because the range of the tides is small and the frequency of fluctuation is high which causes surface inundation and exposure to alternate frequently around the neap tide day the direct recharge of seawater from the surface to the groundwater causes the groundwater to drain downward the upward flow of the porewater in the soil driven by evapotranspiration when the surface is exposed makes the groundwater move upward alicia et al 2015 therefore around the neap tide day the groundwater frequently alternates between the porewater and drainage processes around the two neap tide days the vertical flow directions of groundwater are reversed because the ratio of surface inundation and exposure time around the two neap tide days is different thus the proportion of downward and upward groundwater flow is different when the groundwater drainage process is dominant the general direction of groundwater vertical flow is downward when the groundwater experiences the porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration the general direction of groundwater vertical flow is from upward when the surface is inundated for a long time the downward drainage of groundwater accelerates the downward vertical flow of groundwater when the surface is not inundated the porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration will accelerate the upward vertical flow of groundwater in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the surface elevation is higher than that of the bare flat zone the frequency of seawater inundation is significantly reduced and the surface exposure lasts longer resulting in a lower alternation frequency of the groundwater flow direction the groundwater characteristics around the first spring tide day are different from the groundwater characteristics around the second spring tide day groundwater continued to drain downwards around the second spring tide day the groundwater vertical flow direction similar to that in the bare flat zone still alternates frequently in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone this may be because the tidal range around the first spring tide day is significantly larger than the tidal range around the second spring tide day the tide level range fluctuates greatly the frequency of inundation around the first spring tide day is higher than that around the second spring tide day and the groundwater is drained the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration therefore frequently alternates with the groundwater drainage process in the chinese tamarisk zone the altitude is the highest in the study area the surface is exposed almost year round and the groundwater level is deep when the yellow river water level increases the yellow river water continuously recharges the groundwater surface evapotranspiration also causes the soil porewater to flow upwards and in the end the groundwater level is continuously raised before and after the yellow river water and sediment regulation period surface evapotranspiration rainfall recharge and small fluctuations in the yellow river water level control the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone the groundwater characteristics are affected by the yellow river recharge and tides the intensity of the influences of these two factors is determined by the elevation of the yellow river water level when the yellow river water level is low the tide is the main factor affecting the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone are similar to those in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone which is only affected by the tide when the yellow river water level is high the yellow river recharge affects the staggered growth zone the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone are similar to those in the chinese tamarisk zone which is only affected by the yellow river recharge the groundwater characteristics of the 4 zones of the salt marsh macrophytes are affected by the tides and yellow river recharge and the surface elevation also has a significant impact on the ecological zonation of the macrophytes fig 8 the bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone staggered growth zone and chinese tamarisk zone are distributed from the sea to the land and the surface elevation increases in turn the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow are obviously related to the elevation this result is consistent with the basic hydrogeological theory of homogeneous confined aquifers freeze and cherry 1979 the bare flat zone has the lowest elevation in the study area the overall groundwater vertical flow direction drains downward and the rate varies the least the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone is also discharged from the top to the bottom in the direction of the overall groundwater vertical flow the total drainage of groundwater downward is greater than that of the bare flat zone and the drainage rate changes significantly this may be because the growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag improves the soil permeability in the area in the chinese tamarisk zone the groundwater vertical flow direction of the groundwater is the same as that in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone this shows that the influence of tides and yellow river recharge on the groundwater vertical flow rate is approximately the same but the overall direction of the groundwater vertical flow is opposite the direction of the groundwater vertical flow in the staggered growth zone is both upwards and downwards the variation in the groundwater vertical flow rate is smaller than those in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone this phenomenon indicates that in this area where the tides and the yellow river recharge are significant the overall direction of groundwater vertical flow is determined by the relative strength of the influence of the two factors when the tide is the main influencing factor the overall direction of groundwater vertical flow drains downward when the yellow river recharge is the main influencing factor the overall direction of groundwater vertical flow is upward the rate of groundwater vertical flow is weakened by the mutual offsetting of the effects of the two factors biotic factors also have local effect to the ecological zonation these local effects are most pronounced in the chinese tamarisk zone in this zone there are more top down movements of porewater than in other zones this zone also has the highest salinity some studies have found that salt secretion from chinese tamarisk can change local soil salinity yin et al 2007 cui et al 2010 salt secretion from chinese tamarisk may be another reason for the accumulation of salinity 4 2 controlling effect of groundwater characteristics on salt marsh macrophyte ecological zonation there are fewer human disturbances in the study area and the distribution of salt marsh plants is mainly affected by habitat suitability after long term growth competition and reproduction shallow soil salinity in this area where the salt marsh plants are stably distributed can reflect the range of the macrophytes suitable salinity range to a certain extent yi et al 2013 based on the results of in situ monitoring we find that the suitable salinity ranges of suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk are different the suitable salinity ranges of suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk are 6 33 8 33 ppt and 12 83 18 18 ppt respectively cui et al 2008 monitored the salinity range of suaeda heteroptera kitag in the yellow river estuarine and used gaussian statistical model the appropriate salinity range of suaeda heteroptera kitag was 5 17 20 25 ppt cui et al detected suaeda heteroptera kitag growing at higher salinity in non tidal regions however the location of w3 was in the intertidal area frequent changes in the vertical direction of groundwater flow caused by the tide made it difficult for the soil to accumulate salt based on on site monitoring data and one way anova analysis yang 2009 determined the salinity range of chinese tamarisk in the yellow river estuarine is 10 20 ppt this result is close to the results monitored in this study the tides and the yellow river recharge affect the groundwater characteristics of the salt marsh wetland while the groundwater characteristics control the salt marsh macrophyte ecological zonation along the gradient of the salt marsh wetland from the sea to the land to the yellow river the groundwater is affected by the different intensities of the tides and the yellow river recharge the groundwater characteristics are different the depth of the groundwater determines the moisture content of the shallow soil and the vertical flow direction and rate of the groundwater determine the rate of accumulation of or decrease in salinity in the shallow soil therefore different groundwater characteristics can lead to differences in shallow soil moisture content and salinity in the bare flat zone the tidal influence is the strongest the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration and the downward drainage of groundwater alternates frequently the process of accumulation and reduction of shallow soil salinity alternates frequently and it is difficult for salt to accumulate continuously so the salinity of the area is lower the groundwater depth is shallower and the moisture content is higher in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the alternation frequency of the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration and the downward drainage of groundwater is significantly reduced and there are long periods of continuous upward or downward groundwater flow processes there are processes of continuous accumulation of or reduction in salinity in this area in the staggered growth zone there are also long periods of continuous groundwater upward or downward flow processes during the strong replenishment of the yellow river there is a similar groundwater vertical flow process as seen in the chinese tamarisk zone the salinity is recharged both by the tides and the yellow river in the chinese tamarisk zone the yellow river recharge is the main controlling factor of groundwater characterization the groundwater depth is deep the shallow soil moisture content is low the surface is exposed for a long time and the groundwater upward flow is the main groundwater characteristic salinity accumulation is the main process and the salinity is high in situ experiment results found that the soil salinity accumulation in the bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and part of the staggered growth zone in the intertidal area is mainly caused by the tide xin et al 2017 obtained the same results in the study of a coastal wetland in inland zone relatively far from the sea xin et al found that soil salinity was mainly affected by evaporative and rainfall vertical flow of groundwater has few effects however in the chinese tamarisk zone groundwater monitoring results show that the groundwater is affected by the lateral recharge of the yellow river and the frequency of vertical flow changes is low this result indicated that in the estuary wetlands salinity accumulation in inland zone far from the sea was not dominated by rainfall and evaporation but by the yellow river main driving force of soil salinity accumulation in inland areas far from the s main driving forceea are the main differences between coastal wetlands and estuary wetlands the groundwater characteristics affect the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes by changing the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil in the salt marshes the difference in the response of macrophyte physiological ecology to environmental factors is the key cause of the change in salt marsh macrophyte ecological zonation the monitoring results for the shallow soil moisture content and salinity in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone showed that the moisture content and salinity of shallow soils were significantly different in the macrophytes zones of different salt marsh macrophytes in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the moisture content is high but the salinity is very low and the ranges of moisture content and salinity are both very small the chinese tamarisk zone shows the opposite trends studies on salt marsh macrophytes have also shown that soil moisture content is a limiting condition for the growth of salt marsh macrophytes rodriguez iturbe 2000 ursino 2010 the soil moisture content has significant control over the composition and structure of wetland ecosystems xu et al 2006 soil salinity is another limiting factor limiting the growth of salt marsh macrophytes munns and tester 2008 environmental stress causes changes in physiological and ecological characteristics such as the growth and photosynthesis of salt marsh macrophytes the degree of environmental stress affects the growth of salt marsh macrophytes and the interactions among macrophytes the growth and distribution of chinese tamarisk and suaeda heteroptera kitag are affected by the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil chinese tamarisk is more tolerant of high salinity and low moisture than suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk is more suitable for growth in high salinity low moisture soil suaeda heteroptera kitag is more suitable for growing in areas with high moisture content and low salinity many physical conditions and biological interactions determine macrophyte ecological zonation in salt marshes in rapidly developing coastal wetlands succession controlled by environmental factors is the main process leading to macrophyte ecological zonation wang et al 2010 the effects of changes in environmental stresses on salt marsh macrophytes will result in changes in the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes slama et al 2015 the environmental gradient of coastal wetlands is more obvious and the tolerance of different macrophytes to environmental stresses is not the same therefore the ecological zonation of macrophyte communities in coastal wetlands is the result of the trade off between interspecific competition and individual or population tolerance to environmental stress bertness and pennings 2002 in estuary areas the groundwater level in the highland is low with the characteristics of high salinity and low moisture content in the shallow soils which provides a suitable habitat for the growth of chinese tamarisk the groundwater in the low beach is just under the surface and the surface is often submerged the salinity does not accumulate much and the shallow soil has the characteristics of low moisture content and high salinity which provides a suitable habitat for the growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag the chinese tamarisk zone is in the highland and the shallow soil is separated from the groundwater by hydraulic isolation the local changes in topography evapotranspiration and sediment permeability have a great impact on macrophyte ecological zonation this is consistent with the findings of the san francisco bay salt marsh ecology zoning concept model moffett et al 2012 the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions on salt marsh macrophytes are another part of the controlling effect of groundwater characteristics on the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes shallow soil water salt interactions may impose some additional restrictions on salt marsh macrophytes in salt marsh wetlands bennett et al 2009 in general the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions on seedling growth and survival are greater than the effects of any single factor salter et al 2007 at present there is relatively little understanding of the different responses of different salt marsh macrophytes in the salt marsh ecosystem to shallow soil water salt interactions janousek and mayo 2013 snedden et al 2015 the mechanism of groundwater characteristics controlling the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions on the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes is still unclear the monitoring results of this study showed that the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil in the bare flat zone and the suaeda heteroptera kitag area were low but the field observation showed that the bare flat zone also had a small amount of suaeda heteroptera kitag however there was a significant difference between that small amount and the dense growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone although the salinity and moisture content of shallow soil are generally low in both regions the stress on macrophyte growth is significantly different this phenomenon demonstrates the effect of shallow soil water salt interactions on the zonation of salt marsh macrophytes the reason for this phenomenon is that the difference in groundwater characteristics between the two regions leads to different effects of shallow soil water salt interactions in the two regions the groundwater vertical flow direction in the bare flat zone continues to change and the shallow soil cannot continue to provide a suitable habitat for the suaeda heteroptera kitag so it is difficult for suaeda heteroptera kitag to grow in this area however in the suaeda heteroptera kitag area there are persistent habitat conditions suitable for the growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag in general in the salt marsh wetland of the yellow river estuarine nature reserve the groundwater characteristics indirectly control the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes the tides and yellow river recharge affect the groundwater characteristics and the different groundwater characteristics leads to different moisture and salinity levels in the shallow soil different moisture and salinity levels in shallow soil provide different habitat conditions for salt marsh macrophytes under the effect of shallow soil water salt interactions different macrophytes zones of salt marsh macrophytes are formed 5 conclusion groundwater characteristics in different salt marsh macrophyte zones were explained by groundwater in situ experiments using groundwater monitoring wells with different screening depths in the estuarine salt marsh wetland the monitoring results show that the groundwater characteristics of the salt marsh in the estuary have an important control effect on the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes in the bare flat zone the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration and the downward drainage process of groundwater frequently alternate the process of accumulation of or reduction in shallow soil salinity frequently alternates and it is difficult for salt to accumulate continuously in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the groundwater characteristics are mainly affected by the tides there are long term continuous periods of the upward porewater process and the downward drainage process of groundwater and the salinity continues to accumulate or decrease in the chinese tamarisk zone the groundwater level is deep and the shallow soil moisture content is low the upward porewater process of groundwater caused by evapotranspiration is the main groundwater characteristic and the accumulation of shallow soil salinity is the main process the staggered growth zone has the groundwater characteristics of both the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone in general the different salt marsh macrophyte zones affect groundwater characteristics and the differences in groundwater characteristics support the different macrophytes zones in salt marshes the analysis of the synergistic relationship between groundwater and shallow soil shows that the shallow soil 0 40 cm moisture content is negatively correlated with the groundwater depth and conforms to the shallow soil unsaturated soil water retention curve the formula is θ r 1 0725 0 4 0 e x p 0 8 z h d z shallow soil salinity is positively correlated with groundwater vertical water level difference and the formula is s s ss 0 0 9152 δ h 10 6 tides and yellow river recharges affect the shallow soil moisture content by affecting the depth of groundwater the influence of tides on shallow soil moisture content is greater than that of the yellow river the relationship between groundwater salinity and shallow soil salinity is weak the change in soil salinity is a cumulative process the groundwater upward porewater process leads to the accumulation of surface soil salinity while the groundwater downward drainage process leads to the reduction in surface soil salinity this study found that the groundwater characteristics in the salt marsh in the yellow river estuary have a strong hydrological relationship with the tides and yellow river recharge the different groundwater characteristics in turn indirectly support the apparent salinity based macrophyte ecological zonation through soil in the salt marsh wetland the tides and yellow river recharges affect the characteristics of the salt marsh groundwater and moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil are different the salt marsh macrophytes are affected by the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions grow in their suitable habitats and form macrophytes zones credit authorship contribution statement hongyi xie conceptualization methodology data curation writing

5585,tides and river water affect the groundwater vertical flow in the shallow soil in estuary areas which in turn determines the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes the groundwater vertical flow under the influence of the interaction of saltwater and freshwater is very complicated and includes upward porewater flow driven by evapotranspiration and downward groundwater drainage in this study in situ experiments were conducted to investigate the groundwater vertical flow direction and rate in four macrophytes zones of salt marsh macrophytes in the yellow river estuarine nature reserve this study found that there are significant differences in groundwater vertical flow among these four macrophytes zones 1 in the bare flat zone the downward drainage of groundwater and the upward porewater movement process frequently alternate the processes of accumulation of and reduction in shallow soil salinity frequently alternate and it is difficult for salt to accumulate continuously 2 the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone is mainly affected by tides there are long periods of continuous porewater upward movement or groundwater downward drainage and salinity in the shallow soils continues to accumulate or decrease during these periods 3 in the chinese tamarisk zone the groundwater table is deep and the moisture content of the shallow soil is low the groundwater vertical flow is mainly an upward porewater process caused by evapotranspiration and the shallow soil salinity accumulates gradually 4 in the staggered growth zone the groundwater vertical flow characteristics of both the bare flat zone and the chinese tamarisk zone are evident in general in the salt marshes of the yellow river estuary the tides and the yellow river recharge affect the characteristics of the salt marsh groundwater the salt marsh macrophytes are affected by the interactions of water and salt in the shallow soil which form band shaped macrophytes zones keywords groundwater salt marsh macrophytes zonation estuarine 1 introduction salt marsh is a high productivity ecosystem with important ecological service functions and ecological values mostly distributed in coastal and estuary areas mitsch and gosselink 2000 boorman 2003 sun et al 2015 the estuary salt marsh plays a key role in water storage and flood control maintaining the regional water balance protecting biodiversity and maintaining the ecological integrity of the river ge et al 2015 2016 in a salt marsh ecosystem the environmental gradient is obvious and the species composition is relatively simple the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes living in the estuary often shows a characteristic band distribution emery et al 2001 zheng et al 2016 salt marsh macrophytes under natural conditions are generally divided into five macrophytes zones from low to high elevation 1 the pioneer macrophyte zone 2 the low tide beach zone 3 the middle tide beach zone 4 the high tide beach zone and 5 the transition zone the main features of macrophytes at the lower elevations are salt tolerance and flood resistance pioneer macrophytes gradually transition to higher elevations as mesophytes boorman 2003 the band distribution characteristics of salt marsh macrophytes have important reference value in the ecological restoration of salt marsh wetlands at present the ecological restoration of salt marsh wetlands in estuarine areas mainly occurs through water recharge and hydrological regulation fraaije et al 2015 therefore it is urgent to conduct research on the ecological and hydrological aspects of estuarine salt marsh wetlands and provide technical support for restoration the study of the factors affecting the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes and its mechanisms is of particular significance to ecological protection and restoration work in the estuary area nicholls 2004 the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes is controlled by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors huckle et al 2002 in the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors abiotic factors have a decisive role in the ecological division of salt marsh macrophytes while biotic factors mostly have local effects alicia et al 2015 macrophyte interspecific competition pennings and silliman 2005 transpiration effects on microclimate moffett et al 2012 enrichment of soil elements and nutrient uptake morris 1980 2006 marani et al 2013 affect the habitat of salt marsh macrophytes which in turn affects their ecological zonation in addition mammals furbish and albano 1994 birds zhao et al 2003 insects daehler and strong 1997 fish benthic animals silliman et al 2004 and microbial communities mchugh and dighton 2004 fisher et al 2005 also directly and indirectly affect the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes salt marshes are highly heterogeneous ecosystems they are influenced by tidal regularity and by abiotic factors closely related to tides such as salinity inundation time and frequency nutrient availability soil granularity and oxygen tolerance abiotic factors also exhibit changes along environmental gradients thus leading to changes in the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes along a gradient adam 1990 current research divides abiotic factors into resource factors and conditional factors begon et al 2006 the study of resource factors focuses on the nutrient availability of salt marsh soils which directly affects the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes emery et al 2001 ewanchuk and bertness 2004 brown et al 2006 the study of conditional factors focuses on two factors inundation and salinity noe and zedler 2000 noe 2002 for the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes frequent and prolonged inundation and high salinity are the two most important stress inducing and influential factors snow and vince 1984 long term high frequency inundation can reduce soil oxygen content and reduce soil nutrient availability thereby limiting macrophyte growth and affecting macrophyte zonation in salt marshes bertness et al 1992 crawford 1992 ewanchuk and bertness 2004 on the one hand soil salinity is affected by tidal waves climatic effects such as evapotranspiration and rainfall and rivers entering the estuary on the other hands the influence degree of these factors varies with the surface elevation changes in salinity with elevation are complicated mahal and park 1976 adam 1990 soil salinity can determine the osmotic pressure of the environment in which macrophytes are located and has significant effects on physiological processes such as the seed germination photosynthesis and growth of salt marsh macrophytes pearcy and ustin 1984 rozema and diggelen 1991 noe and zedler 2000 noe 2002 different salt marsh macrophytes have different tolerances to salinity so the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes is significantly affected by soil salinity julkowska and testerink 2015 xue et al 2018 many studies have shown that these abiotic factors are related to the elevation and hydrological processes of salt marshes silvestri et al 2005 especially in relation to groundwater processes in shallow soil gardner 1973 hemond and fifield 1982 harvey et al 1987 harvey and odum 1990 nuttle and harvey 1995 groundwater process is the main route of solute migration in soil guo et al 2008 2011 2013 2014 2016 2019 famiglietti 2014 groundwater characteristics and drainage rates are major factors affecting abiotic factors in salt marsh wetlands gardner 2005 2007 xin et al 2009 2010 2011 wilson and morris 2012 the gradient distribution of abiotic factors under different groundwater regimes controls the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes wilson et al 2011 moffett et al 2012 xin et al 2013 however most of the current research focuses on coastal salt marsh wetlands and their tidal driven groundwater characteristics which control the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes alicia et al 2015 there are significant differences between estuarine salt marsh wetlands and coastal salt marsh wetlands which are mainly reflected in the fact that the soil groundwater vertical flow characteristics of the estuary salt marsh are affected by the tide xie et al 2017 the river flowing into the sea also has a significant impact chen et al 2004 chen et al 2006 changes in runoff can affect river groundwater recharge relationships and recharge intensity thereby changing soil groundwater characteristics suzuki 1990 zheng et al 2004 the estuarine salt marsh also shows an obvious macrophyte band distribution along the sea land river gradient qi 2018 at present there are few reports on the ecological zonation and impact factors of estuarine salt marsh macrophytes under the influence of tides and rivers the control effect of estuarine salt marsh groundwater vertical flow characteristics on the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes needs to be studied in this study groundwater monitoring wells and water level recorders were used to continuously measure groundwater head data in situ thus providing an explanation based on soil groundwater processes rather than on statistical significance for the ecological zonation of estuarine salt marsh macrophytes combined with statistical analysis this method detects the hydrogeological characteristics of the root area of salt marsh macrophytes in estuarine areas and the differences in hydrogeological characteristics among different macrophyte zones the research area of this study is the yellow river estuarine nature reserve this study aims to answer three scientific questions 1 what are the differences in groundwater vertical flow characteristics between different salt marsh macrophyte zones in the estuary 2 what effect do the estuarine groundwater vertical flow characteristics have on the hydrogeological parameters in the root area of salt marsh macrophytes 3 what are the mechanisms by which the estuarine groundwater vertical flow characteristics control the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes 2 methods 2 1 study area the yellow river estuarine nature reserve fig 1 is located in the estuarine area of the yellow river in north eastern dongying city shandong province bordering the bohai sea in the north and laizhou bay in the east the geographical coordinates are 37 35 38 12 n 118 33 119 20 e and the total study area covered 15 3 104 hm2 2 2 field methods this study carried out field monitoring in the experimental area for 28 days july 2 to july 29 2019 in the salt marsh a transect a a with a length of approximately 4000 m was set along the sea land yellow river gradient fig 1 on this gradient there are band distribution characteristics of salt marsh plants the north side of the transect was the ocean which is affected by tides the south side of the transect was the yellow river channel in early july the yellow river was in a period of water and sediment regulation and the water level surged in this transect it is divided into five macrophytes zones according to the dominant plant species bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone staggered growth zone chinese tamarisk zone and reed zone and groundwater monitoring sites were set in each macrophyte zone in bare flat zone there is almost no plant growth and there is a small amount of suaeda heteroptera kitag scattered sporadically in suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the dominant species is suaeda heteroptera kitag which is mainly carpet like distribution in staggered growth zone suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk are staggered distribution in chinese tamarisk zone the dominant species is chinese tamarisk which is mainly patchy distribution in reed zone the dominant species is reed w1 was set in the bare flat zone w3 was set in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone w5 was set in the staggered growth zone and w10 was set in the chinese tamarisk zone each groundwater monitoring site was provided with two groundwater monitoring wells with screen depths of 0 5 1 m and 2 2 5 m fig 2 some pre investigations had been carried out on this transect during march to june 2019 the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil were monitored on the 25th of each month in these pre investigations the reed zone was small and the shallow soil salinity was extremely low and hardly changed therefore this study only considered the bare flat zone the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the staggered growth zone and the chinese tamarisk zone in this study the tidal level monitoring site and the yellow river water level monitoring site were set on the tidal creek a and the yellow river bank a respectively the tide levels and the yellow river water levels were recorded separately using capacitive tube type water level recorders dataflow odyssey capacitive water level water temperature recorders in this study in situ monitoring of shallow soil moisture content and salinity was carried out 10 times at every groundwater monitoring site the monitoring data were taken on july 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 and 29 2019 considering that the shallow soil moisture content and salinity of salt marshes have significant effects on the roots of salt marsh macrophytes and that the roots of salt marsh macrophytes are shallow xin et al 2013 this study collected soil samples from 0 to 40 cm deep during each sampling period 3 soil samples were collected from each zone for a total of 15 samples and measured moisture content and salinity in the laboratory after the experimental determination the mean value of 3 samples in each zone was taken as moisture content and salinity a total of 150 soil samples were collected in this study the method for determining the moisture content of the shallow soil was the drying weighing method and the method for determining the salinity was the leaching method one way analysis of variance anova was a statistical test which makes a single overall decision as to whether a significant difference is present among three or more sample means anova was used to analyze the difference in the salinity and moisture content across the different macrophytes zones 2 3 hydraulic analyses the hydraulic analysis in this study focused on the vertical flow characteristics of groundwater in shallow soils including the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow the water level recorders were placed in the groundwater monitoring wells with different screen depths at each groundwater monitoring site before july 2 9 during july 10 16 and after july 17 29 the yellow river water and sediment regulation period groundwater monitoring was carried out the groundwater level data were continuously recorded and the time step of each record was 1 h the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow were determined by analysing groundwater head data from two groundwater monitoring wells with different screen depths at different groundwater monitoring sites hemond and fifield 1982 the groundwater vertical water level difference dh was used as an analytical indicator to indicate the groundwater level difference between the two groundwater monitoring wells with different screen depths at each groundwater monitoring site the formula is 1 dh h d h s where dh is the groundwater vertical water head difference m hd is the groundwater head m measured by the groundwater monitoring well with the screen position of 2 2 5 m and hs is the groundwater head m measured by the groundwater monitoring well with the screen position of 0 5 1 m according to the darcy formula when dh is positive the vertical flow direction of groundwater is upward when dh is negative the vertical flow direction of groundwater is downward the magnitude of dh is proportional to the rate of vertical flow of the groundwater fetter 2001 2 4 synergistic relationship analyses using the data from in situ monitoring in july 2019 redundancy analysis rda was used to study the relationship between the explanatory variables the shallow soil moisture content and salinity and the environmental variables the groundwater salinity the groundwater depth the surface elevation the distance from the yellow river the yellow river water level the tide level and the tidal range and to understand the water salt synergistic relationship between the groundwater and the shallow soil considering that soil salinity is a process of accumulation he et al 2009 the rda analysis of the synergistic relationship between groundwater and shallow soil in this study was performed from two perspectives 1 the existing state es and 2 the change between continuous monitoring points ccm the instantaneous values of both explanatory and environmental variables are used in the analysis of es the analysis of ccm uses the change in the instantaneous value between two consecutives in situ monitoring points time interval is 72 h and δ h the cumulative value of dh over 72 h represents the change in dh during the monitoring period since the units of the explanatory variables and the environmental variables are different all variables needed to be normalized before rda analysis this study used a z score standardization method with the following formula 2 z x μ σ where is the case value z is the normalized result of the case μ is the population mean and σ is the standard deviation of the population 3 result 3 1 groundwater characteristics in different macrophytes zone groundwater and soil properties monitored by groundwater monitoring wells represent groundwater and soil properties in macrophytes zones the monitoring results fig 3 a showed that there are differences in the salinity and moisture content of the shallow soil among the bare flat zone w1 suaeda heteroptera kitag zone w3 staggered growth zone w5 chinese tamarisk zone w7 and reed zone w10 from the sea to the land the shallow soil salinity first increases and then decreases reaching a maximum in the chinese tamarisk zone moisture content shows the opposite pattern the salinity and moisture content of the shallow soil in the bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and staggered growth zone were similar and the shallow soil salinity in these zones was significantly lower than that in the chinese tamarisk zone the shallow soil moisture content in these zones was significantly higher than that in the chinese tamarisk zone the soil salinity of the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone near the ocean is lower the moisture content is higher and the range of variation is smaller than those of the other zones in contrast the salinity of the chinese tamarisk zone near the yellow river is higher the moisture content is lower and the range of variation is larger than those of the other zones the salinity and moisture content of the staggered growth zone located between the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and chinese tamarisk zone are more consistent with those of the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone as a transitional zone the salinity and moisture content of the staggered growth zone is in a suitable range for suaeda heteroptera kitag and the staggered growth zone has a wide range of moisture content and salinity variation which provides an ecological niche for chinese tamarisk the chinese tamarisk zone has the highest salinity and it is near the high tide beaches salt marsh research on the southern atlantic coast of the united states also found that the salinity of salt marshes on the middle and high tide beaches is often much higher than that of the nearby low lying beach salt marshes creating a peak of salinity in the middle and high tide beaches wang et al 2010 pennings and silliman 2005 the phenomenon of salinity reaching its peak on middle and high tide beach salt marshes is found globally he et al 2009 time series plot of shallow soil salinity monitoring results are shown in fig 3 b during the yellow river water and sediment regulation period july 10 16 shallow soil salinity appeared minimum value at groundwater monitoring sites w5 and w7 compared with the period before and after the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the decrease of shallow soil salinity at w7 is very obvious the yellow river water and sediment has an impact on salinity decline in chinese tamarisk zone however the effect on salinity in other zones is not obvious time series plot of shallow soil salinity monitoring results are shown in fig 3 c there is no obvious relationship between the yellow river water and sediment and moisture content the anova analysis results of shallow soil salinity and moisture content are provided in table 1 at 95 confidence level p value of shallow soil salinity is 0 000 0 05 p value of shallow soil moisture content is 0 001 0 05 at 95 confidence level there is a significant difference in the salinity and moisture content across the different zones the monitoring results of the tide and the yellow river water levels fig 4 indicate that there is a continuous influence of the spring neap tide at site a on the transect the tidal cycle is approximately 14 days the spring tide appears around july 6 and 18 and the neap tide appears around july 12 and 26 the water level of the yellow river at site a of the transect was greatly disturbed by humans and the water level fluctuated sharply before july 2 9 during july 10 16 and after july 17 29 the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the water level change was significant during the regulation period the water level of the yellow river surged and the water level fluctuated greatly before and after the period the water level was lower on the a a transect the anova analysis results of dh are provided in table 2 at 95 confidence level p value of dh is 0 000 0 05 at 95 confidence level the groundwater characteristics of the bare flat zone w1 suaeda heteroptera kitag zone w3 staggered growth zone w5 and chinese tamarisk zone w7 are significantly different in the bare flat zone fig 5 a the vertical flow direction of the groundwater alternates frequently during the 14 day tidal cycle and the vertical flow rate changes periodically the vertical flow direction of groundwater is significantly affected by the tides the frequent alternation of the groundwater flow direction occurs mostly around the neap tide day and the process dominated by the downward flow frequently occurs around the spring tide day the 24 h moving average of dh before and after the first neap tide day is positive but the 24 h moving average of dh before and after the second neap tide day is negative and the general direction of groundwater vertical flow is opposite on the two neap tide days the rate of vertical groundwater vertical flow is also significantly affected by the tides the rate of vertical groundwater vertical flow shows a continuous trend from the neap tide days to the spring tide days and from the spring tide days to the neap tide days the rate of vertical groundwater vertical flow decreases first and then increases the variation process is characterized by fluctuations the rate of groundwater vertical flow before and after the spring and neap tide days appears to be extremely high in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone fig 5 b the groundwater characteristics are also affected by tides and are significantly different from the groundwater characteristics in the bare flat zone the groundwater characteristics in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone were similar to those in the bare flat zone in the 14 day period of the tide but the alternation frequency of the vertical flow direction of the groundwater was significantly reduced the rate of vertical flow changes periodically and the change range increases around the neap tide day and the second spring tide day the upward porewater process and the downward groundwater process both continue for a period of time which is the biggest difference from the pattern in the bare flat zone this difference was also observed in the staggered growth zone and the chinese tamarisk zone in the chinese tamarisk zone fig 5 d the groundwater characteristics are significantly different from those of both the bare flat zone and the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone which are controlled by tides the yellow river recharge in the chinese tamarisk zone is the main controlling factor of groundwater during the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the yellow river water level suddenly increases the direction of groundwater vertical flow is upward and the rate of groundwater vertical flow increases with the rise of the water level the staggered growth zone fig 5 c is an area dominated by two salt marsh macrophytes the groundwater characteristics are the same as those in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone when the water level of the yellow river is high during the yellow river water and sediment regulation period the groundwater characteristics in the staggered zone and the chinese tamarisk zone are the same the water level of the yellow river is lower before and after yellow river water and sediment regulation and the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone and the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone are similar 3 2 synergistic relationship between groundwater and shallow soil the rda results for shallow soil moisture content and salinity with the existing state environmental factors fig 6 a show that the eigenvalues of the first two sorting axes are 0 7539 and 0 2275 respectively and the total eigenvalue is 98 14 there is a good explanation for the shallow soil moisture content and salinity in the existing state the distance from the yellow river and the depth of groundwater are the main factors influencing the moisture content of the shallow soil the groundwater depth is negatively correlated with the moisture content of the shallow soil and the distance from the yellow river is positively correlated with the moisture content of the shallow soil the contributions of other environmental factors are small this result indicates that the tides and yellow river recharges affect the shallow soil moisture content by affecting the depth of groundwater and the influence of tides on the shallow soil moisture content is greater than that of the yellow river considering that the depth of the collected shallow soil samples is above the groundwater level the soil samples monitored in this study are all unsaturated soils and the relationship between shallow soil moisture content and groundwater depth should be consistent with the shallow soil unsaturated soil water retention curve the formula is 3 θ exp α φ where θ is the soil moisture content φ is the pressure head m where φ z h h is the groundwater depth m z is the buried depth of the measuring point and both and α are parameters in this study the moisture content of the 0 40 cm shallow soil was monitored after integrating eq 3 the formula for the average moisture content θr of the 0 40 cm soil on the sample strip is 4 θ r 0 4 0 4 0 e x p α z h d z based on the results of the field monitoring of the shallow soil moisture content and the groundwater depth at the four sites the value of is 0 429 and the value of α is 0 8 the regression coefficient obtained by the regression test is r2 0 763 and the fitting degree to the monitoring data is high therefore the relationship between the moisture content of the shallow soil in the yellow river delta and the groundwater depth is 5 θ r 1 0725 0 4 0 e x p 0 8 z h d z there is a clear correlation between surface elevation tide level and shallow soil salinity however other environmental factors have less impact on shallow soil salinity however although the tide level has a significant negative correlation with shallow soil salinity the degree of interpretation is extremely low there is a positive correlation between surface elevation and shallow soil salinity this may be because the higher the elevation is the longer the surface exposure time therefore evapotranspiration causes the saltwater in the soil to evaporate and more salt is left in the soil it is worth noting that the correlation between groundwater salinity and shallow soil salinity is very weak surface evapotranspiration removes water from the shallow soil and leaves the salt within the soil this result proves that soil salinity changes are less affected by changes in groundwater salinity the change in salt is gradually accumulated or reduced considering the relationship between soil salinity and environmental factors in the existing state the salinity of shallow soil cannot be accurately quantified by environmental factors therefore the study also examined the changes during continuous monitoring fig 6 b the results show that the feature values of the first two sorting axes are 0 7531 and 0 1244 respectively and the total eigenvalue is 87 75 the changes in environmental factors during continuous monitoring can explain the changes in shallow soil moisture during continuous monitoring well it is worth noting that the change in the shallow soil salinity during continuous monitoring was significantly positively correlated with the cumulative value of the change in dh during continuous monitoring according to the results of the linear regression analysis fig 7 the change in the shallow soil salinity during continuous monitoring has a significant linear relationship with the cumulative value of the change in dh during continuous monitoring the regression coefficient is 0 838 the formula can be expressed as 6 dss 0 9152 δ h 10 6 where dss is the change in the shallow soil salinity during continuous monitoring ppt and δ h d h represents the cumulative value of the change in dh during continuous monitoring m shallow soil salinity ss can be expressed as 7 ss s s 0 d s s ss 0 0 9152 δ h 10 6 where ss0 is the shallow soil salinity ppt at first monitoring this indicates that dh can characterize the accumulation of or the reduction in soil salinity to some extent this indicates that the salt accumulation and reduction process in the shallow soil is closely related to the groundwater characteristics according to darcy s law the positive and negative state of dh can characterize the vertical flow direction of groundwater and the magnitude of dh is proportional to the rate of vertical flow of groundwater fetter 2001 when δ h is greater than 0 the groundwater vertical flow net direction is upward under these conditions net salinity increase is greater than zero and the salinity accumulates in the shallow soil the larger the δ h the higher the salinity accumulation in the shallow soil when δ h is 0 the groundwater vertical flow direction is downward net salinity increase is greater less than zero and the salinity of the shallow soil is reduced the greater the δ h the more the salinity of the shallow soil decreases δ h represents the net direction of groundwater flow over time the upward porewater flow causes the accumulation of salt in the shallow soil while the downward drainage of the groundwater leads to a decrease in the salt in the shallow soil 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the tides and river recharge on groundwater characteristics the groundwater characteristics of the salt marsh in the estuary area are affected by tides and rivers tidal inundation and rainfall recharge are the main reasons for groundwater vertical flow from top to bottom this downward flow of groundwater is a drainage process the upward movement of soil water caused by high water level replenishment in the yellow river and evapotranspiration is the main reason for the upward flow of groundwater the upward flow of groundwater is a porewater process under the influence of tides and yellow river recharge the relative intensity of the groundwater porewater and drainage processes determines the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow in the bare flat zone the vertical flow direction of the groundwater around the spring tide day is mainly downward and the alternation frequency is very low this is because the range of the tides is large and the frequency of fluctuations is low which causes the surface to be inundated for a long time around the spring tide and the groundwater to drain around the neap tide the vertical flow direction of the groundwater alternates often this is because the range of the tides is small and the frequency of fluctuation is high which causes surface inundation and exposure to alternate frequently around the neap tide day the direct recharge of seawater from the surface to the groundwater causes the groundwater to drain downward the upward flow of the porewater in the soil driven by evapotranspiration when the surface is exposed makes the groundwater move upward alicia et al 2015 therefore around the neap tide day the groundwater frequently alternates between the porewater and drainage processes around the two neap tide days the vertical flow directions of groundwater are reversed because the ratio of surface inundation and exposure time around the two neap tide days is different thus the proportion of downward and upward groundwater flow is different when the groundwater drainage process is dominant the general direction of groundwater vertical flow is downward when the groundwater experiences the porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration the general direction of groundwater vertical flow is from upward when the surface is inundated for a long time the downward drainage of groundwater accelerates the downward vertical flow of groundwater when the surface is not inundated the porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration will accelerate the upward vertical flow of groundwater in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the surface elevation is higher than that of the bare flat zone the frequency of seawater inundation is significantly reduced and the surface exposure lasts longer resulting in a lower alternation frequency of the groundwater flow direction the groundwater characteristics around the first spring tide day are different from the groundwater characteristics around the second spring tide day groundwater continued to drain downwards around the second spring tide day the groundwater vertical flow direction similar to that in the bare flat zone still alternates frequently in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone this may be because the tidal range around the first spring tide day is significantly larger than the tidal range around the second spring tide day the tide level range fluctuates greatly the frequency of inundation around the first spring tide day is higher than that around the second spring tide day and the groundwater is drained the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration therefore frequently alternates with the groundwater drainage process in the chinese tamarisk zone the altitude is the highest in the study area the surface is exposed almost year round and the groundwater level is deep when the yellow river water level increases the yellow river water continuously recharges the groundwater surface evapotranspiration also causes the soil porewater to flow upwards and in the end the groundwater level is continuously raised before and after the yellow river water and sediment regulation period surface evapotranspiration rainfall recharge and small fluctuations in the yellow river water level control the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone the groundwater characteristics are affected by the yellow river recharge and tides the intensity of the influences of these two factors is determined by the elevation of the yellow river water level when the yellow river water level is low the tide is the main factor affecting the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone are similar to those in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone which is only affected by the tide when the yellow river water level is high the yellow river recharge affects the staggered growth zone the groundwater characteristics in the staggered growth zone are similar to those in the chinese tamarisk zone which is only affected by the yellow river recharge the groundwater characteristics of the 4 zones of the salt marsh macrophytes are affected by the tides and yellow river recharge and the surface elevation also has a significant impact on the ecological zonation of the macrophytes fig 8 the bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone staggered growth zone and chinese tamarisk zone are distributed from the sea to the land and the surface elevation increases in turn the direction and rate of groundwater vertical flow are obviously related to the elevation this result is consistent with the basic hydrogeological theory of homogeneous confined aquifers freeze and cherry 1979 the bare flat zone has the lowest elevation in the study area the overall groundwater vertical flow direction drains downward and the rate varies the least the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone is also discharged from the top to the bottom in the direction of the overall groundwater vertical flow the total drainage of groundwater downward is greater than that of the bare flat zone and the drainage rate changes significantly this may be because the growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag improves the soil permeability in the area in the chinese tamarisk zone the groundwater vertical flow direction of the groundwater is the same as that in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone this shows that the influence of tides and yellow river recharge on the groundwater vertical flow rate is approximately the same but the overall direction of the groundwater vertical flow is opposite the direction of the groundwater vertical flow in the staggered growth zone is both upwards and downwards the variation in the groundwater vertical flow rate is smaller than those in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone this phenomenon indicates that in this area where the tides and the yellow river recharge are significant the overall direction of groundwater vertical flow is determined by the relative strength of the influence of the two factors when the tide is the main influencing factor the overall direction of groundwater vertical flow drains downward when the yellow river recharge is the main influencing factor the overall direction of groundwater vertical flow is upward the rate of groundwater vertical flow is weakened by the mutual offsetting of the effects of the two factors biotic factors also have local effect to the ecological zonation these local effects are most pronounced in the chinese tamarisk zone in this zone there are more top down movements of porewater than in other zones this zone also has the highest salinity some studies have found that salt secretion from chinese tamarisk can change local soil salinity yin et al 2007 cui et al 2010 salt secretion from chinese tamarisk may be another reason for the accumulation of salinity 4 2 controlling effect of groundwater characteristics on salt marsh macrophyte ecological zonation there are fewer human disturbances in the study area and the distribution of salt marsh plants is mainly affected by habitat suitability after long term growth competition and reproduction shallow soil salinity in this area where the salt marsh plants are stably distributed can reflect the range of the macrophytes suitable salinity range to a certain extent yi et al 2013 based on the results of in situ monitoring we find that the suitable salinity ranges of suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk are different the suitable salinity ranges of suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk are 6 33 8 33 ppt and 12 83 18 18 ppt respectively cui et al 2008 monitored the salinity range of suaeda heteroptera kitag in the yellow river estuarine and used gaussian statistical model the appropriate salinity range of suaeda heteroptera kitag was 5 17 20 25 ppt cui et al detected suaeda heteroptera kitag growing at higher salinity in non tidal regions however the location of w3 was in the intertidal area frequent changes in the vertical direction of groundwater flow caused by the tide made it difficult for the soil to accumulate salt based on on site monitoring data and one way anova analysis yang 2009 determined the salinity range of chinese tamarisk in the yellow river estuarine is 10 20 ppt this result is close to the results monitored in this study the tides and the yellow river recharge affect the groundwater characteristics of the salt marsh wetland while the groundwater characteristics control the salt marsh macrophyte ecological zonation along the gradient of the salt marsh wetland from the sea to the land to the yellow river the groundwater is affected by the different intensities of the tides and the yellow river recharge the groundwater characteristics are different the depth of the groundwater determines the moisture content of the shallow soil and the vertical flow direction and rate of the groundwater determine the rate of accumulation of or decrease in salinity in the shallow soil therefore different groundwater characteristics can lead to differences in shallow soil moisture content and salinity in the bare flat zone the tidal influence is the strongest the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration and the downward drainage of groundwater alternates frequently the process of accumulation and reduction of shallow soil salinity alternates frequently and it is difficult for salt to accumulate continuously so the salinity of the area is lower the groundwater depth is shallower and the moisture content is higher in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the alternation frequency of the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration and the downward drainage of groundwater is significantly reduced and there are long periods of continuous upward or downward groundwater flow processes there are processes of continuous accumulation of or reduction in salinity in this area in the staggered growth zone there are also long periods of continuous groundwater upward or downward flow processes during the strong replenishment of the yellow river there is a similar groundwater vertical flow process as seen in the chinese tamarisk zone the salinity is recharged both by the tides and the yellow river in the chinese tamarisk zone the yellow river recharge is the main controlling factor of groundwater characterization the groundwater depth is deep the shallow soil moisture content is low the surface is exposed for a long time and the groundwater upward flow is the main groundwater characteristic salinity accumulation is the main process and the salinity is high in situ experiment results found that the soil salinity accumulation in the bare flat zone suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and part of the staggered growth zone in the intertidal area is mainly caused by the tide xin et al 2017 obtained the same results in the study of a coastal wetland in inland zone relatively far from the sea xin et al found that soil salinity was mainly affected by evaporative and rainfall vertical flow of groundwater has few effects however in the chinese tamarisk zone groundwater monitoring results show that the groundwater is affected by the lateral recharge of the yellow river and the frequency of vertical flow changes is low this result indicated that in the estuary wetlands salinity accumulation in inland zone far from the sea was not dominated by rainfall and evaporation but by the yellow river main driving force of soil salinity accumulation in inland areas far from the s main driving forceea are the main differences between coastal wetlands and estuary wetlands the groundwater characteristics affect the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes by changing the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil in the salt marshes the difference in the response of macrophyte physiological ecology to environmental factors is the key cause of the change in salt marsh macrophyte ecological zonation the monitoring results for the shallow soil moisture content and salinity in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone showed that the moisture content and salinity of shallow soils were significantly different in the macrophytes zones of different salt marsh macrophytes in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the moisture content is high but the salinity is very low and the ranges of moisture content and salinity are both very small the chinese tamarisk zone shows the opposite trends studies on salt marsh macrophytes have also shown that soil moisture content is a limiting condition for the growth of salt marsh macrophytes rodriguez iturbe 2000 ursino 2010 the soil moisture content has significant control over the composition and structure of wetland ecosystems xu et al 2006 soil salinity is another limiting factor limiting the growth of salt marsh macrophytes munns and tester 2008 environmental stress causes changes in physiological and ecological characteristics such as the growth and photosynthesis of salt marsh macrophytes the degree of environmental stress affects the growth of salt marsh macrophytes and the interactions among macrophytes the growth and distribution of chinese tamarisk and suaeda heteroptera kitag are affected by the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil chinese tamarisk is more tolerant of high salinity and low moisture than suaeda heteroptera kitag and chinese tamarisk is more suitable for growth in high salinity low moisture soil suaeda heteroptera kitag is more suitable for growing in areas with high moisture content and low salinity many physical conditions and biological interactions determine macrophyte ecological zonation in salt marshes in rapidly developing coastal wetlands succession controlled by environmental factors is the main process leading to macrophyte ecological zonation wang et al 2010 the effects of changes in environmental stresses on salt marsh macrophytes will result in changes in the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes slama et al 2015 the environmental gradient of coastal wetlands is more obvious and the tolerance of different macrophytes to environmental stresses is not the same therefore the ecological zonation of macrophyte communities in coastal wetlands is the result of the trade off between interspecific competition and individual or population tolerance to environmental stress bertness and pennings 2002 in estuary areas the groundwater level in the highland is low with the characteristics of high salinity and low moisture content in the shallow soils which provides a suitable habitat for the growth of chinese tamarisk the groundwater in the low beach is just under the surface and the surface is often submerged the salinity does not accumulate much and the shallow soil has the characteristics of low moisture content and high salinity which provides a suitable habitat for the growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag the chinese tamarisk zone is in the highland and the shallow soil is separated from the groundwater by hydraulic isolation the local changes in topography evapotranspiration and sediment permeability have a great impact on macrophyte ecological zonation this is consistent with the findings of the san francisco bay salt marsh ecology zoning concept model moffett et al 2012 the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions on salt marsh macrophytes are another part of the controlling effect of groundwater characteristics on the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes shallow soil water salt interactions may impose some additional restrictions on salt marsh macrophytes in salt marsh wetlands bennett et al 2009 in general the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions on seedling growth and survival are greater than the effects of any single factor salter et al 2007 at present there is relatively little understanding of the different responses of different salt marsh macrophytes in the salt marsh ecosystem to shallow soil water salt interactions janousek and mayo 2013 snedden et al 2015 the mechanism of groundwater characteristics controlling the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions on the ecological zonation of salt marsh macrophytes is still unclear the monitoring results of this study showed that the moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil in the bare flat zone and the suaeda heteroptera kitag area were low but the field observation showed that the bare flat zone also had a small amount of suaeda heteroptera kitag however there was a significant difference between that small amount and the dense growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone although the salinity and moisture content of shallow soil are generally low in both regions the stress on macrophyte growth is significantly different this phenomenon demonstrates the effect of shallow soil water salt interactions on the zonation of salt marsh macrophytes the reason for this phenomenon is that the difference in groundwater characteristics between the two regions leads to different effects of shallow soil water salt interactions in the two regions the groundwater vertical flow direction in the bare flat zone continues to change and the shallow soil cannot continue to provide a suitable habitat for the suaeda heteroptera kitag so it is difficult for suaeda heteroptera kitag to grow in this area however in the suaeda heteroptera kitag area there are persistent habitat conditions suitable for the growth of suaeda heteroptera kitag in general in the salt marsh wetland of the yellow river estuarine nature reserve the groundwater characteristics indirectly control the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes the tides and yellow river recharge affect the groundwater characteristics and the different groundwater characteristics leads to different moisture and salinity levels in the shallow soil different moisture and salinity levels in shallow soil provide different habitat conditions for salt marsh macrophytes under the effect of shallow soil water salt interactions different macrophytes zones of salt marsh macrophytes are formed 5 conclusion groundwater characteristics in different salt marsh macrophyte zones were explained by groundwater in situ experiments using groundwater monitoring wells with different screening depths in the estuarine salt marsh wetland the monitoring results show that the groundwater characteristics of the salt marsh in the estuary have an important control effect on the ecological zonation of the salt marsh macrophytes in the bare flat zone the upward porewater process driven by surface evapotranspiration and the downward drainage process of groundwater frequently alternate the process of accumulation of or reduction in shallow soil salinity frequently alternates and it is difficult for salt to accumulate continuously in the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone the groundwater characteristics are mainly affected by the tides there are long term continuous periods of the upward porewater process and the downward drainage process of groundwater and the salinity continues to accumulate or decrease in the chinese tamarisk zone the groundwater level is deep and the shallow soil moisture content is low the upward porewater process of groundwater caused by evapotranspiration is the main groundwater characteristic and the accumulation of shallow soil salinity is the main process the staggered growth zone has the groundwater characteristics of both the suaeda heteroptera kitag zone and the chinese tamarisk zone in general the different salt marsh macrophyte zones affect groundwater characteristics and the differences in groundwater characteristics support the different macrophytes zones in salt marshes the analysis of the synergistic relationship between groundwater and shallow soil shows that the shallow soil 0 40 cm moisture content is negatively correlated with the groundwater depth and conforms to the shallow soil unsaturated soil water retention curve the formula is θ r 1 0725 0 4 0 e x p 0 8 z h d z shallow soil salinity is positively correlated with groundwater vertical water level difference and the formula is s s ss 0 0 9152 δ h 10 6 tides and yellow river recharges affect the shallow soil moisture content by affecting the depth of groundwater the influence of tides on shallow soil moisture content is greater than that of the yellow river the relationship between groundwater salinity and shallow soil salinity is weak the change in soil salinity is a cumulative process the groundwater upward porewater process leads to the accumulation of surface soil salinity while the groundwater downward drainage process leads to the reduction in surface soil salinity this study found that the groundwater characteristics in the salt marsh in the yellow river estuary have a strong hydrological relationship with the tides and yellow river recharge the different groundwater characteristics in turn indirectly support the apparent salinity based macrophyte ecological zonation through soil in the salt marsh wetland the tides and yellow river recharges affect the characteristics of the salt marsh groundwater and moisture content and salinity of the shallow soil are different the salt marsh macrophytes are affected by the effects of shallow soil water salt interactions grow in their suitable habitats and form macrophytes zones credit authorship contribution statement hongyi xie conceptualization methodology data curation writing

chief with the assistance of dongmei han associate editor three dimensional response to well pumping in a multilayer aquifer system with rigorous treatment of interfacial flow attracts great attention among the subsurface hydrologists because of its theoretical importance and practical merits in this study a general theory of three dimensional groundwater flow to a well of infinitesimal radius in an anisotropic three layer aquifer system is developed with a constant rate pumping in the lower layer and associated semi analytical solutions of drawdowns in individual layers are obtained this theory discards many previous assumptions for studying a multilayer aquifer system such as simplified flow configuration in the aquitard treatment of cross formation flow as a volumetric averaged term adding to the governing equations of aquifer flows and sometimes negligence of vertical flow components in the aquifers additionally this theory considers three types of commonly used top boundary conditions a water table with delayed gravity drainage boundary condition case 1 a constant head top boundary condition case 2 and a no flow top boundary condition case 3 the dimensionless drawdown solutions in laplace domain are obtained and inverted numerically to calculate the time domain solutions the solution encompasses existing solutions for a two layer or a single layer e g unconfined or confined aquifer system as subsets the developed solutions are tested extensively with a finite element numerical solution using comsol and other existing solutions and a sensitivity analysis is performed to prioritize the influences of different parameter groups the results of this study can be used to predict the pumping induced drawdown at any position with an observation well and to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the lower pumped layer and upper layer as well as the middle layer the developed theory provides a basis for other potential applications such as geotechnical

subscripts 1 2 3 the lower pumped layer middle layer upper layer 1 introduction a large number of multilayer aquifer systems commonly exists in nature and the hydraulic response induced by well pumping in such systems has caught much attention in the fields of hydrogeology geological engineering geothermal engineering and petroleum engineering hantush 1964 javandel and witherspoon 1983 hemker and maas 1987 yeh and chang 2013 to simplify the problem a number of assumptions are usually adopted first flow in the aquitard is usually limited to vertical flow only while the horizontal flow component is regarded as too small to be considered this simplification however is only close to reality when the permeability of the aquitard is much smaller at least two or three orders of magnitude smaller than those of the adjacent aquifers a condition that may not be satisfied in an actual field setting malama et al 2007 2008 feng et al 2019 second the cross formation flow or leakage across the aquitard is treated as vertically averaged term imposed uniformly over the entire thickness of the adjacent aquifers a so called hantush assumption that is against the truth that the cross formation flow occurs only at the aquitard aquifer interface rather as a volumetric sink source term in the governing equations of flow in the aquifer hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1959 1964 moench 1985 zhan and bian 2006 hunt and scott 2007 this assumption is particularly troublesome when the thickness of the aquifer of concern is somewhat the same or greater than the scale of interest such as the distance between the pumping well and the point of observation and or the pumping well is partially penetrating halepaska 1972 bakker 2006 perina and lee 2006 malama et al 2007 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 2019 sedghi et al 2018 feng et al 2019 third vertical flows in the aquifers are also sometimes omitted to simplify the flow to horizontal only in the aquifers hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 hunt and scott 2007 fourth although the storage effect is always considered for transient flow in the aquifer the storage effect of the aquitard is sometime ignored for the simplification purpose hantush 1967 hunt 2005 this simplification is only applicable when the aquitard thickness is much smaller than the scale of interest but is generally not valid otherwise neuman and witherspoon 1969 the use of above assumptions has the benefit of simplifying the mathematical model of flow in a multilayer aquifer system but at the same time substantially limits their applications to a broad spectrum of possible field conditions additionally although the lower boundary of a multilayer aquifer system is usually set as no flow the upper boundary of such a multilayer aquifer system can be subject to different hydrological constrains such as water table condition or no flow or even constant head to name a few for instance motz 1996 and denis and motz 1998 considered the effect of evapotranspiration reduction at top aquifer and proposed a laplace domain solution due to a fully penetrating well pumping from one or two aquifers in a three layer aquifer system on the base of the mathematical model developed by hantush 1967 and neuman and witherspoon 1969 respectively hunt and scott 2007 provided an approximate solution for flow to a fully penetrating well in a lower aquifer overlain by a middle aquitard and an upper unpumped aquifer with a free surface at the top after a careful review of existing literatures on the subject of flow in a multilayer aquifer system we notice that there is not a general theory that is free from many above mentioned assumptions except for a handful of investigations that will be briefly reviewed as follows malama et al 2008 obtained a semi analytical solution to investigate the response of an unconfined aquifer aquitard aquifer system due to a partially penetrating pumping well in this study both horizontal and vertical flows are considered in aquifers and aquitard the well is however pumped at a constant rate in the upper unconfined aquifer for a water table boundary condition described in the manner of neuman 1974 with the effect of instantaneous gravity drainage veling and maas 2009 gave a semi analytical strategy for solving transient flow in a multilayered aquifer system and the effect of delayed gravity drainage at the top boundary condition was not considered thus the purpose of this study is to develop a general theory for flow to a partially penetrating well in an anisotropic three layer aquifer system due to a constant discharge pumping in the lower layer without using above mentioned four assumptions a striking new feature of this new theory is that it does not impose the commonly used restriction on the permeability contrast between two adjacent layers in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system where the permeability of the middle aquitard has to be at least two or three orders of magnitude smaller than those of the aquifers e g hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 another important feature is that the cross formation flow or effect of leakage is considered as an interfacial phenomenon more importantly three commonly used top boundaries are considered including a water table boundary with the effect of delayed gravity drainage case 1 a constant head boundary case 2 and a no flux boundary case 3 2 method 2 1 mathematical models fig 1 shows an infinitesimal radius well pumped at a constant rate q in an anisotropic three layer aquifer system of infinite lateral extent the well partially penetrates the lower layer of the system with a screen fixed from l to d in which l and d are respectively the upper and lower elevations of the well screen from the impermeable bottom of the pumped aquifer each layer with finite thickness is homogeneous but anisotropic and flow is radially symmetric the hydraulic connection between two adjacent layers is accomplished with continuity of drawdown and flux at their interface notably the type of the top boundary of the system can be specified as a water table boundary with the effect of delayed gravity drainage case 1 a constant head boundary case 2 and a no flux boundary case 3 the origin of the coordinate system is located on the well center and the base of the pumped aquifer on the basis of the above conceptual model firstly the governing equation of flow in the layer of concern can be expressed as 1 k ri 1 r s i r z t r k zi 2 s i r z t z 2 s si s i r z t t in which s is drawdown l kr and kz refer to the horizontally radial and vertical hydraulic conductivities respectively l t which are assumed to be constant ss denotes specific storage 1 l and t represents the time of pumping t subscript i 1 2 3 designates lower pumped middle and the upper layers respectively as one can see from eq 1 three dimensional flow is not only considered for the lower pumped layer it is also taken into consideration for the upper layer and the middle layer a point worth noting is that many previous studies only considered vertical flow in the middle layer of aquitard e g neuman and witherspoon 1969 moench 1985 perina and lee 2006 hunt and scott 2007 feng and zhan 2015 because of the generality of the governing equations used here the permeabilities of all three layers here can be arbitrary free from any constrains such a relaxation on the permeability contrasts among different layers will make this work much more general and versatile than previous studies on similar matters the initial conditions of drawdown in the three layers are 2 s i r z 0 0 the infinite lateral boundary for each layer can be expressed as 3 s i z t 0 for a partially penetrating well with a constant discharge in the lower pumped layer the inner boundary condition at the wellbore can be expressed as hantush 1964 malama et al 2008 liang et al 2018 sedghi et al 2018 feng et al 2019 4 lim r 0 r s 1 r 0 l z b 1 q 2 π k r 1 l d d z l 0 0 z d where q is the constant pumping rate and is positive l3 t for flow in the middle layer the well face boundary condition can be written as 5 lim r 0 r s 2 r 0 for the upper layer flow the inner boundary at the wellbore is 6 lim r 0 r s 3 r 0 the impermeable bottom of the lower pumped layer requires 7 s 1 z z 0 0 and the continuity requirements of drawdown and flux at the lower pumped layer middle layer interface are 8 s 1 r z t s 2 r z t z b 1 and 9 k z 1 s 1 r z t z k z 2 s 2 r z t z z b 1 in addition the continuity requirements of drawdown and flux at the upper layer middle layer interface z b 2 are 10 s 2 r z t s 3 r z t z b 2 and 11 k z 2 s 2 r z t z k z 3 s 3 r z t z z b 2 in this study the top boundary condition at the upper layer can be written in three different ways as case 1 a water table boundary condition with the effect of delayed gravity drainage dgd the water table motion of the upper layer considering the dgd effect can be written as moench 1995 12 k z 3 s 3 r z t z α s y 0 t s 3 r z t t exp α t t d t z b 3 where sy refers to the specific yield and α is an empirical constant 1 t note that eq 12 is obtained by moench 1995 on the basis of boulton 1954 and neuman 1972 1974 and it approaches the neuman 1972 1974 boundary condition with the effect of instantaneous gravity drainage igd when α moench 1997 however the effect of unsaturated flow above the water table is neglected in this study this may be acceptable as the pumping well is located in the deeper layer in this system and the unsaturated zone above the upper layer may play a less important role furthermore consideration of the dgd effect has partially taken into account of the unsaturated flow effect indirectly as illustrated by moench 1995 1997 more research for flow at a single layer with a water table upper boundary can be found in many previous studies e g boulton 1954 1963 1973 moench 1995 2008 hunt and scott 2007 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 malama 2011 2014

special solutions 2 3 1 special solutions in a three layer aquifer system when neglecting the horizontal flow in the middle layer kr 2 0 α r 2 α d r 2 0 and ξ 2 2 p α d z 2 the present solutions of eqs 29 37 reduce to the solutions with the assumption that the flow in the middle layer is only vertical the case of an aquifer aquitard aquifer system with neglecting horizontal flow component in the aquitard is frequently used to investigate the lower pumped aquifer drawdown when the hydraulic conductivity of the middle aquitard is several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the adjacent aquifers neuman and witherspoon 1969 2 3 2 special solutions in a two layer aquifer system when b 3 b 2 kr 3 kr 2 kz 3 kz 2 one has bd 3 bd 2 ξ 3 ξ 2 β 2 γ 2 1 θ 1 θ 2 ξ 2 b d 2 1 the developed solutions of eqs 29 37 are coincide with the solution of feng et al 2019 for flow to a partially penetrating pumping well in a two layer aquifer system with constant head and no flow top boundaries moreover let α r 2 α d r 2 0 and ξ 2 2 p α d z 2 one can obtain solutions for groundwater flow to a partially penetrating well in an aquitard aquifer system with a constant head top boundary by neglecting the horizontal flow in the upper layer feng and zhan 2015 2 3 3 special solutions in a single layer aquifer system when neglecting the effect of leakage bd 3 bd 2 1 ξ 3 ξ 2 ξ 1 θ 1 θ 2 0 β

aquifer system with a partially penetrating pumping well further the solution of neuman 1972 can also be obtained from the developed solutions of eq 29 for case 1 by setting α 2 3 4 special solutions for a fully penetrating well if the pumping well is fully penetrating in the lower pumped layer ld 1 dd 0 the derived solutions expressed in eqs 29 37 reduce to their respective solutions for flow to a fully penetrating pumping well in a three layer two layer and single layer aquifer system such as the solution of feng et al 2019 feng and zhan 2015 neuman 1974 and theis 1935 table 2 shows a summary of the newly developed solutions and their special cases in different aquifer systems under different boundary conditions it should be mentioned that validation of the newly developed solutions under these special cases provides a certain degree of assurance for the correction of such solutions to further test the newly developed solutions we will compare them with specially designed numerical solutions in section 3 1 2 4 numerical inversion of the solutions as shown in eqs 29 37 one can see that the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown solutions for different cases involve integrations with the inverse hankel transform which can be evaluated using a method presented by ogata 2005 in this study ogata 2005 gave a numerical integration method with the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes to compute the infinite integral involved in the hankel transformation and its accuracy has been attested before liang et al 2018 feng et al 2019 additionally note that it is also difficult to analytically inverse the laplace transform to obtain the time domain solutions however numerical inversion of laplace transform with the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 can be employed to obtain the time domain solutions tartakovsky and neuman 2007 malama et al 2008 malama 2014 sedghi et al 2018 liang et al 2018 feng et al 2019 which is used in this study the verification and validation of the obtained solutions are further tested by comparison with finite element numerical solutions using comsol and available solutions such as the solutions of theis 1935 hantush 1964 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 neuman 1972 1974 moench 1995 feng and zhan 2015 and feng et al 2019 which are shown in section 3 1 in details 3 results and discussion the characteristics of the dimensionless drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well with constant rate pumping are analyzed herein a sensitivity analysis is carried out to explore the degree of sensitivity of drawdown to various hydrogeological parameters the default values in the following analysis are similar to previous studies neuman and witherspoon 1969 moench 1995 malama et al 2008 feng et al 2019 huang et al

layer one can see that the lower pumped layer and upper unpumped layer are composed of sandy soils and the middle layer is clay soil in nature the three layer system encompasses a special aquifer system consisting two aquifers separated by an aquitard when the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer is much lower two or more orders of magnitude smaller than those of the adjacent aquifers the typical three layer system commonly found in nature and frequently explored by many investigators e g hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 motz 1996 denis and motz 1998 hunt and scott 2007 in the following we use a special subset of the three layer aquifer system an aquifer aquitard aquifer system to compare with previous investigations for the sake of comparison purpose however we need to emphasize once again that the general theory developed in this study is applicable to any three layer aquifer systems without constrains on the permeability contrasts of different layers 3 1 comparison with numerical model and available solutions to examine the correctness of the developed solutions and to verify the applicability of conceptual model with the inverse of hankel and laplace transforms we take case 3 as an example and conduct an axisymmetric finite element numerical simulation for flow to a partially penetrating constant rate pumping well in a three layer aquifer system by comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa the settings of the dimensionless parameter values are as follows the dimensionless thickness of the lower pumped layer bd 1 middle layer of aquitard bd 2 bd 2 bd 1 and the upper unpumped layer bd 3 bd 3 bd 2 are 1 0 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the pumping well configuration parameters are ld 0 75 and dd 0 25 the other dimensionless parameters used in eqs 15 25 are rd 0 1 zd 0 5 β 1 0 01 β 2 100 αdz 1 αdr 1 1 αdz 2 αdr 2 2 10 4 and αdz 3 αdr 3 1 the dimensionless governing equations for case 3 can be numerically solved by the application of the partial differential equation solver of comsol the numerical model is discretized into triangular elements with a number of 82985 notably refinements of elements in the vicinity of the pumping well and the interface between adjacent layers are carried out to improve the accuracy using a minimum element size of 0 001 and a growth rate of 1 05 in addition the time step increases exponentially with a starting time interval δtd 1 10 4 and the whole simulation time td 1 104 then the time domain solution for case 3 of eqs 35 37 employing the numerical inversion method is compared with the numerical solution using the same dimensionless parameter values listed above fig 2 illustrates the comparison of drawdown distributions obtained by the present solution for case 3 shown in solid curves and that of finite element numerical solutions shown in circle symbols fig 2 a demonstrates the dimensionless drawdown responses at rd 0 1 in the lower pumped aquifer zd 0 5 0 9 in the middle aquitard zd 1 25 and in the upper unpumped aquifer zd 3 0 fig 2 b shows the drawdown response for different vertical positions at a given radial distance rd 0 1 with different pumping times td 10 1 101 102 and 103 from both subfigures in fig 2 one can see that the dimensionless drawdown obtained by present solution agrees with that of the numerical method implying that the present study is accurate enough to estimate the drawdown response in the three layer aquifer system fig 3 a shows the dimensionless drawdown of the pumped aquifer at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 induced by a fully penetrating constant rate pumping well ld 1 dd 0 in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system this study for case 2 hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 an aquitard aquifer system feng et al 2019 feng and zhan 2015 an unconfined aquifer system neuman 1972 moench 1995 and a completely confined aquifer system theis 1935 fig 3 b also shows the dimensionless pumped aquifer drawdown at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 induced by a partially penetrating pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 in this study and study of feng et al 2019 and feng and zhan 2019 for a aquitard aquifer system neuman 1974 and moench 1995 for a unconfined aquifer system and hantush 1964 for a leaky confined aquifer system no matter what the pumping well penetration is at the early pumping times the drawdown distribution for all studies as shown in fig 3 coincide with each other due to the release of the groundwater storage in the pumped aquifer at the intermediate and late pumping times the drawdowns obtained by other studies gradually deviate from that of theis 1935 with a full penetrating well in fig 3 a or hantush 1964 with a partially penetrating well in fig 3 b however for a fully penetrating well in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system the initial deviation in this study for case 2 is earlier than that of neuman and witherspoon 1969 and much later than that of hantush 1967 this is attributed to a few factors first the aquitard leakage is treated as a source sink term added into the governing equation of the pumped aquifer in hantush 1967 and neuman and witherspoon 1969 second hantush 1967 neglected the flow in aquitard and neuman and witherspoon 1969 considered the storage and vertical flow in aquitard while our study here not only considers the horizontal and vertical flows and storage in aquitard but also treats the leakage between aquifer and aquitard as an interfacial phenomenon rather than an averaged volumetric sink source term thus our treatment has faithfully acknowledged the actual leakage process occurred in aquitard moreover one can see from fig 3 a that the discrepancies between theis 1935 and hantush 1967 or neuman and witherspoon 1969 become greater as pumping time goes by furthermore the discrepancy for hantush 1967 is always greater than that for neuman and witherspoon 1969 indicating that drawdown can be overestimated because of ignoring flow in aquitard at the late pumping time the drawdown obtained by neuman and witherspoon 1969 is greater than that of this study for case 2 and smaller than that of hantush 1967 the drawdown attains steady state for this study for case 2 because of the use of a constant head top boundary that serves as an infinite source of supplying water to the pumped multilayer aquifer system fig 3 a reveals that the type of the top boundary of the upper unpumped aquifer cannot be overlooked in analyzing drawdown characteristics of a multilayer aquifer system in addition whether the well is fully or partially penetrating in the pumped aquifer the drawdowns developed by feng et al 2019 and feng and zhan 2015 for an aquitard aquifer two layer system and that of this study a three layer system for case 2 is almost the same except at the late time the late time discrepancies among them can be seen in the enlarged part of fig 3 one can see that the drawdown in a three layer aquifer system this study is larger than the drawdown in a two layer aquifer system furthermore the drawdown obtained with neglecting radial flow in aquitard feng and zhan 2015 and this study with no radial flow is larger than that of considering aquitard radial flow feng et al 2019 and this study with radial flow the effect of radial flow in middle aquitard on the pumped aquifer drawdown is quite minor for this example in which the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard is two orders of magnitude smaller than those of aquifers if the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard increases and becomes closer to those of aquifers radial flow in aquitard will become increasingly important and is generally not negligible one also can find from fig 3 that the drawdown in a single layer unconfined aquifer calculated by neuman 1972 and moench 1995 with a fully penetrating pumping well or by neuman 1974 and moench 1995 with a partially penetrating pumping well over the entire pumping period are almost the same with the exception of intermediate time the discrepancies during the intermediate time are mainly caused by the difference between the delayed gravity drainage model and the instantaneous gravity drainage model at the water table and more detailed explanation about this matter will be provided in section 3 5 finally compared fig 3 a with b one can see that the pumped aquifer drawdown induced by a partially penetrating pumping well is larger than that by a fully penetrating pumping well at the same fixed time meaning that the well partial penetration is a concern 3 2 effect of different top boundaries on drawdown fig 4 demonstrates the drawdown characteristics in the lower pumped aquifer zd 0 5 in the middle layer zd 1 25 and in the upper unpumped aquifer zd 2 0 using the type curve of a dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless time at rd 0 1 and b dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless distance at td 104 due to a fully penetrating pumping well ld 1 dd 0 and different top boundaries note that the study of neuman and witherspoon 1969 ignoring the effect of the top boundary condition is also taken into consideration for the purpose of comparison fig 4 a shows that because of a relatively short pumping time the effect of different choices of top boundary on the dimensionless drawdown around a pumping well is not obvious at the early and moderate times but the drawdown is significantly affected at the late time furthermore drawdown for case 1 is larger than that for case 2 and smaller than that for case 3 this is because the constant head top boundary in case 2 serves as an infinite source of water supply thus resulting in the least drawdown among three cases on the other end the no flow top boundary in case 3 serves as a barrier of water supply thus resulting in the greatest drawdown among three cases it is interesting to see that the drawdown in the pumped and unpumped aquifer for case 3 is almost the same as that in neuman and witherspoon 1969 but drawdown in the middle layer for case 3 deviates considerably from that of neuman and witherspoon 1969 this indicates that the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 can be used to describe drawdowns in the upper and lower aquifers in this three layer aquifer system with a no flux top boundary however it fails to describe the drawdown in the middle layer particularly during the late time additionally the late time drawdown in the three layer aquifer system is shown in fig 4 b it can be seen that the pumping induced influence area for case 1 is larger than that for case 2 and smaller than that for case 3 which is consistent with the drawdown characteristics shown in fig 4 a the drawdowns in the two aquifers and the middle layer approach the same value e g zd 0 5 1 25 and 2 at rd 100 sd 0 44 when the distance from the pumping well is sufficiently large much larger than the thickness of the aquifer another phenomenon observed from fig 4 b is that the drawdowns in the two aquifers and the middle layer obtained by neuman and witherspoon 1969 agree with their counterparts of this study for case 3 when the radial distance from the pumping well is greater than the thickness of the pumped aquifer rd 1 this suggests that the flow direction in the middle layer can only be treated as vertical at the distance larger than the thickness of the pumped aquifer for case 3 in other words the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 is valid at rd 1 under the condition that the aquifer permeability is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that of the aquitard the middle layer and a no flux top boundary condition is presented if such conditions are not satisfied the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 will be less reliable finally fig 4 indicates that the choice of top boundary must be clarified especially when using the late time drawdown data to estimate hydraulic parameters of a multilayer aquifer system because the middle layer aquitard drawdown is influenced by the horizontal flow in that layer as discussed above fig 5 is produced to explore the effect of horizontal flow in the aquitard under different top boundaries on dimensionless middle layer drawdown at rd 0 1 induced by a partially penetrating pumping well ld 1 dd 0 5 note that the case of neglecting the horizontal flow in aquitard is also considered for the purpose of comparison in this figure it can be found that the visible aquitard drawdown appears at td 10 this is expected as the response of aquitard to pumping lags behind that of the pumped aquifer the aquitard drawdown for the case of ignoring the effect of horizontal flow is always large than the case of considering the horizontal flow and the discrepancy between these two cases become even more greater when a no flux top boundary rather than the constant head top boundary is used so in general the aquitard horizontal flow and the top boundary type play important roles in predicting the aquitard drawdown near a pumping well and their effects cannot be neglected if the aquitard drawdown is of concern fig 6 illustrates the effect of the type of top boundary condition on drawdown response for different vertical positions at a given radial distance rd 0 1 induced by a partially penetrating well with different pumping times td 100 102 and 105 one can find that the drawdowns along the zd direction for different cases agree with each other when td 100 and 102 but the differences among them are obvious at a larger pumping time of td 105 this shows that the type of the top boundary can affect the drawdown characteristics for locations from the bottom of the pumped aquifer to the top of the unpumped aquifer when the pumping time is sufficiently long thus one should confirm the type of top boundary as well as the piezometer location r and z when using the drawdown data to estimate the hydraulic parameters of aquifers and aquitard 3 3 effect of the thickness of unpumped aquifer and aquitard first of all it should be noted that case 1 is taken an example for illustration in this section one can also conduct similar analysis for case 2 and case 3 if necessary fig 7 demonstrates the dimensionless drawdown response induced by a partially penetrating well ld 1 dd 0 5 in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 in the aquitard zd 1 2 and in the unpumped aquifer zd 1 6 at rd 0 1 for different unpumped aquifer thickness bd 3 bd 3 bd 2 while the thicknesses of the pumped aquifer and the aquitard remain fixed note that the case of no leakage or an impermeable aquitard is considered as well in this figure for the sake of comparison the effect of the thickness of the unpumped aquifer on drawdown does not appear at the early and intermediate pumping times however its effect is significant at late pumping time and a smaller bd 3 means that the water stored in the unpumped aquifer is also smaller leading to a larger drawdown as shown in the figure fig 8 illustrates the dimensionless drawdown characteristics due to a partially penetrating well ld 1 dd 0 5 in the pumped aquifer zd 0 8 in the aquitard zd 1 05 and in the unpumped aquifer at rd 0 1 for different aquitard thicknesses bd 2 bd 2 1 while the thicknesses of the two aquifers remain fixed it should be mentioned that the vertical position of the piezometer in the unpumped aquifer is always set at one meter above the unpumped aquifer aquitard interface no matter what the thickness of aquitard is and the no leakage case is also taken into account as a reference of comparison the type curves of dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless time are affected by the change of the thickness of aquitard at the intermediate and late times especially in the pumped aquifer and the aquitard one can see that a thicker aquitard indicates a greater aquitard storage thus a smaller drawdown in the pumped aquifer and the aquitard see fig 8 the drawdown in the unpumped aquifer is influenced by a thinner aquitard quicker resulting in a larger drawdown in the unpumped aquifer figs 7 and 8 show that the effect of leakage from aquitard on the pumped aquifer drawdown is significant when compared to the no leakage case 3 4 effect of anisotropy fig 9 depicts the dimensionless drawdown response in the anisotropic pumped and unpumped aquifer zd 0 8 and 1 6 for different anisotropy ratios kd kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 kd 3 kz 3 kr 3 and in the isotropic aquitard zd 1 1 at rd 0 1 a number of interesting observations can be made first it can be found in this figure that drawdowns in the aquitard and the two aquifers are significantly influenced by the aquifer anisotropy during the whole pumping periods second a larger aquifer anisotropy signifies stronger vertical flow in the aquifer leading to less water released from the pumped aquifer so a smaller drawdown in the pumped aquifer as well third the drawdown characteristics in the aquitard however is quite different from that of the pumped aquifer as vertical flow plays a stronger role with a larger anisotropy the influence of pumping will propagate vertically to the aquitard earlier resulting in an earlier release of water from the aquitard storage to supply the pumped aquifer thus an earlier response of drawdown in the aquitard as evident from fig 9 fourth when pumping keeps going on the drawdown in the aquitard will eventually become smaller for a larger aquifer anisotropy at late time similar to that in the pumped aquifer because of the stronger overall vertical flow in the system the response of the unpumped aquifer functions similarly to that of the pumped aquifer in general the aquifer anisotropy plays a very important role in determining the characteristics of drawdown in any layers of the whole aquifer system fig 10 shows the drawdown responses in an isotropic aquifers kz 1 kr 1 kz 3 kr 3 10 4 m s and zd 0 8 and 1 6 and an anisotropic aquitard zd 1 1 for different aquitard anisotropy ratios kd 2 at rd 0 1 with a partially penetrating well ld 1 0 and dd 0 5 note that the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is fixed in fig 10 a while in contrast the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is fixed in fig 10 b the case of an isotropic aquitard is included as well in this figure for comparison one can clearly see from fig 10 a that the change of kr 2 has no influence on the drawdowns in the lower pumped layer and upper unpumped layer at the whole pumping time if kr 2 kz 2 however if kr 2 is greater than kz 2 the change of kr 2 clearly affects the drawdowns in both aquifers during the intermediate and late pumping periods as shown in fig 10 a it can be found from fig 10 b that drawdowns in all three layers have been significantly influenced by the change of kz 2 a larger kz 2 implies that more leakage will be induced across the aquitard leading to a smaller drawdown in the pumped lower aquifer and a larger drawdown in the unpumped upper aquifer the findings from fig 10 once again emphasize that both the horizontal and vertical flows in the aquitard are generally not negligible for predicting drawdowns around the pumping well in this three layer aquifer system 3 5 the effect of delayed gravity drainage to investigate the effect of delayed gravity drainage on drawdown induced by a partially penetrating pumping well fig 11 is depicted to show the dimensionless drawdown response in the unpumped aquifer zd 1 6 aquitard zd 1 2 and pumped aquifer zd 0 8 for different values of dimensionless parameter γ at rd 0 1 it should be mentioned that the change of γ can reflect the dgd effect moench 1995 the case of neuman 1974 with the igd effect γ is also considered in this figure for the purpose of comparison additionally the pumped aquifer without leakage hantush 1964 is taken into account as well one can see that the effect of dgd is mainly significant at intermediate time and a larger γ or α indicates that water from the unsaturated zone is drained more quickly thus a larger drawdown can be found in fig 11 in addition the effect of delayed drainage on the drawdown response in the aquitard is less apparent than that in the upper unpumped aquifer and more apparent than that in the lower pumped aquifer 3 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is frequently employed to evaluate how various parameters would affect the drawdown kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 sedghi et al 2018 feng and zhan 2019 sensitivity analysis sa is commonly classified as local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa the former method can change one parameter value in each time and evaluate the local effect of individual parameters while the latter method can consider the joint effect of various parameters song et al 2015 the gsa is widely used at the field regional scale in hydrology e g rajabi and ketabchi 2017 janetti et al 2019 reinecke et al 2019 while lsa is easy to operate and interpret and has relatively low computational cost and no self verification compared with the gsa method song et al 2015 reinecke et al 2019 so it is still popular in well hydraulics studies e g huang et al 2019 lin et al 2019 lin et al 2020 zhu and wen 2020 accordingly the normalized sensitivity analysis is carried out in this study which can be written as huang and yeh 2007 38 x i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j where x i j is the normalized sensitivity value for the jth parameter pj at the ith time oi denotes the drawdown response and the value of the small increment δpj equals to 10 2 pj herein note that the absolute values of x i j is used to investigate the degree of sensitivity of drawdown around pumping well to different parameters the default parameter values are given as kr 1 2 10 4 m s kz 1 10 4 m s ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 b 1 20 m kr 2 2 10 6 m s kz 2 10 6 m s ss 2 10 3 m 1 b 2 30 m kr 3 2 10 4 m s kz 3 10 4 m s ss 3 2 10 5 m 1 b 3 50 m sy 0 2 1 α 103 s r 2 m l 15 m d 5 m z 10 m 25 m and 40 m one can see that the well screen is located in the middle part of the pumped aquifer and the drawdown responses are respectively observed at the middle of the lower pumped aquifer sd 1 the middle aquitard sd 2 and the upper unpumped aquifer sd 3 fig 12 mainly illustrate the sensitivity of drawdown of the lower pumped aquifer for case 1 to the pumped aquifer parameters b 1 kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 the aquitard parameters b 2 kr 2 kz 2 ss 2 and the upper unpumped aquifer parameters b 3 kr 3 kz 3 ss 3 sy α because the previous studies e g feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 have shown that the drawdown is sensitive to the change of well configuration parameters of l and d at the entire pumping time thus the sensitivity analysis of well configuration parameters is not repeated in this study from fig 12 one can find that the effect of the relative change of ss 1 on sd 1 increases gradually as pumping time goes by and decreases gradually until disappears near td 102 after reached the peak near td 10 2 the change of kz 1 on sd 1 increases obviously with pumping time arrives at the peak value near td 5 and maintain the maximum for the rest of pumping time fig 11 also indicates that the effects of kz 2 and ss 2 on sd 1 are minor in the period 1 td 103 and their sensitivities are the same and smaller than that to kz 2 at the late pumping time e g td 105 sd 1 is very sensitive to the change of kr 1 and bz 1 is moderately sensitive to the variation of kz 1 kr 3 and b 3 for case 1 and is slightly sensitive to the variation of kz 2 b 2 and sy for case 1 finally it is can be found that the changes of kz 3 ss 3 and α on sd 1 are rather minor as for the sensitivity analysis of drawdown in aquitard sd 2 and upper aquifer sd 3 one can see more details in supplementary materials 4 application of solutions it is worth mentioning that the newly obtained solution can also serve the following purposes first it can be employed to predict the pumping induced drawdown at any position with an observation well or piezometer with no restrictions on hydraulic parameters for each layer and well configuration parameter such as the hydraulic conductivity in radial and vertical directions the storability and thickness of each layer and the well screen length and location in the pumped layer second it can be utilized to explore the effects of aquitard storage and well partial penetration on the drawdown for different cases third it can be employed to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the three layer aquifer system what is more the developed solutions provide a great potential application value in the area of geothermal engineering geological or geotechnical engineering if the solutions are used for parameter estimation in a three layer aquifer system such as an aquifer aquitard aquifer system the following procedures are recommended firstly the well screen length and its location in the pumped aquifer should be known in advance so does the thickness of each layer and the type of the top boundary of the upper unpumped layer when using the late time drawdown data to estimate aquifer parameters secondly the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped aquifer is sensitive to ss 1 at early time thus it is more valuable to determine its value using the drawdown data collected in this stage additionally the intermediate and late time drawdowns in the pumped aquifer are suggested to estimate the values of kr 1 kz 1 thirdly the in situ data of drawdown in the aquitard at early time are more reliable to determine kz 2 and ss 2 and the drawdown data at intermediate time is recommended for estimating the value of kr 2 fourthly the late time drawdown data of the pumped aquifer or aquitard can be used to estimate the values of kr 3 and sy however the early time drawdown data of the unpumped aquifer is better used to determine the values of kz 3 the values of s 3 and α can also be determined using the late time drawdown data in the unpumped aquifer a point to note is that drawdown response of the anisotropic aquifer aquitard aquifer system is mainly analyzed in section 3 with the aim of comparing with available studies in fact the newly obtained solution has no constrains on the permeability of each layer thus it can be applied to a general three layer aquifer system under the condition of a moderate permeability contrast between two layers for example a three layer aquifer system with the permeability gradually increase from the upper unpumped layer to the lower pumped layer which is usually encountered in river terraces such as the first terrace of yangtze river in china there are also a few limitations for this study that should be addressed firstly the radius of the pumping well is assumed to be infinitesimal thus the effect of finite radius wellbore storage and skin effect have not been analyzed in this study secondly the well face boundary condition is assumed as a uniform flux type for simplicity rather than the integrated or mixed flux or other types thirdly the aquifer heterogeneity and variable layer thickness are not considered although the aquifer anisotropy has been considered fourthly the well pumping is limited to constant rate other types of pumping schemes such as constant drawdown pumping variable rate pumping etc have not been addressed fifthly the slope of the layers and the effect of multi pumping wells system are not taken into account as well these subjects are worthy of further investigation in details in the future in addition the newly obtained solutions are only applicable when the number of aquifer layers is less than or equal to three limiting their use for an aquifer system with more than three layers nevertheless when the number of aquifer layers is indeed less than or equal to three the proposed new solutions are generally straightforward stable and computationally efficient for computing the drawdowns or for parameter estimation avoiding the issues associated with constructing numerical solutions such as unknown numerical errors non convergency and even non uniqueness of solutions however when the assumptions used in this study are violated such as the three layer aquifer system having an irregular lateral boundary existence of a non uniform skin near the pumping well due to well development and or clogging and nonnegligible wellbore storage effect then the numerical solutions would be a better choice compared with analytical solutions under such circumstances 5 summary and conclusions a new semi analytical drawdown solution in dimensionless form for flow to a partially penetrating constant rate pumping well in an anisotropic three layer system is obtained by the method of laplace hankel transform considering the interface flow and different top boundary conditions it is worth noting that the commonly used top boundary condition of the water table with delayed gravity drainage boundary for case 1 constant head boundary for case 2 and no flow boundary for case 3 are taken into consideration the real time solutions are obtained by carrying out the inverse laplace and hankel transforms numerically the newly developed solutions are shown to unify some known solutions in a two layer or a single layer aquifer system with a fully or partially penetrating well which can be seen in table 2 the validity and correctness of the obtained solutions is verified by the comparison with the results of numerical method by comsol and the known analytical and semi analytical solutions for some special cases of this study the three dimensional drawdown response of a three layer aquifer system induced by a partially penetrating constant rate well in the lower aquifer are discussed based on the newly developed solutions the sensitivity of drawdown for case 1 to various aquifer parameters is explored the main findings of this study are as follows 1 the pumped aquifer drawdown for hantush 1967 with ignoring flow in aquitard is always larger that of neuman and witherspoon 1969 with assumption of horizontal flow in aquifer and vertical flow in aquitard and this study for case 2 during the entire pumping times and the drawdown obtained by neuman and witherspoon 1969 is larger than that of this study for case 2 at late time 2 the drawdowns in the pumped and unpumped aquifers for case 3 are almost the same as their counterparts in neuman and witherspoon 1969 however the aquitard drawdown computed by neuman and witherspoon 1969 has significant error at the whole pumping time the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 is valid to determine the drawdown at the distance larger than the thickness of the pumped aquifer at late time 3 the drawdowns in aquitard and two aquifers are significantly influenced by the aquifer anisotropy during the whole pumping periods the effect of horizontal flow in aquitard cannot be neglected when estimating hydraulic parameters of aquitard when using the drawdown data near the pumping well the effect of vertical flow on drawdown in the three layer system is significant over the entire pumping time additionally the effect of the delayed gravity drainage is mainly significant at intermediate times 4 the drawdown in the pumped aquifer sd 1 for case 1 is very sensitive to the change of kr 1 and bz 1 is moderately sensitive to the variation of kz 1 kr 3 and b 3 and is slightly sensitive to the variation of kz 2 b 2 and sy at late time credit authorship contribution statement qinggao

chief with the assistance of dongmei han associate editor three dimensional response to well pumping in a multilayer aquifer system with rigorous treatment of interfacial flow attracts great attention among the subsurface hydrologists because of its theoretical importance and practical merits in this study a general theory of three dimensional groundwater flow to a well of infinitesimal radius in an anisotropic three layer aquifer system is developed with a constant rate pumping in the lower layer and associated semi analytical solutions of drawdowns in individual layers are obtained this theory discards many previous assumptions for studying a multilayer aquifer system such as simplified flow configuration in the aquitard treatment of cross formation flow as a volumetric averaged term adding to the governing equations of aquifer flows and sometimes negligence of vertical flow components in the aquifers additionally this theory considers three types of commonly used top boundary conditions a water table with delayed gravity drainage boundary condition case 1 a constant head top boundary condition case 2 and a no flow top boundary condition case 3 the dimensionless drawdown solutions in laplace domain are obtained and inverted numerically to calculate the time domain solutions the solution encompasses existing solutions for a two layer or a single layer e g unconfined or confined aquifer system as subsets the developed solutions are tested extensively with a finite element numerical solution using comsol and other existing solutions and a sensitivity analysis is performed to prioritize the influences of different parameter groups the results of this study can be used to predict the pumping induced drawdown at any position with an observation well and to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the lower pumped layer and upper layer as well as the middle layer the developed theory provides a basis for other potential applications such as geotechnical

subscripts 1 2 3 the lower pumped layer middle layer upper layer 1 introduction a large number of multilayer aquifer systems commonly exists in nature and the hydraulic response induced by well pumping in such systems has caught much attention in the fields of hydrogeology geological engineering geothermal engineering and petroleum engineering hantush 1964 javandel and witherspoon 1983 hemker and maas 1987 yeh and chang 2013 to simplify the problem a number of assumptions are usually adopted first flow in the aquitard is usually limited to vertical flow only while the horizontal flow component is regarded as too small to be considered this simplification however is only close to reality when the permeability of the aquitard is much smaller at least two or three orders of magnitude smaller than those of the adjacent aquifers a condition that may not be satisfied in an actual field setting malama et al 2007 2008 feng et al 2019 second the cross formation flow or leakage across the aquitard is treated as vertically averaged term imposed uniformly over the entire thickness of the adjacent aquifers a so called hantush assumption that is against the truth that the cross formation flow occurs only at the aquitard aquifer interface rather as a volumetric sink source term in the governing equations of flow in the aquifer hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1959 1964 moench 1985 zhan and bian 2006 hunt and scott 2007 this assumption is particularly troublesome when the thickness of the aquifer of concern is somewhat the same or greater than the scale of interest such as the distance between the pumping well and the point of observation and or the pumping well is partially penetrating halepaska 1972 bakker 2006 perina and lee 2006 malama et al 2007 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 2019 sedghi et al 2018 feng et al 2019 third vertical flows in the aquifers are also sometimes omitted to simplify the flow to horizontal only in the aquifers hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 hunt and scott 2007 fourth although the storage effect is always considered for transient flow in the aquifer the storage effect of the aquitard is sometime ignored for the simplification purpose hantush 1967 hunt 2005 this simplification is only applicable when the aquitard thickness is much smaller than the scale of interest but is generally not valid otherwise neuman and witherspoon 1969 the use of above assumptions has the benefit of simplifying the mathematical model of flow in a multilayer aquifer system but at the same time substantially limits their applications to a broad spectrum of possible field conditions additionally although the lower boundary of a multilayer aquifer system is usually set as no flow the upper boundary of such a multilayer aquifer system can be subject to different hydrological constrains such as water table condition or no flow or even constant head to name a few for instance motz 1996 and denis and motz 1998 considered the effect of evapotranspiration reduction at top aquifer and proposed a laplace domain solution due to a fully penetrating well pumping from one or two aquifers in a three layer aquifer system on the base of the mathematical model developed by hantush 1967 and neuman and witherspoon 1969 respectively hunt and scott 2007 provided an approximate solution for flow to a fully penetrating well in a lower aquifer overlain by a middle aquitard and an upper unpumped aquifer with a free surface at the top after a careful review of existing literatures on the subject of flow in a multilayer aquifer system we notice that there is not a general theory that is free from many above mentioned assumptions except for a handful of investigations that will be briefly reviewed as follows malama et al 2008 obtained a semi analytical solution to investigate the response of an unconfined aquifer aquitard aquifer system due to a partially penetrating pumping well in this study both horizontal and vertical flows are considered in aquifers and aquitard the well is however pumped at a constant rate in the upper unconfined aquifer for a water table boundary condition described in the manner of neuman 1974 with the effect of instantaneous gravity drainage veling and maas 2009 gave a semi analytical strategy for solving transient flow in a multilayered aquifer system and the effect of delayed gravity drainage at the top boundary condition was not considered thus the purpose of this study is to develop a general theory for flow to a partially penetrating well in an anisotropic three layer aquifer system due to a constant discharge pumping in the lower layer without using above mentioned four assumptions a striking new feature of this new theory is that it does not impose the commonly used restriction on the permeability contrast between two adjacent layers in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system where the permeability of the middle aquitard has to be at least two or three orders of magnitude smaller than those of the aquifers e g hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 another important feature is that the cross formation flow or effect of leakage is considered as an interfacial phenomenon more importantly three commonly used top boundaries are considered including a water table boundary with the effect of delayed gravity drainage case 1 a constant head boundary case 2 and a no flux boundary case 3 2 method 2 1 mathematical models fig 1 shows an infinitesimal radius well pumped at a constant rate q in an anisotropic three layer aquifer system of infinite lateral extent the well partially penetrates the lower layer of the system with a screen fixed from l to d in which l and d are respectively the upper and lower elevations of the well screen from the impermeable bottom of the pumped aquifer each layer with finite thickness is homogeneous but anisotropic and flow is radially symmetric the hydraulic connection between two adjacent layers is accomplished with continuity of drawdown and flux at their interface notably the type of the top boundary of the system can be specified as a water table boundary with the effect of delayed gravity drainage case 1 a constant head boundary case 2 and a no flux boundary case 3 the origin of the coordinate system is located on the well center and the base of the pumped aquifer on the basis of the above conceptual model firstly the governing equation of flow in the layer of concern can be expressed as 1 k ri 1 r s i r z t r k zi 2 s i r z t z 2 s si s i r z t t in which s is drawdown l kr and kz refer to the horizontally radial and vertical hydraulic conductivities respectively l t which are assumed to be constant ss denotes specific storage 1 l and t represents the time of pumping t subscript i 1 2 3 designates lower pumped middle and the upper layers respectively as one can see from eq 1 three dimensional flow is not only considered for the lower pumped layer it is also taken into consideration for the upper layer and the middle layer a point worth noting is that many previous studies only considered vertical flow in the middle layer of aquitard e g neuman and witherspoon 1969 moench 1985 perina and lee 2006 hunt and scott 2007 feng and zhan 2015 because of the generality of the governing equations used here the permeabilities of all three layers here can be arbitrary free from any constrains such a relaxation on the permeability contrasts among different layers will make this work much more general and versatile than previous studies on similar matters the initial conditions of drawdown in the three layers are 2 s i r z 0 0 the infinite lateral boundary for each layer can be expressed as 3 s i z t 0 for a partially penetrating well with a constant discharge in the lower pumped layer the inner boundary condition at the wellbore can be expressed as hantush 1964 malama et al 2008 liang et al 2018 sedghi et al 2018 feng et al 2019 4 lim r 0 r s 1 r 0 l z b 1 q 2 π k r 1 l d d z l 0 0 z d where q is the constant pumping rate and is positive l3 t for flow in the middle layer the well face boundary condition can be written as 5 lim r 0 r s 2 r 0 for the upper layer flow the inner boundary at the wellbore is 6 lim r 0 r s 3 r 0 the impermeable bottom of the lower pumped layer requires 7 s 1 z z 0 0 and the continuity requirements of drawdown and flux at the

different ways as case 1 a water table boundary condition with the effect of delayed gravity drainage dgd the water table motion of the upper layer considering the dgd effect can be written as moench 1995 12 k z 3 s 3 r z t z α s y 0 t s 3 r z t t exp α t t d t z b 3 where sy refers to the specific yield and α is an empirical constant 1 t note that eq 12 is obtained by moench 1995 on the basis of boulton 1954 and neuman 1972 1974 and it approaches the neuman 1972 1974 boundary condition with the effect of instantaneous gravity drainage igd when α moench 1997 however the effect of unsaturated flow above the water table is neglected in this study this may be acceptable as the pumping well is located in the deeper layer in this system and the unsaturated zone above the upper layer may play a less important role furthermore consideration of the dgd effect has partially taken into account of the unsaturated flow effect indirectly as illustrated by moench 1995 1997 more research for flow at a single layer with a water table upper boundary can be found in many previous studies e g boulton 1954 1963 1973 moench 1995 2008 hunt and scott 2007 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 malama 2011 2014

special solutions 2 3 1 special solutions in a three layer aquifer system when neglecting the horizontal flow in the middle layer kr 2 0 α r 2 α d r 2 0 and ξ 2 2 p α d z 2 the present solutions of eqs 29 37 reduce to the solutions with the assumption that the flow in the middle layer is only vertical the case of an aquifer aquitard aquifer system with neglecting horizontal flow component in the aquitard is frequently used to investigate the lower pumped aquifer drawdown when the hydraulic conductivity of the middle aquitard is several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the adjacent aquifers neuman and witherspoon 1969 2 3 2 special solutions in a two layer aquifer system when b 3 b 2 kr 3 kr 2 kz 3 kz 2 one has bd 3 bd 2 ξ 3 ξ 2 β 2 γ 2 1 θ 1 θ 2 ξ 2 b d 2 1 the developed

moreover let α r 2 α d r 2 0 and ξ 2 2 p α d z 2 one can obtain solutions for groundwater flow to a partially penetrating well in an aquitard aquifer system with a constant head top boundary by neglecting the horizontal flow in the upper layer feng and zhan 2015 2 3 3 special solutions in a single layer aquifer system when neglecting the effect of leakage bd 3 bd 2 1 ξ 3 ξ 2 ξ 1 θ 1 θ 2 0 β

aquifer system with a partially penetrating pumping well further the solution of neuman 1972 can also be obtained from the developed solutions of eq 29 for case 1 by setting α 2 3 4 special solutions for a fully penetrating well if the pumping well is fully penetrating in the lower pumped layer ld 1 dd 0 the derived solutions expressed in eqs 29 37 reduce to their respective solutions for flow to a fully penetrating pumping well in a three layer two layer and single layer aquifer system such as the solution of feng et al 2019 feng and zhan 2015 neuman 1974 and theis 1935 table 2 shows a summary of the newly developed solutions and their special cases in different aquifer systems under different boundary conditions it should be mentioned that validation of the newly developed solutions under these special cases provides a certain degree of assurance for the correction of such solutions to further test the newly developed solutions we will compare them with specially designed numerical solutions in section 3 1 2 4 numerical inversion of the solutions as shown in eqs 29 37 one can see that the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown solutions for different cases involve integrations with the inverse hankel transform which can be evaluated using a method presented by ogata 2005 in this study ogata 2005 gave a numerical integration method with the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes to compute the infinite integral involved in the hankel transformation and its accuracy has been attested before liang et al 2018 feng et al 2019 additionally note that it is also difficult to analytically inverse the laplace transform to obtain the time domain solutions however numerical inversion of laplace transform with the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 can be employed to obtain the time domain solutions tartakovsky and neuman 2007 malama et al 2008 malama 2014 sedghi et al 2018 liang et al 2018 feng et al 2019 which is used in this study the verification and validation of the obtained solutions are further tested by comparison with finite element numerical solutions using comsol and available solutions such as the solutions of theis 1935 hantush 1964 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 neuman 1972 1974 moench 1995 feng and zhan 2015 and feng et al 2019 which are shown in section 3 1 in details 3 results and discussion the characteristics of the dimensionless drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well with constant rate pumping are analyzed herein a sensitivity analysis is carried out to explore the degree of sensitivity of drawdown to various hydrogeological parameters the default values in the following analysis are similar to previous studies neuman and witherspoon 1969 moench 1995 malama et al 2008 feng et al 2019 huang et al

layer one can see that the lower pumped layer and upper unpumped layer are composed of sandy soils and the middle layer is clay soil in nature the three layer system encompasses a special aquifer system consisting two aquifers separated by an aquitard when the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer is much lower two or more orders of magnitude smaller than those of the adjacent aquifers the typical three layer system commonly found in nature and frequently explored by many investigators e g hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 motz 1996 denis and motz 1998 hunt and scott 2007 in the following we use a special subset of the three layer aquifer system an aquifer aquitard aquifer system to compare with previous investigations for the sake of comparison purpose however we need to emphasize once again that the general theory developed in this study is applicable to any three layer aquifer systems without constrains on the permeability contrasts of different layers 3 1 comparison with numerical model and available solutions to examine the correctness of the developed solutions and to verify the applicability of conceptual model with the inverse of hankel and laplace transforms we take case 3 as an example and conduct an axisymmetric finite element numerical simulation for flow to a partially penetrating constant rate pumping well in a three layer aquifer system by comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa the settings of the dimensionless parameter values are as follows the dimensionless thickness of the lower pumped layer bd 1 middle layer of aquitard bd 2 bd 2 bd 1 and the upper unpumped layer bd 3 bd 3 bd 2 are 1 0 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the pumping well configuration parameters are ld 0 75 and dd 0 25 the other dimensionless parameters used in eqs 15 25 are rd 0 1 zd 0 5 β 1 0 01 β 2 100 αdz 1 αdr 1 1 αdz 2 αdr 2 2 10 4 and αdz 3 αdr 3 1 the dimensionless governing equations for case 3 can be numerically solved by the application of the partial differential equation solver of comsol the numerical model is discretized into triangular elements with a number of 82985 notably refinements of elements in the vicinity of the pumping well and the interface between adjacent layers are carried out to improve the accuracy using a minimum element size of 0 001 and a growth rate of 1 05 in addition the time step increases exponentially with a starting time interval δtd 1 10 4 and the whole simulation time td 1 104 then the time domain solution for case 3 of eqs 35 37 employing the numerical inversion method is compared with the numerical solution using the same dimensionless parameter values listed above fig 2 illustrates the comparison of drawdown distributions obtained by the present solution for case 3 shown in solid curves and that of finite element numerical solutions shown in circle symbols fig 2 a demonstrates the dimensionless drawdown responses at rd 0 1 in the lower pumped aquifer zd 0 5 0 9 in the middle aquitard zd 1 25 and in the upper unpumped aquifer zd 3 0 fig 2 b shows the drawdown response for different vertical positions at a given radial distance rd 0 1 with different pumping times td 10 1 101 102 and 103 from both subfigures in fig 2 one can see that the dimensionless drawdown obtained by present solution agrees with that of the numerical method implying that the present study is accurate enough to estimate the drawdown response in the three layer aquifer system fig 3 a shows the dimensionless drawdown of the pumped aquifer at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 induced by a fully penetrating constant rate pumping well ld 1 dd 0 in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system this study for case 2 hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 an aquitard aquifer system feng et al 2019 feng and zhan 2015 an unconfined aquifer system neuman 1972 moench 1995 and a completely confined aquifer system theis 1935 fig 3 b also shows the dimensionless pumped aquifer drawdown at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 induced by a partially penetrating pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 in this study and study of feng et al 2019 and feng and zhan 2019 for a aquitard aquifer system neuman 1974 and moench 1995 for a unconfined aquifer system and hantush 1964 for a leaky confined aquifer system no matter what the pumping well penetration is at the early pumping times the drawdown distribution for all studies as shown in fig 3 coincide with each other due to the release of the groundwater storage in the pumped aquifer at the intermediate and late pumping times the drawdowns obtained by other studies gradually deviate from that of theis 1935 with a full penetrating well in fig 3 a or hantush 1964 with a partially penetrating well in fig 3 b however for a fully penetrating well in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system the initial deviation in this study for case 2 is earlier than that of neuman and witherspoon 1969 and much later than that of hantush 1967 this is attributed to a few factors first the aquitard leakage is treated as a source sink term added into the governing equation of the pumped aquifer in hantush 1967 and neuman and witherspoon 1969 second hantush 1967 neglected the flow in aquitard and neuman and witherspoon 1969 considered the storage and vertical flow in aquitard while our study here not only considers the horizontal and vertical flows and storage in aquitard but also treats the leakage between aquifer and aquitard as an interfacial phenomenon rather than an averaged volumetric sink source term thus our treatment has faithfully acknowledged the actual leakage process occurred in aquitard moreover one can see from fig 3 a that the discrepancies between theis 1935 and hantush 1967 or neuman and witherspoon 1969 become greater as pumping time goes by furthermore the discrepancy for hantush 1967 is always greater than that for neuman and witherspoon 1969 indicating that drawdown can be overestimated because of ignoring flow in aquitard at the late pumping time the drawdown obtained by neuman and witherspoon 1969 is greater than that of this study for case 2 and smaller than that of hantush 1967 the drawdown attains steady state for this study for case 2 because of the use of a constant head top boundary that serves as an infinite source of supplying water to the pumped multilayer aquifer system fig 3 a reveals that the type of the top boundary of the upper unpumped aquifer cannot be overlooked in analyzing drawdown characteristics of a multilayer aquifer system in addition whether the well is fully or partially penetrating in the pumped aquifer the drawdowns developed by feng et al 2019 and feng and zhan 2015 for an aquitard aquifer two layer system and that of this study a three layer system for case 2 is almost the same except at the late time the late time discrepancies among them can be seen in the enlarged part of fig 3 one can see that the drawdown in a three layer aquifer system this study is larger than the drawdown in a two layer aquifer system furthermore the drawdown obtained with neglecting radial flow in aquitard feng and zhan 2015 and this study with no radial flow is larger than that of considering aquitard radial flow feng et al 2019 and this study with radial flow the effect of radial flow in middle aquitard on the pumped aquifer drawdown is quite minor for this example in which the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard is two orders of magnitude smaller than those of aquifers if the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard increases and becomes closer to those of aquifers radial flow in aquitard will become increasingly important and is generally not negligible one also can find from fig 3 that the drawdown in a single layer unconfined aquifer calculated by neuman 1972 and moench 1995 with a fully penetrating pumping well or by neuman 1974 and moench 1995 with a partially penetrating pumping well over the entire pumping period are almost the same with the exception of intermediate time the discrepancies during the intermediate time are mainly caused by the difference between the delayed gravity drainage model and the instantaneous gravity drainage model at the water table and more detailed explanation about this matter will be provided in section 3 5 finally compared fig 3 a with b one can see that the pumped aquifer drawdown induced by a partially penetrating pumping well is larger than that by a fully penetrating pumping well at the same fixed time meaning that the well partial penetration is a concern 3 2 effect of different top boundaries on drawdown fig 4 demonstrates the drawdown characteristics in the lower pumped aquifer zd 0 5 in the middle layer zd 1 25 and in the upper unpumped aquifer zd 2 0 using the type curve of a dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless time at rd 0 1 and b dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless distance at td 104 due to a fully penetrating pumping well ld 1 dd 0 and different top boundaries note that the study of neuman and witherspoon 1969 ignoring the effect of the top boundary condition is also taken into consideration for the purpose of comparison fig 4 a shows that because of a relatively short pumping time the effect of different choices of top boundary on the dimensionless drawdown around a pumping well is not obvious at the early and moderate times but the drawdown is significantly affected at the late time furthermore drawdown for case 1 is larger than that for case 2 and smaller than that for case 3 this is because the constant head top boundary in case 2 serves as an infinite source of water supply thus resulting in the least drawdown among three cases on the other end the no flow top boundary in case 3 serves as a barrier of water supply thus resulting in the greatest drawdown among three cases it is interesting to see that the drawdown in the pumped and unpumped aquifer for case 3 is almost the same as that in neuman and witherspoon 1969 but drawdown in the middle layer for case 3 deviates considerably from that of neuman and witherspoon 1969 this indicates that the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 can be used to describe drawdowns in the upper and lower aquifers in this three layer aquifer system with a no flux top boundary however it fails to describe the drawdown in the middle layer particularly during the late time additionally the late time drawdown in the three layer aquifer system is shown in fig 4 b it can be seen that the pumping induced influence area for case 1 is larger than that for case 2 and smaller than that for case 3 which is consistent with the drawdown characteristics shown in fig 4 a the drawdowns in the two aquifers and the middle layer approach the same value e g zd 0 5 1 25 and 2 at rd 100 sd 0 44 when the distance from the pumping well is sufficiently large much larger than the thickness of the aquifer another phenomenon observed from fig 4 b is that the drawdowns in the two aquifers and the middle layer obtained by neuman and witherspoon 1969 agree with their counterparts of this study for case 3 when the radial distance from the pumping well is greater than the thickness of the pumped aquifer rd 1 this suggests that the flow direction in the middle layer can only be treated as vertical at the distance larger than the thickness of the pumped aquifer for case 3 in other words the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 is valid at rd 1 under the condition that the aquifer permeability is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that of the aquitard the middle layer and a no flux top boundary condition is presented if such conditions are not satisfied the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 will be less reliable finally fig 4 indicates that the choice of top boundary must be clarified especially when using the late time drawdown data to estimate hydraulic parameters of a multilayer aquifer system because the middle layer aquitard drawdown is influenced by the horizontal flow in that layer as discussed above fig 5 is produced to explore the effect of horizontal flow in the aquitard under different top boundaries on dimensionless middle layer drawdown at rd 0 1 induced by a partially penetrating pumping well ld 1 dd 0 5 note that the case of neglecting the horizontal flow in aquitard is also considered for the purpose of comparison in this figure it can be found that the visible aquitard drawdown appears at td 10 this is expected as the response of aquitard to pumping lags behind that of the pumped aquifer the aquitard drawdown for the case of ignoring the effect of horizontal flow is always large than the case of considering the horizontal flow and the discrepancy between these two cases become even more greater when a no flux top boundary rather than the constant head top boundary is used so in general the aquitard horizontal flow and the top boundary type play important roles in predicting the aquitard drawdown near a pumping well and their effects cannot be neglected if the aquitard drawdown is of concern fig 6 illustrates the effect of the type of top boundary condition on drawdown response for different vertical positions at a given radial distance rd 0 1 induced by a partially penetrating well with different pumping times td 100 102 and 105 one can find that the drawdowns along the zd direction for different cases agree with each other when td 100 and 102 but the differences among them are obvious at a larger pumping time of td 105 this shows that the type of the top boundary can affect the drawdown characteristics for locations from the bottom of the pumped aquifer to the top of the unpumped aquifer when the pumping time is sufficiently long thus one should confirm the type of top boundary as well as the piezometer location r and z when using the drawdown data to estimate the hydraulic parameters of aquifers and aquitard 3 3 effect of the thickness of unpumped aquifer and aquitard first of all it should be noted that case 1 is taken an example for illustration in this section one can also conduct similar analysis for case 2 and case 3 if necessary fig 7 demonstrates the dimensionless drawdown response induced by a partially penetrating well ld 1 dd 0 5 in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 in the aquitard zd 1 2 and in the unpumped aquifer zd 1 6 at rd 0 1 for different unpumped aquifer thickness bd 3 bd 3 bd 2 while the thicknesses of the pumped aquifer and the aquitard remain fixed note that the case of no leakage or an impermeable aquitard is considered as well in this figure for the sake of comparison the effect of the thickness of the unpumped aquifer on drawdown does not appear at the early and intermediate pumping times however its effect is significant at late pumping time and a smaller bd 3 means that the water stored in the unpumped aquifer is also smaller leading to a larger drawdown as shown in the figure fig 8 illustrates the dimensionless drawdown characteristics due to a partially penetrating well ld 1 dd 0 5 in the pumped aquifer zd 0 8 in the aquitard zd 1 05 and in the unpumped aquifer at rd 0 1 for different aquitard thicknesses bd 2 bd 2 1 while the thicknesses of the two aquifers remain fixed it should be mentioned that the vertical position of the piezometer in the unpumped aquifer is always set at one meter above the unpumped aquifer aquitard interface no matter what the thickness of aquitard is and the no leakage case is also taken into account as a reference of comparison the type curves of dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless time are affected by the change of the thickness of aquitard at the intermediate and late times especially in the pumped aquifer and the aquitard one can see that a thicker aquitard indicates a greater aquitard storage thus a smaller drawdown in the pumped aquifer and the aquitard see fig 8 the drawdown in the unpumped aquifer is influenced by a thinner aquitard quicker resulting in a larger drawdown in the unpumped aquifer figs 7 and 8 show that the effect of leakage from aquitard on the pumped aquifer drawdown is significant when compared to the no leakage case 3 4 effect of anisotropy fig 9 depicts the dimensionless drawdown response in the anisotropic pumped and unpumped aquifer zd 0 8 and 1 6 for different anisotropy ratios kd kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 kd 3 kz 3 kr 3 and in the isotropic aquitard zd 1 1 at rd 0 1 a number of interesting observations can be made first it can be found in this figure that drawdowns in the aquitard and the two aquifers are significantly influenced by the aquifer anisotropy during the whole pumping periods second a larger aquifer anisotropy signifies stronger vertical flow in the aquifer leading to less water released from the pumped aquifer so a smaller drawdown in the pumped aquifer as well third the drawdown characteristics in the aquitard however is quite different from that of the pumped aquifer as vertical flow plays a stronger role with a larger anisotropy the influence of pumping will propagate vertically to the aquitard earlier resulting in an earlier release of water from the aquitard storage to supply the pumped aquifer thus an earlier response of drawdown in the aquitard as evident from fig 9 fourth when pumping keeps going on the drawdown in the aquitard will eventually become smaller for a larger aquifer anisotropy at late time similar to that in the pumped aquifer because of the stronger overall vertical flow in the system the response of the unpumped aquifer functions similarly to that of the pumped aquifer in general the aquifer anisotropy plays a very important role in determining the characteristics of drawdown in any layers of the whole aquifer system fig 10 shows the drawdown responses in an isotropic aquifers kz 1 kr 1 kz 3 kr 3 10 4 m s and zd 0 8 and 1 6 and an anisotropic aquitard zd 1 1 for different aquitard anisotropy ratios kd 2 at rd 0 1 with a partially penetrating well ld 1 0 and dd 0 5 note that the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is fixed in fig 10 a while in contrast the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is fixed in fig 10 b the case of an isotropic aquitard is included as well in this figure for comparison one can clearly see from fig 10 a that the change of kr 2 has no influence on the drawdowns in the lower pumped layer and upper unpumped layer at the whole pumping time if kr 2 kz 2 however if kr 2 is greater than kz 2 the change of kr 2 clearly affects the drawdowns in both aquifers during the intermediate and late pumping periods as shown in fig 10 a it can be found from fig 10 b that drawdowns in all three layers have been significantly influenced by the change of kz 2 a larger kz 2 implies that more leakage will be induced across the aquitard leading to a smaller drawdown in the pumped lower aquifer and a larger drawdown in the unpumped upper aquifer the findings from fig 10 once again emphasize that both the horizontal and vertical flows in the aquitard are generally not negligible for predicting drawdowns around the pumping well in this three layer aquifer system 3 5 the effect of delayed gravity drainage to investigate the effect of delayed gravity drainage on drawdown induced by a partially penetrating pumping well fig 11 is depicted to show the dimensionless drawdown response in the unpumped aquifer zd 1 6 aquitard zd 1 2 and pumped aquifer zd 0 8 for different values of dimensionless parameter γ at rd 0 1 it should be mentioned that the change of γ can reflect the dgd effect moench 1995 the case of neuman 1974 with the igd effect γ is also considered in this figure for the purpose of comparison additionally the pumped aquifer without leakage hantush 1964 is taken into account as well one can see that the effect of dgd is mainly significant at intermediate time and a larger γ or α indicates that water from the unsaturated zone is drained more quickly thus a larger drawdown can be found in fig 11 in addition the effect of delayed drainage on the drawdown response in the aquitard is less apparent than that in the upper unpumped aquifer and more apparent than that in the lower pumped aquifer 3 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is frequently employed to evaluate how various parameters would affect the drawdown kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 sedghi et al 2018 feng and zhan 2019 sensitivity analysis sa is commonly classified as local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa the former method can change one parameter value in each time and evaluate the local effect of individual parameters while the latter method can consider the joint effect of various parameters song et al 2015 the gsa is widely used at the field regional scale in hydrology e g rajabi and ketabchi 2017 janetti et al 2019 reinecke et al 2019 while lsa is easy to operate and interpret and has relatively low computational cost and no self verification compared with the gsa method song et al 2015 reinecke et al 2019 so it is still popular in well hydraulics studies e g huang et al 2019 lin et al 2019 lin et al 2020 zhu and wen 2020 accordingly the normalized sensitivity analysis is carried out in this study which can be written as huang and yeh 2007 38 x i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j where x i j is the normalized sensitivity value for the jth parameter pj at the ith time oi denotes the drawdown response and the value of the small increment δpj equals to 10 2 pj herein note that the absolute values of x i j is used to investigate the degree of sensitivity of drawdown around pumping well to different parameters the default parameter values are given as kr 1 2 10 4 m s kz 1 10 4 m s ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 b 1 20 m kr 2 2 10 6 m s kz 2 10 6 m s ss 2 10 3 m 1 b 2 30 m kr 3 2 10 4 m s kz 3 10 4 m s ss 3 2 10 5 m 1 b 3 50 m sy 0 2 1 α 103 s r 2 m l 15 m d 5 m z 10 m 25 m and 40 m one can see that the well screen is located in the middle part of the pumped aquifer and the drawdown responses are respectively observed at the middle of the lower pumped aquifer sd 1 the middle aquitard sd 2 and the upper unpumped aquifer sd 3 fig 12 mainly illustrate the sensitivity of drawdown of the lower pumped aquifer for case 1 to the pumped aquifer parameters b 1 kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 the aquitard parameters b 2 kr 2 kz 2 ss 2 and the upper unpumped aquifer parameters b 3 kr 3 kz 3 ss 3 sy α because the previous studies e g feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 have shown that the drawdown is sensitive to the change of well configuration parameters of l and d at the entire pumping time thus the sensitivity analysis of well configuration parameters is not repeated in this study from fig 12 one can find that the effect of the relative change of ss 1 on sd 1 increases gradually as pumping time goes by and decreases gradually until disappears near td 102 after reached the peak near td 10 2 the change of kz 1 on sd 1 increases obviously with pumping time arrives at the peak value near td 5 and maintain the maximum for the rest of pumping time fig 11 also indicates that the effects of kz 2 and ss 2 on sd 1 are minor in the period 1 td 103 and their sensitivities are the same and smaller than that to kz 2 at the late pumping time e g td 105 sd 1 is very sensitive to the change of kr 1 and bz 1 is moderately sensitive to the variation of kz 1 kr 3 and b 3 for case 1 and is slightly sensitive to the variation of kz 2 b 2 and sy for case 1 finally it is can be found that the changes of kz 3 ss 3 and α on sd 1 are rather minor as for the sensitivity analysis of drawdown in aquitard sd 2 and upper aquifer sd 3 one can see more details in supplementary materials 4 application of solutions it is worth mentioning that the newly obtained solution can also serve the following purposes first it can be employed to predict the pumping induced drawdown at any position with an observation well or piezometer with no restrictions on hydraulic parameters for each layer and well configuration parameter such as the hydraulic conductivity in radial and vertical directions the storability and thickness of each layer and the well screen length and location in the pumped layer second it can be utilized to explore the effects of aquitard storage and well partial penetration on the drawdown for different cases third it can be employed to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the three layer aquifer system what is more the developed solutions provide a great potential application value in the area of geothermal engineering geological or geotechnical engineering if the solutions are used for parameter estimation in a three layer aquifer system such as an aquifer aquitard aquifer system the following procedures are recommended firstly the well screen length and its location in the pumped aquifer should be known in advance so does the thickness of each layer and the type of the top boundary of the upper unpumped layer when using the late time drawdown data to estimate aquifer parameters secondly the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped aquifer is sensitive to ss 1 at early time thus it is more valuable to determine its value using the drawdown data collected in this stage additionally the intermediate and late time drawdowns in the pumped aquifer are suggested to estimate the values of kr 1 kz 1 thirdly the in situ data of drawdown in the aquitard at early time are more reliable to determine kz 2 and ss 2 and the drawdown data at intermediate time is recommended for estimating the value of kr 2 fourthly the late time drawdown data of the pumped aquifer or aquitard can be used to estimate the values of kr 3 and sy however the early time drawdown data of the unpumped aquifer is better used to determine the values of kz 3 the values of s 3 and α can also be determined using the late time drawdown data in the unpumped aquifer a point to note is that drawdown response of the anisotropic aquifer aquitard aquifer system is mainly analyzed in section 3 with the aim of comparing with available studies in fact the newly obtained solution has no constrains on the permeability of each layer thus it can be applied to a general three layer aquifer system under the condition of a moderate permeability contrast between two layers for example a three layer aquifer system with the permeability gradually increase from the upper unpumped layer to the lower pumped layer which is usually encountered in river terraces such as the first terrace of yangtze river in china there are also a few limitations for this study that should be addressed firstly the radius of the pumping well is assumed to be infinitesimal thus the effect of finite radius wellbore storage and skin effect have not been analyzed in this study secondly the well face boundary condition is assumed as a uniform flux type for simplicity rather than the integrated or mixed flux or other types thirdly the aquifer heterogeneity and variable layer thickness are not considered although the aquifer anisotropy has been considered fourthly the well pumping is limited to constant rate other types of pumping schemes such as constant drawdown pumping variable rate pumping etc have not been addressed fifthly the slope of the layers and the effect of multi pumping wells system are not taken into account as well these subjects are worthy of further investigation in details in the future in addition the newly obtained solutions are only applicable when the number of aquifer layers is less than or equal to three limiting their use for an aquifer system with more than three layers nevertheless when the number of aquifer layers is indeed less than or equal to three the proposed new solutions are generally straightforward stable and computationally efficient for computing the drawdowns or for parameter estimation avoiding the issues associated with constructing numerical solutions such as unknown numerical errors non convergency and even non uniqueness of solutions however when the assumptions used in this study are violated such as the three layer aquifer system having an irregular lateral boundary existence of a non uniform skin near the pumping well due to well development and or clogging and nonnegligible wellbore storage effect then the numerical solutions would be a better choice compared with analytical solutions under such circumstances 5 summary and conclusions a new semi analytical drawdown solution in dimensionless form for flow to a partially penetrating constant rate pumping well in an anisotropic three layer system is obtained by the method of laplace hankel transform considering the interface flow and different top boundary conditions it is worth noting that the commonly used top boundary condition of the water table with delayed gravity drainage boundary for case 1 constant head boundary for case 2 and no flow boundary for case 3 are taken into consideration the real time solutions are obtained by carrying out the inverse laplace and hankel transforms numerically the newly developed solutions are shown to unify some known solutions in a two layer or a single layer aquifer system with a fully or partially penetrating well which can be seen in table 2 the validity and correctness of the obtained solutions is verified by the comparison with the results of numerical method by comsol and the known analytical and semi analytical solutions for some special cases of this study the three dimensional drawdown response of a three layer aquifer system induced by a partially penetrating constant rate well in the lower aquifer are discussed based on the newly developed solutions the sensitivity of drawdown for case 1 to various aquifer parameters is explored the main findings of this study are as follows 1 the pumped aquifer drawdown for hantush 1967 with ignoring flow in aquitard is always larger that of neuman and witherspoon 1969 with assumption of horizontal flow in aquifer and vertical flow in aquitard and this study for case 2 during the entire pumping times and the drawdown obtained by neuman and witherspoon 1969 is larger than that of this study for case 2 at late time 2 the drawdowns in the pumped and unpumped aquifers for case 3 are almost the same as their counterparts in neuman and witherspoon 1969 however the aquitard drawdown computed by neuman and witherspoon 1969 has significant error at the whole pumping time the solution of neuman and witherspoon 1969 is valid to determine the drawdown at the distance larger than the thickness of the pumped aquifer at late time 3 the drawdowns in aquitard and two aquifers are significantly influenced by the aquifer anisotropy during the whole pumping periods the effect of horizontal flow in aquitard cannot be neglected when estimating hydraulic parameters of aquitard when using the drawdown data near the pumping well the effect of vertical flow on drawdown in the three layer system is significant over the entire pumping time additionally the effect of the delayed gravity drainage is mainly significant at intermediate times 4 the drawdown in the pumped aquifer sd 1 for case 1 is very sensitive to the change of kr 1 and bz 1 is moderately sensitive to the variation of kz 1 kr 3 and b 3 and is slightly sensitive to the variation of kz 2 b 2 and sy at late time credit authorship contribution statement qinggao

5587,with the implementation of the grain for green program artificial vegetation was introduced on the loess plateau which resulted in high soil water content swc depletion currently lack of soil water recharge is one of the most serious challenges on the loess plateau soil drying and wetting processes are critical for the sustainability of soil water recycling but this has not been well studied there is also a lack of physical definition of the upper bound swc of dried soil layers dsl in this study soil water dynamics the change of swc affected by precipitation and vegetation transpiration were studied under converted vegetation in situ swc measurements from the 0 5 m or 0 8 m deep profile over consecutive wet years from 2016 to 2018 with an average precipitation of 660 9 mm were analyzed to understand soil water depletion and restoration processes results showed distinct differences in soil water dynamics in the soil profiles and soil water balances under different vegetation types swc under continuous perennial alfalfa medicago sativa had greater fluctuations between 0 and 300 cm than below 300 cm and a dsl was observed below 300 cm after converting from alfalfa to soybean glycine max swc increased greatly during the three wet years soil water storage s increased at an average rate of 35 8 mm year 1 m 1 within the top 500 cm of the soil profile average evapotranspiration et was 482 0 mm year 1 and maximum restoration depth of soil water extended to 660 cm however swc gradually decreased over time after replacing food crop with alfalfa s declined at an average rate of 21 4 mm year 1 m 1 within the top 500 cm of the soil profile average et was 680 4 mm year 1 and the maximum depth of soil water depletion extended to 360 cm these results suggest that swc in deep layers can be depleted and replenished quickly and the processes were dominated by vegetation types and precipitation taking vegetation types and soil texture into consideration the calculation of upper bound swc of dsl was redefined given the long term effects of high water demand from vegetation such as alfalfa on the soil water balance et of vegetation should be reduced through conversion to less water intensive vegetation types or biomass control i e reduced planting density appropriately in arid areas of the loess plateau keywords vegetation conversion soil water restoration water balance dried soil layer dsl water wind erosion crisscross region the chinese loess plateau 1 introduction soil water content swc is a vital element of terrestrial systems that can limit vegetation growth in semi arid regions gao and shao 2012 wang et al 2012a zhang et al 2016 since the initiation of the grain for green eco project in 1999 affected areas have experienced an increase in vegetation coverage and soil and water loss has declined due to the introduced artificial vegetation shao et al 2018 however artificial vegetation consumes high amounts of soil water deep in the soil profile and this has led to soil desiccation in semi arid and semi humid areas on the loess plateau and dried soil layers dsl have been widely observed shangguan 2007 shao et al 2018 wang et al 2011b wang et al 2009 the phenomenon of dsl formation is a phenomenon related to soil desiccation dsls form as a result of excessive soil water depletion from perennial plants below the average precipitation infiltration depth chen et al 2008 shao et al 2018 dried soil layers affect tree growth survival and natural regeneration and are a potential threat to plant succession and afforestation efforts wang et al 2010 deep dsls may also have other negative effects on the water cycle for example precipitation may not infiltrate deeply enough to recharge shallow groundwater or introduced vegetation may not survive during severe dry seasons previous studies have investigated factors that control regional scale distribution of dsls under forests meadows and agricultural fields that grow corn including field capacity bulk density slope gradient slope aspect capillary water content sand content altitude vegetation coverage and evaporation and they have analyzed the negative effects of dsl on ecosystems including poor vegetation growth induced degeneration of vegetation drying microclimate and degrading soil quality and the potential reasons for their formation including low precipitation high evaporation improper selection of vegetation types and high density of trees planted jia et al 2017 shangguan 2007 wang et al 2012b zhao et al 2007 however the occurrences of dsl have become increasingly common and are widely distributed throughout arid and semiarid regions around the world including russia southern australia eastern amazonia and china s loess plateau christina et al 2017 jipp et al 1998 robinson et al 2006 shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2007 soil water depletion under different vegetation was observed across south west western australia where within 7 years of planting eucalyptus roots reached at least 8 10 m to exploit soil water robinson et al 2006 on the loess plateau of china dsl depths have been known to exceeded 10 m cheng and liu 2014 shao et al 2018 wang et al 2008 soil water depletion depth of 7 year old alfalfa medicago sativa 23 year old caragana shrub and 23 year old pine forest were up to 15 5 m 22 4 m and 21 5 m respectively around the central loess plateau wang et al 2009 cheng and liu 2014 studied swc in the 0 15 m soil profile under four land uses and found that persistent dsls developed under perennial vegetation other studies in the liudaogou watershed showed that perennial alfalfa and caragana consumed swc within the top 6 m of a soil profile and a 40 cm thick dsl was observed under a 2 year old alfalfa and 4 year old caragana but the dsl extended to a depth of 580 cm under alfalfa and caragana after 7 and 8 years of growth respectively fan et al 2016 jia et al 2019 zhang and wang 2017 investigated soil water dynamics in apple orchards of various ages on the changwu tableland of the loess plateau and found that the most severe dsl occurred in the 19 year old apple orchard soil desiccation has been observed in almost all artificial forests shrub lands apple orchards and perennial alfalfa on the loess plateau chen et al 2008 wang et al 2011a zhang and wang 2017 to achieve sustainable use of soil water it is recommended that alfalfa only be cropped for less than eight consecutive years in areas where annual precipitation is 600 mm li and huang 2008 ren et al 2011 other studies have shown that natural restoration is a better option than artificial replanting with respect to maintaining the sustainability of water resources in arid and semi arid regions and the optimal land use in semi arid regions is grassland deng et al 2016 wang et al 2015 a large number of studies about the restoration of swc in dsls found that deep swc can be recharged in fallow land and unfertilized cropland cheng and liu 2014 huang and gallichand 2006 jia et al 2019 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2011a a previous study showed that the recovery depths under bare soil and soybean glycine max crop were greater than the observation depth 5 m after 5 years of monitoring in the liudaogou watershed fan et al 2016 resulting from many years of intensive cropping a persistent dsl has been found to form between 2 and 3 m depths in cropland which was fully replenished after one wet year liu et al 2010 a one dimensional simulation model shaw was used to evaluate soil water restoration in apple orchards in the gully region of the loess plateau and the simulation results showed that the average recovery time was 7 3 years for 0 3 m soil depth and an average of 13 7 years for the 0 10 m soil profile huang and gallichand 2006 there is little field data that simultaneously captures soil drying and wetting processes during the creation and reversal of dsls and having this data could help indicate whether dsls could be reduced or fully remedied there is a lack of a physical definition for the upper bound swc of dsls which is affected by soil texture and vegetation types in our study the soil water dynamics in the 0 5 or 0 8 m soil profile were observed under three combinations of vegetation types which included alfalfa to soybean perennial alfalfa and planted alfalfa following food crops from 2016 to 2018 in semi arid water wind erosion crisscross region soil water storage s of three treatments and the depth of soil water depletion and restoration were studied the objective of this study was to determine the rate and depth of soil water depletion and restoration in the observed soil profile depth following vegetation inter conversion a new method to calculate the upper bound swc of the dsl under associated vegetation types and soil texture factors is proposed the results of this study will improve our understanding of the importance of plant choice under dry land farming 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at shenmu erosion and environmental experimental station in the liudaogou watershed 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n altitude is 1094 1274 m and catchment area 6 9 km2 located in shenmu city shaanxi province china this location is in the water wind erosion crisscross region which is a transitional zone from the loess plateau to mu us desert and at the transitional zone from the loess hilly region of flowing water erosion to the ordos plateau the climate is semi arid continental monsoon and is characterized by severe changes in temperature and precipitation the winter is dry and droughts often occur in the spring which results in wind erosion and sandstorms in this area in contrast the summer is wet characterized by heavy precipitation and rainstorms which leads to water induced soil erosion the mean annual precipitation in the liudaogou watershed from 2003 to 2018 was 469 0 mm there were great differences in interannual precipitation ranging from 280 5 mm in 2005 to 704 3 mm in 2016 more than 85 of the total annual precipitation falls between may and october during this study total precipitation in 2016 2017 and 2018 was 704 3 mm 651 1 mm and 627 4 mm respectively fig 1 which is higher than mean annual precipitation therefore each year was considered a wet year the sum of the total precipitation in july and august were 426 7 mm in 2016 375 0 mm in 2017 and 375 3 mm in 2018 this accounted for 60 57 and 73 of the total precipitation in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c and mean annual evaporation is 785 4 mm the terrain is characterized by typical deep gullies and undulating slopes and hills 2 2 field experiment the trial had three treatments a soil water restoration treatment alfalfa to soybean a control check treatment ck with perennial alfalfa as the ck of restoration treatment and a soil water depletion treatment food crops to alfalfa in april 2016 three 10 year old alfalfa plots alfalfa planted in may 2007 on land with a slope of zero with 20 m2 5 m 4 m for each experimental plot were selected this treatment was planted with soybean after removing alfalfa ploughing and fertilizing prior to carrying out the soil water restoration experiment at the same time another three 10 year old alfalfa plots located 5 m from restoration treatment plots with the same conditions as described for the restoration treatment were selected as the ck treatment a 5 m wide buffer zone was planted with a mix of alfalfa and grass to prevent alfalfa in the ck treatment from absorbing swc under the soybean crop in restoration treatment a 5 m long aluminum tube was installed in the center of each plot in the restoration and ck treatments and after july 25 2018 the 5 m measuring tube was lengthened using an 8 m long aluminum tube to study soil water depletion processes farm land cultivated for 15 years with soybean or millet under typical local management were selected in april 2017 and three plots were set up the field had a slope less than 10 the shortest distance from the restoration treatment field is 561 m the three plots were planted with alfalfa and the whole plot of alfalfa was mowed in august and october each year each plot area was 80 m2 10 m 8 m an 8 m long aluminum tube was installed in the center of each plot for the depletion treatment the dominant soil type was loessial soil and each of the three fields had similar almost uniform soil texture initial conditions for each treatment are shown in table 1 and fig 2 2 3 soil water content measurements and calculations each of treatments has three replicate plots and 5 m or 8 m aluminum tube was installed installation holes were drilled manually and access tubes were installed vertically into soil profile soil water content cm3 cm 3 was measured periodically with neutron probes model cnc503b super energy nuclear technology ltd beijing china at 10 cm 0 100 cm or 20 cm 100 500 or 800 cm intervals measurements were taken in april july august and october 2016 in may july august september and october 2017 may june july august september and october 2018 the oven dry method was used to calibrate neutron probe readings s was calculated using the following equation 1 s i 1 n sw c i h i where s is the soil water storage mm the change in depth is hi 10 cm for the depth range of 0 100 cm and hi 20 cm for depth 100 cm i denotes the increment of profile depth and s was calculated over the depth range of 0 500 cm run off was never observed on the terraces due to the high infiltration rate of water in these soils there was no irrigation on any of the fields and no groundwater replenishment because the groundwater table is more than 50 m below the surface generally the observed maximum infiltration depth is 200 cm in the study area fan et al 2016 although the infiltration depth occasionally reached 660 cm in the restoration treatment deep percolation below 500 cm was ignored the differences value of s was calculated by equation 2 δ s s end s start where δs is the differences value of s between the beginning and the end of growing season mm s start and s end are the s at the beginning and the end of the growing season mm respectively the evapotranspiration mm et was calculated with the following water balance equation 3 et p δ s where p is precipitation mm because different treatments were compared at same measured date only measured data over the growing season were analyzed the impact of measured swc before or after precipitation on soil water depletion and restoration over the growing season were the same with different treatments soil water depletion and restoration rate were calculated using the following equations 4 r d s min s start t d 5 r r s end s start t d where r d is the depletion rate per year per meter mm year 1 m 1 r r is restoration rate per year per meter mm year 1 m 1 during the whole growing season s min is amount of s at times of high evapotranspiration during the growing season mm t is time year and d is soil depth m soil water depletion depth is the depth of soil water consumed by plants in the current year according to the swc curve measured at the beginning of the growing season and strong evapotranspiration curves during the growth season the corresponding depth of the cross over point of the two curves is the depletion depth and the corresponding curve was the depletion curve if two curves have no distinct cross over point the depletion depth exceeds measured depth soil water restoration depth is the precipitation infiltration depth in the current year under each vegetation type by comparing the measured swc curve at the beginning and end of the growth season the corresponding depth of the cross over point of the two curves is the restoration depth similarly if two curves have no distinct cross over point the restoration depth exceeds the measured depth fig s1 the upper bound swc of dsl was defined considering vegetation types and soil texture a dsl begins to form at a specified pressure head which was calculated as the median between wilting point pressure head and the lowest point of optimal pressure head for root water uptake according to root water stress response function van genuchten and nielsen 1985 feddes et al 1978 the specified pressure head represents the pressure head at which root water uptake is reduced by 50 and then swc can be calculated using the soil water retention curve root water uptake parameters of alfalfa and soybean were referenced from hydrus 1d 3 results 3 1 processes of soil water restoration and depletion the upper bound swc of dsl was calculated for two sites with different soil particle composition and different vegetation types the upper bound swc of dsl is represented with dashed lines in figs 3 and 4 mean upper bound swc of dsl was 0 102 cm3 cm 3 in the restoration treatment with soybean fig 3d f and 0 083 cm3 cm 3 with alfalfa in the ck treatment fig 3a c but was 0 137 cm3 cm 3 in 0 800 cm profile in the depletion treatment due to different soil textures fig 4 the distributions of swc changed over time and under different treatments swc of the restoration treatment increased over the three wet years compared with ck swc at 0 360 cm depth in the depletion treatment decreased from 2017 to 2018 swc dynamics of the ck treatment at 0 300 cm showed greater fluctuations than that at 300 500 cm especially in the 0 100 cm soil layer where swc varied between 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and 0 26 cm3 cm 3 there was a stable swc layer in the ck treatment in 300 500 cm which maintained a swc below 0 10 cm3 cm 3 0 06 0 10 cm3 cm 3 over time fig 3a c and 92 1 of the swc measurements were lower than the upper bound swc of a dsl 0 086 cm3 cm 3 average value in 300 500 cm the changes in swc were distinct after land use was converted following conversion from alfalfa to soybean land the dry soil profiles were recharged substantially the swc increased to nearly 0 21 cm3 cm 3 at 30 cm depth and at 180 220 cm depth and was 0 11 cm3 cm 3 at 300 cm soil depth and then swc in the 0 300 cm profile was higher than the upper bound swc of dsl by the end of the growing season in 2016 fig 3d by the end of the growing season in 2017 fig 3e swc was greater than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 at 30 50 cm and 160 260 cm and swc was up to 0 20 cm3 cm 3 at 500 cm depth in addition swc did not have a cross over point in the 400 500 cm soil layer therefore soil water infiltration depth exceeded the observation depth and swc at the end of the growing season was higher than the upper bound swc of dsl in the whole profile furthermore the observation depth was extended to 800 cm in july 2018 fig 3f the swc distribution indicated that the swc was greater than 0 15 cm3 cm 3 down to soil depths of 600 cm the swc of soybean was similar to that of ck at 660 cm therefore soil water restoration depth was 660 cm and the swc was almost higher than the dsl upper bound swc over the entire soil profile growing alfalfa after food crops in 2017 decreased swc fig 4 based on the fact that the swc at the beginning of the growing season mean value 0 24 cm3 cm 3 was near field capacity 0 26 cm3 cm 3 chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 and many crops and natural grasses did not cause deep dsl the deep swc under these vegetation types has little inter annual variability fang et al 2016 the changes in average swc ranged from 0 24 cm3 cm 3 to 0 20 cm3 cm 3 in the 0 200 cm soil layer below 200 cm swc did not decline in 2017 fig 4a in 2018 swc was close to the upper bound swc of a dsl in the 0 260 cm soil layer fig 4b at the same time swc in 0 360 cm was lower than the swc at the beginning of the growing season therefore growing alfalfa after food crops decreased swc and swc approached the upper bound swc of a dsl below 360 cm swc was stable compared to the beginning of the growing season in 2018 because of the small biomass of alfalfa in the first growing stage 3 2 temporal variation of s on depleting and restoring processes seasonal variation in the amount of stored water in the 500 cm deep profiles was evident from 2016 to 2018 the s of the restoration treatment increased compared with the ck treatment fig 5 from the beginning to the end of the growing season s increased by 62 7 from 431 5 mm to 702 1 mm in 2016 and increased by 24 5 from 755 7 mm to 941 0 mm in 2017 and increased by 10 3 from 789 0 mm to 869 9 mm in 2018 under the ck treatment s was stable on the contrary s in the depletion treatment constantly declined fig 5 by the end of september 2017 s declined from 1246 1 mm to 1213 4 mm however it increased slightly in october 2017 then s declined until june 2018 in july and august s increased due to high rainfall and then decreased as alfalfa biomass increased throughout the growing period the soil water balances differed between the three land use treatments the restoration treatment exhibited a large increase in δs compared with ck from 2016 to 2018 table 2 there was 592 1 mm year 1 of average et from the ck treatment which was higher than the restoration treatment 482 0 mm year 1 during the study period the average δs was 68 9 mm year 1 over the three year study for the ck treatment and 178 9 mm year 1 for the restoration treatment in contrast a net decrease in δs occurred under the depletion treatment that planted alfalfa following food crops from 2017 to 2018 table 2 alfalfa consumed all of the seasonal precipitation as well as an additional 41 1 mm year 1 of soil water 3 3 rate and depth of soil water depletion and restoration through the comparison of s depletion and restoration between the three treatments the rate of water increase in the restoration treatment was always higher than that in the ck treatment and the rate of water decrease was always highest in the depletion treatment table 3 for the ck treatment in 2016 the rate of soil water storage increased by 27 5 mm year 1 m 1 from the beginning to the end of the growing season which was higher than in 2017 8 0 mm year 1 m 1 and in 2018 5 8 mm year 1 m 1 for the restoration treatment the rate of soil water storage increased by 54 1 mm year 1 m 1 in 2016 but was lower in 2017 36 5 mm year 1 m 1 and 2018 16 2 mm year 1 m 1 however the rate of soil water decrease in the depletion treatment was 19 1 mm year 1 m 1 in 2017 and 23 6 mm year 1 m 1 in 2018 soil water content restoration and depletion processes occurred simultaneously under the ck treatment of perennial alfalfa the restoration depth 240 cm was greater than the depletion depth 200 cm in 2016 fig 6 until 2017 the restoration depth was 200 cm less than the depletion depth 300 cm in 2018 the restoration depth 200 cm was less than the depletion depth 280 cm for the restoration treatment with the conversion of alfalfa to soybean the restoration depth was greater than the depletion depth the restoration depth was down to 320 cm in 2016 and was deeper than the observation depth 500 cm in 2017 in 2018 after the observed depth was increased the restoration depth was down to 660 cm and the restoration processes were in progress for the depletion treatment with the alfalfa planted following food crop the depletion depth was 200 cm in 2017 and with the swc continually consumed the depletion depth was down to 360 cm at the end of the growth season in 2018 this occurred despite the two previous years being wetter than compared to the mean annual precipitation 4 discussion 4 1 formation of dsl dsls based on oure new index of dsl were found if high water requirements were planted the upper bound of dsl was defined as a soil layer with swc that results in root water uptake being reduced by 50 van genuchten and nielsen 1985 however dsl has also been defined in previous studies based on desiccated soil as a soil layer with a swc lower than 60 of field capacity chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012b the practicality of using this value should be discussed for different soil textures and vegetation types crops and drought tolerant vegetation have different root water uptake parameters according to the hydrus 1d model feddes et al 1978 lv et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2018 for example under the condition of dsl swc a crop may not be able to grow due to limited water uptake but drought tolerant vegetation may be able to grow our definition of dsl considers varied soil texture and vegetation types for example according to our definition for alfalfa the mean upper bound swc of dsl was 0 083 cm3 cm 3 in loessial soil fig 3 c and it was 0 137 cm3 cm 3 in old loessial soil fig 4 for loessial soil with the same texture it was 0 102 cm3 cm 3 and 0 097 cm3 cm 3 for soybean fig 3d f and corn respectively however according to previous definitions chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012b the upper bound swc of dsl was 0 156 cm3 cm 3 in loessial soil dsls can quickly form under vegetation with high water requirements with the implementation of the grain for green project the vegetation in the local study area has recovered gradually and soil erosion has been substantially reduced fan et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 however with an increase in vegetation coverage especially artificial vegetation the swc in the soil profile has decreased this quickly resulted in a dsl forming under vegetation with high water requirements wang et al 2010 reported that a dsl was formed 2 years after planting alfalfa and 3 years after planting caragana korshinskii in the liudaogou watershed where our experiments were conducted cheng and liu 2014 observed a dsl at a depth of 1 4 5 m under continuous alfalfa and the dsl continued to extend to a depth of 10 m by 3 years after planting in the semi arid changwu tableland region of the loess plateau where average annual precipitation is 579 mm deep stocks of soil water on the loess plateau can be buffered against seasonal and inter annual variation in rainfall however dsl occurrence indicated that the soil s buffering capacity has been lost the deep soil water is also an important resource in many tropical forests for example in eastern amazonia forests are well buffered against seasonal and interannual variations in rainfall christina et al 2017 however the seasonally dry forests in paragominas appears to be growing near the soil s buffering capacity in the severe dry years associated with el nino southern oscillation enso events jipp et al 1998 in this study deep rooted alfalfa depleted deep soil water in prior years and alfalfa biomass was controlled by rainfall a dsl formed in deep soil layer which still existed under perennial alfalfa and a dsl appears to be forming after conversion from food crops to alfalfa in consecutively wet years swc under the ck treatment was stable at 0 06 0 09 cm3 cm 3 at 300 500 cm lower than the upper bound swc of a dsl this indicates a dsl has formed at the same time swc was decreasing rapidly in the depletion treatment during two growing seasons fig 4 in the 100 360 cm soil layer the maximum reduction of swc was 24 5 by the end of the growing season in 2018 and was close to the upper bound swc of a dsl the speed of dsl formation was slower than the results of wang et al 2010 due to relatively abundant precipitation soil water depletion depth reached 360 cm within the two wet years and s declined at a rate of 8 2 mm year 1 m 1 even with the abundant precipitation in wet years 2017 651 1 mm and 2018 627 4 mm swc still declined this result is in accordance with previous studies cheng and liu 2014 wang et al 2010 the et of artificial alfalfa was nearly equal to or more than precipitation table 2 high evapotranspiration rates reduced precipitation replenishment to deep soil resulting in low swc in the soil profile liu and shao 2016 this illustrates that alfalfa could rapidly deplete deep soil water with increased in root length which is consistent with the conclusions of fan et al 2014 dsls generally developed under perennial vegetation even after removing the vegetation dsls can persist for several decades cheng and liu 2014 if the precipitation only infiltrates down to shallow soil layers the dsl will not disappear 4 2 δs and restoration of the dsl δs and precipitation infiltration depth differed when vegetation type was altered consistent with previous research chen et al 2008 yang et al 2014 jian et al 2015 becasue introduced vegetation depleted swc in deep soil yang et al 2014 swc in deep soil layers was lower than swc in the upper bounds of the dsl fig 3a c s of the ck treatment did not show large fluctuations within three wet years with an average of 526 7 mm fig 5 it indicated that swc in deep soil layer could not be replenished by precipitation under perennial high demand water vegetation within consecutive wet years the infiltration was obstructed by the existence of a dsl and alfalfa in the ck treatment consumed all the water added during rainfall under alfalfa converted to soybean s increased over three growth seasons by a total of 101 6 from 431 5 mm in april 2016 to 869 9 mm in october 2018 fig 5 because local food crops i e soybean have shallow roots and lower water demands fan et al 2016 extra water was able to infiltrate through the soil profile and s in deep soil layers could be recharged on the contrary s started to decrease slowly within two wet years s decreased by 14 0 from may in 2017 1246 1 mm to october in 2018 1071 2 mm fig 5 in the depletion treatment this can be attributed to planting alfalfa two years prior and the alfalfa growing at a low water consumption period during the two consecutive wet years it could be predicated that dsl would develop after alfalfa was grown at high water requirement stage as shown in the ck treatment abundant precipitation could replenish the swc of a dsl if evapotranspiration of vegetation was substantially reduced in this study soil water recharged down to 660 cm under soybean after alfalfa was removed during the continuously three wet years in 2016 2017 and 2018 with precipitation of 704 3 mm 651 1 mm and 627 4 mm respectively and by the end of those three years swc of the dsl was similar to the water content before planting alfalfa this indicated that the swc of dsl can quickly recover to pre dsl conditions and the recovery rate of swc in the dsl was 35 8 mm year 1 m 1 in the three wet years others have noted that the 3 m recovery time for a dsl was 7 3 years under a normal precipitation of 545 mm in the southern part of the loess plateau if apple trees were cut huang and gallichand 2006 food crops such as soybean were not an optimal choice on sloped land because soil erosion occurs on the slope wang et al 2018 which is contrary with the objective of grain for green consecutive years of high precipitation rarely happen in the semi arid region of the loess plateau to balance the sustainable use of soil water resources with precipitation it is important to consider plant species selection 4 3 measures for sustainable water management water resource sustainability and ecosystem perseverance should be considered when vegetation is restored especially in arid and semi arid regions soil water infiltration and root water uptake depth are greatly affected by introduced vegetation in semi arid regions fan et al 2016 selecting proper land use types and plant species is important especially where there is a lack of available water liu et al 2016 wang et al 2012c yang et al 2012 fan et al 2017 found rooting depth was highly sensitive to local soil profile water content determined by precipitation infiltration depth and groundwater table depth the root depth of shrubland and a mix of shrubland alfalfa shrubland orchard shrubland grassland have been reported to be up to 1800 cm 1550 cm 600 cm and 560 cm respectively wang et al 2015 deep roots of shrubs or trees can increase the volume of soil that could supply water in order to support high evapotranspiration asbjornsen et al 2008 reader et al 1993 c korshinskii and robinia pseudoacacia have been highly recommended for vegetation restoration in the anjiapo catchment which has an annual mean precipitation of 420 mm jian et al 2015 however c korshinskii and r pseudoacacia have been recognized as vegetation with high water demand jia et al 2017 deep rooted and high water consumption vegetation such as artificial alfalfa c korshinskii r pseudoacacia jia et al 2017 and p tabuliformis zhang et al 2015 occupied a large percentage around our study site and these species would further deplete s however these species should not be the primary choice in semi arid loess liang et al 2018 it is essential that the current vegetation recovery strategy be re evaluated with consideration to vegetation sustainability and soil water availability wang et al 2017 in addition zhang et al 2015 provided a reference guide for planting coverage for different precipitation regions according to many quantitative results and choosing reasonable planting densities based on different precipitation regions could also help to reduce et our study showed that swc of dsls can be quickly recovered fully if deep rooting plants are removed to avoid the formation of dsls in semi arid regions planting shallow rooted vegetation instead of deep rooted plants should be considered shallow rooted vegetation would improve soil and water conservation similar to natural restoration by succession deng et al 2016 jia and shao 2014 liu and shao 2016 wang et al 2015 and artificial grassland however a large proportion of natural grasslands have been greatly influenced by shrub encroachment li et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 and shrubs consume significantly more water than grass su and shangguan 2019 similarly woody plants and eastern redcedar juniperus virginiana have encroach into tallgrass prairie and this has led to greater soil water depletion in the 0 80 cm soil layer resulting in artificial encroachment becoming a threat to groundwater replenishment in dry sub humid regions acharya et al 2017 some areas with fertile soils were abandoned due to the low income for the farmers in mountain areas of europe and the western mediterranean hatna and bakker 2011 macdonald et al 2000 romerodíaz et al 2017 vegetation recovery after abandonment has been successful but high erosion and low soil quality were found under semiarid conditions romerodíaz et al 2017 compared with natural succession high diversity grassland artificially planted with c3 and c4 shallow rooted grass species on abandoned and degraded lands could reduce nitrate leaching reduce invasive plant species and increase underground biomass and carbon sequestration yang et al 2019 herbaceous vegetation with a relatively shallow effective rooting depth that replaces woody plants has been shown to improve biodiversity reduce erosion and increase deep drainage replenishing soil storage in southwest idaho where mean annual precipitation is 550 mm seyfried and wilcox 2006 williamson et al 2005 found that recharge capacity increased due to decreased transpiration rates that followed shrub removal in san dimas experimental forest which has a mean precipitation of 678 mm therefore proper land management is required regardless of the vegetation maybe shallow rooted grassland should be developed which can achieve ecological and economic development future research should explore which vegetation restoration efforts will achieve this goal in the water wind erosion crisscross region on the loess plateau 5 conclusions conversion of vegetation types along with precipitation impact s and infiltration depth after conversion from food crops into alfalfa s consistently decreased and the depletion depth consistently increased even during consecutive wet years on the contrary after conversion from perennial alfalfa into soybean the rate and depth of restoration continuously increased over time swc was restored at an average rate of 35 8 mm year 1 m 1 and the restoration depth was up to 660 cm in three wet years these results indicated that swc of dsl could be recovered with consecutive wet years and altering vegetation types between deep and shallow rooted vegetation could play an important role in soil water restoration and depletion the new standards to define a dsl include soil textures and vegetation types which may be used to more accurately judge soil water status under different vegetation furthermore vegetation conversion should be considered according to the swc of dsl credit authorship contribution statement jiamin ge formal analysis investigation data curation writing original draft writing review editing

5587,with the implementation of the grain for green program artificial vegetation was introduced on the loess plateau which resulted in high soil water content swc depletion currently lack of soil water recharge is one of the most serious challenges on the loess plateau soil drying and wetting processes are critical for the sustainability of soil water recycling but this has not been well studied there is also a lack of physical definition of the upper bound swc of dried soil layers dsl in this study soil water dynamics the change of swc affected by precipitation and vegetation transpiration were studied under converted vegetation in situ swc measurements from the 0 5 m or 0 8 m deep profile over consecutive wet years from 2016 to 2018 with an average precipitation of 660 9 mm were analyzed to understand soil water depletion and restoration processes results showed distinct differences in soil water dynamics in the soil profiles and soil water balances under different vegetation types swc under continuous perennial alfalfa medicago sativa had greater fluctuations between 0 and 300 cm than below 300 cm and a dsl was observed below 300 cm after converting from alfalfa to soybean glycine max swc increased greatly during the three wet years soil water storage s increased at an average rate of 35 8 mm year 1 m 1 within the top 500 cm of the soil profile average evapotranspiration et was 482 0 mm year 1 and maximum restoration depth of soil water extended to 660 cm however swc gradually decreased over time after replacing food crop with alfalfa s declined at an average rate of 21 4 mm year 1 m 1 within the top 500 cm of the soil profile average et was 680 4 mm year 1 and the maximum depth of soil water depletion extended to 360 cm these results suggest that swc in deep layers can be depleted and replenished quickly and the processes were dominated by vegetation types and precipitation taking vegetation types and soil texture into consideration the calculation of upper bound swc of dsl was redefined given the long term effects of high water demand from vegetation such as alfalfa on the soil water balance et of vegetation should be reduced through conversion to less water intensive vegetation types or biomass control i e reduced planting density appropriately in arid areas of the loess plateau keywords vegetation conversion soil water restoration water balance dried soil layer dsl water wind erosion crisscross region the chinese loess plateau 1 introduction soil water content swc is a vital element of terrestrial systems that can limit vegetation growth in semi arid regions gao and shao 2012 wang et al 2012a zhang et al 2016 since the initiation of the grain for green eco project in 1999 affected areas have experienced an increase in vegetation coverage and soil and water loss has declined due to the introduced artificial vegetation shao et al 2018 however artificial vegetation consumes high amounts of soil water deep in the soil profile and this has led to soil desiccation in semi arid and semi humid areas on the loess plateau and dried soil layers dsl have been widely observed shangguan 2007 shao et al 2018 wang et al 2011b wang et al 2009 the phenomenon of dsl formation is a phenomenon related to soil desiccation dsls form as a result of excessive soil water depletion from perennial plants below the average precipitation infiltration depth chen et al 2008 shao et al 2018 dried soil layers affect tree growth survival and natural regeneration and are a potential threat to plant succession and afforestation efforts wang et al 2010 deep dsls may also have other negative effects on the water cycle for example precipitation may not infiltrate deeply enough to recharge shallow groundwater or introduced vegetation may not survive during severe dry seasons previous studies have investigated factors that control regional scale distribution of dsls under forests meadows and agricultural fields that grow corn including field capacity bulk density slope gradient slope aspect capillary water content sand content altitude vegetation coverage and evaporation and they have analyzed the negative effects of dsl on ecosystems including poor vegetation growth induced degeneration of vegetation drying microclimate and degrading soil quality and the potential reasons for their formation including low precipitation high evaporation improper selection of vegetation types and high density of trees planted jia et al 2017 shangguan 2007 wang et al 2012b zhao et al 2007 however the occurrences of dsl have become increasingly common and are widely distributed throughout arid and semiarid regions around the world including russia southern australia eastern amazonia and china s loess plateau christina et al 2017 jipp et al 1998 robinson et al 2006 shangguan 2007 zhao et al 2007 soil water depletion under different vegetation was observed across south west western australia where within 7 years of planting eucalyptus roots reached at least 8 10 m to exploit soil water robinson et al 2006 on the loess plateau of china dsl depths have been known to exceeded 10 m cheng and liu 2014 shao et al 2018 wang et al 2008 soil water depletion depth of 7 year old alfalfa medicago sativa 23 year old caragana shrub and 23 year old pine forest were up to 15 5 m 22 4 m and 21 5 m respectively around the central loess plateau wang et al 2009 cheng and liu 2014 studied swc in the 0 15 m soil profile under four land uses and found that persistent dsls developed under perennial vegetation other studies in the liudaogou watershed showed that perennial alfalfa and caragana consumed swc within the top 6 m of a soil profile and a 40 cm thick dsl was observed under a 2 year old alfalfa and 4 year old caragana but the dsl extended to a depth of 580 cm under alfalfa and caragana after 7 and 8 years of growth respectively fan et al 2016 jia et al 2019 zhang and wang 2017 investigated soil water dynamics in apple orchards of various ages on the changwu tableland of the loess plateau and found that the most severe dsl occurred in the 19 year old apple orchard soil desiccation has been observed in almost all artificial forests shrub lands apple orchards and perennial alfalfa on the loess plateau chen et al 2008 wang et al 2011a zhang and wang 2017 to achieve sustainable use of soil water it is recommended that alfalfa only be cropped for less than eight consecutive years in areas where annual precipitation is 600 mm li and huang 2008 ren et al 2011 other studies have shown that natural restoration is a better option than artificial replanting with respect to maintaining the sustainability of water resources in arid and semi arid regions and the optimal land use in semi arid regions is grassland deng et al 2016 wang et al 2015 a large number of studies about the restoration of swc in dsls found that deep swc can be recharged in fallow land and unfertilized cropland cheng and liu 2014 huang and gallichand 2006 jia et al 2019 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2011a a previous study showed that the recovery depths under bare soil and soybean glycine max crop were greater than the observation depth 5 m after 5 years of monitoring in the liudaogou watershed fan et al 2016 resulting from many years of intensive cropping a persistent dsl has been found to form between 2 and 3 m depths in cropland which was fully replenished after one wet year liu et al 2010 a one dimensional simulation model shaw was used to evaluate soil water restoration in apple orchards in the gully region of the loess plateau and the simulation results showed that the average recovery time was 7 3 years for 0 3 m soil depth and an average of 13 7 years for the 0 10 m soil profile huang and gallichand 2006 there is little field data that simultaneously captures soil drying and wetting processes during the creation and reversal of dsls and having this data could help indicate whether dsls could be reduced or fully remedied there is a lack of a physical definition for the upper bound swc of dsls which is affected by soil texture and vegetation types in our study the soil water dynamics in the 0 5 or 0 8 m soil profile were observed under three combinations of vegetation types which included alfalfa to soybean perennial alfalfa and planted alfalfa following food crops from 2016 to 2018 in semi arid water wind erosion crisscross region soil water storage s of three treatments and the depth of soil water depletion and restoration were studied the objective of this study was to determine the rate and depth of soil water depletion and restoration in the observed soil profile depth following vegetation inter conversion a new method to calculate the upper bound swc of the dsl under associated vegetation types and soil texture factors is proposed the results of this study will improve our understanding of the importance of plant choice under dry land farming 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at shenmu erosion and environmental experimental station in the liudaogou watershed 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n altitude is 1094 1274 m and catchment area 6 9 km2 located in shenmu city shaanxi province china this location is in the water wind erosion crisscross region which is a transitional zone from the loess plateau to mu us desert and at the transitional zone from the loess hilly region of flowing water erosion to the ordos plateau the climate is semi arid continental monsoon and is characterized by severe changes in temperature and precipitation the winter is dry and droughts often occur in the spring which results in wind erosion and sandstorms in this area in contrast the summer is wet characterized by heavy precipitation and rainstorms which leads to water induced soil erosion the mean annual precipitation in the liudaogou watershed from 2003 to 2018 was 469 0 mm there were great differences in interannual precipitation ranging from 280 5 mm in 2005 to 704 3 mm in 2016 more than 85 of the total annual precipitation falls between may and october during this study total precipitation in 2016 2017 and 2018 was 704 3 mm 651 1 mm and 627 4 mm respectively fig 1 which is higher than mean annual precipitation therefore each year was considered a wet year the sum of the total precipitation in july and august were 426 7 mm in 2016 375 0 mm in 2017 and 375 3 mm in 2018 this accounted for 60 57 and 73 of the total precipitation in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c and mean annual evaporation is 785 4 mm the terrain is characterized by typical deep gullies and undulating slopes and hills 2 2 field experiment the trial had three treatments a soil water restoration treatment alfalfa to soybean a control check treatment ck with perennial alfalfa as the ck of restoration treatment and a soil water depletion treatment food crops to alfalfa in april 2016 three 10 year old alfalfa plots alfalfa planted in may 2007 on land with a slope of zero with 20 m2 5 m 4 m for each experimental plot were selected this treatment was planted with soybean after removing alfalfa ploughing and fertilizing prior to carrying out the soil water restoration experiment at the same time another three 10 year old alfalfa plots located 5 m from restoration treatment plots with the same conditions as described for the restoration treatment were selected as the ck treatment a 5 m wide buffer zone was planted with a mix of alfalfa and grass to prevent alfalfa in the ck treatment from absorbing swc under the soybean crop in restoration treatment a 5 m long aluminum tube was installed in the center of each plot in the restoration and ck treatments and after july 25 2018 the 5 m measuring tube was lengthened using an 8 m long aluminum tube to study soil water depletion processes farm land cultivated for 15 years with soybean or millet under typical local management were selected in april 2017 and three plots were set up the field had a slope less than 10 the shortest distance from the restoration treatment field is 561 m the three plots were planted with alfalfa and the whole plot of alfalfa was mowed in august and october each year each plot area was 80 m2 10 m 8 m an 8 m long aluminum tube was installed in the center of each plot for the depletion treatment the dominant soil type was loessial soil and each of the three fields had similar almost uniform soil texture initial conditions for each treatment are shown in table 1 and fig 2 2 3 soil water content measurements and calculations each of treatments has three replicate plots and 5 m or 8 m aluminum tube was installed installation holes were drilled manually and access tubes were installed vertically into soil profile soil water content cm3 cm 3 was measured periodically with neutron probes model cnc503b super energy nuclear technology ltd beijing china at 10 cm 0 100 cm or 20 cm 100 500 or 800 cm intervals measurements were taken in april july august and october 2016 in may july august september and october 2017 may june july august september and october 2018 the oven dry method was used to calibrate neutron probe readings s was calculated using the following equation 1 s i 1 n sw c i h i where s is the soil water storage mm the change in depth is hi 10 cm for the depth range of 0 100 cm and hi 20 cm for depth 100 cm i denotes the increment of profile depth and s was calculated over the depth range of 0 500 cm run off was never observed on the terraces due to the high infiltration rate of water in these soils there was no irrigation on any of the fields and no groundwater replenishment because the groundwater table is more than 50 m below the surface generally the observed maximum infiltration depth is 200 cm in the study area fan et al 2016 although the infiltration depth occasionally reached 660 cm in the restoration treatment deep percolation below 500 cm was ignored the differences value of s was calculated by equation 2 δ s s end s start where δs is the differences value of s between the beginning and the end of growing season mm s start and s end are the s at the beginning and the end of the growing season mm respectively the evapotranspiration mm et was calculated with the following water balance equation 3 et p δ s where p is precipitation mm because different treatments were compared at same measured date only measured data over the growing season were analyzed the impact of measured swc before or after precipitation on soil water depletion and restoration over the growing season were the same with different treatments soil water depletion and restoration rate were calculated using the following equations 4 r d s min s start t d 5 r r s end s start t d where r d is the depletion rate per year per meter mm year 1 m 1 r r is restoration rate per year per meter mm year 1 m 1 during the whole growing season s min is amount of s at times of high evapotranspiration during the growing season mm t is time year and d is soil depth m soil water depletion depth is the depth of soil water consumed by plants in the current year according to the swc curve measured at the beginning of the growing season and strong evapotranspiration curves during the growth season the corresponding depth of the cross over point of the two curves is the depletion depth and the corresponding curve was the depletion curve if two curves have no distinct cross over point the depletion depth exceeds measured depth soil water restoration depth is the precipitation infiltration depth in the current year under each vegetation type by comparing the measured swc curve at the beginning and end of the growth season the corresponding depth of the cross over point of the two curves is the restoration depth similarly if two curves have no distinct cross over point the restoration depth exceeds the measured depth fig s1 the upper bound swc of dsl was defined considering vegetation types and soil texture a dsl begins to form at a specified pressure head which was calculated as the median between wilting point pressure head and the lowest point of optimal pressure head for root water uptake according to root water stress response function van genuchten and nielsen 1985 feddes et al 1978 the specified pressure head represents the pressure head at which root water uptake is reduced by 50 and then swc can be calculated using the soil water retention curve root water uptake parameters of alfalfa and soybean were referenced from hydrus 1d 3 results 3 1 processes of soil water restoration and depletion the upper bound swc of dsl was calculated for two sites with different soil particle composition and different vegetation types the upper bound swc of dsl is represented with dashed lines in figs 3 and 4 mean upper bound swc of dsl was 0 102 cm3 cm 3 in the restoration treatment with soybean fig 3d f and 0 083 cm3 cm 3 with alfalfa in the ck treatment fig 3a c but was 0 137 cm3 cm 3 in 0 800 cm profile in the depletion treatment due to different soil textures fig 4 the distributions of swc changed over time and under different treatments swc of the restoration treatment increased over the three wet years compared with ck swc at 0 360 cm depth in the depletion treatment decreased from 2017 to 2018 swc dynamics of the ck treatment at 0 300 cm showed greater fluctuations than that at 300 500 cm especially in the 0 100 cm soil layer where swc varied between 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and 0 26 cm3 cm 3 there was a stable swc layer in the ck treatment in 300 500 cm which maintained a swc below 0 10 cm3 cm 3 0 06 0 10 cm3 cm 3 over time fig 3a c and 92 1 of the swc measurements were lower than the upper bound swc of a dsl 0 086 cm3 cm 3 average value in 300 500 cm the changes in swc were distinct after land use was converted following conversion from alfalfa to soybean land the dry soil profiles were recharged substantially the swc increased to nearly 0 21 cm3 cm 3 at 30 cm depth and at 180 220 cm depth and was 0 11 cm3 cm 3 at 300 cm soil depth and then swc in the 0 300 cm profile was higher than the upper bound swc of dsl by the end of the growing season in 2016 fig 3d by the end of the growing season in 2017 fig 3e swc was greater than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 at 30 50 cm and 160 260 cm and swc was up to 0 20 cm3 cm 3 at 500 cm depth in addition swc did not have a cross over point in the 400 500 cm soil layer therefore soil water infiltration depth exceeded the observation depth and swc at the end of the growing season was higher than the upper bound swc of dsl in the whole profile furthermore the observation depth was extended to 800 cm in july 2018 fig 3f the swc distribution indicated that the swc was greater than 0 15 cm3 cm 3 down to soil depths of 600 cm the swc of soybean was similar to that of ck at 660 cm therefore soil water restoration depth was 660 cm and the swc was almost higher than the dsl upper bound swc over the entire soil profile growing alfalfa after food crops in 2017 decreased swc fig 4 based on the fact that the swc at the beginning of the growing season mean value 0 24 cm3 cm 3 was near field capacity 0 26 cm3 cm 3 chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 and many crops and natural grasses did not cause deep dsl the deep swc under these vegetation types has little inter annual variability fang et al 2016 the changes in average swc ranged from 0 24 cm3 cm 3 to 0 20 cm3 cm 3 in the 0 200 cm soil layer below 200 cm swc did not decline in 2017 fig 4a in 2018 swc was close to the upper bound swc of a dsl in the 0 260 cm soil layer fig 4b at the same time swc in 0 360 cm was lower than the swc at the beginning of the growing season therefore growing alfalfa after food crops decreased swc and swc approached the upper bound swc of a dsl below 360 cm swc was stable compared to the beginning of the growing season in 2018 because of the small biomass of alfalfa in the first growing stage 3 2 temporal variation of s on depleting and restoring processes seasonal variation in the amount of stored water in the 500 cm deep profiles was evident from 2016 to 2018 the s of the restoration treatment increased compared with the ck treatment fig 5 from the beginning to the end of the growing season s increased by 62 7 from 431 5 mm to 702 1 mm in 2016 and increased by 24 5 from 755 7 mm to 941 0 mm in 2017 and increased by 10 3 from 789 0 mm to 869 9 mm in 2018 under the ck treatment s was stable on the contrary s in the depletion treatment constantly declined fig 5 by the end of september 2017 s declined from 1246 1 mm to 1213 4 mm however it increased slightly in october 2017 then s declined until june 2018 in july and august s increased due to high rainfall and then decreased as alfalfa biomass increased throughout the growing period the soil water balances differed between the three land use treatments the restoration treatment exhibited a large increase in δs compared with ck from 2016 to 2018 table 2 there was 592 1 mm year 1 of average et from the ck treatment which was higher than the restoration treatment 482 0 mm year 1 during the study period the average δs was 68 9 mm year 1 over the three year study for the ck treatment and 178 9 mm year 1 for the restoration treatment in contrast a net decrease in δs occurred under the depletion treatment that planted alfalfa following food crops from 2017 to 2018 table 2 alfalfa consumed all of the seasonal precipitation as well as an additional 41 1 mm year 1 of soil water 3 3 rate and depth of soil water depletion and restoration through the comparison of s depletion and restoration between the three treatments the rate of water increase in the restoration treatment was always higher than that in the ck treatment and the rate of water decrease was always highest in the depletion treatment table 3 for the ck treatment in 2016 the rate of soil water storage increased by 27 5 mm year 1 m 1 from the beginning to the end of the growing season which was higher than in 2017 8 0 mm year 1 m 1 and in 2018 5 8 mm year 1 m 1 for the restoration treatment the rate of soil water storage increased by 54 1 mm year 1 m 1 in 2016 but was lower in 2017 36 5 mm year 1 m 1 and 2018 16 2 mm year 1 m 1 however the rate of soil water decrease in the depletion treatment was 19 1 mm year 1 m 1 in 2017 and 23 6 mm year 1 m 1 in 2018 soil water content restoration and depletion processes occurred simultaneously under the ck treatment of perennial alfalfa the restoration depth 240 cm was greater than the depletion depth 200 cm in 2016 fig 6 until 2017 the restoration depth was 200 cm less than the depletion depth 300 cm in 2018 the restoration depth 200 cm was less than the depletion depth 280 cm for the restoration treatment with the conversion of alfalfa to soybean the restoration depth was greater than the depletion depth the restoration depth was down to 320 cm in 2016 and was deeper than the observation depth 500 cm in 2017 in 2018 after the observed depth was increased the restoration depth was down to 660 cm and the restoration processes were in progress for the depletion treatment with the alfalfa planted following food crop the depletion depth was 200 cm in 2017 and with the swc continually consumed the depletion depth was down to 360 cm at the end of the growth season in 2018 this occurred despite the two previous years being wetter than compared to the mean annual precipitation 4 discussion 4 1 formation of dsl dsls based on oure new index of dsl were found if high water requirements were planted the upper bound of dsl was defined as a soil layer with swc that results in root water uptake being reduced by 50 van genuchten and nielsen 1985 however dsl has also been defined in previous studies based on desiccated soil as a soil layer with a swc lower than 60 of field capacity chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012b the practicality of using this value should be discussed for different soil textures and vegetation types crops and drought tolerant vegetation have different root water uptake parameters according to the hydrus 1d model feddes et al 1978 lv et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2018 for example under the condition of dsl swc a crop may not be able to grow due to limited water uptake but drought tolerant vegetation may be able to grow our definition of dsl considers varied soil texture and vegetation types for example according to our definition for alfalfa the mean upper bound swc of dsl was 0 083 cm3 cm 3 in loessial soil fig 3 c and it was 0 137 cm3 cm 3 in old loessial soil fig 4 for loessial soil with the same texture it was 0 102 cm3 cm 3 and 0 097 cm3 cm 3 for soybean fig 3d f and corn respectively however according to previous definitions chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012b the upper bound swc of dsl was 0 156 cm3 cm 3 in loessial soil dsls can quickly form under vegetation with high water requirements with the implementation of the grain for green project the vegetation in the local study area has recovered gradually and soil erosion has been substantially reduced fan et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 however with an increase in vegetation coverage especially artificial vegetation the swc in the soil profile has decreased this quickly resulted in a dsl forming under vegetation with high water requirements wang et al 2010 reported that a dsl was formed 2 years after planting alfalfa and 3 years after planting caragana korshinskii in the liudaogou watershed where our experiments were conducted cheng and liu 2014 observed a dsl at a depth of 1 4 5 m under continuous alfalfa and the dsl continued to extend to a depth of 10 m by 3 years after planting in the semi arid changwu tableland region of the loess plateau where average annual precipitation is 579 mm deep stocks of soil water on the loess plateau can be buffered against seasonal and inter annual variation in rainfall however dsl occurrence indicated that the soil s buffering capacity has been lost the deep soil water is also an important resource in many tropical forests for example in eastern amazonia forests are well buffered against seasonal and interannual variations in rainfall christina et al 2017 however the seasonally dry forests in paragominas appears to be growing near the soil s buffering capacity in the severe dry years associated with el nino southern oscillation enso events jipp et al 1998 in this study deep rooted alfalfa depleted deep soil water in prior years and alfalfa biomass was controlled by rainfall a dsl formed in deep soil layer which still existed under perennial alfalfa and a dsl appears to be forming after conversion from food crops to alfalfa in consecutively wet years swc under the ck treatment was stable at 0 06 0 09 cm3 cm 3 at 300 500 cm lower than the upper bound swc of a dsl this indicates a dsl has formed at the same time swc was decreasing rapidly in the depletion treatment during two growing seasons fig 4 in the 100 360 cm soil layer the maximum reduction of swc was 24 5 by the end of the growing season in 2018 and was close to the upper bound swc of a dsl the speed of dsl formation was slower than the results of wang et al 2010 due to relatively abundant precipitation soil water depletion depth reached 360 cm within the two wet years and s declined at a rate of 8 2 mm year 1 m 1 even with the abundant precipitation in wet years 2017 651 1 mm and 2018 627 4 mm swc still declined this result is in accordance with previous studies cheng and liu 2014 wang et al 2010 the et of artificial alfalfa was nearly equal to or more than precipitation table 2 high evapotranspiration rates reduced precipitation replenishment to deep soil resulting in low swc in the soil profile liu and shao 2016 this illustrates that alfalfa could rapidly deplete deep soil water with increased in root length which is consistent with the conclusions of fan et al 2014 dsls generally developed under perennial vegetation even after removing the vegetation dsls can persist for several decades cheng and liu 2014 if the precipitation only infiltrates down to shallow soil layers the dsl will not disappear 4 2 δs and restoration of the dsl δs and precipitation infiltration depth differed when vegetation type was altered consistent with previous research chen et al 2008 yang et al 2014 jian et al 2015 becasue introduced vegetation depleted swc in deep soil yang et al 2014 swc in deep soil layers was lower than swc in the upper bounds of the dsl fig 3a c s of the ck treatment did not show large fluctuations within three wet years with an average of 526 7 mm fig 5 it indicated that swc in deep soil layer could not be replenished by precipitation under perennial high demand water vegetation within consecutive wet years the infiltration was obstructed by the existence of a dsl and alfalfa in the ck treatment consumed all the water added during rainfall under alfalfa converted to soybean s increased over three growth seasons by a total of 101 6 from 431 5 mm in april 2016 to 869 9 mm in october 2018 fig 5 because local food crops i e soybean have shallow roots and lower water demands fan et al 2016 extra water was able to infiltrate through the soil profile and s in deep soil layers could be recharged on the contrary s started to decrease slowly within two wet years s decreased by 14 0 from may in 2017 1246 1 mm to october in 2018 1071 2 mm fig 5 in the depletion treatment this can be attributed to planting alfalfa two years prior and the alfalfa growing at a low water consumption period during the two consecutive wet years it could be predicated that dsl would develop after alfalfa was grown at high water requirement stage as shown in the ck treatment abundant precipitation could replenish the swc of a dsl if evapotranspiration of vegetation was substantially reduced in this study soil water recharged down to 660 cm under soybean after alfalfa was removed during the continuously three wet years in 2016 2017 and 2018 with precipitation of 704 3 mm 651 1 mm and 627 4 mm respectively and by the end of those three years swc of the dsl was similar to the water content before planting alfalfa this indicated that the swc of dsl can quickly recover to pre dsl conditions and the recovery rate of swc in the dsl was 35 8 mm year 1 m 1 in the three wet years others have noted that the 3 m recovery time for a dsl was 7 3 years under a normal precipitation of 545 mm in the southern part of the loess plateau if apple trees were cut huang and gallichand 2006 food crops such as soybean were not an optimal choice on sloped land because soil erosion occurs on the slope wang et al 2018 which is contrary with the objective of grain for green consecutive years of high precipitation rarely happen in the semi arid region of the loess plateau to balance the sustainable use of soil water resources with precipitation it is important to consider plant species selection 4 3 measures for sustainable water management water resource sustainability and ecosystem perseverance should be considered when vegetation is restored especially in arid and semi arid regions soil water infiltration and root water uptake depth are greatly affected by introduced vegetation in semi arid regions fan et al 2016 selecting proper land use types and plant species is important especially where there is a lack of available water liu et al 2016 wang et al 2012c yang et al 2012 fan et al 2017 found rooting depth was highly sensitive to local soil profile water content determined by precipitation infiltration depth and groundwater table depth the root depth of shrubland and a mix of shrubland alfalfa shrubland orchard shrubland grassland have been reported to be up to 1800 cm 1550 cm 600 cm and 560 cm respectively wang et al 2015 deep roots of shrubs or trees can increase the volume of soil that could supply water in order to support high evapotranspiration asbjornsen et al 2008 reader et al 1993 c korshinskii and robinia pseudoacacia have been highly recommended for vegetation restoration in the anjiapo catchment which has an annual mean precipitation of 420 mm jian et al 2015 however c korshinskii and r pseudoacacia have been recognized as vegetation with high water demand jia et al 2017 deep rooted and high water consumption vegetation such as artificial alfalfa c korshinskii r pseudoacacia jia et al 2017 and p tabuliformis zhang et al 2015 occupied a large percentage around our study site and these species would further deplete s however these species should not be the primary choice in semi arid loess liang et al 2018 it is essential that the current vegetation recovery strategy be re evaluated with consideration to vegetation sustainability and soil water availability wang et al 2017 in addition zhang et al 2015 provided a reference guide for planting coverage for different precipitation regions according to many quantitative results and choosing reasonable planting densities based on different precipitation regions could also help to reduce et our study showed that swc of dsls can be quickly recovered fully if deep rooting plants are removed to avoid the formation of dsls in semi arid regions planting shallow rooted vegetation instead of deep rooted plants should be considered shallow rooted vegetation would improve soil and water conservation similar to natural restoration by succession deng et al 2016 jia and shao 2014 liu and shao 2016 wang et al 2015 and artificial grassland however a large proportion of natural grasslands have been greatly influenced by shrub encroachment li et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 and shrubs consume significantly more water than grass su and shangguan 2019 similarly woody plants and eastern redcedar juniperus virginiana have encroach into tallgrass prairie and this has led to greater soil water depletion in the 0 80 cm soil layer resulting in artificial encroachment becoming a threat to groundwater replenishment in dry sub humid regions acharya et al 2017 some areas with fertile soils were abandoned due to the low income for the farmers in mountain areas of europe and the western mediterranean hatna and bakker 2011 macdonald et al 2000 romerodíaz et al 2017 vegetation recovery after abandonment has been successful but high erosion and low soil quality were found under semiarid conditions romerodíaz et al 2017 compared with natural succession high diversity grassland artificially planted with c3 and c4 shallow rooted grass species on abandoned and degraded lands could reduce nitrate leaching reduce invasive plant species and increase underground biomass and carbon sequestration yang et al 2019 herbaceous vegetation with a relatively shallow effective rooting depth that replaces woody plants has been shown to improve biodiversity reduce erosion and increase deep drainage replenishing soil storage in southwest idaho where mean annual precipitation is 550 mm seyfried and wilcox 2006 williamson et al 2005 found that recharge capacity increased due to decreased transpiration rates that followed shrub removal in san dimas experimental forest which has a mean precipitation of 678 mm therefore proper land management is required regardless of the vegetation maybe shallow rooted grassland should be developed which can achieve ecological and economic development future research should explore which vegetation restoration efforts will achieve this goal in the water wind erosion crisscross region on the loess plateau 5 conclusions conversion of vegetation types along with precipitation impact s and infiltration depth after conversion from food crops into alfalfa s consistently decreased and the depletion depth consistently increased even during consecutive wet years on the contrary after conversion from perennial alfalfa into soybean the rate and depth of restoration continuously increased over time swc was restored at an average rate of 35 8 mm year 1 m 1 and the restoration depth was up to 660 cm in three wet years these results indicated that swc of dsl could be recovered with consecutive wet years and altering vegetation types between deep and shallow rooted vegetation could play an important role in soil water restoration and depletion the new standards to define a dsl include soil textures and vegetation types which may be used to more accurately judge soil water status under different vegetation furthermore vegetation conversion should be considered according to the swc of dsl credit authorship contribution statement jiamin ge formal analysis investigation data curation writing original draft writing review editing

5588,iodine rich groundwater is a cause for concern because it is harmful to human health and determining the sources of groundwater iodine in coastal urbanized areas is complicated this study aims to delineate the spatial distribution of groundwater iodide in various shallow and unconfined aquifers as well as in areas with different urbanization levels in the pearl river delta prd and to identify the origins of iodide rich 0 08 mg l groundwater in this region approximately 400 groundwater samples 10 surface water samples and 9 leachate samples were collected and a total of 17 chemicals were analyzed the result showed that iodide rich groundwater was present in 13 95 of shallow granular aquifers and 6 82 of shallow fissured aquifers however it was not present in karst aquifers in shallow granular aquifers the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in areas with different urbanization levels were similar on the other hand in shallow fissured aquifers iodide rich groundwater mostly appeared in urbanized areas and its proportion was more than three times that of non urbanized areas however it was not present in peri urban areas the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides and decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in sediments were likely the main sources of iodide rich groundwater in shallow granular aquifers urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage was also a significant source for iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers of urbanized areas in contrast the degradation of organic matter in carbonate rich rocks and urbanization accompanied by leakage of reductive sewage were most likely responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in shallow fissured aquifers the leakage of landfill leachate was also a significant source for iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of non urbanized areas keywords iodide groundwater granular aquifers fissured aquifers urbanized areas 1 introduction iodine is an essential micronutrient for humans however excessive ingestion of iodine can result in disorders of iodine excess laurberg et al 2010 for example iodine excess may increase the prevalence of thyroid enlargement and goiter iodine induced hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis and it may give rise to autoimmune thyroid diseases and or loss of intelligence world health organization who 2007 correspondingly the tolerable upper intake level for iodine recommended by the who and in china is 1000 μg day for adults who 2007 tang et al 2013 likewise intakes of up to 600 μg day in the european union and 1100 μg day in the united states are declared as tolerable for adults zimmermann et al 2008 iodine in the human body originates mainly from food and water excessive iodine intake is a concern in ten countries who 2007 pearce et al 2013 such as china and denmark because groundwater with a high concentration of iodine is often serves as drinking water voutchkova et al 2014a xue et al

of china have total iodine concentrations as high as 1 4 mg l 1 1 mg l and 4 1 mg l respectively tang et al 2013 li et al 2014 xue et al 2019 these iodine concentrations are significantly higher than the national standards of several countries for example the standards for iodine in the drinking water of russia and china are 0 125 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively reimann and birke 2010 xue et al 2019 however there are currently no iodine standards set by the united states or the who additionally the groundwater quality standard for iodide in china is 0 08 mg l as stated by the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china gaqsiqprc 2017 in the hydrogeochemical cycle iodine can be found in the stable inorganic forms of iodide and iodate as well as in various organic iodine compounds iodide and iodate tend to adsorb onto soils sediments with more organic matter yamaguchi et al 2010 iodide is the most mobile species in sediments owing to its low affinity to minerals hu et al 2005 redox and ph are two important parameters that control the geochemical behavior of iodine iodide is typically the dominant species of iodine in groundwater with reducing conditions tang et al 2013 li et al 2017 and it is sometimes the sole species in acidic and reductive groundwater lloyd et al 1982 iodine enrichment in groundwater results from desorption of iodine from sediments that are enhanced with an increase in ph because of the negative charges of the sediments kennedy et al 2011 reducing conditions are also favorable for iodine enrichment in groundwater because iodate and organic iodine are transformed to the more mobile iodide and the release of iodide accompanied by reductive dissolution metal oxy hydroxides occurs at the reducing conditions li et al 2013 elevated iodine concentrations in groundwater commonly originate naturally the decomposition of iodine containing organic matter as well as the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded metal oxy hydroxides in iodine rich sediments release soluble iodine into groundwater and are mainly responsible for the iodine rich groundwater in the datong basin north china plain and taiyuan basin of china tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2014 moreover voutchkova et al 2017 found three different explanations for elevated iodine concentrations in danish aquifers 1 leaching from soil enriched with iodine because of atmospheric deposition and proximity to the sea 2 influence from the marine origin of the aquifer sediment because of desorption of iodine from iodine enriched organic matter or minerals and 3 influence from residual saline water because of upward advective or and diffusive transport of iodine in addition anthropogenic sources may be responsible for the high concentrations of iodine in groundwater in some urbanized areas for instance the leakage of landfill leachate and industrial wastewater occurs during urbanization zhang et al 2020 furthermore iodide is one of the main pollutants in groundwater found near landfill sites and wastewater from some sources such as optoelectronic wastewater contain high concentrations of iodine kentjono et al 2010 han et al 2016 the pearl river delta prd is an area in china that was rapidly urbanized and the groundwater is an important water resource for drinking and domestic purposes in this area huang et al 2013 recently zhang et al 2019 reported the presence of iodide rich groundwater in the prd however the spatial distribution and origin of groundwater iodide in the prd both remain uncertain in particular distinct levels of urbanization have occurred within the prd however the effect of urbanization on the distribution of iodide rich groundwater in the prd has received little attention the present study aims firstly to delineate spatial distributions of groundwater iodide in various shallow aquifers and in areas with different urbanization levels in the prd and secondly to discuss the main origins of groundwater iodide in various shallow aquifers and in areas with different urbanization levels the effect of urbanization on the distribution of iodide rich groundwater is particularly highlighted the results will benefit the groundwater resource management of the prd and increase understanding of the fate of iodide in the complex aquifer systems in urbanized areas such as the prd 2 study area 2 1 hydrogeological and geological conditions the prd adjacent to the south china sea was formed as a result of the tibetan plateau uplift during the tertiary and quaternary periods quaternary deposits appear in the central and southern parts of the prd and arecomposedof two marine strata and two terrestrial strata huang et al 2018a the younger marine stratum is at an elevation above 20 m and the older marine stratum is located between 15 and 40 m fig 1 the younger terrestrial stratum may be sandy fluvial deposits or clayey silt the older terrestrial stratum is dominated by sand and gravel huang et al 2018b groundwater in the granular aquifers of these strata is recharged primarily by atmospheric precipitation and agricultural irrigation additionally seawater intrusion often occurs in granular aquifers near the south china sea guangdong hydrogeological second team ghst 1981 the prd is surrounded by hills to the east west and north and the maximum elevation of the hilly areas is 1210 m fissured aquifers exist in the hilly areas of the prd in which bedrocks e g limestone mudstone sandstone shale dolomite granite and gneiss ranging in age from cambrian to tertiary crop out fig s1 karst aquifers account for less than 10 of the total area and exist surrounding the prd plain the general direction of the regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd roughly follows the major river flow fig s2 it flows from fissured aquifers toward granular aquifers because the groundwater of granular aquifers in the vicinity of fissured aquifers exhibits the same hydrochemical facies ca hco3 as those of fissured aquifers huang et al 2018a finally note that some important data such as groundwater residence time related to redox conditions celle jeanton et al 2009 huneau et al 2011 and the distribution of marine sediments in the prd are not present in this study 2 2 characteristics of urbanization in the prd according to different urbanization levels the land use in the prd can be divided into three types namely urbanized areas ua peri urban areas pua and non urbanized areas nua huang et al 2018b the ua are associated with large scale construction land and characterized by dense populations 1500 people km2 many factories 20 number km2 and vast amounts of domestic sewage 20 tons km2 huang et al 2020 from 1988 to 2006 the ua in the prd increased to 6816 km2 which was more than two times that in 1988 fig s3 the pua are the epitaxial areas 2 km outside the ua and have less factories 5 number km2 and smaller populations 500 people km2 in comparison with those of the ua guangdong province statistical bureau gpsb 2007 the nua are the woodlands small villages less than1000 people and agricultural lands sun et al 2009 huang et al 2013 additionally landfills have been formed in the pua and nua during urbanization fig s3 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques in this study 399 groundwater samples 258 132 and 9 samples from granular fissured and karst aquifers respectively were collected once during the wet season july to october of 2006 and the sampling densities was approximately 30 50 samples and 5 10 samples for every 1000 km2 in the plains and hilly regions respectively all the wells chosen for groundwater sampling were commonly utilized for general purposes and their depths were typically less than 10 m unconfined aquifer to ensure that the groundwater samples were representative of the in situ conditions samples were collected after purging at least three borehole volumes groundwater samples were collected below the water table at a depth of 50 cm with a stainless steel sampler and then two 250 ml high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled similar to the groundwater sampling 9 leachate samples were collected below the water table at a depth of 10 cm from leachate tanks and 10 surface water samples were collected below the water table at a depth of 50 cm from rivers and or ditches fig 1 all the samples were filtered 1 2 μm membrane on site and stored at 4 c until the laboratory procedures could be performed the groundwater levels of 214 wells were also measured once during the sampling period using a dip meter seventeen chemical parameters of the waters were measured redox potential eh ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured on site using a multiparameter instrument wtw multi 340i set germany and the probes were calibrated utilizing appropriate standard solutions and or procedures prior to sampling the groundwater each day metals k na ca2 mg2 fe mn were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan the total dissolved solids tds and hco3 were measured by gravimetric and acid base titration methods respectively nh4 and other anions no3 so4 2 cl i were identified using ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10advp japan the chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by potassium dichromate titration to ensure data quality each sample was analyzed in triplicate sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks and all data were corrected for instrument drift the detection limits for the above chemical parameters are presented in table s1 supplementary material the relative errors of all parameters were less than 6 3 2 data processing and principal components analysis the data below the detection limits were substituted with zero when data of chemical parameters in waters were used for descriptive statistics and principal component analysis pca pca has proven itself as a powerful tool for analyzing high dimensional hydrochemical data sets huang et al 2014 as well as reducing a large number of variables to a small number of principal components pcs by linearly combining measurements made on the original variables davis 1986 this multi step approach has been applied successfully to extract related variables and infer the underlying natural and or anthropogenic processes that control the chemistry of groundwaters singh et al 2005 güler et al 2012 in this study pca was used to extract the pcs from groundwater chemical data sets that included 17 physico chemical variables and the units of these variables were mg l except for ph and eh mv log transformed data and a standardized data matrix were used in the pca to give each variable equal weight in the multivariate statistical analysis güler et al 2002 rotation of the pcs was conducted using the varimax method where kaiser criterion was used to determine the number of components pcs with eigenvalues 1 were retained for analyses the pca was performed separately on the iodide concentrations from the granular and fissured aquifers and the results of the kaiser meyer olkin and bartlett s tests showed significant difference between the correlation coefficient matrix and identity matrix and were suitable for the pca table s2 the terms strong moderate and weak as applied to pc loadings referred to the absolute loading values of 0 75 0 75 0 5 and 0 5 0 3 respectively huang et al 2018a the software spss version 23 0 spss inc chicago usa was used for the pca in this study 4 results 4 1 iodide concentrations in waters and landfill leachate of the prd the pourbaix diagram showed that i was the sole species of inorganic i in the shallow groundwater of the prd because of the low eh and ph values fig s4 consequently this study focused on the occurrence of i in the shallow groundwater of the prd as shown in table 1 the groundwater i concentration in the prd had a wide range 0 01 mg l 1 62 mg l in contrast the i concentration in the surface water of the prd had a narrow range 0 01 mg l 0 18 mg l table s3 note that the small number i e 10 of surface water samples could be the reason for a narrow range of i concentration in the surface water the mean concentrations of i in the surface water and groundwater were similar on the other hand the median mean and 75th percentile i concentrations in the landfill leachate of the prd were all more than two times as high as those of the surface water and groundwater table 1 table s3 this indicated that landfill leachate was more enriched with i in comparison with that of the groundwater and surface water in the prd 4 2 groundwater iodide concentrations in various aquifers the median concentrations of i in various shallow aquifers were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l indicating that more than half groundwater samples collected from various aquifers exhibited i concentrations lower than 0 01 mg l in this study the groundwater i concentration 0 08 mg l exceeded the groundwater quality standard of china gaqsiqprc 2017 and was identified as iodide rich groundwater as shown in table 1 iodide rich groundwater was present in 13 95 and 6 82 of the granular and fissured aquifers respectively however it was not present in the karst aquifers fig 2 similarly the mean and 75th percentile i concentrations in the granular and fissured aquifers were significantly higher than those in the karst aquifers therefore we will focus on the main origins of groundwater i in granular and fissured aquifers in the following sections 4 3 groundwater iodide concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels in shallow granular aquifers the differences in groundwater i concentrations i e mean values and 75th percentile between the various areas with different urbanization levels were not significant table 1 similarly the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the ua pua and nua were all similar table 1 indicating that the effect of urbanization on the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers could be insignificant on the other hand in shallow fissured aquifers the mean concentration of groundwater i in the ua was more than two times that of the pua and approximately five times that of the nua table 1 similarly the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the ua was significantly higher than those of the pua and nua fig 3 indicating that urbanization was probably an important factor influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers 4 4 hydrochemical characteristics and water level in groundwater with different levels of iodide the median values of the hydrochemical parameters in the groundwater with different levels of iodide are summarized in fig 4 in shallow granular aquifers the median concentrations of nh4 fe mn and cl in the groundwater increased gradually with an increase in i concentration indicating that iodide rich groundwater was commonly enriched with nh4 fe mn and cl iodide rich groundwater was typically characterized by a relatively reductive environment in the granular aquifers because of the decrease in the median do concentration and increase in the median cod concentration with an increase in i concentration in addition note that the median value of the groundwater level decreased gradually with an increase in i concentration in the granular aquifers on the other hand in the fissured aquifers iodide rich groundwater was generally enriched with tds and some major ions such as na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and no3 because the median concentrations of the tds and these major ions in the groundwater increased gradually with an increase in i concentration fig 4 similarly iodide rich groundwater was also present in relatively reductive environment in the fissured aquifers because of a decrease in the median do and eh values and an increase in the median cod value with an increase in i concentration hydrochemical characteristics in the granular aquifers in areas with different urbanization levels were further investigated because more than 70 of the iodide rich groundwater was present within granular aquifers iodide rich groundwater was enriched with na and cl regardless of the different urbanization level of an area because the median concentrations of na and cl increased gradually with an increase in i concentration fig 4 moreover iodide rich groundwater was also enriched with nh4 and fe in the ua and pua but not in the nua this was because the median concentrations of nh4 and fe in iodide rich groundwater in the ua and pua were significantly higher than those found in iodide moderate and iodide poor groundwaters fig 4 furthermore the iodide rich groundwater was also enriched with so4 2 and mn in the ua and pua respectively fig 4 4 5 principal components analysis in this study by applying the pca technique 17 variables were combined to produce four significant pcs which explained 66 22 and 75 05 of the variance in the hydrochemical data sets of the granular and fissured aquifers respectively table 2 the pc3 for granular aquifers was related to i specifically it had a strong positive loading 0 75 with nh4 moderate positive loadings 0 50 with cod i and fe a weak positive loading 0 30 with mn and a weak negative loading 0 30 with do the pc4 for fissured aquifers was also related to i specifically it demonstrated a strong positive loading with i and a moderate positive loading with nh4 table 2 5 discussion iodine rich groundwater is already presented in many coastal countries such as china japan denmark and argentina smedley et al 2002 li et al 2013 togo et al 2016 voutchkova et al 2014b xue et al 2019 similar to this study i was the dominant species of iodine in iodine rich groundwater in areas of skagen ishøj and stevns 2 in denmark as well as in areas of datong and the north china plain in china and it was the sole species of iodine in iodine rich groundwater in the horonobe area in japan table s4 the maximum concentration of the groundwater i in the prd was typically much higher than that of the aforementioned iodine rich groundwater areas such as skagen and ishøj in denmark la pampa in argentina and the north china plain in china on the other hand the median concentration of groundwater i in the prd was typically much lower than that of the aforementioned iodine rich groundwater areas such as skagen ishøj and stevns 2 in denmark horonobe in japan and the north china plain and datong in china table s4 5 1 origins of groundwater iodide in granular aquifers in coastal areas high levels of iodine in the groundwater of granular aquifers typically originate naturally from the leaching of iodine rich soils close to the sea iodine rich seawater intrusion and desorption of iodine rich organic matter or minerals in marine sediments voutchkova et al 2017 xue et al 2019 in this study the seawater intrusion occurred in the granular aquifers near the south china sea ghst 1981 indicating that the seawater could be a significant source of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers as seawater commonly enhances iodine zhang et al 2013 nevertheless one surface water sample collected from the pearl river estuary adjacent to the south china sea exhibited a low i concentration of 0 028 mg l and seawater from the southern region of the east china sea adjacent to the south china sea also exhibited low i concentrations of approximately 0 008 to 0 018 mg l wong and zhang 2003 these i concentrations were significantly lower than the groundwater quality standard threshold of china 0 08 mg l indicating that seawater from the south china sea should not be enriched with i furthermore the low proportion of iodide rich groundwater appeared in coastal areas where seawater intrusion occurs fig 2 for instance groundwater cl as an indicator of seawater intrusion was found in high concentrations in an area adjacent to the pearl river estuary however iodide rich groundwater was not present in this area fig s5 thus we determined that modern seawater intrusion was not an important factor influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers similarly a lower proportion of iodide rich groundwater appeared in coastal areas 5 km from the sea in comparison with that of areas further from the sea 5 km table s5 indicating that the leaching of iodine rich soils close to the sea was also not a major factor influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers on the other hand the pc3 of granular aquifers had strong to weak positive loadings with nh4 cod i fe and mn and a weak negative loading with do table 2 indicating that the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides and the decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in sediments were likely responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers on a regional scale tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2014 correspondingly abundant fe mn oxy hydroxides were found in quaternary sediments of the prd wang et al 2012 and fe mn oxy hydroxides have typically been considered the primary reservoirs for coastal sediment iodine because of their high adsorption capacities for iodine shetaya et al 2012 li et al 2017 moreover iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers appeared relatively reductive environment in comparison with that of iodide poor groundwater owing to the significantly higher median value of the cod and significantly lower median value of the do fig 4 thus under reducing conditions the release of soluble iodide from the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides in quaternary sediments of the prd was expected because of the negative loading with do and positive loadings with i fe and mn in the same pc of the granular aquifers table 2 in addition jiao et al 2010 reported that abnormally high nh4 concentrations in the granular aquifers of the prd originated mainly from the decomposition of nitrogen rich organic matter in the marine strata and the marine strata commonly enrich not only the nitrogen but also the iodine fuge and johnson 2015 therefore under reducing conditions the release of soluble iodide from the decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in the marine strata overlaid granular aquifers of the prd was also expected owing to the negative loading with do and positive loadings with nh4 cod and i in the same pc table 2 in contrast in the ua urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage could be a significant source for iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers because leakage of wastewater in the ua of the prd is common huang et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 and several surface water samples with high levels of i table s3 were collected from polluted rivers indicating that some wastewater in the prd enhances iodide content sun et al 2009 for example wastewater in an irrigation area of the prd was characterized by high levels of na cl so4 2 nh4 and fe huang et al 2011 and the iodide rich surface water in the prd also had significantly higher median concentrations of na cl so4 2 nh4 and fe in comparison with that of the iodide poor surface water table s6 correspondingly iodide rich groundwater in the granular aquifers of the ua was also characterized by high levels of these chemicals in comparison with that of the iodide poor 0 01 mg l groundwater fig 4 in addition two iodide rich surface water samples were located in the ua and nearby groundwater samples were also iodide rich figs 2 and 3 however the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in the granular aquifers of the ua and pua were similar to that of the proportion found in the nua table 1 in which wastewater leakage was scarce indicating that urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage was not the main origin for iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers moreover this was supported by evidence that the correlation r 0 06 p 0 1 between the depth of groundwater level and the groundwater i concentration in the granular aquifers of the ua was insignificant fig 5 the median values of the groundwater level in the granular aquifers of the ua did not appear to gradually increase with a decrease in i concentration fig 4 because the concentrations of groundwater contaminants commonly decreased with an increase in absolute values of the groundwater level when the groundwater contaminants originated from the surface of the ground i e wastewater leakage during urbanization zhang et al 2019 hou et al 2020 therefore urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage was considered an important source of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers but not the main one 5 2 origins of groundwater iodide in fissured aquifers unlike that of granular aquifers the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides was not a major factor influencing the groundwater i in fissured aquifers this was because fe mn and i were not in the same pc as fissured aquifers table 2 the pc4 of fissured aquifers showed positive loadings with i and nh4 table 2 indicating that the degradation of organic matter and leakage of reductive sewage could be responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers on a regional scale for example iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was mainly located in the devonian permian strata in which carbonate rich rocks such as mudstone and shale were common fig s6 and the carbonate rich rocks in the coastal areas were typically enriched with iodine rich and nitrogen rich organic matter fuge et al 1978 sun et al 2009 moreover nearly 80 of the iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was characterized by hco3 facies table s7 which indicated that iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was mainly present in carbonate rich sedimentary rocks because the degradation of iodine rich organic matter in sedimentary rocks results in the enrichment of iodine and hco3 in groundwater li et al 2017 furthermore the iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was characterized by a relatively reductive environment in comparison with that of iodide poor groundwater this was because the median eh and do values in the iodide poor groundwater were both approximately two times those found in the iodide rich groundwater fig 4 thus the decomposition of iodine rich and nitrogen rich organic matter in carbonate rich rocks under reducing conditions could be one of the main factors influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers in the prd on the other hand the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the nua was significantly less than that of the ua table 1 in which the leakage of reductive sewage during urbanization was common huang et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 additionally reductive sewage such as septic tank effluents and domestic sewage has typically been characterized by high levels of i and nh4 umezawa et al 2008 sun et al 2009 in addition all the iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the ua was collected from wells with a groundwater level of less than 1 5 m and in contrast this was not observed in wells with a groundwater level greater than 1 5 m fig 5 which indicated that groundwater i in fissured aquifers of the ua originated mainly from the surface of the ground i e sewage leakage during urbanization therefore urbanization accompanied by leakage of reductive sewage was also found to be one of the main origins for iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers in addition we observed that leakage of landfill leachate that resulted from urbanization was also an important source for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the nua in which landfills were common and typically lacked anti seepage measures sun et al 2009 huang et al 2014 for example in this study the maximum value of i in the landfill leachate of the prd was collected from the datianshan landfill in one of the nua in which an anti seepage measure was lacking fig s7 similarly a nearby groundwater sampling site showed iodide rich 0 086 mg l groundwater nonetheless leakage of landfill leachate was not the main origin for iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers because the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the nua and pua were significantly less than the proportion in the ua table 1 in which landfills were scarce sun et al 2009 6 conclusions in the prd iodide rich 0 08 mg l groundwater was present in 13 95 and 6 82 of shallow granular and shallow fissured aquifers respectively however it was not present in karst aquifers in shallow granular aquifers the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in various areas with different urbanization levels were similar in contrast the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the shallow fissured aquifers in the ua was more than three times that in the nua and it was not present in the pua in shallow granular aquifers the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides and the decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in sediments were the main origins for iodide rich groundwater wastewater leakage during urbanization was also a source however it was not the main source for iodide rich groundwater in shallow granular aquifers in the ua in contrast in shallow fissured aquifers the degradation of organic matter in carbonate rich rocks under reducing conditions as well as urbanization accompanied by the leakage of reductive sewage were most likely responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater moreover the leakage of landfill leachate as a result of from urbanization was another source however it was not the main source for iodide rich groundwater in shallow fissured aquifers in this study the pca results were quite clearly supportive of our inferences related to the main origins of groundwater iodide in the prd in the future an investigation of organic iodine and dissolved organic carbon in groundwater as well as the distribution of marine sediments in the prd should be conducted to identify more specific origins of

5588,iodine rich groundwater is a cause for concern because it is harmful to human health and determining the sources of groundwater iodine in coastal urbanized areas is complicated this study aims to delineate the spatial distribution of groundwater iodide in various shallow and unconfined aquifers as well as in areas with different urbanization levels in the pearl river delta prd and to identify the origins of iodide rich 0 08 mg l groundwater in this region approximately 400 groundwater samples 10 surface water samples and 9 leachate samples were collected and a total of 17 chemicals were analyzed the result showed that iodide rich groundwater was present in 13 95 of shallow granular aquifers and 6 82 of shallow fissured aquifers however it was not present in karst aquifers in shallow granular aquifers the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in areas with different urbanization levels were similar on the other hand in shallow fissured aquifers iodide rich groundwater mostly appeared in urbanized areas and its proportion was more than three times that of non urbanized areas however it was not present in peri urban areas the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides and decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in sediments were likely the main sources of iodide rich groundwater in shallow granular aquifers urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage was also a significant source for iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers of urbanized areas in contrast the degradation of organic matter in carbonate rich rocks and urbanization accompanied by leakage of reductive sewage were most likely responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in shallow fissured aquifers the leakage of landfill leachate was also a significant source for iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of non urbanized areas keywords iodide groundwater granular aquifers fissured aquifers urbanized areas 1 introduction iodine is an essential micronutrient for humans however excessive ingestion of iodine can result in disorders of iodine excess laurberg et al 2010 for example iodine excess may increase the prevalence of thyroid enlargement and goiter iodine induced hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis and it may give rise to autoimmune thyroid diseases and or loss of intelligence world health organization who 2007 correspondingly the tolerable upper intake level for iodine recommended by the who and in china is 1000 μg day for adults who 2007 tang et al 2013 likewise intakes of up to 600 μg day in the european union and 1100 μg day in the united states are declared as tolerable for adults zimmermann et al 2008 iodine in the human body originates mainly from food and water excessive iodine intake is a concern in ten countries who 2007 pearce et al 2013 such as china and denmark because groundwater with a high concentration of iodine is often serves as drinking water voutchkova et al 2014a xue et al 2019 for instance the groundwater in denmark has a total iodine concentration as high as 1 22 mg l voutchkova et al 2014a while the groundwater in the datong basin north china plain and taiyuan basin of china have total iodine concentrations as high as 1 4 mg l 1 1 mg l and 4 1 mg l respectively tang et al 2013 li et al 2014 xue et al 2019 these iodine concentrations are significantly higher than the national standards of several countries for example the standards for iodine in the drinking water of russia and china are 0 125 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively reimann and birke 2010 xue et al 2019 however there are currently no iodine standards set by the united states or the who additionally the groundwater quality standard for iodide in china is 0 08 mg l as stated by the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china gaqsiqprc 2017 in the hydrogeochemical cycle iodine can be found in the stable inorganic forms of

iodine in groundwater with reducing conditions tang et al 2013 li et al 2017 and it is sometimes the sole species in acidic and reductive groundwater lloyd et al 1982 iodine enrichment in groundwater results from desorption of iodine from sediments that are enhanced with an increase in ph because of the negative charges of the sediments kennedy et al 2011 reducing conditions are also favorable for iodine enrichment in groundwater because iodate and organic iodine are transformed to the more mobile iodide and the release of iodide accompanied by reductive dissolution metal oxy hydroxides occurs at the reducing conditions li et al 2013 elevated iodine concentrations in groundwater commonly originate naturally the decomposition of iodine containing organic matter as well as the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded metal oxy hydroxides in iodine rich sediments release soluble iodine into groundwater and are mainly responsible for the iodine rich groundwater in the datong basin north china plain and taiyuan basin of china tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2014 moreover voutchkova et al 2017 found three different explanations for elevated iodine concentrations in danish aquifers 1 leaching from soil enriched with iodine because of atmospheric deposition and proximity to the sea 2 influence from the marine origin of the aquifer sediment because of desorption of iodine from iodine enriched organic matter or minerals and 3 influence from residual saline water because of upward advective or and diffusive transport of iodine in addition anthropogenic sources may be responsible for the high concentrations of iodine in groundwater in some urbanized areas for instance the leakage of landfill leachate and industrial wastewater occurs during urbanization zhang et al 2020 furthermore iodide is one of the main pollutants in groundwater found near landfill sites and wastewater from some sources such as optoelectronic wastewater contain high concentrations of iodine kentjono et al 2010 han et al 2016 the pearl river delta prd is an area in china that was rapidly urbanized and the groundwater is an important water resource for drinking and domestic purposes in this area huang et al 2013 recently zhang et al 2019 reported the presence of iodide rich groundwater in the prd however the spatial distribution and origin of groundwater iodide in the prd both remain uncertain in particular distinct levels of urbanization have occurred within the prd however the effect of urbanization on the distribution of iodide rich groundwater in the prd has received little attention the present study aims firstly to delineate spatial distributions of groundwater iodide in various shallow aquifers and in areas with different urbanization levels in the prd and

groundwater is particularly highlighted the results will benefit the groundwater resource management of the prd and increase understanding of the fate of iodide in the complex aquifer systems in urbanized areas such as the prd 2 study area 2 1 hydrogeological and geological conditions the prd adjacent to the south china sea was formed as a result of the tibetan plateau uplift during the tertiary and quaternary periods quaternary deposits appear in the central and southern parts of the prd and arecomposedof two marine strata and two terrestrial strata huang et al 2018a the younger marine stratum is at an elevation above 20 m and the older marine stratum is located between 15 and 40 m fig 1 the younger terrestrial stratum may be sandy fluvial deposits or clayey silt the older terrestrial stratum is dominated by sand and gravel huang et al 2018b groundwater in the granular aquifers of these strata is recharged primarily by atmospheric precipitation and agricultural irrigation additionally seawater intrusion often occurs in granular aquifers near the south china sea guangdong hydrogeological second team ghst 1981 the prd is surrounded by hills to the east west and north and the maximum elevation of the hilly areas is 1210 m fissured aquifers exist in the hilly areas of the prd in which bedrocks e g limestone mudstone sandstone shale dolomite granite and gneiss ranging in age from cambrian to tertiary crop out fig s1 karst aquifers account for less than 10 of the total area and exist surrounding the prd plain the general direction of the regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd roughly follows the major river flow fig s2 it flows from fissured aquifers toward granular aquifers because the groundwater of granular aquifers in the vicinity of fissured aquifers exhibits the same hydrochemical facies ca hco3 as those of fissured aquifers huang et al 2018a finally note that some important data such as groundwater residence time related to redox conditions celle jeanton et al 2009 huneau et al 2011 and the distribution of marine sediments in the prd are not present in this study 2 2 characteristics of urbanization in the prd according to different urbanization levels the land use in the prd can be divided into three types namely urbanized areas ua peri urban areas pua and non urbanized areas nua huang et al 2018b the ua are associated with large scale construction land and characterized by dense populations 1500 people km2 many factories 20 number km2 and vast amounts of domestic sewage 20 tons km2 huang et al 2020 from 1988 to 2006 the ua in the prd increased to 6816 km2 which was more than two times that in 1988 fig s3 the pua are the epitaxial areas 2 km outside the ua and have less factories 5 number km2 and smaller populations 500 people km2 in comparison with those of the ua guangdong province statistical bureau gpsb 2007 the nua are the woodlands small villages less than1000 people and agricultural lands sun et al 2009 huang et al 2013 additionally landfills have been formed in the pua and nua during urbanization fig s3 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques in this study 399 groundwater samples 258 132 and 9 samples from granular fissured and karst aquifers respectively were collected once during the wet season july to october of 2006 and the sampling densities was approximately 30 50 samples and 5 10 samples for every 1000 km2 in the plains and hilly regions respectively all the wells chosen for groundwater sampling were commonly utilized for general purposes and their depths were typically less than 10 m unconfined aquifer to ensure that the groundwater samples were representative of the in situ conditions samples were collected after purging at least three borehole volumes groundwater samples were collected below the water table at a depth of 50 cm with a stainless steel sampler and then two 250 ml high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled similar to the groundwater sampling 9 leachate samples were collected below the water table at a depth of 10 cm from leachate tanks and 10 surface water samples were collected below the water table at a depth of 50 cm from rivers and or ditches fig 1 all the samples were filtered 1 2 μm membrane on site and stored at 4 c until the laboratory procedures could be performed the groundwater levels of 214 wells were also measured once during the sampling period using a dip meter seventeen chemical parameters of the waters were measured redox potential eh ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured on site using a multiparameter instrument wtw multi 340i set germany and the probes were calibrated utilizing appropriate standard solutions and or procedures prior to sampling the groundwater each day metals k na ca2 mg2 fe mn were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan the total dissolved solids tds and hco3 were measured by gravimetric and acid base titration methods respectively nh4 and other anions no3 so4 2 cl i were identified using ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10advp japan the chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by potassium dichromate titration to ensure data quality each sample was analyzed in triplicate sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks and all data were corrected for instrument drift the detection limits for the above chemical parameters are presented in table s1 supplementary material the relative errors of all parameters were less than 6 3 2 data processing and principal components analysis the data below the detection limits were substituted with zero when data of chemical parameters in waters were used for descriptive statistics and principal component analysis pca pca has proven itself as a powerful tool for analyzing high dimensional hydrochemical data sets huang et al 2014 as well as reducing a large number of variables to a small number of principal components pcs by linearly combining measurements made on the original variables davis 1986 this multi step approach has been applied successfully to extract related variables and infer the underlying natural and or anthropogenic processes that control the chemistry of groundwaters singh et al 2005 güler et al 2012 in this study pca was used to extract the pcs from groundwater chemical data sets that included 17 physico chemical variables and the units of these variables were mg l except for ph and eh mv log transformed data and a standardized data matrix were used in the pca to give each variable equal weight in the multivariate statistical analysis güler et al 2002 rotation of the pcs was conducted using the varimax method where kaiser criterion was used to determine the number of components pcs with eigenvalues 1 were retained for analyses the pca was performed separately on the iodide concentrations from the granular and fissured aquifers and the results of the kaiser meyer olkin and bartlett s tests showed significant difference between the correlation coefficient matrix and identity matrix and were suitable for the pca table s2 the terms strong moderate and weak as applied to pc loadings referred to the absolute loading values of 0 75 0 75 0 5 and 0 5 0 3 respectively huang et al 2018a the software spss version 23 0 spss inc chicago usa was used for the pca in this study 4 results 4 1 iodide concentrations in waters and landfill leachate of the prd the pourbaix diagram showed that i was the sole species of inorganic i in the shallow groundwater of the prd because of the low eh and ph values fig s4 consequently this study focused on the occurrence of i in the shallow groundwater of the prd as shown in table 1 the groundwater i concentration in the prd had a wide range 0 01 mg l 1 62 mg l in contrast the i concentration in the surface water of the prd had a narrow range 0 01 mg l 0 18 mg l table s3 note that the small number i e 10 of surface water samples could be the reason for a narrow range of i concentration in the surface water the mean concentrations of i in the surface water and groundwater were similar on the other hand the median mean and 75th percentile i concentrations in the landfill leachate of the prd were all more than two times as high as those of the surface water and groundwater table 1 table s3 this indicated that landfill leachate was more enriched with i in comparison with that of the groundwater and surface water in the prd 4 2 groundwater iodide concentrations in various aquifers the median concentrations of i in various shallow aquifers were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l indicating that more than half groundwater samples collected from various aquifers exhibited i concentrations lower than 0 01 mg l in this study the groundwater i concentration 0 08 mg l exceeded the groundwater quality standard of china gaqsiqprc 2017 and was identified as iodide rich groundwater as shown in table 1 iodide rich groundwater was present in 13 95 and 6 82 of the granular and fissured aquifers respectively however it was not present in the karst aquifers fig 2 similarly the mean and 75th percentile i concentrations in the granular and fissured aquifers were significantly higher than those in the karst aquifers therefore we will focus on the main origins of groundwater i in granular and fissured aquifers in the following sections 4 3 groundwater iodide concentrations in areas with different urbanization levels in shallow granular aquifers the differences in groundwater i concentrations i e mean values and 75th percentile between the various areas with different urbanization levels were not significant table 1 similarly the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the ua pua and nua were all similar table 1 indicating that the effect of urbanization on the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers could be insignificant on the other hand in shallow fissured aquifers the mean concentration of groundwater i in the ua was more than two times that of the pua and approximately five times that of the nua table 1 similarly the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the ua was significantly higher than those of the pua and nua fig 3 indicating that urbanization was probably an important factor influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers 4 4 hydrochemical characteristics and water level in groundwater with different levels of iodide the median values of the hydrochemical parameters in the groundwater with different levels of iodide are summarized in fig 4 in shallow granular aquifers the median concentrations of nh4 fe mn and cl in the groundwater increased gradually with an increase in i concentration indicating that iodide rich groundwater was commonly enriched with nh4 fe mn and cl iodide rich groundwater was typically characterized by a relatively reductive environment in the granular aquifers because of the decrease in the median do concentration and increase in the median cod concentration with an increase in i concentration in addition note that the median value of the groundwater level decreased gradually with an increase in i concentration in the granular aquifers on the other hand in the fissured aquifers iodide rich groundwater was generally enriched with tds and some major ions such as na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and no3 because the median concentrations of the tds and these major ions in the groundwater increased gradually with an increase in i concentration fig 4 similarly iodide rich groundwater was also present in relatively reductive environment in the fissured aquifers because of a decrease in the median do and eh values and an increase in the median cod value with an increase in i concentration hydrochemical characteristics in the granular aquifers in areas with different urbanization levels were further investigated because more than 70 of the iodide rich groundwater was present within granular aquifers iodide rich groundwater was enriched with na and cl regardless of the different urbanization level of an area because the median concentrations of na and cl increased gradually with an increase in i concentration fig 4 moreover iodide rich groundwater was also enriched with nh4 and fe in the ua and pua but not in the nua this was because the median concentrations of nh4 and fe in iodide rich groundwater in the ua and pua were significantly higher than those found in iodide moderate and iodide poor groundwaters fig 4 furthermore the iodide rich groundwater was also enriched with so4 2 and mn in the ua and pua respectively fig 4 4 5 principal components analysis in this study by applying the pca technique 17 variables were combined to produce four significant pcs which explained 66 22 and 75 05 of the variance in the hydrochemical data sets of the granular and fissured aquifers respectively table 2 the pc3 for granular aquifers was related to i specifically it had a strong positive loading 0 75 with nh4 moderate positive loadings 0 50 with cod i and fe a weak positive loading 0 30 with mn and a weak negative loading 0 30 with do the pc4 for fissured aquifers was also related to i specifically it demonstrated a strong positive loading with i and a moderate positive loading with nh4 table 2 5 discussion iodine rich groundwater is already presented in many coastal countries such as china japan denmark and argentina smedley et al 2002 li et al 2013 togo et al 2016 voutchkova et al 2014b xue et al 2019 similar to this study i was the dominant species of iodine in iodine rich groundwater in areas of skagen ishøj and stevns 2 in denmark as well as in areas of datong and the north china plain in china and it was the sole species of iodine in iodine rich groundwater in the horonobe area in japan table s4 the maximum concentration of the groundwater i in the prd was typically much higher than that of the aforementioned iodine rich groundwater areas such as skagen and ishøj in denmark la pampa in argentina and the north china plain in china on the other hand the median concentration of groundwater i in the prd was typically much lower than that of the aforementioned iodine rich groundwater areas such as skagen ishøj and stevns 2 in denmark horonobe in japan and the north china plain and datong in china table s4 5 1 origins of groundwater iodide in granular aquifers in coastal areas high levels of iodine in the groundwater of granular aquifers typically originate naturally from the leaching of iodine rich soils close to the sea iodine rich seawater intrusion and desorption of iodine rich organic matter or minerals in marine sediments voutchkova et al 2017 xue et al 2019 in this study the seawater intrusion occurred in the granular aquifers near the south china sea ghst 1981 indicating that the seawater could be a significant source of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers as seawater commonly enhances iodine zhang et al 2013 nevertheless one surface water sample collected from the pearl river estuary adjacent to the south china sea exhibited a low i concentration of 0 028 mg l and seawater from the southern region of the east china sea adjacent to the south china sea also exhibited low i concentrations of approximately 0 008 to 0 018 mg l wong and zhang 2003 these i concentrations were significantly lower than the groundwater quality standard threshold of china 0 08 mg l indicating that seawater from the south china sea should not be enriched with i furthermore the low proportion of iodide rich groundwater appeared in coastal areas where seawater intrusion occurs fig 2 for instance groundwater cl as an indicator of seawater intrusion was found in high concentrations in an area adjacent to the pearl river estuary however iodide rich groundwater was not present in this area fig s5 thus we determined that modern seawater intrusion was not an important factor influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers similarly a lower proportion of iodide rich groundwater appeared in coastal areas 5 km from the sea in comparison with that of areas further from the sea 5 km table s5 indicating that the leaching of iodine rich soils close to the sea was also not a major factor influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers on the other hand the pc3 of granular aquifers had strong to weak positive loadings with nh4 cod i fe and mn and a weak negative loading with do table 2 indicating that the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides and the decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in sediments were likely responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers on a regional scale tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2014 correspondingly abundant fe mn oxy hydroxides were found in quaternary sediments of the prd wang et al 2012 and fe mn oxy hydroxides have typically been considered the primary reservoirs for coastal sediment iodine because of their high adsorption capacities for iodine shetaya et al 2012 li et al 2017 moreover iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers appeared relatively reductive environment in comparison with that of iodide poor groundwater owing to the significantly higher median value of the cod and significantly lower median value of the do fig 4 thus under reducing conditions the release of soluble iodide from the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides in quaternary sediments of the prd was expected because of the negative loading with do and positive loadings with i fe and mn in the same pc of the granular aquifers table 2 in addition jiao et al 2010 reported that abnormally high nh4 concentrations in the granular aquifers of the prd originated mainly from the decomposition of nitrogen rich organic matter in the marine strata and the marine strata commonly enrich not only the nitrogen but also the iodine fuge and johnson 2015 therefore under reducing conditions the release of soluble iodide from the decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in the marine strata overlaid granular aquifers of the prd was also expected owing to the negative loading with do and positive loadings with nh4 cod and i in the same pc table 2 in contrast in the ua urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage could be a significant source for iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers because leakage of wastewater in the ua of the prd is common huang et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 and several surface water samples with high levels of i table s3 were collected from polluted rivers indicating that some wastewater in the prd enhances iodide content sun et al 2009 for example wastewater in an irrigation area of the prd was characterized by high levels of na cl so4 2 nh4 and fe huang et al 2011 and the iodide rich surface water in the prd also had significantly higher median concentrations of na cl so4 2 nh4 and fe in comparison with that of the iodide poor surface water table s6 correspondingly iodide rich groundwater in the granular aquifers of the ua was also characterized by high levels of these chemicals in comparison with that of the iodide poor 0 01 mg l groundwater fig 4 in addition two iodide rich surface water samples were located in the ua and nearby groundwater samples were also iodide rich figs 2 and 3 however the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in the granular aquifers of the ua and pua were similar to that of the proportion found in the nua table 1 in which wastewater leakage was scarce indicating that urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage was not the main origin for iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers moreover this was supported by evidence that the correlation r 0 06 p 0 1 between the depth of groundwater level and the groundwater i concentration in the granular aquifers of the ua was insignificant fig 5 the median values of the groundwater level in the granular aquifers of the ua did not appear to gradually increase with a decrease in i concentration fig 4 because the concentrations of groundwater contaminants commonly decreased with an increase in absolute values of the groundwater level when the groundwater contaminants originated from the surface of the ground i e wastewater leakage during urbanization zhang et al 2019 hou et al 2020 therefore urbanization accompanied by wastewater leakage was considered an important source of iodide rich groundwater in granular aquifers but not the main one 5 2 origins of groundwater iodide in fissured aquifers unlike that of granular aquifers the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides was not a major factor influencing the groundwater i in fissured aquifers this was because fe mn and i were not in the same pc as fissured aquifers table 2 the pc4 of fissured aquifers showed positive loadings with i and nh4 table 2 indicating that the degradation of organic matter and leakage of reductive sewage could be responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers on a regional scale for example iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was mainly located in the devonian permian strata in which carbonate rich rocks such as mudstone and shale were common fig s6 and the carbonate rich rocks in the coastal areas were typically enriched with iodine rich and nitrogen rich organic matter fuge et al 1978 sun et al 2009 moreover nearly 80 of the iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was characterized by hco3 facies table s7 which indicated that iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was mainly present in carbonate rich sedimentary rocks because the degradation of iodine rich organic matter in sedimentary rocks results in the enrichment of iodine and hco3 in groundwater li et al 2017 furthermore the iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers was characterized by a relatively reductive environment in comparison with that of iodide poor groundwater this was because the median eh and do values in the iodide poor groundwater were both approximately two times those found in the iodide rich groundwater fig 4 thus the decomposition of iodine rich and nitrogen rich organic matter in carbonate rich rocks under reducing conditions could be one of the main factors influencing the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers in the prd on the other hand the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the nua was significantly less than that of the ua table 1 in which the leakage of reductive sewage during urbanization was common huang et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 additionally reductive sewage such as septic tank effluents and domestic sewage has typically been characterized by high levels of i and nh4 umezawa et al 2008 sun et al 2009 in addition all the iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the ua was collected from wells with a groundwater level of less than 1 5 m and in contrast this was not observed in wells with a groundwater level greater than 1 5 m fig 5 which indicated that groundwater i in fissured aquifers of the ua originated mainly from the surface of the ground i e sewage leakage during urbanization therefore urbanization accompanied by leakage of reductive sewage was also found to be one of the main origins for iodide rich groundwater in fissured aquifers in addition we observed that leakage of landfill leachate that resulted from urbanization was also an important source for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the nua in which landfills were common and typically lacked anti seepage measures sun et al 2009 huang et al 2014 for example in this study the maximum value of i in the landfill leachate of the prd was collected from the datianshan landfill in one of the nua in which an anti seepage measure was lacking fig s7 similarly a nearby groundwater sampling site showed iodide rich 0 086 mg l groundwater nonetheless leakage of landfill leachate was not the main origin for iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers because the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in the fissured aquifers of the nua and pua were significantly less than the proportion in the ua table 1 in which landfills were scarce sun et al 2009 6 conclusions in the prd iodide rich 0 08 mg l groundwater was present in 13 95 and 6 82 of shallow granular and shallow fissured aquifers respectively however it was not present in karst aquifers in shallow granular aquifers the proportions of iodide rich groundwater in various areas with different urbanization levels were similar in contrast the proportion of iodide rich groundwater in the shallow fissured aquifers in the ua was more than three times that in the nua and it was not present in the pua in shallow granular aquifers the reductive dissolution of iodine loaded fe mn oxy hydroxides and the decomposition of iodine rich organic matter in sediments were the main origins for iodide rich groundwater wastewater leakage during urbanization was also a source however it was not the main source for iodide rich groundwater in shallow granular aquifers in the ua in contrast in shallow fissured aquifers the degradation of organic matter in carbonate rich rocks under reducing conditions as well as urbanization accompanied by the leakage of reductive sewage were most likely responsible for the occurrence of iodide rich groundwater moreover the leakage of landfill leachate as a result of from urbanization was another source however it was not the main source for iodide rich groundwater in shallow fissured aquifers in this study the pca results were quite clearly supportive of our inferences related to the main origins of groundwater iodide in the prd in the future an investigation of organic iodine and dissolved organic carbon in groundwater as well as the distribution of marine sediments in the prd should be conducted to identify more specific origins of

5589,the present study uses a 2d floodplain hydrodynamic model in combination with hypothetical scenarios to investigate the coupled effects or maximum contribution of floodplain vegetation on the hydrodynamic behaviors of poyang lake china a flood pulse influenced river lake system model simulations reveal that the influences of the floodplain vegetation on lake water levels flow velocities and outflow discharges were stronger during the rising and receding water phases than during the flooding phase indicating the interactions between vegetation and hydrology that vary with the floodplain seasonality the addition of floodplain vegetation affects conveyance efficiency of the system decreasing flow velocities by 0 2 m s increasing water levels by 0 3 m and associated storage volume of the lake by up to 5 the distributed effect of floodplain vegetation on the flow velocities shows more complex and sensitive responses than the water levels across the lake floodplains demonstrating a strong linkage between the vegetation structure of the floodplain and the velocity distribution sensitivity analysis indicates that the transition between different vegetation cover types cannot produce significant influences on the hydrodynamic behaviors relative to the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation this study provides important knowledge regarding the role of floodplain vegetation changes to decision makers for both poyang lake and other similar flood pulse systems given proposals to cope with the flood risk and the accelerating pace of human interventions keywords poyang lake floodplain hydrology vegetation roughness hydrodynamic model flood pulse river lake system 1 introduction the flood pulse concept states that regularity is central to the importance of flooding in tropical systems allowing biota to evolve adaptations that enable exploitation of newly accessible habitat and the pulse in nutrient availability and primary productivity associated with floodplain inundation junk et al 1989 under natural conditions the flood pulse of rivers and lakes is characterized by a predictable and monomodal flood pulse with an annual cycle of rising high receding and low hydrological phases junk et al 1989 in areas of high flood risk there is a frequent exchange of water sediments organic matter and chemicals between the main channels and the surrounding floodplains junk et al 1989 tockner et al 2010 li et al 2019a in other words flood pulse is thought to be the key driver for the ecological and biogeochemical processes of floodplain systems thomas et al 2015 burnett et al 2017 ung et al 2019 wang et al 2019 lakes and river related floodplains in flood pulse systems are estimated to range between 0 8 and 2 2 million km2 on a worldwide basis entwistle et al 2019 floodplains frequently function as the highly productive and valuable hotspots on earth that are enriched with nutrients sediments biological communities and various kinds of vegetations but they exhibit hydrologically dynamic and complex characterized by multiple flow processes bonnet et al 2008 thomas et al 2015 de resende et al 2019 evidence accumulated from the research regarding the anthropogenic interventions and climate change demonstrates that floodplains are presently more prone to external forces and have been recognized as globally threatened ecosystems van der most and hudson 2018 entwistle et al 2019 additionally floodplains are subjected to more frequent wetting and drying cycles than other surface waterbodies on earth sokly et al 2018 funk et al 2019 the hydrology and vegetation are closely linked and are regarded as two important components of floodplain systems werner et al 2005 światek et al 2008 mikuś et al 2019 although floodplain vegetation has previously known to have significant implications for flood management freshwater fisheries aquatic habitats and other ecosystem services dudgeon et al 2006 the role of floodplain vegetation on hydrology has received less attention hydrological impacts on floodplain vegetation have gained a considerable attention and worldwide recognition bendix and hupp 2000 hu et al 2015 leauthaud et al 2018 ye et al 2019 in the most cases however floodplain vegetation plays a significant role in affecting hydrodynamic behaviors in flood pulse systems from a hydrologic perspective światek et al 2008 osterkamp and hupp 2010 devi and kumar 2016 the influence of floodplain vegetation on hydrodynamic condition depends upon the combined role of morphological and structural features canopy height density and phenological state of the vegetation chow 1959 kiss et al 2019 for example thick floodplain vegetation may cause declining flood conveyance thereby leading to increasing water levels and associated flood risks chow 1959 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in light of the significant importance of vegetation ecology many investigations into the effects of vegetation changes on hydrodynamic regime have been conducted in surface waterbodies and the associated floodplains the methods in previous studies include laboratory experiment takuya et al 2014 wang and wang 2011 wang et al 2015 he et al 2019 field based observations saiers et al 2003 wu et al 2005 devi and kumar 2016 remote sensing technique de resende et al 2019 and physically based hydrodynamic modelling światek et al 2008 werner et al 2005 kiss et al 2019 in general the remoteness and complexity in the majority of floodplains have limited the observation study resulting in field based investigations of floodplain vegetation impacts being time consuming and technically difficult karim et al 2015 khaki and awange 2019 the vegetation effects from the laboratory analysis usually represent constant conditions that cannot be extended to more general situations in large floodplain settings in addition the resolution of remote sensing images has become increasingly high in spatial domain and provides more knowledge about floodplain assessment alsdorf et al 2010 tan et al 2019 despite the effectiveness of these previous methods in exploring the changes in floodplain settings hydrodynamic models have become an appropriate tool and seem to be a more widespread approach for assessing various scenarios that are related to floodplain vegetation and or hydrology for data limited floodplain areas światek et al 2008 kiss et al 2019 li et al 2019a to analyze the vegetation effects and to model the hydrodynamic responses the general idea is to show the differences between the hydrodynamic behaviors under different modeling scenarios such as forcing factors model inputs and floodplain conditions e g werner et al 2005 światek et al 2008 kiss et al 2019 poyang lake is a unique flood pulse system that is influenced by seasonal flood water from both the upstream catchment rivers and the downstream yangtze river shankman et al 2006 hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 that is the particular time lag of the peak flows i e 1 1 5 months from the catchment and the river plays a key role in affecting the changes in flood pulse across the whole poyang lake hu et al 2007 in addition the reverse flows from the yangtze river into the lake i e backflow will enhance the magnitude and extent of the lake floods hu et al 2007 li et al 2017 creating extensive floodplain areas in the flood pulse system li et al 2019b geographically speaking the main lake and its surrounding floodplains constitute the largest freshwater lake in china the lake is a highly valued water resource and the floodplains support an internationally recognized wetland system li et al 2019a the environmental and ecological conditions in the lake floodplain system are more sensitive to changes in the hydrological regime because of its shallow and wide characteristics li et al 2016 the hydrodynamic behaviors vary between a main flow channel and a large lake floodplain system that are highly dynamic and different from that in other flood pulse systems li et al 2018 2019b due to a considerable seasonal variation of water level and water surface area feng et al 2013 statistical reports show that there has been increasing knowledge about water quality sedimentation vegetation and hydrology in the flood pulse system of poyang lake during the recent decade fig 1 considerable attention to the impacts of accelerating climate and human interventions has led to raising concerns regarding the floodplain hydrology and associated vegetation due mainly to their strong relationship and combined influences on wetland ecosystem mei et al 2016 tan et al 2016 for example a large number of previous studies used hydrodynamic models or statistical methods to investigate the floodplain hydrological regime and the associated causal factors in the lake floodplains li et al 2014 2015a zhang et al 2014 yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 many efforts have applied remote sensing techniques to interpret the historical variability of different vegetation types within the floodplain areas wang et al 2012 han et al 2015 dronova et al 2011 dronova et al 2015 in addition more attention has been paid to the flood pulse system in terms of the hydrological impacts on floodplain vegetation using a combination of in situ monitoring remote sensing data and physically based models hu et al 2015 you et al 2015 dai et al 2016 tan et al 2016 although the previous studies highlight important aspects of the addressed issue the role of floodplain vegetation in large scale floodplains remains in large part unexplored e g han et al 2015 dai et al 2016 tan et al 2016 extension of present studies of vegetation as a regulator of floodplain hydrological and geomorphic processes may be essential for lake floodplain management and planning as well as for an improved understanding of ecological conservation of flood pulse systems wang et al 2012 changes in floodplain vegetation are also known to play a critical role in influencing the physical habitat and the ecological integrity of poyang lake han et al 2015 in addition the landscape in the lake s floodplain areas are prone to vegetation changes especially under current and future climate and human interventions which may exert a significant impact on their vegetation types and the associated vegetation roughness han et al 2015 hu et al 2015 given these backgrounds it is very necessary to improve the understanding of the role of floodplain vegetation fill information gaps regarding the floodplain vegetation effects on the hydrological and hydrodynamic behaviors in the flood pulse system of poyang lake the objectives of this paper were to 1 validate a 2d floodplain hydrodynamic model to explore hydrodynamics in the flood pulse system of the large poyang lake and 2 investigate the role of floodplain vegetation to further quantify the influences of vegetation on overall hydrodynamic behavior in the flood pulse system 2 study area poyang lake is located at the south bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river and the north of jiangxi province fig 2 a in the yangtze river basin it is considered as the most extensive floodplain lake that is still freely connected to its surrounding inflow rivers hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 the lake s catchment has an area of 1 62 105 km2 and experiences a typical subtropical monsoon climate shankman et al 2006 statistical results show that the air temperatures vary from the cold winters december february to the warm summers june august in addition the average annual precipitation and evaporation are 1600 mm yr and 1000 mm yr respectively annual precipitation is around 1600 mm of which 55 concentrates in spring summer months from march to june poyang lake receives catchment inflows from the five major rivers i e ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers and subsequently exhibits complex interactions with the yangtze river via the downstream lake outflow channel fig 2a during the high water level period of the yangtze river backflow from the river to the lake can also occur thereby affecting the hydrological regime of the lake floodplain system li et al 2017 geographically speaking the flood pulse system of poyang lake consists of deep flow channels i e main lake undulating shallow floodplains near lakeshore bays and several small islands characterized by complex morphology and bathymetric features li et al 2018 with topographic elevations varied from 8 to 28 2 m fig 2a during flood seasons the maximum water depth can reach about 30 m in the lake s main flow channels but the depth within the lake s floodplain regions is 6 m li et al 2017 from a hydrodynamic perspective the flow velocities are in the range of 0 1 1 0 m s showing an increasing trend from the floodplains and bays to the main lake flow channels li et al 2016 while the associated flushing ability exhibits a decreasing trend with the residence times in the range of 20 300 days li et al 2015b the flood pulses from both the catchment rivers and the yangtze river create 2000 km2 floodplain areas within poyang lake that is partly or fully connected to the main lake during june october i e wet season but become isolated during december february i e dry season fig 2b c the differences in the water surface elevation along the longitudinal profile can reach up to 5 m during the dry period of the lake whereas the lake surface is nearly horizontal during the wet period of the lake leading to highly dynamic lake floodplain exchanges in the transverse direction fig 2d the spatial pattern of floodplain vegetation exhibits obvious complexity and variability fig 3 a depending upon the combined role of region s topographic and hydrological conditions

distributed roughness were applied to the floodplain model to investigate the effects of floodplain vegetation on overall hydrodynamic behavior 3 1 data collection daily river discharges derived from the six gauging stations i e waizhou lijiadu meigang shizhenjie dufengkeng and wanjiabu fig 2a were used to represent catchment inflows and set boundary conditions within the floodplain hydrodynamic

topographical features of the lake floodplains in the hydrodynamic model all of these data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province in addition depth averaged flow velocity measurements were conducted and used to validate the floodplain model using a 3 mhz 4 beam adcp acoustic doppler current profile usa during july 10 11 2010 see section 4 1 all of these data were collected to represent the hydrometeorological conditions of 2010 3 2 floodplain hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model mike 21 simulates the depth averaged flow characteristics of the poyang lake flood pulse system for the year 2010 the element sizes across 3124 km2 domain were adjusted by trial and error and vary from 70 to 1500 m i e edge length with a total of 20 450 unstructured elements to reproduce the bathymetry in 2010 the observed time varying catchment inflows were used as the upstream boundaries to the hydrodynamic model and the water level observations at hukou gauging station were adopted to set the lower boundary condition of the model fig 4 time varying precipitation evaporation wind speed and wind direction from the lake gauging stations were used to define the lake atmospheric conditions of the floodplain model fig 4 the water level observations from all the lake gauging stations fig 2a were spatial interpolated and used as the initial water surface elevation while the initial water flow velocities were set to zero throughout the model domain in the current mike 21 floodplain model the minimum time step is restricted to 0 1 s to keep the target courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition number of 1 0 according to our experiences the thresholds h dry drying depth 0 005 m h flood flooding depth 0 05 m h wet wetting depth 0 1 m were used to define the shift of drying and wetting in the floodplain model of poyang lake li et al 2019a b in the present modeling study the manning number of the lake floodplains m 10 59 m1 3 s table 1 were based on literature values from previous modeling calibration of poyang lake li et al 2014 and other similar areas chow 1959 dhi 2014 kiss et al 2019 the smagorinsky factor of eddy viscosity cs 0 28 was also derived from li et al 2014 and adopted to perform the hydrodynamic simulation and model validation the floodplain model has been calibrated in many previous studies regarding the poyang lake hydrodynamics the

water level i e at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan outflow discharge at hukou and water surface areas modis products were used to calibrate the hydrodynamic model li et al 2014 in addition the comparison between depth averaged flow magnitudes from the adcp velocity profile and model simulations was also conducted li et al 2015b previous calibration procedure has demonstrated that the model is suitable for simulating the floodplain dynamics of poyang lake the floodplain model has been widely used to investigate the hydrodynamics external forcings and other various applications of the lake floodplain system li et al 2014 2017 2019a b model calibration is described in detailed in the previous references and therefore only a brief description is given in this section in this study model validation was conducted using spatiotemporal observations of lake water levels at the four gauging stations i e xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan and gauged outflow hydrograph i e at hukou lake flow velocities derived from adcp field measurements were also used to validate the floodplain model to quantify the ability of the model coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe coefficient ens and root mean square error rmse were selected to evaluate the model s performance li et al 2015a 3 3 conceptualization and scenario simulation since the effects of floodplain vegetation occur mainly during the period of high water level with significant lake floodplain interactions see fig 2d the present simulations cover the rising flooding and receding water phases it was hypothesized that the coupled role of the floodplain vegetation is more important than that of each individual vegetation type the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the vegetation was used to assess the floodplain roughness table 1 based on values obtained from chow 1959 and kiss et al 2019 for the purpose of hydrodynamic calculations roughness in the 2d model domain allows us to represent different levels of vegetation roughness heterogeneity based on the distributed land use data see fig 3 in the first scenario the present vegetation roughness values table 1 were used to represent natural condition of the lake floodplains i e with vegetation in the second scenario we assumed that the vegetation would be cleared from our study area from a systemic perspective i e without vegetation the hydrodynamic results of the designed scenarios were compared and analyzed thus the temporal and spatial differences in major hydrodynamic behaviors i e water level discharge and flow velocity were evaluated across the lake floodplain system 4 results 4 1 validation of hydrodynamic model model performance is evaluated through time series comparison of daily water levels and outflow discharges for the five lake gauging stations as shown in fig 5 the amplitude and phase from the simulations and observations matched well during the validation year of 2010 the statistical results showed that both the ens and r 2 of the water levels varied from 0 97 to 0 99 and the rmse values were 0 40 m fig 5a d the statistical values of ens and r 2 for the lake outflow discharges reached 0 92 and 0 94 respectively suggesting a satisfactory agreement between the field observations and the model simulations fig 5e validation of flow velocities within the lake floodplain system is presented in fig 6 indicating that the hydrodynamic model has the capability to reproduce overall flow dynamics with a r 2 of 0 74 it should be noted that the slight discrepancies between the model and the observation were found fig 6 due partly to the complex topography and model s mesh sizes however the results presented in figs 5 and 6 indicate that the floodplain model mike 21 is generally capable of simulating hydrodynamic behaviors in the flood pulse system of the lake therefore the model has allowed us to perform floodplain vegetation analysis with a high level of confidence 4 2 influence of floodplain vegetation on hydrodynamics the first scenario in the floodplain hydrodynamic model simulates a hydrodynamic behavior in the present day vegetation effects while the second scenario represents a hypothetical condition without the vegetation effects 4 2 1 changes in water levels the water level difference between the two designed scenarios was used to quantify the effects of the floodplain vegetation in the flood pulse system of poyang lake as shown in fig 7 water level responses in the lake floodplains show significant temporal differences between the scenarios resulting from the role of floodplain vegetation the modeling simulations indicated that the coupled effects of the floodplain vegetation on the water levels during the rising water phase e g may june are obviously stronger than the flooding and receding water phases i e july september across the lake floodplains the reason can be attributable to the complex interactions between vegetation and hydrology that vary with the floodplain seasonality e g water depth free surface gradient and surface water connectivity in other words the floodplain vegetation is more likely to result in a higher water level than the hypothetical scenario i e water level difference 0 m during the rising limb as reflected in an increased water level for both the main lake i e by up to 0 3 m and the lake s floodplains i e by up to 0 2 m fig 7a b while the changes in the floodplain vegetation appear to have a neglectable effect on the water levels during the flood seasons due to the water level differences within the error bounds of the simulation i e the yellow dashed lines fig 7 in addition during the receding period of the flood the floodplain vegetation tends to play a weak role in influencing the water level changes i e 0 1 m the visual comparison between the scenario results indicated that in general the floodplain vegetation effects are greatest in the upstream area of the flood pulse system e g from xingzi to kangshan gauging station fig 7c the results presented here demonstrate that the floodplain vegetation may result in a declining flood conveyance thereby leading to increasing water levels as expected fig 8 further shows the spatial influence of floodplain vegetation on water levels within the lake floodplains during the rising flooding and receding water phases the simulation results revealed that although the lake wide pattern exhibits a similar spatial distribution for various water phases the spatial water levels during the rising and receding periods i e may june and september present more significant changes i e varied between 0 2 m and 0 4 m than those during the flood period i e varied between 0 m and 0 1 m july august as expected in the study period although the water level increases were observed in the majority of the lake floodplains fig 8 water level reductions were also found in the outer limits of the floodplains by up to 0 2 m additionally the simulations showed that the water level increases in the upstream regions are slightly higher than those of the downstream regions for each water phase possibly due to the spatial variability of distributed vegetation roughness and complex morphology and bathymetric features overall these results indicated that the present day vegetation in the floodplains tends to play an important role in increasing water levels during the rising and receding limbs fig 8a b and e especially for the upstream regions of the flood pulse system 4 2 2 changes in outflow discharge the outflow discharge in the flood pulse system of poyang lake plays a strong role in determining the interactions and exchanges between the yangtze river and the lake fig 9 shows the effects of the floodplain vegetation on the outflow hydrograph at the lake outlet the modeling results revealed that the outflow discharge seems to exhibit complex responses to the hypothetical scenario of without floodplain vegetation with positive and negative outflow differences in the range of 2000 to 1000 m3 s fig 9 it follows that the accumulated lake discharges exhibit a similar variation trend to the outflow hydrograph see the red line in fig 9 however more significant changes in outflow discharge are observed during the rising and receding water phases rather than the flooding period fig 9 indicating a strong role of the floodplain vegetation in influencing outflow condition during the rising and receding water phases on average the floodplain vegetation in the study period may contribute to retaining storage volume i e by up to 4 108 m3 in terms of the accumulated discharges relative to the condition of without floodplain vegetation fig 9 4 2 3 changes in water flow velocities the simulations of changes in water flow velocities revealed the hydrodynamic behaviors of the studied main lake and floodplain areas as shown in fig 10 the notable changes in flow velocities in the main lake i e by up to 0 2 m s and the floodplain areas i e by up to 0 07 m s were visible during the rising water phase while the velocity changes were relatively small during other water phases 0 05 m s especially for the flooding period i e within the error of the model although the floodplain vegetation may increase the flow velocities at some local regions of the lake floodplains i e positive values at tangyin gauging station see the blue line in fig 10a the decreasing flow velocities were observed in the majority regions of the system it is noteworthy that the role of floodplain vegetation is equivalent to a large number of obstacles resulting in decreasing flow velocities overall the results presented in fig 10 indicated that the present vegetation cover in the lake s floodplains may play a non neglectable role in decreasing flow velocity during the rising and receding water phases of the lake floodplains fig 11 shows the spatial influence of floodplain vegetation on monthly mean flow velocities in the flood pulse system of poyang lake in general the spatial distribution of flow velocity changes is similar for different water phases that is flow velocity reductions were observed in the main lake flow channels and the lake s floodplain areas 0 2 m s while the water velocity increases were found at the downstream areas of the system by up to 0 1 m s in addition it is expected that the spatial flow velocities in the rising and receding limbs show more significant changes i e 0 3 0 1 m s fig 11a b e than in the flood period i e 0 05 m s 0 04 m s fig 11c d overall the distributed effect of floodplain vegetation on the flow velocities reveals a relatively complex pattern mainly due to the rapid and sensitive responses of water flows 5 discussion spatiotemporal changes in the floodplain vegetation are known to play a critical role in determining the physical habitat and the ecological integrity of poyang lake flood pulse system dronova et al 2011 han et al 2015 you et al 2015 dai et al 2016 although the spatial pattern of land use data was used to reflect the present day vegetation see fig 3 it is very necessary to discuss the long term changes in the lake s floodplain vegetation the floodplain vegetation in the flood pulse system showed a significant increasing trend during the past four decades and the vegetation cover appeared to spread into the center areas of the main lake han et al 2015 in contrast a decreasing trend was found for the mudflats additionally the rapid shrinkage of the sand area was observed from 1970s to 1990s after which the sand area remained relatively consistent in poyang lake it is noteworthy that the coverage of floodplain vegetation exhibited out of phase variability over long time scales han et al 2015 overall the floodplain vegetation has experienced distinct spatiotemporal changes over interannual time scales the effects of many driving factors on floodplain vegetation have been investigated for poyang lake han et al 2015 found a significant correlation r 2 0 72 between the temperature and the vegetation coverage during each year besides approximately 70 of the floodplain vegetation changes in the dry seasons of the lake may be attributable to local temperature for the flood pulse of poyang lake the sediment input along with the strong catchment inflows can affect the turbidity of the lake water thereby regulating underwater light transmission and the associated growth of floodplain vegetation xiao et al 2016 in addition changes in other hydrological and meteorological conditions e g water level and precipitation might play an important role in influencing the biomass and coverage of the floodplain vegetation zhang et al 2012 you et al 2015 dai et al 2016 tan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 overall the long term changes in the floodplain vegetation can be explained by the natural processes and or anthropogenic interventions han et al 2015 for example the increase area of the floodplain vegetation especially after 2002 could possibly be due to the impact of the three gorges dam and lowering water levels of the lake feng et al 2013 hu et al 2015 many previous studies have concluded that the hydrological regime of poyang lake is controlled by the upstream catchment inflows during the rising water phase while it is affected by the downstream yangtze river during the flooding and receding water phases zhang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 therefore the combined effects of local catchment and the yangtze river are more likely to play a critical role in influencing the vegetation grown and its spatiotemporal distribution however quantifying the effect of dynamic hydraulic conditions on vegetation changes in the large scale floodplains remains a difficult task this study provides necessary information for the role of floodplain vegetation changes in poyang lake which could be used in the future for management and planning purposes in the lake s ecosystem considering the findings of this work the floodplain vegetation is more likely to play a very minor role in affecting the lake s high flood level through the entire summer in contrast the strong role of the floodplain vegetation was observed during the rising and receding hydrological phases which may directly affect the water levels hydrodynamic fields and subsequent ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation the outcomes of the present work further extend previous studies regarding the vegetation and hydrological changes by providing new insights for an improved understanding of the contribution of changes in floodplain vegetation to the lake hydrodynamics from a hydrodynamic perspective although there are free surface water exchanges i e a high hydrological connectivity between the main lake and the floodplains during the flooding water phase fig 12 li et al 2019a the water flow dynamics across the flood pulse system are relatively stable li et al 2019b during this high flood level period it is expected that the submerged vegetation and applied roughness values may generate a smaller effect on the hydrodynamic conditions than the external causal factors e g the yangtze river flow catchment inflow and wind field it is noteworthy that the submerged vegetation is mostly likely to affect the velocity pattern in the bottom layer of the lake floodplains during the rising and receding water phases fig 12 it can be expected that the water exchanges between the main lake and the floodplains may be exhibited more sensitive and rapid responses to the vegetation changes li et al 2019a that is the floodplain vegetation may affect the water flow pathway and the velocity magnitude suggesting a key role of the floodplain vegetation a generalized diagram illustrating the possible linkage between hydrology and vegetation within the poyang lake flood pulse system is provided in fig 12 under natural conditions the transitions and changes between different vegetation cover types may play a minor role in influencing the hydrodynamic behaviors of the lake from a conservation perspective however floodplain vegetation should be protected in the natural floodplains of the flood pulse system because of the significant ecological implications in the data limited environment dai et al 2016 chen et al 2018 tan et al 2019 it must be acknowledged that there are several limitations and uncertainties associated with adopting existing methods in a novel way to explore the hydrodynamic consequences of the changes in vegetation roughness and to investigate the role of the floodplain vegetation in many other modelling studies where roughness values are used to represent vegetation effects on flow dynamics a single floodplain roughness has been employed for modeling simulations albeit this is not a best choice horritt and bates 2001 werner et al 2005 although the vegetation roughness values obtained from chow 1959 and kiss et al 2019 were adopted in the current simulations table 1 the difference between the actual values and the literature values remains unknown and difficult to evaluate however sensitivity analysis was conducted to provide an evaluation of the uncertainties in the present model simulations and to show how vegetation roughness variations within a given range m 10 35 m1 3 s see table 1 affect the hydrodynamic behaviors of the poyang lake floodplain system fig 13 the resulting sensitivities indicate the rather limited effect of roughness changes on water levels 0 1 m and flow velocities 0 1 m s at the most lake floodplains in particular during the flooding water phase this implies that the transition between different vegetation cover types e g phragmites to pasture cannot produce significant influences on the floodplain hydrodynamic conditions relative to the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation in this study i e vegetation to mudflat or without vegetation as mentioned previously it can be expected that the floodplain vegetation e g canopy height density is mostly likely to affect the velocity pattern in the bottom layer of the lake floodplains therefore the results of this work are needed to be confirmed through application of a full three dimensional hydrodynamic model with explicit accounting of vertical water column for example a three dimensional floodplain model mike 3 has been constructed and used to investigate the mixing and stratification conditions for the whole poyang lake li et al 2018 6 conclusions flood pulse systems are known to have significant implications for a range of hydrological and ecological functions that are often highly complex and dynamic hydrological units floodplain hydrology and vegetation are closely linked and are regarded as two important components of lake floodplains the present work is the first to interrogate the role of floodplain vegetation and its effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors in the large flood pulse influenced river lake system poyang lake china using a two dimensional floodplain hydrodynamic model in combination with hypothetical scenarios the simulations provide new insights into the effects of the extensive floodplain vegetation on the lake s hydrodynamic behaviors generally the modeling results show that the temporal influences of the floodplain vegetation on the lake water levels flow velocities and outflow discharges were stronger during the rising and receding water phases than during the flooding phase possibly due to the complex interactions between vegetation and hydrology that vary with the floodplain seasonality e g water depth free surface gradient and surface water connectivity overall the present day vegetation in the floodplains may play an important role in affecting conveyance efficiency of the flood pulse system and hence decreasing flow velocities by 0 2 m s increasing water levels by 0 3 m and associated lake storage volume by up to 5 spatially the effect of floodplain vegetation on hydrodynamics in the upstream regions tends to be more significant than that in the downstream areas additionally it is expected that the distributed effect of floodplain vegetation on the velocities shows more complex responses than the water levels indicating that the velocity distribution may directly related to the vegetation structure sensitivity analysis implies that the transition between different vegetation cover types cannot produce large influences on the floodplain hydrodynamics relative to the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation our findings highlight the important role of floodplain vegetation during the rising and receding periods and the limited effect during the flooding period across the flood pulse system the outcomes from this work are important for understanding the floodplain vegetation hydrology relationships of poyang lake providing a basis to further address the lake floodplain management and planning credit

5589,the present study uses a 2d floodplain hydrodynamic model in combination with hypothetical scenarios to investigate the coupled effects or maximum contribution of floodplain vegetation on the hydrodynamic behaviors of poyang lake china a flood pulse influenced river lake system model simulations reveal that the influences of the floodplain vegetation on lake water levels flow velocities and outflow discharges were stronger during the rising and receding water phases than during the flooding phase indicating the interactions between vegetation and hydrology that vary with the floodplain seasonality the addition of floodplain vegetation affects conveyance efficiency of the system decreasing flow velocities by 0 2 m s increasing water levels by 0 3 m and associated storage volume of the lake by up to 5 the distributed effect of floodplain vegetation on the flow velocities shows more complex and sensitive responses than the water levels across the lake floodplains demonstrating a strong linkage between the vegetation structure of the floodplain and the velocity distribution sensitivity analysis indicates that the transition between different vegetation cover types cannot produce significant influences on the hydrodynamic behaviors relative to the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation this study provides important knowledge regarding the role of floodplain vegetation changes to decision makers for both poyang lake and other similar flood pulse systems given proposals to cope with the flood risk and the accelerating pace of human interventions keywords poyang lake floodplain hydrology vegetation roughness hydrodynamic model flood pulse river lake system 1 introduction the flood pulse concept states that regularity is central to the importance of flooding in tropical systems allowing biota to evolve adaptations that enable exploitation of newly accessible habitat and the pulse in nutrient availability and primary productivity

worldwide basis entwistle et al 2019 floodplains frequently function as the highly productive and valuable hotspots on earth that are enriched with nutrients sediments biological communities and various kinds of vegetations but they exhibit hydrologically dynamic and complex characterized by multiple flow processes bonnet et al 2008 thomas et al 2015 de resende et al 2019 evidence accumulated from the research regarding the anthropogenic interventions and climate change demonstrates that floodplains are presently more prone to external forces and have been recognized as globally threatened ecosystems van der most and hudson 2018 entwistle et al 2019 additionally floodplains are subjected to more frequent wetting and drying cycles than other surface waterbodies on earth sokly et al 2018 funk et al 2019 the hydrology and vegetation are closely linked and are regarded as two important components of floodplain systems werner et al 2005 światek et al 2008 mikuś et al 2019 although floodplain vegetation has previously known to have significant implications for flood management freshwater fisheries aquatic habitats and other ecosystem services dudgeon et al 2006 the role of floodplain vegetation on hydrology has received less attention hydrological impacts on floodplain vegetation have gained a considerable attention and worldwide recognition bendix and hupp 2000 hu et al 2015 leauthaud et al 2018 ye et al 2019 in the most cases however floodplain vegetation plays a significant role in affecting hydrodynamic behaviors in flood pulse systems from a hydrologic perspective światek et al 2008 osterkamp and hupp 2010 devi and kumar 2016 the influence of floodplain vegetation on hydrodynamic condition depends upon the combined role of morphological and structural features canopy height density and phenological state of the vegetation chow 1959 kiss et al 2019 for example thick floodplain vegetation may cause declining flood conveyance thereby leading to increasing water levels and associated flood risks chow 1959 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in light of the significant importance of vegetation ecology many investigations into the effects of vegetation changes on hydrodynamic regime have been conducted in surface waterbodies and the associated floodplains the methods in previous studies include laboratory experiment takuya et al 2014

hydrodynamic modelling światek et al 2008 werner et al 2005 kiss et al 2019 in general the remoteness and complexity in the majority of floodplains have limited the observation study resulting in field based investigations of floodplain vegetation impacts being time consuming and technically difficult karim et al 2015 khaki and awange 2019 the vegetation effects from the laboratory analysis usually represent constant conditions that cannot be extended to more general situations in large floodplain settings in addition the resolution of remote sensing images has become increasingly high in spatial domain and provides more knowledge about floodplain assessment alsdorf et al 2010 tan et al 2019 despite the effectiveness of these previous methods in exploring the changes in floodplain settings hydrodynamic models have become an appropriate tool and seem to be a more widespread approach for assessing various scenarios that are related to floodplain vegetation and or hydrology for data limited floodplain areas światek et al 2008 kiss et al 2019 li et al 2019a to analyze the vegetation effects and to model the hydrodynamic responses the general idea is to show the differences between the hydrodynamic behaviors under different modeling scenarios such as forcing factors model inputs and floodplain conditions e g werner et al 2005 światek et al 2008 kiss et al 2019 poyang lake is a unique flood pulse system that is influenced by seasonal flood water from both the upstream catchment rivers and the downstream yangtze river shankman et al 2006 hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 that is the particular time lag of the peak flows i e 1 1 5 months from the catchment and the river plays a key role in affecting the changes in flood pulse across the whole poyang lake hu et al 2007 in addition the reverse flows from the yangtze river into the lake i e backflow will enhance the magnitude and extent of the lake floods hu et al 2007 li et al 2017 creating extensive floodplain areas in the flood pulse system li et al 2019b geographically speaking the main lake and its surrounding floodplains constitute the largest freshwater lake in china the lake is a highly valued water resource and the floodplains support an internationally recognized wetland system li et al 2019a the environmental and ecological conditions in the lake floodplain system are more sensitive to changes in the hydrological regime because of its shallow and wide characteristics li et al 2016 the hydrodynamic behaviors vary between a main flow channel and a large lake floodplain system that are highly dynamic and different from that in other flood pulse systems li et al 2018 2019b due to a considerable seasonal variation of water level and water surface area feng et al 2013 statistical reports show that there has been increasing knowledge about water quality sedimentation vegetation and hydrology in the flood pulse system of poyang lake during the recent decade fig 1 considerable attention to the impacts of accelerating climate and human interventions has led to raising concerns regarding the floodplain hydrology and associated vegetation due mainly to their strong relationship and combined influences on wetland ecosystem mei et al 2016 tan et al 2016 for example a large number of previous studies used hydrodynamic models or statistical methods to investigate the floodplain hydrological regime and the associated causal factors in the lake floodplains li et al 2014 2015a zhang et al 2014 yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 many efforts have applied remote sensing techniques to interpret the historical variability of different vegetation types within the floodplain areas wang et al 2012 han et al 2015 dronova et al 2011 dronova et al 2015 in addition more attention has been paid to the flood pulse system in terms of the hydrological impacts on floodplain vegetation using a combination of in situ monitoring remote sensing data and physically based models hu et al

in large part unexplored e g han et al 2015 dai et al 2016 tan et al 2016 extension of present studies of vegetation as a regulator of floodplain hydrological and geomorphic processes may be essential for lake floodplain management and planning as well as for an improved understanding of ecological conservation of flood pulse systems wang et al 2012 changes in floodplain vegetation are also known to play a critical role in influencing the physical habitat and the ecological integrity of poyang lake han et al 2015 in addition the landscape in the lake s floodplain areas are prone to vegetation changes especially under current and future climate and human interventions which may exert a significant impact on their vegetation types and the associated vegetation roughness han et al 2015 hu et al 2015 given these backgrounds it is very necessary to improve the understanding of the role of floodplain vegetation fill information gaps regarding the floodplain vegetation effects on the hydrological and hydrodynamic behaviors in the flood pulse system of poyang lake the objectives of this paper were to 1 validate a 2d floodplain hydrodynamic model to explore hydrodynamics in the flood pulse system of the large poyang lake and 2 investigate the role of floodplain vegetation to further quantify the influences of vegetation on overall hydrodynamic behavior in the flood pulse system 2 study area poyang lake is located at the south bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river and the north of jiangxi province fig 2 a in the yangtze river basin it is considered as the most extensive floodplain lake that is still freely connected to its surrounding inflow rivers hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 the lake s catchment has an area of 1 62 105 km2 and experiences a typical subtropical monsoon climate shankman et al 2006 statistical results show that the air temperatures vary from the cold winters december february to the warm summers june august in addition the average annual precipitation and evaporation are 1600 mm yr and 1000 mm yr respectively annual precipitation is around 1600 mm of which 55 concentrates in spring summer months from march to june poyang lake receives catchment inflows from the five major rivers i e ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers and subsequently exhibits complex interactions with the yangtze river via the downstream lake outflow channel fig 2a during the high water level period of the yangtze river backflow from the river to the lake can also occur thereby affecting the hydrological regime of the lake floodplain system li et al 2017 geographically speaking the flood pulse system of poyang lake consists of deep flow channels i e main lake undulating shallow floodplains near lakeshore bays and several small islands characterized by complex morphology and bathymetric features li et al 2018 with topographic elevations varied from 8 to 28 2 m fig 2a during flood seasons the maximum water depth can reach about 30 m in the lake s main flow channels but the depth within the lake s floodplain regions is 6 m li et al 2017 from a hydrodynamic perspective the flow velocities are in the range of 0 1 1 0 m s showing an increasing trend from the floodplains and bays to the main lake flow channels li et al 2016 while the associated flushing ability exhibits a decreasing trend with the residence times in the range of 20 300 days li et al 2015b the flood pulses from both the catchment rivers and the yangtze river create 2000 km2 floodplain areas within poyang lake that is partly or fully connected to the main lake during june october i e wet season but become isolated during december february i e dry season fig 2b c the differences in the water surface elevation along the longitudinal profile can reach up to 5 m during the dry period of the lake whereas the lake surface is nearly horizontal during the wet period of the lake leading to highly dynamic lake floodplain exchanges in the transverse direction fig 2d the spatial pattern of floodplain vegetation exhibits obvious complexity and variability fig 3 a depending upon the combined role of region s topographic and hydrological conditions mei et al 2016 the distribution of land cover in the lake floodplains consists of water 39 mudflat 9 phragmites 9 meadow 22 carex 17 and artemisia 4 fig 3b carex is the main aquatic vegetation in the floodplain areas in general floodplain vegetation shows a zonal distribution from the main lake to the outer limits of the floodplains tan et al 2016 including the floating vegetation submerged vegetation emergent aquatic vegetation and mesophytic vegetation fig 3a 3 materials and methods the flood pulse system of poyang lake is investigated using a previously developed mike 21 model li et al 2014 2017 2019a b the mike 21 floodplain model 2012 version was used to explore the hydrodynamics in response to vegetation changes in the flood pulse system the floodplain vegetation and distributed roughness were applied to the floodplain model to investigate the effects of floodplain vegetation on overall hydrodynamic behavior 3 1 data collection daily river discharges derived from the six gauging stations i e waizhou lijiadu meigang shizhenjie dufengkeng and wanjiabu fig 2a were used to represent catchment inflows and set boundary conditions within the floodplain hydrodynamic model of poyang lake lake water levels derived from the five gauging stations were selected to set the outflow boundary condition of the model and represent the lake s hydrodynamic responses i e kangshan tangyin duchang xingzi and hukou fig 2a daily meteorological observations i e wind speed wind direction precipitation and evaporation were collected at the three gauging stations i e xingzi duchang and kangshan and used to reflect the atmospheric boundary conditions of the flood pulse system the bathymetric map of the flood pulse system 30 m 30 m fig 2a was used to define the topographical features of the lake floodplains in the hydrodynamic model all of these data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province in addition depth averaged flow velocity measurements were conducted and used to validate the floodplain model using a 3 mhz 4 beam adcp acoustic doppler current profile usa during july 10 11 2010 see section 4 1 all of these data were collected to represent the hydrometeorological conditions of 2010 3 2 floodplain hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model mike 21 simulates the depth averaged flow characteristics of the poyang lake flood pulse system for the year 2010 the element sizes across 3124 km2 domain were adjusted by trial and error and vary from 70 to 1500 m i e edge length with a total of 20 450 unstructured elements to reproduce the bathymetry in 2010 the observed time varying catchment inflows were used as the upstream boundaries to the hydrodynamic model and the water level observations at hukou gauging station were adopted to set the lower boundary condition of the model fig 4 time varying precipitation evaporation wind speed and wind direction from the lake gauging stations were used to define the lake atmospheric conditions of the floodplain model fig 4 the water level observations from all the lake gauging stations fig 2a were spatial interpolated and used as the initial water surface elevation while the initial water flow velocities were set to zero throughout the model domain in the current mike 21 floodplain model the minimum time step is restricted to 0 1 s to keep the target courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition number of 1 0 according to our experiences the thresholds h dry drying depth 0 005 m h flood flooding depth 0 05 m h wet wetting depth 0 1 m were used to define the shift of drying and wetting in the floodplain model of poyang lake li et al 2019a b in the present modeling study the manning number of the lake floodplains m 10 59 m1 3 s table 1 were based on literature values from previous modeling calibration of poyang lake li et al 2014 and other similar areas chow 1959 dhi 2014 kiss et al 2019 the smagorinsky factor of eddy viscosity cs 0 28 was also derived from li et al 2014 and adopted to perform the hydrodynamic simulation and model validation the floodplain model has been calibrated in many previous studies regarding the poyang lake hydrodynamics the final specifications of the mike 21 model parameters after the calibration for the floodplain system include the manning number and smagorinsky factor li et al 2014 the observed daily series of lake water level i e at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan outflow discharge at hukou and water surface areas modis products were used to calibrate the hydrodynamic model li et al 2014 in addition the comparison between depth averaged flow magnitudes from the adcp velocity profile and model simulations was also conducted li et al 2015b previous calibration procedure has demonstrated that the model is suitable for simulating the floodplain dynamics of poyang lake the floodplain model has been widely used to investigate the hydrodynamics external forcings and other various applications of the lake floodplain system li et al 2014 2017 2019a b model calibration is described in detailed in the previous references and therefore only a brief description is given in this section in this study model validation was conducted using spatiotemporal observations of lake water levels at the four gauging stations i e xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan and gauged outflow hydrograph i e at hukou lake flow velocities derived from adcp field measurements were also used to validate the floodplain model to quantify the ability of the model coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe coefficient ens and root mean square error rmse were selected to evaluate the model s performance li et al 2015a 3 3 conceptualization and scenario simulation since the effects of floodplain vegetation occur mainly during the period of high water level with significant lake floodplain interactions see fig 2d the present simulations cover the rising flooding and receding water phases it was hypothesized that the coupled role of the floodplain vegetation is more important than that of each individual vegetation type the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the vegetation was used to assess the floodplain roughness table 1 based on values obtained from chow 1959 and kiss et al 2019 for the purpose of hydrodynamic calculations roughness in the 2d model domain allows us to represent different levels of vegetation roughness heterogeneity based on the distributed land use data see fig 3 in the first scenario the present vegetation roughness values table 1 were used to represent natural condition of the lake floodplains i e with vegetation in the second scenario we assumed that the vegetation would be cleared from our study area from a systemic perspective i e without vegetation the hydrodynamic results of the designed scenarios were compared and analyzed thus the temporal and spatial differences in major hydrodynamic behaviors i e water level discharge and flow velocity were evaluated across the lake floodplain system 4 results 4 1 validation of hydrodynamic model model performance is evaluated through time series comparison of daily water levels and outflow discharges for the five lake gauging stations as shown in fig 5 the amplitude and phase from the simulations and observations matched well during the validation year of 2010 the statistical results showed that both the ens and r 2 of the water levels varied from 0 97 to 0 99 and the rmse values were 0 40 m fig 5a d the statistical values of ens and r 2 for the lake outflow discharges reached 0 92 and 0 94 respectively suggesting a satisfactory agreement between the field observations and the model simulations fig 5e validation of flow velocities within the lake floodplain system is presented in fig 6 indicating that the hydrodynamic model has the capability to reproduce overall flow dynamics with a r 2 of 0 74 it should be noted that the slight discrepancies between the model and the observation were found fig 6 due partly to the complex topography and model s mesh sizes however the results presented in figs 5 and 6 indicate that the floodplain model mike 21 is generally capable of simulating hydrodynamic behaviors in the flood pulse system of the lake therefore the model has allowed us to perform floodplain vegetation analysis with a high level of confidence 4 2 influence of floodplain vegetation on hydrodynamics the first scenario in the floodplain hydrodynamic model simulates a hydrodynamic behavior in the present day vegetation effects while the second scenario represents a hypothetical condition without the vegetation effects 4 2 1 changes in water levels the water level difference between the two designed scenarios was used to quantify the effects of the floodplain vegetation in the flood pulse system of poyang lake as shown in fig 7 water level responses in the lake floodplains show significant temporal differences between the scenarios resulting from the role of floodplain vegetation the modeling simulations indicated that the coupled effects of the floodplain vegetation on the water levels during the rising water phase e g may june are obviously stronger than the flooding and receding water phases i e july september across the lake floodplains the reason can be attributable to the complex interactions between vegetation and hydrology that vary with the floodplain seasonality e g water depth free surface gradient and surface water connectivity in other words the floodplain vegetation is more likely to result in a higher water level than the hypothetical scenario i e water level difference 0 m during the rising limb as reflected in an increased water level for both the main lake i e by up to 0 3 m and the lake s floodplains i e by up to 0 2 m fig 7a b while the changes in the floodplain vegetation appear to have a neglectable effect on the water levels during the flood seasons due to the water level differences within the error bounds of the simulation i e the yellow dashed lines fig 7 in addition during the receding period of the flood the floodplain vegetation tends to play a weak role in influencing the water level changes i e 0 1 m the visual comparison between the scenario results indicated that in general the floodplain vegetation effects are greatest in the upstream area of the flood pulse system e g from xingzi to kangshan gauging station fig 7c the results presented here demonstrate that the floodplain vegetation may result in a declining flood conveyance thereby leading to increasing water levels as expected fig 8 further shows the spatial influence of floodplain vegetation on water levels within the lake floodplains during the rising flooding and receding water phases the simulation results revealed that although the lake wide pattern exhibits a similar spatial distribution for various water phases the spatial water levels during the rising and receding periods i e may june and september present more significant changes i e varied between 0 2 m and 0 4 m than those during the flood period i e varied between 0 m and 0 1 m july august as expected in the study period although the water level increases were observed in the majority of the lake floodplains fig 8 water level reductions were also found in the outer limits of the floodplains by up to 0 2 m additionally the simulations showed that the water level increases in the upstream regions are slightly higher than those of the downstream regions for each water phase possibly due to the spatial variability of distributed vegetation roughness and complex morphology and bathymetric features overall these results indicated that the present day vegetation in the floodplains tends to play an important role in increasing water levels during the rising and receding limbs fig 8a b and e especially for the upstream regions of the flood pulse system 4 2 2 changes in outflow discharge the outflow discharge in the flood pulse system of poyang lake plays a strong role in determining the interactions and exchanges between the yangtze river and the lake fig 9 shows the effects of the floodplain vegetation on the outflow hydrograph at the lake outlet the modeling results revealed that the outflow discharge seems to exhibit complex responses to the hypothetical scenario of without floodplain vegetation with positive and negative outflow differences in the range of 2000 to 1000 m3 s fig 9 it follows that the accumulated lake discharges exhibit a similar variation trend to the outflow hydrograph see the red line in fig 9 however more significant changes in outflow discharge are observed during the rising and receding water phases rather than the flooding period fig 9 indicating a strong role of the floodplain vegetation in influencing outflow condition during the rising and receding water phases on average the floodplain vegetation in the study period may contribute to retaining storage volume i e by up to 4 108 m3 in terms of the accumulated discharges relative to the condition of without floodplain vegetation fig 9 4 2 3 changes in water flow velocities the simulations of changes in water flow velocities revealed the hydrodynamic behaviors of the studied main lake and floodplain areas as shown in fig 10 the notable changes in flow velocities in the main lake i e by up to 0 2 m s and the floodplain areas i e by up to 0 07 m s were visible during the rising water phase while the velocity changes were relatively small during other water phases 0 05 m s especially for the flooding period i e within the error of the model although the floodplain vegetation may increase the flow velocities at some local regions of the lake floodplains i e positive values at tangyin gauging station see the blue line in fig 10a the decreasing flow velocities were observed in the majority regions of the system it is noteworthy that the role of floodplain vegetation is equivalent to a large number of obstacles resulting in decreasing flow velocities overall the results presented in fig 10 indicated that the present vegetation cover in the lake s floodplains may play a non neglectable role in decreasing flow velocity during the rising and receding water phases of the lake floodplains fig 11 shows the spatial influence of floodplain vegetation on monthly mean flow velocities in the flood pulse system of poyang lake in general the spatial distribution of flow velocity changes is similar for different water phases that is flow velocity reductions were observed in the main lake flow channels and the lake s floodplain areas 0 2 m s while the water velocity increases were found at the downstream areas of the system by up to 0 1 m s in addition it is expected that the spatial flow velocities in the rising and receding limbs show more significant changes i e 0 3 0 1 m s fig 11a b e than in the flood period i e 0 05 m s 0 04 m s fig 11c d overall the distributed effect of floodplain vegetation on the flow velocities reveals a relatively complex pattern mainly due to the rapid and sensitive responses of water flows 5 discussion spatiotemporal changes in the floodplain vegetation are known to play a critical role in determining the physical habitat and the ecological integrity of poyang lake flood pulse system dronova et al 2011 han et al 2015 you et al 2015 dai et al 2016 although the spatial pattern of land use data was used to reflect the present day vegetation see fig 3 it is very necessary to discuss the long term changes in the lake s floodplain vegetation the floodplain vegetation in the flood pulse system showed a significant increasing trend during the past four decades and the vegetation cover appeared to spread into the center areas of the main lake han et al 2015 in contrast a decreasing trend was found for the mudflats additionally the rapid shrinkage of the sand area was observed from 1970s to 1990s after which the sand area remained relatively consistent in poyang lake it is noteworthy that the coverage of floodplain vegetation exhibited out of phase variability over long time scales han et al 2015 overall the floodplain vegetation has experienced distinct spatiotemporal changes over interannual time scales the effects of many driving factors on floodplain vegetation have been investigated for poyang lake han et al 2015 found a significant correlation r 2 0 72 between the temperature and the vegetation coverage during each year besides approximately 70 of the floodplain vegetation changes in the dry seasons of the lake may be attributable to local temperature for the flood pulse of poyang lake the sediment input along with the strong catchment inflows can affect the turbidity of the lake water thereby regulating underwater light transmission and the associated growth of floodplain vegetation xiao et al 2016 in addition changes in other hydrological and meteorological conditions e g water level and precipitation might play an important role in influencing the biomass and coverage of the floodplain vegetation zhang et al 2012 you et al 2015 dai et al 2016 tan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 overall the long term changes in the floodplain vegetation can be explained by the natural processes and or anthropogenic interventions han et al 2015 for example the increase area of the floodplain vegetation especially after 2002 could possibly be due to the impact of the three gorges dam and lowering water levels of the lake feng et al 2013 hu et al 2015 many previous studies have concluded that the hydrological regime of poyang lake is controlled by the upstream catchment inflows during the rising water phase while it is affected by the downstream yangtze river during the flooding and receding water phases zhang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 therefore the combined effects of local catchment and the yangtze river are more likely to play a critical role in influencing the vegetation grown and its spatiotemporal distribution however quantifying the effect of dynamic hydraulic conditions on vegetation changes in the large scale floodplains remains a difficult task this study provides necessary information for the role of floodplain vegetation changes in poyang lake which could be used in the future for management and planning purposes in the lake s ecosystem considering the findings of this work the floodplain vegetation is more likely to play a very minor role in affecting the lake s high flood level through the entire summer in contrast the strong role of the floodplain vegetation was observed during the rising and receding hydrological phases which may directly affect the water levels hydrodynamic fields and subsequent ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation the outcomes of the present work further extend previous studies regarding the vegetation and hydrological changes by providing new insights for an improved understanding of the contribution of changes in floodplain vegetation to the lake hydrodynamics from a hydrodynamic perspective although there are free surface water exchanges i e a high hydrological connectivity between the main lake and the floodplains during the flooding water phase fig 12 li et al 2019a the water flow dynamics across the flood pulse system are relatively stable li et al 2019b during this high flood level period it is expected that the submerged vegetation and applied roughness values may generate a smaller effect on the hydrodynamic conditions than the external causal factors e g the yangtze river flow catchment inflow and wind field it is noteworthy that the submerged vegetation is mostly likely to affect the velocity pattern in the bottom layer of the lake floodplains during the rising and receding water phases fig 12 it can be expected that the water exchanges between the main lake and the floodplains may be exhibited more sensitive and rapid responses to the vegetation changes li et al 2019a that is the floodplain vegetation may affect the water flow pathway and the velocity magnitude suggesting a key role of the floodplain vegetation a generalized diagram illustrating the possible linkage between hydrology and vegetation within the poyang lake flood pulse system is provided in fig 12 under natural conditions the transitions and changes between different vegetation cover types may play a minor role in influencing the hydrodynamic behaviors of the lake from a conservation perspective however floodplain vegetation should be protected in the natural floodplains of the flood pulse system because of the significant ecological implications in the data limited environment dai et al 2016 chen et al 2018 tan et al 2019 it must be acknowledged that there are several limitations and uncertainties associated with adopting existing methods in a novel way to explore the hydrodynamic consequences of the changes in vegetation roughness and to investigate the role of the floodplain vegetation in many other modelling studies where roughness values are used to represent vegetation effects on flow dynamics a single floodplain roughness has been employed for modeling simulations albeit this is not a best choice horritt and bates 2001 werner et al 2005 although the vegetation roughness values obtained from chow 1959 and kiss et al 2019 were adopted in the current simulations table 1 the difference between the actual values and the literature values remains unknown and difficult to evaluate however sensitivity analysis was conducted to provide an evaluation of the uncertainties in the present model simulations and to show how vegetation roughness variations within a given range m 10 35 m1 3 s see table 1 affect the hydrodynamic behaviors of the poyang lake floodplain system fig 13 the resulting sensitivities indicate the rather limited effect of roughness changes on water levels 0 1 m and flow velocities 0 1 m s at the most lake floodplains in particular during the flooding water phase this implies that the transition between different vegetation cover types e g phragmites to pasture cannot produce significant influences on the floodplain hydrodynamic conditions relative to the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation in this study i e vegetation to mudflat or without vegetation as mentioned previously it can be expected that the floodplain vegetation e g canopy height density is mostly likely to affect the velocity pattern in the bottom layer of the lake floodplains therefore the results of this work are needed to be confirmed through application of a full three dimensional hydrodynamic model with explicit accounting of vertical water column for example a three dimensional floodplain model mike 3 has been constructed and used to investigate the mixing and stratification conditions for the whole poyang lake li et al 2018 6 conclusions flood pulse systems are known to have significant implications for a range of hydrological and ecological functions that are often highly complex and dynamic hydrological units floodplain hydrology and vegetation are closely linked and are regarded as two important components of lake floodplains the present work is the first to interrogate the role of floodplain vegetation and its effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors in the large flood pulse influenced river lake system poyang lake china using a two dimensional floodplain hydrodynamic model in combination with hypothetical scenarios the simulations provide new insights into the effects of the extensive floodplain vegetation on the lake s hydrodynamic behaviors generally the modeling results show that the temporal influences of the floodplain vegetation on the lake water levels flow velocities and outflow discharges were stronger during the rising and receding water phases than during the flooding phase possibly due to the complex interactions between vegetation and hydrology that vary with the floodplain seasonality e g water depth free surface gradient and surface water connectivity overall the present day vegetation in the floodplains may play an important role in affecting conveyance efficiency of the flood pulse system and hence decreasing flow velocities by 0 2 m s increasing water levels by 0 3 m and associated lake storage volume by up to 5 spatially the effect of floodplain vegetation on hydrodynamics in the upstream regions tends to be more significant than that in the downstream areas additionally it is expected that the distributed effect of floodplain vegetation on the velocities shows more complex responses than the water levels indicating that the velocity distribution may directly related to the vegetation structure sensitivity analysis implies that the transition between different vegetation cover types cannot produce large influences on the floodplain hydrodynamics relative to the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation our findings highlight the important role of floodplain vegetation during the rising and receding periods and the limited effect during the flooding period across the flood pulse system the outcomes from this work are important for understanding the floodplain vegetation hydrology relationships of poyang lake providing a basis to further address the lake floodplain management and planning credit
