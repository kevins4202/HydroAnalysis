8625,the choice of uranine ur and sulforhodamine b srb as hydrological tracers has recently been questioned since they might interact with the soil or become degraded in this context microbiological degradation of ur and srb and the factors influencing it remain poorly studied here we conducted a long term mesocosm experiment where the effects of plants and hydrologic conditions on the dissipation and degradation of ur and srb was separately investigated mass balances were combined with excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize microbially derived organic matter results revealed that most of srb accumulated in the sand while ur was mainly found in the pore water the estimated degradation of ur and srb was greater in the treatments with plants and under unsaturated conditions overall ur exhibited higher presumable degradation than srb two components were identified by parallel factor analysis of the eems in addition to the ur related component u one humic like of high molecular weight primarily derived from terrestrial or soil organic matter sources a c and a second humic like of lower molecular weight related to recent microbial activity m a high positive correlation spearman s rho 0 74 p 0 001 between m and u suggested a possible link in which the presence of ur fostered microbial processes thus supporting the hypothesis of biodegradation of ur which seemed independent of the presence of plants whereas it was not possible to point out such a correlation for srb these results show for the first time that plants and the alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions are favourable to increase degradation of ur and srb and that microbiological degradation can be involved and dominant in ur dissipation keywords hydrological tracers wetland mesocosm degradation sorption excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 1 introduction fluorescent tracers have proven to be useful and effective tools to investigate water pathways in hydrological and hydrogeological studies e g smart and laidlaw 1977 käss 1998 flury and wai 2003 uranine ur and sulforhodamine b srb are often chosen due to their low detection limit visualization potential and ease of quantification by chemical analysis yet they cannot be considered as conservative tracers since they might interact with the soil or become degraded for instance ur is subjected to photodegradation by sunlight smart and laidlaw 1977 käss 1998 whereas srb is known to be susceptible to sorption on almost all mineral surfaces kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 leibundgut et al 2009 this behavior may be advantageous when it comes to simulating the transport and attenuation of contaminants with similar reactive properties in fact recent studies have made use of these tracers as reference substances to simulate photolytic decay and sorption of pollutants in sediments lange et al 2011 schuetz et al 2012 durst et al 2013 dollinger et al 2017 while assumptions have been made about the biodegradability of ur and srb to date only the formation of a transformation product of ur by sulfonation in agricultural soils lange et al 2017 in addition to the light mediated degradation of ur gutowski et al 2015 have been demonstrated a possible reason is that microorganisms present in the natural environment lack enzymes required to degrade ur and srb given the xenobiotic character of these substances without such enzymes biodegradation of ur and srb would presumably take place slowly zollinger 2003 therefore systematic long term studies are needed to evaluate microbiological degradation of ur and srb however such studies have not been carried out to the best of our knowledge fluorescence spectroscopy is the standard method for analysing and quantifying ur and srb in the laboratory synchronous scanning mode is usually the preferred option as it allows better separation of the fluorescent signals and the analytical background and of different fluorescent dyes with similar optical properties goldscheider et al 2008 alternatively fluorescence can be assessed in three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems where intensities are given as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths ishii et al 2012 this methodology together with parallel factor analysis parafac used to deconvolute complex eems into independent fluorescent components is widely applied to characterize dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic ecosystems stedmon et al 2003 jaffé et al 2008 it has also been used in engineered systems as an indicator of water treatment efficiency murphy et al 2011 and to characterize microbially derived organic matter fox et al 2017 more precisely eem fluorescence spectroscopy offers the advantage of providing information about the source and biological reactivity of the dom mladenov et al 2009 whose concentration and composition control microbial growth and contaminant mobility ishii et al 2012 despite eem fluorescence spectroscopy being a fast relatively inexpensive and precise technique that can be coupled with extensive spatial and temporal sampling programs fellman et al 2010 just very few studies have used it to analyze the fate of fluorescent tracers in hydrological and hydrogeological systems buzády et al 2006 meus et al 2006 mudarra et al 2011 in this regard it should be mentioned that the natural organic matter present in the water contains a range of fluorescent compounds baker and lamont biack 2001 that may interfere with tracers especially those having short wavelengths meus et al 2006 tracer mass balances have proven to be a useful tool to distinguish between non degradative i e sorption and plant uptake and degradative processes that may contribute to reduce the amount of chemicals in the water compartment maillard et al 2016 established bromide ur and srb mass balances to evaluate potential dissipation pathways of the herbicide s metolachlor in constructed wetlands under continuous flow and alternate draining and flooding they found that both degradative and non degradative processes were predominant in the system with alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions yet microbiological degradation could not be separately identified the objective of this study is to quantify the effects of plants and hydrologic conditions saturated and unsaturated on the dissipation and degradation of ur and srb this is done by extending the long term laboratory wetland mesocosm experiments of maillard et al 2016 in this context we have coupled for the first time tracer mass balances with eem fluorescence spectroscopy as a simple tool to characterize microbially derived organic matter 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the physio chemical properties of ur and srb tracers are summarized in table 1 ur was purchased from simon werner gmbh cas no 518 47 8 and srb from waldeck gmbh co kg cas no 3520 42 1 ur and srb were dissolved in water to prepare a stock solution of 14 mg l 1 and 28 mg l 1 respectively the injection target masses of 0 7 mg for ur and 1 4 mg for srb were calculated according to maillard et al 2016 2 2 design of the mesocosm experiments the laboratory scale wetland mesocosms consisted of black polypropylene containers 33 5 cm long 40 4 cm wide and 53 9 cm deep filled with 10 cm layer of gravel grain size of 4 8 mm and topped with 30 cm layer of sand grain size of 0 01 2 mm fig 1 the characteristics of the system are given in table 2 around 5 8 plants per mesocosm were planted and monitored throughout the experiment plants were purchased from a local garden center with an average initial height of 77 9 cm 12 9 daily photoperiods of 11 h were controlled with 64 osram ssl 3 w light emitting diode lamps for plant growth purple alien 2 0 led grow shop germany a piezometer 60 cm length and 3 5 cm diameter embedded in the sand and gravel layer was installed in the middle of the mesocosm for measuring electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen in situ with a wtw multi 3230 sensor wtw weilheim germany water samples were collected at the bottom on one side of the mesocosm through a chrome plated brass tap with a filter inside mesh size of 0 27 mm the tap was sufficiently separated from the piezometer to avoid possible shortcuts or preferential flow paths water level was visually determined with a non invasive method using an outer plexiglas pipe 44 5 cm length and 15 mm diameter integrated in the tap and equipped with a metric scale the study was designed based on the application of two separate series of experiments table 3 to evaluate the effect of hydrologic conditions on tracer degradation i saturated and ii unsaturated for each series three treatments were carried out with 1 phalaris arundinacea 2 typha latifolia and 3 no plants control to assess the effect of two species of wetland plants on tracer degradation each treatment was made in triplicate ur and srb were injected separately in the treatments thus making a total of 36 mesocosms the saturated conditions were achieved by a constant re filling of the mesocosms with tap water whereas the unsaturated conditions were created by allowing the mesocosms to dry out before re saturation once per week the mesocosms functioned as static systems except when the water was sampled with the tap the entire experiment lasted 9 months from july 2015 to april 2016 during which two injections of tracers were carried out as the first injection from july 17 to september 18 2015 failed to show any decrease in tracers concentration fig s2 of the supplementary information due to the unknown threshold concentration of tracers above which there is a detectable adaptation of the microbial communities spain et al 1983 thus a second injection from january 21 to april 15 2016 which served as an enhancement experiment was performed the mean values of the physicochemical water quality parameters air temperature and light intensity of the experimental room during the first injection are described in table s1 and figure s1 of the supplementary information respectively tracer concentrations measured prior to the second injection were taken into account for background correction before the second injection the mesocosms were left for approximately a week for the water levels to fall to zero in order to ensure an even distribution of tracers the average volume of water to saturate the mesocosms was estimated at 800 ml which corresponded to a water height of approximately 30 12 cm 0 27 2 3 sampling water leachate and sand samples were collected every two weeks during 12 weeks after the second injection gravel samples could not be taken due to the impossibility to extract intact samples and the risk of producing large disturbances when the experiment was running thus the tracer mass in the gravel was extrapolated as explained in section 2 5 100 ml of water samples were taken through the outlet tap located at the bottom of the mesocosm and then transferred to brown glass bottles and stored at 4 c for tracer analysis and nitrate measurements sand samples were collected by inserting a plastic pipe inner diameter 1 3 cm and length 68 6 cm through the sediment till it reached the gravel layer and taking it out with the help of a detachable pump a single sample per mesocosm was taken each time at a random surface location once the sample was pulled out it was transferred into a beaker and the wet mass recorded thereafter the sand sample was left to settle for 24 h at 4 c in the refrigerator after which an approximate volume of 3500 µl of supernatant water in the beaker was taken with a syringe as representative of pore water for tracer analysis the remaining wet sand was dried at 40 c for 48 h in the oven the total pore volume was calculated by the difference between the wet and the dry weight the dry sand samples were then kept in the dark for the subsequent tracer analysis at the end of the experiment both water and sand samples were taken to estimate the remaining tracer mass in the system the mesocosms were emptied of their gravity water before sand mixing and then the plants were removed and separated into aerial parts stems and leaves and roots and stored in the dark at 20 c until tracer analysis the sediments were thereafter removed from the mesocosms and poured into buckets where they were uniformly mixed no distinction between sand and gravel was made as the purpose was to measure ph and total organic carbon of the entire sediment 10 g and 2 3 gr of material per mesocosm were collected for the measurement of ph and total organic carbon respectively samples were thereafter dried at room temperature for 24 h and then stored in the dark 2 4 chemical analyses nitrate concentrations in the water samples were measured with a uv spectrometer props cw trios gmbh rastede germany electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were directly monitored in the piezometer tubes with a wtw multi 3230 sensor wtw weilheim germany once a week for this purpose the sensor was inserted into the piezometers to a fixed depth that corresponded to an intermediate point of the water column according to the water level at the time the total concentration of organic carbon toc and sediment ph were measured at the end of the experiment the c content was determined with a cns analyser vario el cube elementar germany after grinding the samples with a vibratory disc mill siebtechnik gmbh germany the ph value of the sediment was measured at room temperature after over night equilibration of the 10 g sample in 25 ml solution ultrapure water 0 01 m cacl2 solution with a ph meter metrohm germany concentrations of ur and srb were measured by fluorescence spectrometry perkin elmer ls 50b by means of a quartz cuvette 3500 µl with a 10 mm path length with two different methodologies the first one was the synchronous scan method käss 1998 which was applied to calculate the concentration of tracers with an excitation emission wavelength difference of 25 nm and target wavelengths of 488 nm and 561 nm for ur and srb respectively due to the high background signal in the samples as a consequence of the presence of particulate material the resulted curves had to be corrected through interpolation and subtraction of the background from the peak intensity as described by leibundgut et al 2009 the second method was the excitation emission matrix eem which was used to characterize dom results were obtained based on a combination of a series of emission scans 300 650 nm 0 5 nm steps with excitation scans 250 590 nm 10 nm steps removal of the raman peak and background corrections were done prior to further analysis of the eems using the software spekwin32 f menges version 1 72 0 2016 http www effemm2 de spekwin tracers were measured in the water outlet water sediment sand and gravel pore water plant stems and leaves and roots water and pore water samples did not require further treatment and were measured directly with the aforementioned procedures however tracers in the sediment specifically in the sand had to be first extracted and within the framework of this study it was decided to apply two different methodologies one derived from mcmahon et al 2003 and a second based on wernli 2011 in the first case two grams of the dried sand were mixed with 20 ml of deionized water the samples were then shaken on an ika hs 250 reciprocating shaker for 1 h at 240 rpm and later centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min megafuge 1 0r heraeus instruments an aliquot of the supernatant 3 5 ml was taken and measured for the tracers the samples were always covered to avoid photodegradation as for the second methodology two grams of the dried sediment samples were mixed with 10 ml of ammonia ethanol solution 40 60 v v the samples were then shaken on an ika hs 250 reciprocating shaker for 30 min at 240 rpm and stored at 4 c in the refrigerator for at least 24 h supernatant was afterwards taken and measured for the tracers plants were separated into aerial parts stems and leaves and roots biomass was determined on a dry matter basis first they were oven dried at 60 c for approximately 24 h sand and clay particles were removed from the stems and leaves by hand the roots however needed to be sieved 2 mm before proceeding further in order to remove the sediment particles attached to the roots following this the samples were grinded with a vibratory disc mill siebtechnik gmbh germany and the resulting ground material was then measured for tracers with the second methodology based on wernli 2011 as described above 2 5 data analyses 2 5 1 mass balance to perform the mass balance the system was divided into 7 different compartments outlet water pore water sand gravel aerial shoot system stems and leaves roots and the mass taken out from the system during sampling weekly tracer masses in the outlet water sediments sand and gravel and pore water were calculated based on the dissolved tracer concentrations multiplied by the system water volume in the case of the outlet water and pore water samples or by each sediment fraction mass in the case of the sand and the gravel samples the percentage of tracer degraded mdeg was estimated by subtracting the fraction sorbed in the sediments taken up by the plants or remaining in the water or pore water from the injected tracer mass according to eq 1 1 m deg min m s e d m w m p w m v e g m o u t min 100 where min mg is the tracer mass injected at the beginning of the experiment plus the background tracer mass m s e d mg is the remaining tracer mass measured in the sand and gravel at the end of the experiment m w mg is the remaining tracer mass measured in the outlet water at end of the experiment m p w mg is the remaining tracer mass measured in the pore water at the end of the experiment m v e g mg is the tracer mass measured in the stems and leaves and roots at the end of the experiment and m o u t mg is the sum of the tracer masses in the outlet water pore water and sediments samples that were taken out from the system during the sampling tracer losses due to evaporation were considered insignificant in addition the mass of tracers measured in the aerial shoot system and the roots was compared with the mass of tracers potentially taken up by the plants which was estimated based on the amounts of water transpired during the experiment multiplied by the concentration of tracers in the pore water evapotranspiration was previously calculated as the average water loss per day between the weekly readings the values of transpiration resulted from the difference between the species p arundinacea and t latifolia in this case the species t latifolia was chosen instead of the controls as representatives of evaporation for the calculation of transpiration because the controls were not exposed to artificial light to prevent possible colonization of plants besides since the treatments with t latifolia died at the beginning of the experiment it was assumed that no transpiration would take place but only evaporation under the same conditions of temperature and light as p arundinacea 2 5 2 statistical analysis the whole eem data set was analyzed using parallel factor analysis parafac which is a multi way data analysis technique that decomposes the fluorescence signal into underlying individual fluorescent components bro 1997 whose excitation emission maxima can then be compared with the large number of natural and anthropogenic fluorophores identified to date in literature the parafac analysis was done using the n way toolbox for matlab andersson and bro 2000 according to the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 with the matlab version r2015b the resulted components were analyzed with the spearman s rank correlation due to their non normal distributions correlations were calculated individually for water and sand samples additionally it was assessed whether the type of plant species or its absence showed different compositions of fluorophores likewise the effects of tracer type plant species and hydrologic conditions on the estimated tracer degradation were statistically analyzed with an anova model pr f 0 05 here it should be noted that a strict comparison between plants species could not be done as t latifolia did not survive thus it was assumed that they were systems with decaying organic matter the predicted values and their 95 confidence intervals were obtained by means of the effects package by fox 2003 in r studio all statistical tests were performed using the r statistical programming language r core team 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 water level monitoring physicochemical water quality parameters total organic carbon and sediment ph mean volume of refilled water in the mesocosms over the weeks is provided in fig 2 as expected the maintenance of saturated and unsaturated conditions as well as the presence of plants affected the water requirements of the systems in this respect since the unsaturated treatments were allowed to dry refilling was less frequent as a result the volume of refilled water in the unsaturated treatments was always higher compared to the saturated treatments likewise the planted treatments required higher amounts of water as besides direct evaporation the loss of water by transpiration had to be considered no major differences between plant species were found despite the fact that t latifolia was unable to survive from the beginning of the experiment the similarities between the planted treatments may be explained by the artificial conditions to which the plants were exposed to such as the lack of air circulation consequently these conditions might have caused a decline of transpiration in the plants that were still alive leading to similar water requirements as the systems with dead plants the differences in volume of refilled water between the planted treatments and the controls were probably due to the fact that the controls were not exposed to artificial light and thus presumably less evapotranspiration took place the development of water electrical conductivity ph dissolved oxygen and nitrate over the 12 weeks of measurements is displayed in fig 3 results did not show significant differences between the tracers but rather between the treatments yet with little changes over time for most of them the gradual increase in temperature in the water of the mesocosms from 16 to 21 c approximately was due to the air temperature rise in the experimental room from 14 to 24 c approximately in this context the increase in temperature might have favoured microbial processes hopkins et al 2014 however possible changes in the sorption behavior of the tracers due to the air temperature rise have been ruled out since the sorption properties of ur and srb only seem to vary significantly above 30 c see fig s4 of the supplementary information the high electrical conductivity values of the saturated p arundinacea and control treatments were possibly caused by leaching phenomena produced by continuous washing of sediments the mean ph of the water remained close to neutral during the entire study period ranging from 7 to 8 approximately in all treatments the lowest ph values were reached in the treatments with p arundinacea presumably due to microbial decomposition processes of organic matter in fact the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the treatments with p arundinacea were the lowest thus possible aerobic microbial respiration took place additionally the concentration of nitrate in the p arundinacea treatments was very low or non existent which suggested possible denitrification or plant uptake by contrast the treatments originally planted with t latifolia remained at similar oxygen levels as the controls this was expected since the plants died at the beginning of the experiment the contribution of sand plants and tracers to total organic carbon toc is shown in fig 4 the highest values of toc were reached when srb was present this was true for all treatments except for p arundinacea and the control saturated overall the contribution of srb to toc was greater compared to ur fig 4a in this context with the exception of the controls whose values were similar the saturated treatments showed higher contribution of srb to toc than the unsaturated treatments this observation could be related to the largest amounts of srb found in the sediment sand of the saturated treatments the mean sediment ph values table 4 were rather alkaline for all treatments but they were higher for ur than for srb a possible reason for the overall alkalinity could be the accumulation of na k ca and mg bicarbonates and carbonates as a consequence of watering the systems with tap water the ph differences between the tracers were more complex to explain since they were under the same conditions according to each treatment however the lowest ph values of the treatments with srb may have been caused by the sorption ability of srb indeed the molar proton to srb ion exchange ratio calculated according to the difference between the sediment ph values measured in the water and in the cacl2 solution table 4 was 1 1 34 thus confirming that some srb molecules desorbed protons and as a result lowered the ph this observation has already been reported in the literature with rhodamine b namasivayam et al 2001 3 2 fate of the tracers in the system the mass of ur and srb measured in the different compartments over the weeks confirmed their contrasting behaviour when entering the soil water interface fig 5 the largest masses of ur and srb were measured in the pore water and the sand respectively the maximum was reached within the first weeks after the injection then a gradual decrease over time was observed although srb experienced an increase in the sand compartment at the end of the study which may have been due to possible adsorption desorption phenomena as for the tracer mass in the outlet water and gravel compartments no significant changes over time were observed in this case it is very likely that ur and srb were mainly transported and could not be degraded due to their short residence time the corresponding mass of tracers observed in the plants stems and leaves and roots at the end of the experiment was negligible compared to the other compartments fig 6 and only srb could be measured in significant amounts in the roots such results were likely due to the sorption of srb to roots surfaces or to organic matter rather than plant uptake fig 6 also shows an estimate of the potential amount of tracers that could be taken up by the plants the resulted values were higher than the actual mass of tracers measured in the plants as far as the treatments are concerned the saturated ones showed the highest values of potential mass of tracers taken up by the plants this behavior was observed in both ur and srb and was related to the highest transpiration rates measured in the saturated treatments as for the tracers the estimated uptake values of potential mass taken up by the plants were higher for ur than for srb which was related to the greater amounts of ur found in the pore water in any case since we assumed that the plants took up all the tracers available in the water it is likely that the results were overestimated besides these results may not reflect what could happen in natural environments given that the plants were under artificial conditions in this context stress factors such as the lack of sufficient light or nutrients most likely affected their growth and development thus plant uptake of tracers could not be ruled out based on the results of our experiment in fact maillard et al 2016 showed that both ur and srb can be taken up by wetland plants although only small amounts 8 of total could be measured moreover other studies have demonstrated that ur can be taken up by plant stomata eichert et al 2001 and that ur is very mobile within the plant tissue stadelmann and kinzel 1972 whereas rhodamine b similar to srb with a different functional group has been used to trace water uptake from the roots into grafted petunia plants drummond et al 2009 the tracer mass balances for the different treatments at the end of the experiment fig 7 were in agreement with the aforementioned weekly observations of tracer mass in the different compartments indeed most of srb accumulated in the sand which was consistent with its sorption affinity for mineral media whereas ur was primarily found in the pore water the overall estimated tracer degradation table 5 was higher for ur than for srb both tracers showed more likely degradation in the treatments with plants and decaying organic matter originally planted with t latifolia than in the controls 3 3 effect of the different treatments on the estimated tracer degradation the outcome of the different treatments on the percentage of estimated tracer degradation was studied using an analysis of variance anova model with a significance probability associated with the f statistic pr f 0 05 table 6 the model accounted for the tracer type the treatments with plants decaying organic matter and the hydrologic conditions the predicted values and their 95 confidence intervals are shown in fig 8 the results revealed that the treatments with p arundinacea and those originally planted with t latifolia hereunder referred to as systems with decaying organic matter presented higher percentages of estimated tracer degradation compared to the controls among the tracers ur showed the highest presumable degradation with only minor differences between the treatments with plants and those with decaying organic matter p arundinacea 78 t latifolia 73 in contrast srb was more resistant to degradation and displayed more pronounced differences between the treatments with plants and those with decaying organic matter p arundinacea 67 t latifolia 35 likewise the tracers showed divergent behavior in the controls while ur exhibited an estimated tracer degradation of 46 srb showed no degradation in fact the model predicted negative values probably due to an overestimation of the tracer in the sediment as we can see in in table s2 b of the supplementary information the hydrologic conditions had a minor influence on the degradation of ur since it experienced similarly high rates of estimated tracer degradation under saturated and unsaturated conditions 61 and 70 respectively in contrast the unsaturated conditions might have played an important role for srb as the estimated degradation rates in these treatments were more than double the amount of the saturated treatments saturated 13 unsaturated 53 overall these results suggest biodegradation of ur and srb the presence of plants may have stimulated the degradation of both tracers although it is not a precondition for ur given its estimated degradation of 46 in the controls indeed the results of the estimated degradation of the treatments with p arundinacea and those with decaying organic matter were similar this could indicate that the microorganisms involved in the degradation of ur were not associated with the plants but rather with the sediments this assumption could not be made for srb as the estimated degradation was not significant in the controls one explanation might be the higher molecular weight of srb compared to ur and its greater susceptibility to sorption on mineral surfaces kasnavia et al 1999 making srb less bioavailable for microorganisms in fact other studies have confirmed the greater stability of srb in soils compared to ur maillard et al 2016 lange et al 2017 therefore srb could be used as a proxy for recalcitrant contaminants with comparable chemical properties the results presented here fig 8 also suggest that soil aeration promoted by unsaturated conditions can enhance oxidative degradation processes which is consistent with previous findings maillard et al 2016 moreover the death of the roots from the systems with decaying organic matter might have served as a source of substrate for degrading bacteria leigh et al 2002 kuiper et al 2004 and in turn promote the degradation of tracers in this context the input of fresh organic matter could have triggered the degradation of previously unreactive organic matter kuzyakov 2010 what has already been shown with contaminants salati et al 2010 3 4 relationship between fluorescent components the analysis of the eems of water outlet water and sand samples with parafac resulted in three fluorescent components two of these fluorescent components had spectral characteristics that were equivalent to those of other components of dom found by the same method in aquatic environments stedmon et al 2003 cory and mcknight 2005 stedmon and markager 2005a murphy et al 2006 the excitation and emission pairs of each component and the representative eems are presented in table 7 component 1 had two excitation maxima at 310 nm and 250 nm and one emission maximum at 395 5 nm it could be identified as the already known m peak that can be related with marine humic like fluorophores coble 1996 coble et al 1998 microbial production cory and mcknight 2005 and wastewater stedmon and markager 2005b it is characterized by lower aromaticity and molecular weight than humic like peaks a and c see below fellman et al 2010 component 2 peak u could be related to the tracer ur as the excitation and emission maxima were coincident and supported by previous calibration component 3 was characterized by two excitation peaks at 250 nm and 340 nm and one emission maximum at 447 5 nm these two peaks were similar to the humic like fluophores also known as a and c defined by coble 1996 and coble et al 1998 which are mainly derived from vascular plant sources and represent higher molecular weight fraction of dom unlike ur component 2 srb could not be detected as a distinct peak in the parafac analysis probably due to its lower fluorescent intensity the results of the spearman s rank correlation for the water and sand samples are summarized in table 8 components 1 2 and 3 are named hereunder as m coble s peak m u and a c coble s peak a and c respectively the components for the sand samples did not show any significant correlation this might be explained by the fact that a large number of the sand samples had to be discarded due to the high background produced by the presence of particulate material however a significant positive linear correlation between the components m and u for the water samples was found spearman s rho 0 74 p 0 001 which suggested a link between the tracer ur and the component m as for the different treatments no correlation between the components m and u was observed detailed results for the intensity of these two components over the the length of the experiment can be found in the supplementary information fig s5 further analysis of the intensity of the different components in the water samples of the planted and control treatments fig 9 showed that the components m and u had similarly high intensities in the treatments with p arundinacea and those with decaying organic matter in contrast the component a c exhibited comparatively lower intensities with slightly higher values in the treatments with decaying organic matter among the tracers the components m and u had the highest intensities in the treatments with ur whereas the component a c showed the highest intensities in the treatments with srb the control treatments on the other hand displayed significantly higher intensities of the components m and u in the samples with ur compared to the other treatments by contrast in the control treatments with srb the components u and a c were barely present and component m was absent these results can be explained by looking at the origin of the components component m was traditionally thought to be a marine derived compound coble 1996 but it has also been observed in other aquatic environments stedmon and markager 2005b subsequent studies have also associated component m with recent microbial activity zhang et al 2009 singh et al 2010 the fact that this component appeared in both planted and non planted controls treatments suggests that its origin is not necessarily associated with plants but rather with ubiquitous bacteria in water or soil indeed a recent study conducted by fox et al 2017 with several species of bacteria demonstrated that such microorganisms can produce in situ fluorescent organic matter including component m thus we assume that in the present study microbial processes were involved in the production of component m moreover since component m appeared in all cases when ur was present but not when there was only srb we hypothesize that biodegradation of ur is likely to occur and it could be linked with the occurrence of component m likewise the origin of component a c is not necessarily related to plants as it was present in all treatments and with both tracers however since no correlation was found with the other components or tracers it is assumed that its origin is independent of the tracers and is instead intrinsic to the sediment 4 conclusions the fate and possible degradation of the tracers ur and srb at the soil plant water interface has been investigated for the first time with a long term mesocosm experiment variations in the hydrologic conditions and the presence of wetland plants and decaying organic matter played an important role in the potential dissipation of both tracers the experimental observations supported the idea that both the plants and the alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions could enhance the degradation of ur and srb as expected sorptive processes dominated in the case of srb whereas ur was mainly present in the pore water plant uptake was not relevant in this study yet the artificial conditions might have biased the results and therefore this process may be of greater importance in other conditions overall ur experienced higher estimated degradation rates compared to srb the combination of eem fluorescence spectroscopy with tracer mass balance analysis provided additional information on possible degradation processes the strong positive correlation found between the component m associated with biological activity and the tracer ur suggested a possible link in which the presence of ur fostered microbial processes these results agreed with the higher overall estimated degradation rates for ur confirming for the first time the hypothesis that microbiological degradation can be involved and dominant in ur dissipation nevertheless additional research also in other environmental systems coupled with measurements of degradation products would be necessary to confirm the biodegradability of ur and srb and support the idea that they might be used not only to investigate water pathways and flow rates but also

8625,the choice of uranine ur and sulforhodamine b srb as hydrological tracers has recently been questioned since they might interact with the soil or become degraded in this context microbiological degradation of ur and srb and the factors influencing it remain poorly studied here we conducted a long term mesocosm experiment where the effects of plants and hydrologic conditions on the dissipation and degradation of ur and srb was separately investigated mass balances were combined with excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize microbially derived organic matter results revealed that most of srb accumulated in the sand while ur was mainly found in the pore water the estimated degradation of ur and srb was greater in the treatments with plants and under unsaturated conditions overall ur exhibited higher presumable degradation than srb two components were identified by parallel factor analysis of the eems in addition to the ur related component u one humic like of high molecular weight primarily derived from terrestrial or soil organic matter sources a c and a second humic like of lower molecular weight related to recent microbial activity m a high positive correlation spearman s rho 0 74 p 0 001 between m and u suggested a possible link in which the presence of ur fostered microbial processes thus supporting the hypothesis of biodegradation of ur which seemed independent of the presence of plants whereas it was not possible to point out such a correlation for srb these results show for the first time that plants and the alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions are favourable to increase degradation of ur and srb and that microbiological degradation can be involved and dominant in ur dissipation keywords hydrological tracers wetland mesocosm degradation sorption excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 1 introduction fluorescent tracers have proven to be useful and effective tools to investigate water pathways in hydrological and hydrogeological studies e g smart and laidlaw 1977 käss 1998 flury and wai 2003 uranine ur and sulforhodamine b srb are often chosen due to their low detection limit visualization potential and ease of quantification by chemical analysis yet they cannot be considered as conservative tracers since they might interact with the soil or become degraded for instance ur is subjected to photodegradation by sunlight smart and laidlaw 1977 käss 1998 whereas srb is known to be susceptible to sorption on almost all mineral surfaces kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 leibundgut et al 2009 this behavior may be advantageous when it comes to simulating the transport and attenuation of contaminants with similar reactive properties in fact recent studies have made use of these tracers as reference substances to simulate photolytic decay and sorption of pollutants in sediments lange et al 2011 schuetz et al 2012 durst et al 2013 dollinger et al 2017 while assumptions have been made about the biodegradability of ur and srb to date only the formation of a transformation product of ur by sulfonation in agricultural soils lange et al 2017 in addition to the light mediated degradation of ur gutowski et al 2015 have been demonstrated a possible reason is that microorganisms present in the natural environment lack enzymes required to degrade ur and srb given the xenobiotic character of these substances without such enzymes biodegradation of ur and srb would presumably take place slowly zollinger 2003 therefore systematic long term studies are needed to evaluate microbiological degradation of ur and srb however such studies have not been carried out to the best of our knowledge fluorescence spectroscopy is the standard method for analysing and quantifying ur and srb in the laboratory synchronous scanning mode is usually the preferred option as it allows better separation of the fluorescent signals and the analytical background and of different fluorescent dyes with similar optical properties goldscheider et al 2008 alternatively fluorescence can be assessed in three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems where intensities are given as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths ishii et al 2012 this methodology together with parallel factor analysis parafac used to deconvolute complex eems into independent fluorescent components is widely applied to characterize dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic ecosystems stedmon et al 2003 jaffé et al 2008 it has also been used in engineered systems as an indicator of water treatment efficiency murphy et al 2011 and to characterize microbially derived organic matter fox et al 2017 more precisely eem fluorescence spectroscopy offers the advantage of providing information about the source and biological reactivity of the dom mladenov et al 2009 whose concentration and composition control microbial growth and contaminant mobility ishii et al 2012 despite eem fluorescence spectroscopy being a fast relatively inexpensive and precise technique that can be coupled with extensive spatial and temporal sampling programs fellman et al 2010 just very few studies have used it to analyze the fate of fluorescent tracers in hydrological and hydrogeological systems buzády et al 2006 meus et al 2006 mudarra et al 2011 in this regard it should be mentioned that the natural organic matter present in the water contains a range of fluorescent compounds baker and lamont biack 2001 that may interfere with tracers especially those having short wavelengths meus et al 2006 tracer mass balances have proven to be a useful tool to distinguish between non degradative i e sorption and plant uptake and degradative processes that may contribute to reduce the amount of chemicals in the water compartment maillard et al 2016 established bromide ur and srb mass balances to evaluate potential dissipation pathways of the herbicide s metolachlor in constructed wetlands under continuous flow and alternate draining and flooding they found that both degradative and non degradative processes were predominant in the system with alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions yet microbiological degradation could not be separately identified the objective of this study is to quantify the effects of plants and hydrologic conditions saturated and unsaturated on the dissipation and degradation of ur and srb this is done by extending the long term laboratory wetland mesocosm experiments of maillard et al 2016 in this context we have coupled for the first time tracer mass balances with eem fluorescence spectroscopy as a simple tool to characterize microbially derived organic matter 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the physio chemical properties of ur and srb tracers are summarized in table 1 ur was purchased from simon werner gmbh cas no 518 47 8 and srb from waldeck gmbh co kg cas no 3520 42 1 ur and srb were dissolved in water to prepare a stock solution of 14 mg l 1 and 28 mg l 1 respectively the injection target masses of 0 7 mg for ur and 1 4 mg for srb were calculated according to maillard et al 2016 2 2 design of the mesocosm experiments the laboratory scale wetland mesocosms consisted of black polypropylene containers 33 5 cm long 40 4 cm wide and 53 9 cm deep filled with 10 cm layer of gravel grain size of 4 8 mm and topped with 30 cm layer of sand grain size of 0 01 2 mm fig 1 the characteristics of the system are given in table 2 around 5 8 plants per mesocosm were planted and monitored throughout the experiment plants were purchased from a local garden center with an average initial height of 77 9 cm 12 9 daily photoperiods of 11 h were controlled with 64 osram ssl 3 w light emitting diode lamps for plant growth purple alien 2 0 led grow shop germany a piezometer 60 cm length and 3 5 cm diameter embedded in the sand and gravel layer was installed in the middle of the mesocosm for measuring electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen in situ with a wtw multi 3230 sensor wtw weilheim germany water samples were collected at the bottom on one side of the mesocosm through a chrome plated brass tap with a filter inside mesh size of 0 27 mm the tap was sufficiently separated from the piezometer to avoid possible shortcuts or preferential flow paths water level was visually determined with a non invasive method using an outer plexiglas pipe 44 5 cm length and 15 mm diameter integrated in the tap and equipped with a metric scale the study was designed based on the application of two separate series of experiments table 3 to evaluate the effect of hydrologic conditions on tracer degradation i saturated and ii unsaturated for each series three treatments were carried out with 1 phalaris arundinacea 2 typha latifolia and 3 no plants control to assess the effect of two species of wetland plants on tracer degradation each treatment was made in triplicate ur and srb were injected separately in the treatments thus making a total of 36 mesocosms the saturated conditions were achieved by a constant re filling of the mesocosms with tap water whereas the unsaturated conditions were created by allowing the mesocosms to dry out before re saturation once per week the mesocosms functioned as static systems except when the water was sampled with the tap the entire experiment lasted 9 months from july 2015 to april 2016 during which two injections of tracers were carried out as the first injection from july 17 to september 18 2015 failed to show any decrease in tracers concentration fig s2 of the supplementary information due to the unknown threshold concentration of tracers above which there is a detectable adaptation of the microbial communities spain et al 1983 thus a second injection from january 21 to april 15 2016 which served as an enhancement experiment was performed the mean values of the physicochemical water quality parameters air temperature and light intensity of the experimental room during the first injection are described in table s1 and figure s1 of the supplementary information respectively tracer concentrations measured prior to the second injection were taken into account for background correction before the second injection the mesocosms were left for approximately a week for the water levels to fall to zero in order to ensure an even distribution of tracers the average volume of water to saturate the mesocosms was estimated at 800 ml which corresponded to a water height of approximately 30 12 cm 0 27 2 3 sampling water leachate and sand samples were collected every two weeks during 12 weeks after the second injection gravel samples could not be taken due to the impossibility to extract intact samples and the risk of producing large disturbances when the experiment was running thus the tracer mass in the gravel was extrapolated as explained in section 2 5 100 ml of water samples were taken through the outlet tap located at the bottom of the mesocosm and then transferred to brown glass bottles and stored at 4 c for tracer analysis and nitrate measurements sand samples were collected by inserting a plastic pipe inner diameter 1 3 cm and length 68 6 cm through the sediment till it reached the gravel layer and taking it out with the help of a detachable pump a single sample per mesocosm was taken each time at a random surface location once the sample was pulled out it was transferred into a beaker and the wet mass recorded thereafter the sand sample was left to settle for 24 h at 4 c in the refrigerator after which an approximate volume of 3500 µl of supernatant water in the beaker was taken with a syringe as representative of pore water for tracer analysis the remaining wet sand was dried at 40 c for 48 h in the oven the total pore volume was calculated by the difference between the wet and the dry weight the dry sand samples were then kept in the dark for the subsequent tracer analysis at the end of the experiment both water and sand samples were taken to estimate the remaining tracer mass in the system the mesocosms were emptied of their gravity water before sand mixing and then the plants were removed and separated into aerial parts stems and leaves and roots and stored in the dark at 20 c until tracer analysis the sediments were thereafter removed from the mesocosms and poured into buckets where they were uniformly mixed no distinction between sand and gravel was made as the purpose was to measure ph and total organic carbon of the entire sediment 10 g and 2 3 gr of material per mesocosm were collected for the measurement of ph and total organic carbon respectively samples were thereafter dried at room temperature for 24 h and then stored in the dark 2 4 chemical analyses nitrate concentrations in the water samples were measured with a uv spectrometer props cw trios gmbh rastede germany electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were directly monitored in the piezometer tubes with a wtw multi 3230 sensor wtw weilheim germany once a week for this purpose the sensor was inserted into the piezometers to a fixed depth that corresponded to an intermediate point of the water column according to the water level at the time the total concentration of organic carbon toc and sediment ph were measured at the end of the experiment the c content was determined with a cns analyser vario el cube elementar germany after grinding the samples with a vibratory disc mill siebtechnik gmbh germany the ph value of the sediment was measured at room temperature after over night equilibration of the 10 g sample in 25 ml solution ultrapure water 0 01 m cacl2 solution with a ph meter metrohm germany concentrations of ur and srb were measured by fluorescence spectrometry perkin elmer ls 50b by means of a quartz cuvette 3500 µl with a 10 mm path length with two different methodologies the first one was the synchronous scan method käss 1998 which was applied to calculate the concentration of tracers with an excitation emission wavelength difference of 25 nm and target wavelengths of 488 nm and 561 nm for ur and srb respectively due to the high background signal in the samples as a consequence of the presence of particulate material the resulted curves had to be corrected through interpolation and subtraction of the background from the peak intensity as described by leibundgut et al 2009 the second method was the excitation emission matrix eem which was used to characterize dom results were obtained based on a combination of a series of emission scans 300 650 nm 0 5 nm steps with excitation scans 250 590 nm 10 nm steps removal of the raman peak and background corrections were done prior to further analysis of the eems using the software spekwin32 f menges version 1 72 0 2016 http www effemm2 de spekwin tracers were measured in the water outlet water sediment sand and gravel pore water plant stems and leaves and roots water and pore water samples did not require further treatment and were measured directly with the aforementioned procedures however tracers in the sediment specifically in the sand had to be first extracted and within the framework of this study it was decided to apply two different methodologies one derived from mcmahon et al 2003 and a second based on wernli 2011 in the first case two grams of the dried sand were mixed with 20 ml of deionized water the samples were then shaken on an ika hs 250 reciprocating shaker for 1 h at 240 rpm and later centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min megafuge 1 0r heraeus instruments an aliquot of the supernatant 3 5 ml was taken and measured for the tracers the samples were always covered to avoid photodegradation as for the second methodology two grams of the dried sediment samples were mixed with 10 ml of ammonia ethanol solution 40 60 v v the samples were then shaken on an ika hs 250 reciprocating shaker for 30 min at 240 rpm and stored at 4 c in the refrigerator for at least 24 h supernatant was afterwards taken and measured for the tracers plants were separated into aerial parts stems and leaves and roots biomass was determined on a dry matter basis first they were oven dried at 60 c for approximately 24 h sand and clay particles were removed from the stems and leaves by hand the roots however needed to be sieved 2 mm before proceeding further in order to remove the sediment particles attached to the roots following this the samples were grinded with a vibratory disc mill siebtechnik gmbh germany and the resulting ground material was then measured for tracers with the second methodology based on wernli 2011 as described above 2 5 data analyses 2 5 1 mass balance to perform the mass balance the system was divided into 7 different compartments outlet water pore water sand gravel aerial shoot system stems and leaves roots and the mass taken out from the system during sampling weekly tracer masses in the outlet water sediments sand and gravel and pore water were calculated based on the dissolved tracer concentrations multiplied by the system water volume in the case of the outlet water and pore water samples or by each sediment fraction mass in the case of the sand and the gravel samples the percentage of tracer degraded mdeg was estimated by subtracting the fraction sorbed in the sediments taken up by the plants or remaining in the water or pore water from the injected tracer mass according to eq 1 1 m deg min m s e d m w m p w m v e g m o u t min 100 where min mg is the tracer mass injected at the beginning of the experiment plus the background tracer mass m s e d mg is the remaining tracer mass measured in the sand and gravel at the end of the experiment m w mg is the remaining tracer mass measured in the outlet water at end of the experiment m p w mg is the remaining tracer mass measured in the pore water at the end of the experiment m v e g mg is the tracer mass measured in the stems and leaves and roots at the end of the experiment and m o u t mg is the sum of the tracer masses in the outlet water pore water and sediments samples that were taken out from the system during the sampling tracer losses due to evaporation were considered insignificant in addition the mass of tracers measured in the aerial shoot system and the roots was compared with the mass of tracers potentially taken up by the plants which was estimated based on the amounts of water transpired during the experiment multiplied by the concentration of tracers in the pore water evapotranspiration was previously calculated as the average water loss per day between the weekly readings the values of transpiration resulted from the difference between the species p arundinacea and t latifolia in this case the species t latifolia was chosen instead of the controls as representatives of evaporation for the calculation of transpiration because the controls were not exposed to artificial light to prevent possible colonization of plants besides since the treatments with t latifolia died at the beginning of the experiment it was assumed that no transpiration would take place but only evaporation under the same conditions of temperature and light as p arundinacea 2 5 2 statistical analysis the whole eem data set was analyzed using parallel factor analysis parafac which is a multi way data analysis technique that decomposes the fluorescence signal into underlying individual fluorescent components bro 1997 whose excitation emission maxima can then be compared with the large number of natural and anthropogenic fluorophores identified to date in literature the parafac analysis was done using the n way toolbox for matlab andersson and bro 2000 according to the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 with the matlab version r2015b the resulted components were analyzed with the spearman s rank correlation due to their non normal distributions correlations were calculated individually for water and sand samples additionally it was assessed whether the type of plant species or its absence showed different compositions of fluorophores likewise the effects of tracer type plant species and hydrologic conditions on the estimated tracer degradation were statistically analyzed with an anova model pr f 0 05 here it should be noted that a strict comparison between plants species could not be done as t latifolia did not survive thus it was assumed that they were systems with decaying organic matter the predicted values and their 95 confidence intervals were obtained by means of the effects package by fox 2003 in r studio all statistical tests were performed using the r statistical programming language r core team 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 water level monitoring physicochemical water quality parameters total organic carbon and sediment ph mean volume of refilled water in the mesocosms over the weeks is provided in fig 2 as expected the maintenance of saturated and unsaturated conditions as well as the presence of plants affected the water requirements of the systems in this respect since the unsaturated treatments were allowed to dry refilling was less frequent as a result the volume of refilled water in the unsaturated treatments was always higher compared to the saturated treatments likewise the planted treatments required higher amounts of water as besides direct evaporation the loss of water by transpiration had to be considered no major differences between plant species were found despite the fact that t latifolia was unable to survive from the beginning of the experiment the similarities between the planted treatments may be explained by the artificial conditions to which the plants were exposed to such as the lack of air circulation consequently these conditions might have caused a decline of transpiration in the plants that were still alive leading to similar water requirements as the systems with dead plants the differences in volume of refilled water between the planted treatments and the controls were probably due to the fact that the controls were not exposed to artificial light and thus presumably less evapotranspiration took place the development of water electrical conductivity ph dissolved oxygen and nitrate over the 12 weeks of measurements is displayed in fig 3 results did not show significant differences between the tracers but rather between the treatments yet with little changes over time for most of them the gradual increase in temperature in the water of the mesocosms from 16 to 21 c approximately was due to the air temperature rise in the experimental room from 14 to 24 c approximately in this context the increase in temperature might have favoured microbial processes hopkins et al 2014 however possible changes in the sorption behavior of the tracers due to the air temperature rise have been ruled out since the sorption properties of ur and srb only seem to vary significantly above 30 c see fig s4 of the supplementary information the high electrical conductivity values of the saturated p arundinacea and control treatments were possibly caused by leaching phenomena produced by continuous washing of sediments the mean ph of the water remained close to neutral during the entire study period ranging from 7 to 8 approximately in all treatments the lowest ph values were reached in the treatments with p arundinacea presumably due to microbial decomposition processes of organic matter in fact the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the treatments with p arundinacea were the lowest thus possible aerobic microbial respiration took place additionally the concentration of nitrate in the p arundinacea treatments was very low or non existent which suggested possible denitrification or plant uptake by contrast the treatments originally planted with t latifolia remained at similar oxygen levels as the controls this was expected since the plants died at the beginning of the experiment the contribution of sand plants and tracers to total organic carbon toc is shown in fig 4 the highest values of toc were reached when srb was present this was true for all treatments except for p arundinacea and the control saturated overall the contribution of srb to toc was greater compared to ur fig 4a in this context with the exception of the controls whose values were similar the saturated treatments showed higher contribution of srb to toc than the unsaturated treatments this observation could be related to the largest amounts of srb found in the sediment sand of the saturated treatments the mean sediment ph values table 4 were rather alkaline for all treatments but they were higher for ur than for srb a possible reason for the overall alkalinity could be the accumulation of na k ca and mg bicarbonates and carbonates as a consequence of watering the systems with tap water the ph differences between the tracers were more complex to explain since they were under the same conditions according to each treatment however the lowest ph values of the treatments with srb may have been caused by the sorption ability of srb indeed the molar proton to srb ion exchange ratio calculated according to the difference between the sediment ph values measured in the water and in the cacl2 solution table 4 was 1 1 34 thus confirming that some srb molecules desorbed protons and as a result lowered the ph this observation has already been reported in the literature with rhodamine b namasivayam et al 2001 3 2 fate of the tracers in the system the mass of ur and srb measured in the different compartments over the weeks confirmed their contrasting behaviour when entering the soil water interface fig 5 the largest masses of ur and srb were measured in the pore water and the sand respectively the maximum was reached within the first weeks after the injection then a gradual decrease over time was observed although srb experienced an increase in the sand compartment at the end of the study which may have been due to possible adsorption desorption phenomena as for the tracer mass in the outlet water and gravel compartments no significant changes over time were observed in this case it is very likely that ur and srb were mainly transported and could not be degraded due to their short residence time the corresponding mass of tracers observed in the plants stems and leaves and roots at the end of the experiment was negligible compared to the other compartments fig 6 and only srb could be measured in significant amounts in the roots such results were likely due to the sorption of srb to roots surfaces or to organic matter rather than plant uptake fig 6 also shows an estimate of the potential amount of tracers that could be taken up by the plants the resulted values were higher than the actual mass of tracers measured in the plants as far as the treatments are concerned the saturated ones showed the highest values of potential mass of tracers taken up by the plants this behavior was observed in both ur and srb and was related to the highest transpiration rates measured in the saturated treatments as for the tracers the estimated uptake values of potential mass taken up by the plants were higher for ur than for srb which was related to the greater amounts of ur found in the pore water in any case since we assumed that the plants took up all the tracers available in the water it is likely that the results were overestimated besides these results may not reflect what could happen in natural environments given that the plants were under artificial conditions in this context stress factors such as the lack of sufficient light or nutrients most likely affected their growth and development thus plant uptake of tracers could not be ruled out based on the results of our experiment in fact maillard et al 2016 showed that both ur and srb can be taken up by wetland plants although only small amounts 8 of total could be measured moreover other studies have demonstrated that ur can be taken up by plant stomata eichert et al 2001 and that ur is very mobile within the plant tissue stadelmann and kinzel 1972 whereas rhodamine b similar to srb with a different functional group has been used to trace water uptake from the roots into grafted petunia plants drummond et al 2009 the tracer mass balances for the different treatments at the end of the experiment fig 7 were in agreement with the aforementioned weekly observations of tracer mass in the different compartments indeed most of srb accumulated in the sand which was consistent with its sorption affinity for mineral media whereas ur was primarily found in the pore water the overall estimated tracer degradation table 5 was higher for ur than for srb both tracers showed more likely degradation in the treatments with plants and decaying organic matter originally planted with t latifolia than in the controls 3 3 effect of the different treatments on the estimated tracer degradation the outcome of the different treatments on the percentage of estimated tracer degradation was studied using an analysis of variance anova model with a significance probability associated with the f statistic pr f 0 05 table 6 the model accounted for the tracer type the treatments with plants decaying organic matter and the hydrologic conditions the predicted values and their 95 confidence intervals are shown in fig 8 the results revealed that the treatments with p arundinacea and those originally planted with t latifolia hereunder referred to as systems with decaying organic matter presented higher percentages of estimated tracer degradation compared to the controls among the tracers ur showed the highest presumable degradation with only minor differences between the treatments with plants and those with decaying organic matter p arundinacea 78 t latifolia 73 in contrast srb was more resistant to degradation and displayed more pronounced differences between the treatments with plants and those with decaying organic matter p arundinacea 67 t latifolia 35 likewise the tracers showed divergent behavior in the controls while ur exhibited an estimated tracer degradation of 46 srb showed no degradation in fact the model predicted negative values probably due to an overestimation of the tracer in the sediment as we can see in in table s2 b of the supplementary information the hydrologic conditions had a minor influence on the degradation of ur since it experienced similarly high rates of estimated tracer degradation under saturated and unsaturated conditions 61 and 70 respectively in contrast the unsaturated conditions might have played an important role for srb as the estimated degradation rates in these treatments were more than double the amount of the saturated treatments saturated 13 unsaturated 53 overall these results suggest biodegradation of ur and srb the presence of plants may have stimulated the degradation of both tracers although it is not a precondition for ur given its estimated degradation of 46 in the controls indeed the results of the estimated degradation of the treatments with p arundinacea and those with decaying organic matter were similar this could indicate that the microorganisms involved in the degradation of ur were not associated with the plants but rather with the sediments this assumption could not be made for srb as the estimated degradation was not significant in the controls one explanation might be the higher molecular weight of srb compared to ur and its greater susceptibility to sorption on mineral surfaces kasnavia et al 1999 making srb less bioavailable for microorganisms in fact other studies have confirmed the greater stability of srb in soils compared to ur maillard et al 2016 lange et al 2017 therefore srb could be used as a proxy for recalcitrant contaminants with comparable chemical properties the results presented here fig 8 also suggest that soil aeration promoted by unsaturated conditions can enhance oxidative degradation processes which is consistent with previous findings maillard et al 2016 moreover the death of the roots from the systems with decaying organic matter might have served as a source of substrate for degrading bacteria leigh et al 2002 kuiper et al 2004 and in turn promote the degradation of tracers in this context the input of fresh organic matter could have triggered the degradation of previously unreactive organic matter kuzyakov 2010 what has already been shown with contaminants salati et al 2010 3 4 relationship between fluorescent components the analysis of the eems of water outlet water and sand samples with parafac resulted in three fluorescent components two of these fluorescent components had spectral characteristics that were equivalent to those of other components of dom found by the same method in aquatic environments stedmon et al 2003 cory and mcknight 2005 stedmon and markager 2005a murphy et al 2006 the excitation and emission pairs of each component and the representative eems are presented in table 7 component 1 had two excitation maxima at 310 nm and 250 nm and one emission maximum at 395 5 nm it could be identified as the already known m peak that can be related with marine humic like fluorophores coble 1996 coble et al 1998 microbial production cory and mcknight 2005 and wastewater stedmon and markager 2005b it is characterized by lower aromaticity and molecular weight than humic like peaks a and c see below fellman et al 2010 component 2 peak u could be related to the tracer ur as the excitation and emission maxima were coincident and supported by previous calibration component 3 was characterized by two excitation peaks at 250 nm and 340 nm and one emission maximum at 447 5 nm these two peaks were similar to the humic like fluophores also known as a and c defined by coble 1996 and coble et al 1998 which are mainly derived from vascular plant sources and represent higher molecular weight fraction of dom unlike ur component 2 srb could not be detected as a distinct peak in the parafac analysis probably due to its lower fluorescent intensity the results of the spearman s rank correlation for the water and sand samples are summarized in table 8 components 1 2 and 3 are named hereunder as m coble s peak m u and a c coble s peak a and c respectively the components for the sand samples did not show any significant correlation this might be explained by the fact that a large number of the sand samples had to be discarded due to the high background produced by the presence of particulate material however a significant positive linear correlation between the components m and u for the water samples was found spearman s rho 0 74 p 0 001 which suggested a link between the tracer ur and the component m as for the different treatments no correlation between the components m and u was observed detailed results for the intensity of these two components over the the length of the experiment can be found in the supplementary information fig s5 further analysis of the intensity of the different components in the water samples of the planted and control treatments fig 9 showed that the components m and u had similarly high intensities in the treatments with p arundinacea and those with decaying organic matter in contrast the component a c exhibited comparatively lower intensities with slightly higher values in the treatments with decaying organic matter among the tracers the components m and u had the highest intensities in the treatments with ur whereas the component a c showed the highest intensities in the treatments with srb the control treatments on the other hand displayed significantly higher intensities of the components m and u in the samples with ur compared to the other treatments by contrast in the control treatments with srb the components u and a c were barely present and component m was absent these results can be explained by looking at the origin of the components component m was traditionally thought to be a marine derived compound coble 1996 but it has also been observed in other aquatic environments stedmon and markager 2005b subsequent studies have also associated component m with recent microbial activity zhang et al 2009 singh et al 2010 the fact that this component appeared in both planted and non planted controls treatments suggests that its origin is not necessarily associated with plants but rather with ubiquitous bacteria in water or soil indeed a recent study conducted by fox et al 2017 with several species of bacteria demonstrated that such microorganisms can produce in situ fluorescent organic matter including component m thus we assume that in the present study microbial processes were involved in the production of component m moreover since component m appeared in all cases when ur was present but not when there was only srb we hypothesize that biodegradation of ur is likely to occur and it could be linked with the occurrence of component m likewise the origin of component a c is not necessarily related to plants as it was present in all treatments and with both tracers however since no correlation was found with the other components or tracers it is assumed that its origin is independent of the tracers and is instead intrinsic to the sediment 4 conclusions the fate and possible degradation of the tracers ur and srb at the soil plant water interface has been investigated for the first time with a long term mesocosm experiment variations in the hydrologic conditions and the presence of wetland plants and decaying organic matter played an important role in the potential dissipation of both tracers the experimental observations supported the idea that both the plants and the alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions could enhance the degradation of ur and srb as expected sorptive processes dominated in the case of srb whereas ur was mainly present in the pore water plant uptake was not relevant in this study yet the artificial conditions might have biased the results and therefore this process may be of greater importance in other conditions overall ur experienced higher estimated degradation rates compared to srb the combination of eem fluorescence spectroscopy with tracer mass balance analysis provided additional information on possible degradation processes the strong positive correlation found between the component m associated with biological activity and the tracer ur suggested a possible link in which the presence of ur fostered microbial processes these results agreed with the higher overall estimated degradation rates for ur confirming for the first time the hypothesis that microbiological degradation can be involved and dominant in ur dissipation nevertheless additional research also in other environmental systems coupled with measurements of degradation products would be necessary to confirm the biodegradability of ur and srb and support the idea that they might be used not only to investigate water pathways and flow rates but also

8626,the abundance and fluxes of selected dissolved trace elements te nutrients and dissolved organic carbon doc were quantified in the atchafalaya river basin to better understand its influence on the chemical regime of the louisiana shelf a region where bottom water hypoxia occurs annually during late spring to early fall water samples were collected from throughout the entire atchafalaya river basin including from the mississippi and red rivers as well as basin swamp waters during april and november 2010 and june 2011 which represent typical high and low and unusual high river discharges respectively within the total dissolved 0 45 µm pool most of the tes were mainly partitioned to the 0 02 µm dissolved phase with the exception of cr cs fe pb and zn which were dominantly in the colloidal 0 02 0 45 µm phase in the atchafalaya river seasonal concentration variations in nutrients doc and most tes were similar to those in the mississippi river reflecting a major contribution of water from the mississippi river contributions of the red river to the atchafalaya river s doc and nutrients were estimated to be 1 35 similar to previous estimates for this system the red river contribution to the fluxes of co cr cs fe mn pb rb and zn was generally disproportionally high 20 exceeding its hydrological contribution 10 to the atchafalaya river due to greatly enriched concentrations of these elements in the red river the atchafalaya river basin wetland floodplain contribution to chemical constituents was noticeable accounting for more than a 20 decrease of some elements cd cs cr cu fe mo p u and zn mn was the only element with persistent addition during all sampling campaigns however the contributions from the red river were greater than the wetland floodplain contributions for doc nutrients and most of tes except mn suggesting that the red river plays a disproportionate role in regulating water quality in the atchafalaya river overall the atchafalaya river with its chemical modification of mississippi river water via contributions from the red river and interactions with floodplain wetlands plays a critical role in chemical distributions on the louisiana shelf in the northern gulf of mexico thus the atchafalaya river contribution should be adequately accounted for in biogeochemical studies and models of trace elements and nutrients on the louisiana shelf particularly during periods of bottom water hypoxia keywords atchafalaya river basin wetlands trace elements nutrients dissolved organic carbon 1 introduction freshwater wetlands including marshes floodplains and swamps are an interface between the land and river water and play an important role in regulating water quality in rivers and ultimately the estuaries and coastal zones fed by those rivers correll et al 1992 cai et al 2016 in fact some wetlands are utilized for the treatment of waste waters polluted with nutrients heavy metals and organic contaminants verhoeven et al 2006 and references therein mays and edwards 2001 wetlands in lower floodplains also could play a significant role in the productivity and water quality of coastal ecosystems by regulating nutrient and organic matter transport to the coastal ocean verhoeven et al 2006 thus biogeochemical processes in these wetland systems may additionally impact other coastal environmental processes such as bottom water hypoxia despite their potentially great importance the role of floodplain wetlands in affecting the coastal ocean is not well understood particularly along the louisiana coast in the northern gulf of mexico where bottom waters experience seasonal hypoxia rabalais et al 2010 many biogeochemical processes can affect the distributions of chemical constituents from wetlands in general nutrients dissolved organic matter dom and major and trace element te distributions within wetlands systems can be affected by biological uptake junk et al 1989 bayley 1995 fisher and acreman 2004 weis and weis 2004 microbial activity chow et al 2013 mulholland 1981 roden and wetzel 1996 hamilton et al 1997 adsorption onto particles olivie lauquet et al 2001 redox processes olivie lauquet et al 2001 sedimentation grybos et al 2007 and seasonal hydrological changes such as extent of flooding kerr et al 2008 thus depending on the seasonal and temporal variations of environmental conditions wetlands can act as either sinks e g emmett et al 1994 fisher and acreman 2004 khan and brush 1994 or sources rücker and schrautzer 2010 kerr et al 2008 christopher et al 2006 seyler and boaventura 2003 dawson et al 2008 mulholland 1981 noe and hupp 2007 hansson et al 2005 kinsman costello et al 2016 indeed other recent studies have also suggested that wetlands can be both material sources and sinks depending on the seasonal changes in hydrology as well as chemical speciation of the element for instance cai et al 2016 and shim et al 2017 investigated floodplain wetland influence on carbon speciation and tes in a southern mississippi louisiana east pearl river system having similar climate and physiographic characteristics to the study area discussed here based on a mass balance approach of annual c fluxes cai et al 2016 revealed that the pearl river wetlands could reduce the dissolved inorganic and particulate organic carbon export fluxes by 24 and 40 respectively but enhance the annual riverine doc export by 25 at the same time shim et al 2017 reported downstream variations of tes in the east pearl river which were linked to river stage specifically they noted a downstream increase by 20 or more of tes e g fe mn zn cd that was observed only during moderately high discharge but not during the highest and low river discharges they interpreted their observations as indicating inputs from floodplain wetlands during moderately high river discharge rate limiting of wetland inputs during the highest river discharges and saltwater intrusion as well as hyporheic zone interactions during low river discharge the atchafalaya river carries about 30 of the combined flow of the mississippi and red rivers and the basin of the atchafalaya contains the largest wetlands in north america ford and nyman 2011 although the atchafalaya river is a significant contributor of water and other fluvial materials to the louisiana shelf studies of how the atchafalaya river basin wetlands modify the fluxes of nutrients and doc are still limited scott et al 2014 shen et al 2012 turner et al 2007 lane et al 2002 and the basin s effect on dissolved te fluxes has yet to be determined so far studies of the atchafalaya river basin s role on chemical constituents have found significant doc and nutrient alterations in the basin shen et al 2012 reported that doc was about 150 higher in the atchafalaya river compared to the mississippi river due to the input from wetland waters in the atchafalaya river basin lambou and hern 1983 explained that the increased doc in atchafalaya river waters was due to primary production within overflow areas during high river discharge relative to low river discharge turner and rabalais 1991 reported relatively lower nitrate and silicate 31 and 6 respectively and higher total phosphorous 30 in the atchafalaya river than in the mississippi river and suggested that these differences were probably due to differences in the contribution from the red river however nitrate input from the red river was found to be negligible accounting for 3 in comparison to total loading of nitrate from the mississippi river turner et al 2007 xu 2006 reported about 27 removal of total kjeldahl nitrogen by comparing composition of waters entering and exiting the atchafalaya river basin the removal was closely related to the interaction of river water with the swamp where denitrification was found to be a major process for nitrogen removal xu 2006 lindau et al 2008 scaroni et al 2011 during the 2011 flooding of the atchafalaya basin scott et al 2014 demonstrated floodplain reduction of the atchafalaya river s nitrate load and a small increase in phosphate and ammonium loads reiman et al 2018 examined the flux of total recoverable metals through the atchafalaya basin however for most elements their method determines a largely particulate metal fraction of their unfiltered samples thus not surprisingly they found that the atchafalaya wetlands were a sink for total recoverable metals just as they are for suspended sediments however this provides limited insight into how the wetlands affect transport of metals in the dissolved and colloidal phases which is likely the more important bioactive phase for most trace elements despite this prior work no studies have yet examined the effect of the atchafalaya river basin on dissolved te fluxes to the louisiana shelf clearly though various processes including biological uptake microbial remineralization of organic matter and changing redox state as well as input from the red and mississippi rivers could affect trace element distributions in the basin therefore we hypothesize that 1 chemical contributions from the red river and wetland interactions can be significant altering the chemical compositions of the atchafalaya river and 2 red river and wetland contributions vary seasonally following the changes in river discharges and floodplain inundation herein we report our investigations of doc nutrient and dissolved trace element distributions in waters from the atchafalaya river basin including the main river channels and surface waters of the surrounding swamps the objective of this study was to quantify the contributions from the red river and wetlands within the basin to chemical fluxes through the atchafalaya river to the louisiana shelf during different flow stages 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description ford and nyman 2011 characterize the atchafalaya river basin as having one of the largest and most undeveloped floodplains in north america fig 1 agriculture is common upstream in the atchafalaya river basin while downstream it retains pristine river floodplain forest including bayous lakes and swamps which extend about 120 km in length north to south and 25 35 km in width ford and nyman 2011 the eastern and western boundaries are constrained by artificial levees to prevent flooding and levees on river itself have isolated large portions of the floodplain from the atchafalaya river at all but the highest river stages during the spring flood pulse fontenot et al 2001 construction activities related to navigation flood control and oil and gas canals have altered the historic water flow patterns reduced water circulation and a large portion of wetland areas in atchafalaya river basin are experiencing low dissolved oxygen concentrations fontenot et al 2001 sabo et al 1999 sampling locations fig 1 were chosen to include the major water sources to the atchafalaya river basin mississippi and red rivers the main exits for water into atchafalaya bay including the mouth of the atchafalaya river and the wax lake outlet plus other sites in the main channels and swamps throughout the basin swamp sampling sites ars1 3 were located in the upper part of the atchafalaya swamp and include the swamp inner channel ars3 which frequently connects to the main river channel however during june 2011 when parts of the atchafalaya river basin were flooded due to the opening of the morganza spillway some adjustment of the sampling locations was necessary that is the ar 4 5 and 7 10 arwl and ars3 sites were not accessible due to flooding also at that time we were not able to access the exact same swamp sites as in the previous sampling campaigns and so water samples were collected near the previous sites supplementary table 4 2 2 sample collection sampling campaigns were conducted during april and november 2010 and june 2011 with different river stages river discharges in april and november 2010 were at high and low stages that are typical of the annual river flow cycle fig 2 and supplementary fig 1 during june 2011 unusually high mississippi river discharge resulted in the opening of the morganza spillway inundating large areas of swamp and floodplains in the atchafalaya river basin the spillway is designed to reduce downstream flood pressure in the lowermost mississippi river basin during major flood events this was only the second time the spillway was opened since its completion in 1954 surface waters were collected for nutrient dissolved organic carbon doc and trace element analysis immediately after collection nutrient and doc samples were filtered in the field using 0 45 µm pore size filters whatman puradisc and kept in an iced cooler for transport back to the lab where they were frozen until analysis trace element samples were collected at the same time as nutrients and doc using clean sampling techniques shiller 2003 specifically an acid cleaned polyethylene bottle was attached to a non metallic pole approximately 5 m length and the bottle was rinsed 3 times with ambient water after sample collection the sample bottle was tightly capped and doubly bagged in new plastic zipper bags and stored in an iced cooler these samples were then filtered using 0 45 µm whatman puradisc and 0 02 µm whatman anotop pore size filters using acid cleaned syringes for total dissolved 0 45 µm and the 0 02 µm dissolved fractions respectively shiller 2003 the colloidal 0 02 0 45 µm phase was determined by the difference between the 0 45 µm and 0 02 µm dissolved fractions this filtration was conducted in a small plastic tent within 2 8 h of sample collection the trace element samples were subsequently acidified in our clean lab to ph 2 by addition of ultra clean 6 m hcl seastar baseline a small boat was used for the stations that were not accessible by foot for ancillary data portable sensors were used for the determination of conductivity salinity and temperature model 30 ysi inc and ph oakton ph 110 series usa 2 3 measurements of nutrients doc and trace elements the frozen nutrient and doc samples were thawed overnight at room temperature just before the measurements nutrients were analyzed using an astoria pacific a2c2 nutrient auto analyzer astoria pacific international oregon usa the detection limits for nutrients were 0 1 0 05 and 1 µmol l for nitrate phosphate and silicate respectively concentrations of doc were determined using a shimadzu toc v total organic carbon analyzer employing the high temperature combustion method guo et al 1995 for doc measurements samples were acidified with concentrated hcl to ph 2 immediately before measurement to remove all the dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations were calculated using calibration curves that were generated at the beginning of the sample analysis certified doc standards university of miami and ultrapure water were measured every eight samples during the run as samples to check the performance of the instrument to ensure the data quality three to five measurements were made for each sample and the precision was 2 the te sample analysis was followed well established procedures which can be found elsewhere e g shiller 2003 joung and shiller 2016 shim et al 2017 boyle et al 2012 briefly samples were analyzed using a sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer sf icp ms thermo fisher element 2 as previously described in shiller 2003 for analysis samples were diluted 33 by addition of

detection limits are shown in supplementary table 1 and the recovery of reference materials can be found in shim et al 2017 2 4 river discharge input and export fluxes estimation hydrological data was obtained from the us army corps of engineers http www mvn usace army mil for the red river input to the atchafalaya river basin the daily discharge from the red river at alexandria and the black river at acme la were combined fig 1 for the mississippi river flow into the atchafalaya river basin the daily discharge was obtained by subtracting the red river input from the discharge at simmesport la the mississippi river flow through the birdfoot delta was taken from the gauge at tarbert landing ms which is located below the old river control structure where the mississippi river division is located during june 2011 flood the additional mississippi river discharge to the atchafalaya river basin through the morganza spillway was obtained from scott et al 2014 we note that the hydrological imbalance between inputs discharge at simmesport plus morganza spillway for june 2011 and outputs discharge at wax lake outlet morgan city was 1 5 and 1 for april and november 2010 and june 2011 respectively to estimate the contributions of various sources to chemical fluxes in the atchafalaya river basin we started by calculating the input concentrations of constituents from the red and mississippi rivers i r f rr c rr f mr c mr where ir is the theoretical fluvial input concentration to the basin derived by assuming conservative mixing of red and mississippi river waters the f s are the percentages of water in the atchafalaya river derived from the red and mississippi river and the c s are the concentration 0 45 µm fraction of the constituent in each river we use this theoretical conservative estimate of the input concentration rather than the measured concentration at ar1 since that station is located 60 km downstream from the mixing point of the two rivers to estimate the relative contribution of the red river to the constituent flux through the basin we simply took the ratio of frr crr ir 100 contributions of wetlands floodplains to chemical flux modifications were estimated by simple concentration comparisons between the most upstream site ar1 input and the lower atchafalaya river basin flow weighted average of sites ar10 and arwl output the wetland constituent contribution proportions were calculated by output input input 100 thus negative values indicate a removal during interactions between wetlands floodplains and river water table 1 in june 2011 due to our inability to collect samples from ar10 and arwl we used concentrations of constituents at site ar6 to represent the lower atchafalaya river basin concentrations i e output for estimating the effects of red river and wetlands contributions to the atchafalaya fluxes we considered only concentration differences 20 to be significant shim et al 2017 this accounts for both analytical error and possible short term temporal variability in river concentrations as well as uncertainty in river mixing ratios and is based on the highest standard deviation i e 7 for u of the reference materials and the estimated input output discharge imbalance for the atchafalaya river basin thus 20 or greater differences represent at least twice the flux uncertainties e g shim et al 2017 for doc and nutrients we accepted differences of 10 or greater as significant variations because the standard variation of doc reference materials was typically 2 3 results river discharges varied significantly seasonally fig 2 and supplementary fig 1 discharge for the atchafalaya river at simmesport la was 10 2 103 and 2 8 103 m3 s during april and november 2010 respectively whereas it was 15 9 103 m3 s during june 2011 in june 2011 the additional mississippi river discharge to the atchafalaya river basin through the morganza spillway was 2 8 103 m3 s for the two weeks of the spillway opening scott et al 2014 results for doc nutrients tes and ancillary parameters such as ph conductivity and temperature are shown in figs 3 and 4 and supplementary figs 2 4 and supplementary tables 2 4 though seasonal variations of tes and nutrients were observed in the most eastern are1 and western arw1 sides of the basin their contributions to the fluxes in the atchafalaya river main stem are likely unimportant due to low water flows and concentrations similar to the main stem thus the data for these stations are listed in the supplementary figures and tables and not further displayed herein doc concentrations were always higher in the red river than the mississippi river during our studies fig 3 and supplementary tables 2 4 the doc concentrations showed low variability along the river from ar1 to the atchafalaya river outlets ar10 and arwl except for a doc maximum in the middle of basin ar4 during april and november 2010 in swamp waters ars1 3 doc concentrations were in general about 2 to 3 fold higher than the concentrations in the atchafalaya river main channel waters throughout the study nitrate and silicate concentrations were higher in the mississippi river than the red river in all sampling periods phosphate was also slightly higher in the mississippi river than the atchafalaya river during april and november 2010 though concentrations were comparable in both rivers during june 2011 at the mid basin station where the doc maximum was observed ar4 nitrate and silica showed a minimum during april and november 2010 however phosphate showed a minimum only in november and not in april 2010 in the lower basin ar6 10 and the wax lake outlet arwl concentrations of all studied nutrients generally showed little variability along the flow path swamp waters showed very low nitrate concentrations relative to the atchafalaya river mainstem regardless of season phosphate concentrations in waters from swamps were lower than the concentrations in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river except during june 2011 as well as waters from ars2 silicate concentrations in swamp waters were higher in comparison to main channel waters ammonia and nitrite were generally very low throughout the basin 1 of the nitrate concentrations except in swamp waters where ammonia was as high as 20 µmol kg during november 2010 supplementary tables 2 4 dissolved trace element distributions are shown in fig 4 see also supplementary tables 2 4 and supplementary figs 1 3 most of the studied trace elements were mainly in the 0 02 µm dissolved fraction except for cr cs fe pb and zn among those five elements fe and pb were the most extreme in that the 0 02 0 45 µm colloidal phase accounted for 80 of the total dissolved 0 45 µm pool for cr cs and zn the colloidal phase was considerable accounting for over 50 for many samples total dissolved 0 45 µm cd cu re u and mo concentrations were higher in the mississippi river than red river during our sampling campaigns whereas total dissolved cs fe mn and rb were higher in the red river than mississippi river other elements showed seasonal changes in which source had the higher concentration for example total dissolved ba was higher in the mississippi than red river during june 2011 but it was lower in the mississippi than red river during the other sampling campaigns in general total dissolved cd cr cs fe mn pb and zn in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river were higher during april 2010 and june 2011 than during november 2010 in contrast concentrations of total dissolved as ba cu mo ni re sr u and v were higher in the atchafalaya river mainstem during november 2010 than the other two periods other elements including total dissolved co and rb also varied seasonally but with slightly higher 5 concentrations in june relative to april and november in the mid basin ar4 where the doc maximum and low nitrate concentrations were observed total dissolved cd re u and ni concentrations showed a minimum whereas a maximum was observed at that site for fe mn and co in swamp waters total dissolved fe mn and co were enriched in comparison to the main channel waters whereas total dissolved cd ni cs re v cr pb cu and mo were relatively low in swamp waters other elements such as as ba rb sr and zn showed similar concentrations in the mainstem and swamp waters 4 discussion 4 1 distributions of doc nutrients and trace elements seasonal variations of doc nutrients and trace elements were observed in the atchafalaya river basin as well as the mississippi and red rivers figs 3 4 and supplementary tables 2 4 and supplementary figs 2 4 where applicable these observations are similar to previous reports for the main channel shen et al 2012 duan et al 2007 2010 bianchi et al 2004 dubois et al 2010 shiller 1997 2002 stolpe et al 2010 the seasonal variations of doc nutrients and some trace elements in the mississippi river have been suggested to result from temporal changes in relative tributary contributions e g ohio missouri and upper mississippi rivers to the mississippi river main stem shen et al 2012 duan and bianchi 2006 bianchi et al 2004 2007 duan et al 2007 2010 shiller 1997 2002 and from redox effects shiller 1997 2002 shiller and stephens 2005 this may also lead to seasonal variability of the chemical constituents in the atchafalaya river since the mississippi river is the major hydrological contributor to the atchafalaya river accounting for typically 85 of the atchafalaya river discharge similar to previous observations within the atchafalaya river basin doc was enriched in swamp waters e g stations ars1 ars3 relative to main channel river waters likely due to decomposition of plant detritus and doc production in the swamp cai et al 2016 shen et al 2012 lambou and hern 1983 battle and mihuc 2000 nitrate and phosphate were however depleted in atchafalaya river basin swamp waters this is typical in swamp waters and is generally the result of biological activity such as uptake and or denitrification as well as ammonification lindau et al 2008 scaroni et al 2010 2011 strohm et al 2007 and formation of ferrous phosphate minerals e g vivianite under organic enriched anoxic conditions withers and jarvie 2008 house 2003 the high ammonium concentrations in swamp waters may have been derived from decomposition of wetland vegetation as observed in other natural wetlands garcía garcía et al 2009 swamp waters were enriched with total dissolved 0 45 µm fe mn and co while cd cu mo re sr and v were depleted relative to the concentrations in the main channel waters this is likely due to reductive dissolution fe mn and co adsorptive loss into the sediment mo re u and v and or formation of mineral phases cd cu under reducing conditions in swamp sediments pore waters tribovillard et al 2006 elbaz poulichet et al 1997 jacobs et al 1985 shea and helz 1988 jiann et al 2005 in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river some metals co varied with other metals for example there were positive correlations between colloidal fe and colloidal co cr cs pb and zn and between colloidal mn and only colloidal co not with others for mn regardless of season in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river fig 5 and supplementary figs 5 and 6 in contrast in the 0 02 µm dissolved phase fe was not correlated with co cr cs pb and zn the similar distributions of cr cs pb and zn in the colloidal phase suggest either their adsorption onto fe mn oxy hydroxides and concurrent removal zachara et al 2001 means et al 1978 johnson et al 1992 brick and moore 1996 shiller 1997 pokrovsky and schott 2002 gossuin et al 2002 and or the same sources i e mississippi or red rivers for the colloidal tes however these fe metal relationships were not observed in swamp waters this is probably related with great concentration differences between fe and other elements in that fe concentrations both phases were at least 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than other elements in swamp waters which hinders observation of small changes of these elements relative to fe or it may simply reflect more metal organic matter complexation relative to metal fe hydroxides in organic rich swamp water than river main channel waters grybos et al 2007 for as ni and rb regardless of size we do not observe any correlation with ph doc or colloidal fe mn and this is probably due to other parameters having the dominant influence on their behaviors e g sulfur or clay minerals cempel and nikel 2006 ferguson and gavis 1972 butterman and reese 2003 with other biogeochemical parameters such as doc and ph however we have not observed correlations supplementary figs 7 9 that have commonly been observed in other systems in particular fe and mn often co vary with doc and ph as for acid leachable metals under low oxygen thus significant correlations between fe mn and doc or ph have been commonly reported in wetland systems shim et al 2017 mora et al 2010 olivie lauquet et al 2001 pokrovsky and schott 2002 küchler et al 1994 viers et al 1997 2000 brick and moore 1996 this good correlation implies that there can be a single dominant process affecting te distribution in some wetlands systems such as activity of microorganisms olivie lauquet et al 2001 or biological macrophytes perennial tree uptake viers et al 2005 though these activities would likely occur in the atchafalaya river basin as well nonetheless our observations suggest that the te distributions in the atchafalaya river basin were governed not by the single dominant factor but by the combination of multiple parameters such as hydrological regime redox conditions ph doc and biological plant and microbial activity as well as changing proportions in and of the different element sources red river mississippi river and swamp 4 2 contributions of doc nutrients and trace elements from the red river and wetlands 4 2 1 input from the red river as mentioned earlier the atchafalaya river is comprised of the combined flow of the entire red river discharge and a fraction of the mississippi river typically 85 of the discharge of the atchafalaya is mississippi river water fig 2 note that because our first sampling site ar1 was located 60 km downstream from where the red river enters the atchafalaya river there may be floodplain input or removal in that 60 km reach see below and table 1 thus in the estimates in this section instead of using actual concentrations at ar 1 we used theoretical concentrations of chemical constituents estimated assuming conservative mixing between red and mississippi rivers waters during our sampling periods the red river contributed 9 13 of the atchafalaya river water table 1 however despite its relatively low hydrological contribution the red river contribution to the atchafalaya river flux of some constituents exceeded its hydrological contribution for example due to the substantially higher doc concentration in the red river than in the mississippi river supplementary tables 2 4 doc from the red river accounted for over 20 of the doc entering the atchafalaya river basin i e red mississippi rivers during april 2010 and june 2011 and 10 for november 2010 shen et al 2012 roughly estimated the red river as contributing about 13 of the doc flux in the atchafalaya river basin red mississippi rivers swamp which is comparable with our estimate in contrast due to the low nitrate in the red river 10 µmol kg compared with the mississippi river 100 µmol kg the red river diluted the mississippi river s nitrate by about 10 phosphate and silicate were also usually lower in the red river than in the mississippi river the red river was a significant source to the atchafalaya river for some tes table 1 during april 2010 and june 2011 the red river contributed 20 of the total dissolved 0 45 µm co cr cs mn fe pb rb and zn inputs from the mississippi and red rivers i e an amount in excess of the red river s contribution to the atchafalaya discharge this was due to the 5 10 fold higher red river concentrations of these elements as compared with the mississippi river during november 2010 the red river contributions of these elements were relatively low in comparison to the other two periods because of both seasonally low red river concentrations and also the low red river discharge contribution to the atchafalaya river manganese was the most extreme case in that its concentration was 45 fold higher in the red river than the mississippi river during april 2010 and 5 10 fold greater during november 2010 and june 2011 this indicates that about 87 of mn loading into the atchafalaya river basin was derived from the red river during april 2010 and 40 for other two periods thus the red river can play a disproportionate role relative to its water discharge in the supply of some constituents doc and certain trace elements into the atchafalaya river basin though it is still usually not the main source of these constituents to the basin or the louisiana shelf in table 1 we compare estimates of the initial composition of the atchafalaya river basin based on conservative discharge weighted mixing of red and mississippi rivers concentrations with observed concentrations at ar1 differences between the two numbers reflect both non conservative mixing e g adsorption desorption due to differences in ph doc and spm as well as additional inputs to the atchafalaya river as it flows through the northern part of the floodplain among doc and nutrients only phosphate during one sampling november 2010 was observed to mix non conservatively among the trace elements 0 45 µm as ba co cs cr cu fe ni re rb and v always mixed roughly conservatively only mn was observed to behave non conservatively during all three sampling campaigns showing removal in april and november 2010 but addition during june 2011 during april 2010 pb showed addition with only mn showing removal during november 2010 cd mo po4 sr u and zn showed addition with mn again being the only element to show removal during june 2011 mn and pb showed addition with no elements showing removal note that although overland flow of mississippi river water due to the opening of the morganza spillway in may june 2011 provided an extra input to the atchafalaya river the extra 2800 m3 s flow through the spillway scott et al 2014 only changed the water mixing ratio slightly even assuming that all of this flow reached ar1 which it did not because mixing experiments were not performed it is difficult to ascribe causes to the apparent non conservative behaviors however because the upper atchafalaya river is highly leveed it seems more likely that observed increases in constituent concentrations are due to desorption processes or hyporheic input rather than to an overland input from the surrounding floodplain we also note that the least amount of non conservative behavior was observed during typical high discharge april 2010 and the greatest amount during the lowest discharge november 2010 this either indicates that at low discharge additional sources hyporheic or anthropogenic are relatively more important or that with increased velocity at high discharge river flow would be too fast to fully interact with floodplains the observation that mn is the only constituent to show removal may indicate that the mississippi river is seeding the more mn rich red river waters with mn removing microbial activity e g shiller and stephens 2005 4 2 2 interaction with wetlands in the atchafalaya river basin another important factor potentially altering the chemical constituents in the atchafalaya river basin is the interactions with the wetlands floodplain in the mid to lower basin though conservative behavior appears to characterize the mixing of most of the tes up to the initial atchafalaya river sampling location ar1 concentration changes going downstream are not always smooth or monotonic for instance during april and november 2010 the mid basin ar4 showed increased concentrations of doc co fe mn and zn and decreased concentrations of nitrate silicate cd cr and ni relative to surrounding stations figs 3 and 4 supplementary figs 2 4 a similar phenomenon was observed at arw2 see supplementary figs 2 4 compositionally the observed concentration changes at ar4 and arw2 are consistent with what would be expected from input of water from the wetlands however the fact that those changes do not persist downstream suggests that these sampling sites were at locations of incomplete mixing of wetland and river water nonetheless these more swamp like element distributions in mid basin clearly indicate that there was an input or interaction from the surrounding wetlands either by overland flow or groundwater in table 1 we also compare the concentrations of chemical constituents between the input to the basin at ar1 and the output from the lower atchafalaya river basin to understand the modification created by interaction between river water and the floodplain for the lower atchafalaya river basin output we used a flow weighted average of our samples at the mouth of the river ar10 and at the wax lake delta arwl except in june 2011 when we used the concentration at ar6 as noted above the ar1 composition already accounts for the red river input and in stream process e g biological uptake desorption hyporheic interaction up to that point as well as some of the extra mississippi river input through the morganza floodway in june 2011 the doc output concentrations differed little from the input during all our sampling periods with concentration variations 15 µmol kg or 5 between in output suggesting insignificant doc input or sources and sinks were balanced for nutrients during april and november 2010 the differences of export relative to input for nitrate and silicate were insignificant however during june 2011 nitrate was removed by 23 µmol kg or 31 relative to the concentration at ar1 while river flows the atchafalaya river basin our result is similar to that of scott et al 2014 who likewise found about 30 removal of nitrate in the basin during june 2011 which they attributed to denitrification phosphate was removed by 0 3 µmol kg in the atchafalaya river basin during april 2010 whereas during the other two sampling campaigns the input output differences were insignificant for trace elements 0 45 µm some showed different seasonal behaviors removal or addition and changes in the magnitudes of their input output differences for example during april 2010 only mn varied significantly with addition of over 100 nmol kg while other elements varied within our limitation 20 during november 2010 mn was again the only element showing an increase while cd mo u and zn decreased slightly but by and large most elements were unchanged during passage through the basin however during june 2011 more elements were affected than at the other two times including apparent removal of cd cr cs cu fe and u as well as input of mn our swamp water results generally support the idea that the input output concentration differences are due to input removal by the wetlands that is although there were significant spatial variations in concentrations in our swamp samples nonetheless the swamp water samples were greatly enriched in mn and fe november only and depleted in cd cs cr cu fe and u relative to the concentrations in main river channel waters table 1 fig 4 manganese was the most extreme in that its average concentrations were 10 fold greater 10 in june 2011 and 100 greater in april and november 2010 in swamp waters than in main river channel water this suggests that even small amounts of swamp water introduction into the river could significantly modify for mn in main river channel water particularly during flooding or high river discharge periods with better hydrological connectivity seasonally or with respect to river stage we observed that more elements were affected by the passage through the basin during the highest river discharge in june 2011 than at the other times this is likely a consequence of the morganza spillway opening which resulted in up to 27 of the water passing through the basin via overland flow stated another way this was enough volume to fill the lower atchafalaya river basin to about 1 7 m during peak flooding and resulted in the inundation of large areas that are rarely exposed to flood waters falcini et al 2012 scott et al 2014 in a sense as suggested by scott et al 2014 the opening of the morganza spillway and resultant induced interaction between substantial quantities of mississippi river water and the floodplain was a large scale diversion experiment this experiment shows the potential of and possible limits on the floodplain s ability to alter fluvial te fluxes in contrast during low river discharge the hydrological connectivity between river and swamp can be very poor additionally immediately before and during our low discharge sampling november 2010 there was no precipitation in the atchafalaya river basin thus the chemical flux alterations we observed then were not likely derived from overland or rain associated groundwater inputs we suggest interactions with the hyporheic zone as the probable mechanism for our low flow changes boano et al 2010 shim et al 2017 finally we note that during our april 2010 typical high river flow sampling we observed the fewest alterations of trace elements in the atchafalaya river basin suggesting that the additional interactions via swamp or hyporheic zone were at a minimum relative to the river discharge interestingly our result showing the fewest number of te alterations during typical high flow in april 2010 is similar to observations in the nearby pearl river basin which has a similar climate and ecosystem to our study site in that study shim et al 2017 also reported minimal wetland contribution to pearl river te fluxes during high river discharge shim et al 2017 suggested that the wetland inputs to the river may have been limited at high discharge due to the faster flushing of water than input removal rates of biogeochemical processes they suggested that moderate discharge periods are just right for the river wetlands interactions allowing both river wetland connectivity and residence time for sustaining biogeochemical processes particularly for the pearl river basin for the atchafalaya basin this sort of rate limitation rennert and rinklebe 2010 may also be exacerbated by the leveeing of the system which further limits hydrological connectivity between river channel and floodplain nonetheless it is important to recognize that though both studies reported similar chemical alterations in river water interacting with floodplains wetlands the seasons of the maximum chemical alterations upon hydrological regimes can be completely different due to a basin s physiographic configuration which may be related with river flood pulse as well as riverscape heterogeneity tockner et al 2000 our estimates of the impact of red river and floodplain wetland contributions to the flux of material through the atchafalaya river suggest that in most instances the red river has the greater impact table 1 only for mn was the impact of the wetlands including hyporheic effects a dominant factor during all sampling periods even doc showed negligible within our uncertainty addition from the wetlands this contrasts with the conclusion of shen et al 2012 who found a substantial doc increase 150 in the atchafalaya relative to the mississippi river which they attributed to wetland inputs this difference in our conclusions might have resulted from shen et al having made too low an estimate of red river doc from the usgs total organic carbon data they used for the red river contribution alternatively the difference may also be due to inter annual variations in that several of their lower atchafalaya river doc concentrations were much higher than all of our determinations we also note that our estimates of fluxes are based on the 0 45 µm dissolved load and do not include the particulate forms which would likely have a large increase in total export during floods such as june 2011 falcini et al 2012 but have been retained during other flow conditions reiman et al 2018 also our snapshot sampling though designed to highlight distinct flow regimes may bias our understanding of the annual impact of wetland interactions thus to fully understand the relative contributions of wetlands and the red river to atchafalaya river fluxes future studies should utilize more frequent time series sampling regardless of the source s of chemical alterations of the atchafalaya river water fluxes of most of the chemical constituents we studied were significantly modified during their transit through the river basin this suggests that the chemical modification in the atchafalaya river basin significantly alters the flux of material reaching the louisiana shelf recently based on surface water δ18o and δ2h strauss et al 2012 suggested that louisiana shelf water was mainly influenced by the atchafalaya river during july 2008 similarly based on the δ18o salinity relationship of the shelf surface middle and bottom waters joung and shiller 2014 suggested a considerable freshwater influence of the atchafalaya river on the louisiana shelf during june july 2009 these findings indicate that during times of shelf bottom water hypoxia the atchafalaya river freshwater influence could be more or equally important for dissolved phases of chemical constituents in the shelf surface than the mississippi river delta outflow despite the lower overall outflow of the atchafalaya given our estimates of the chemical modification of atchafalaya river water this could well impact the establishment maintenance and ecosystem effects of louisiana shelf hypoxia 5 conclusions investigation of temporal and spatial variations of trace elements doc nutrients and other biogeochemical properties in the atchafalaya river as well as the mississippi and red rivers provides important information regarding the chemical transport to the louisiana shelf our results indicate that te distributions in floodplain swamp and associated river waters in atchafalaya river basin were not governed by a single dominant factor but by combinations of multiple biogeochemical processes as well as by relative mixing ratios of source waters seasonal trends of atchafalaya river chemical constituents generally followed those in the mississippi river due to the major hydrological contribution of the mississippi river to the atchafalaya river i e 85 despite its low hydrological contribution relative to the mississippi river red river contributions for some chemicals doc co cr cs fe mn pb rb and zn were significant and exceeded its hydrological contribution 10 of atchafalaya river discharge e g accounting for 40 of mn loading to the lower atchafalaya river interestingly during all our study periods the red river effects on constituent concentrations were generally greater than the effects of the floodplain wetlands though some tes did show observable wetlands impact during all our sampling campaigns mn was only the element that showed consistent addition from wetlands to river while some others were at times removed cd cs u cr fe and cu removed in june 2011 cd u zn and mo removed in november 2010 no downstream decrease in april 2010 our results show that chemical alterations in the atchafalaya river basin were greatest during june 2011 due to the abnormally high river flow and resulting extra inputs through wetlands that were rarely exposed to flooding overall the atchafalaya river with its chemical modification of mississippi river water via contributions from the red river and interactions with floodplain wetlands plays a critical role in chemical distributions on the louisiana shelf thus the atchafalaya river contribution should be adequately accounted for in biogeochemical studies and models of trace elements and nutrients on the louisiana shelf particularly

8626,the abundance and fluxes of selected dissolved trace elements te nutrients and dissolved organic carbon doc were quantified in the atchafalaya river basin to better understand its influence on the chemical regime of the louisiana shelf a region where bottom water hypoxia occurs annually during late spring to early fall water samples were collected from throughout the entire atchafalaya river basin including from the mississippi and red rivers as well as basin swamp waters during april and november 2010 and june 2011 which represent typical high and low and unusual high river discharges respectively within the total dissolved 0 45 µm pool most of the tes were mainly partitioned to the 0 02 µm dissolved phase with the exception of cr cs fe pb and zn which were dominantly in the colloidal 0 02 0 45 µm phase in the atchafalaya river seasonal concentration variations in nutrients doc and most tes were similar to those in the mississippi river reflecting a major contribution of water from the mississippi river contributions of the red river to the atchafalaya river s doc and nutrients were estimated to be 1 35 similar to previous estimates for this system the red river contribution to the fluxes of co cr cs fe mn pb rb and zn was generally disproportionally high 20 exceeding its hydrological contribution 10 to the atchafalaya river due to greatly enriched concentrations of these elements in the red river the atchafalaya river basin wetland floodplain contribution to chemical constituents was noticeable accounting for more than a 20 decrease of some elements cd cs cr cu fe mo p u and zn mn was the only element with persistent addition during all sampling campaigns however the contributions from the red river were greater than the wetland floodplain contributions for doc nutrients and most of tes except mn suggesting that the red river plays a disproportionate role in regulating water quality in the atchafalaya river overall the atchafalaya river with its chemical modification of mississippi river water via contributions from the red river and interactions with floodplain wetlands plays a critical role in chemical distributions on the louisiana shelf in the northern gulf of mexico thus the atchafalaya river contribution should be adequately accounted for in biogeochemical studies and models of trace elements and nutrients on the louisiana shelf particularly during periods of bottom water hypoxia keywords atchafalaya river basin wetlands trace elements nutrients dissolved organic carbon 1 introduction freshwater wetlands including marshes floodplains and swamps are an interface between the land and river water and play an important role in regulating water quality in rivers and ultimately the estuaries and coastal zones fed by those rivers correll et al 1992 cai et al 2016 in fact some wetlands are utilized for the treatment of waste waters polluted with nutrients heavy metals and organic contaminants verhoeven et al 2006 and references therein mays and edwards 2001 wetlands in lower floodplains also could play a significant role in the productivity and water quality of coastal ecosystems by regulating nutrient and organic matter transport to the coastal ocean verhoeven et al 2006 thus biogeochemical processes in these wetland systems may additionally impact other coastal environmental processes such as bottom water hypoxia despite their potentially great importance the role of floodplain wetlands in affecting the coastal ocean is not well understood particularly along the louisiana coast in the northern gulf of mexico where bottom waters experience seasonal hypoxia rabalais et al 2010 many biogeochemical processes can affect the distributions of chemical constituents from wetlands in general nutrients dissolved organic matter dom and major and trace element te distributions within wetlands systems can be affected by biological uptake junk et al 1989 bayley 1995 fisher and acreman 2004 weis and weis 2004 microbial activity chow et al 2013 mulholland 1981 roden and wetzel 1996 hamilton et al 1997 adsorption onto particles olivie lauquet et al 2001 redox processes olivie lauquet et al 2001 sedimentation grybos et al 2007 and seasonal hydrological changes such as extent of flooding kerr et al 2008 thus depending on the seasonal and temporal variations of environmental conditions wetlands can act as either sinks e g emmett et al 1994 fisher and acreman 2004 khan and brush 1994 or sources rücker and schrautzer 2010 kerr et al 2008 christopher et al 2006 seyler and boaventura 2003 dawson et al 2008 mulholland 1981 noe and hupp 2007 hansson et al 2005 kinsman costello et al 2016 indeed other recent studies have also suggested that wetlands can be both material sources and sinks depending on the seasonal changes in hydrology as well as chemical speciation of the element for instance cai et al 2016 and shim et al 2017 investigated floodplain wetland influence on carbon speciation and tes in a southern mississippi louisiana east pearl river system having similar climate and physiographic characteristics to the study area discussed here based on a mass balance approach of annual c fluxes cai et al 2016 revealed that the pearl river wetlands could reduce the dissolved inorganic and particulate organic carbon export fluxes by 24 and 40 respectively but enhance the annual riverine doc export by 25 at the same time shim et al 2017 reported downstream variations of tes in the east pearl river which were linked to river stage specifically they noted a downstream increase by 20 or more of tes e g fe mn zn cd that was observed only during moderately high discharge but not during the highest and low river discharges they interpreted their observations as indicating inputs from floodplain wetlands during moderately high river discharge rate limiting of wetland inputs during the highest river discharges and saltwater intrusion as well as hyporheic zone interactions during low river discharge the atchafalaya river carries about 30 of the combined flow of the mississippi and red rivers and the basin of the atchafalaya contains the largest wetlands in north america ford and nyman 2011 although the atchafalaya river is a significant contributor of water and other fluvial materials to the louisiana shelf studies of how the atchafalaya river basin wetlands modify the fluxes of nutrients and doc are still limited scott et al 2014 shen et al 2012 turner et al 2007 lane et al 2002 and the basin s effect on dissolved te fluxes has yet to be determined so far studies of the atchafalaya river basin s role on chemical constituents have found significant doc and nutrient alterations in the basin shen et al 2012 reported that doc was about 150 higher in the atchafalaya river compared to the mississippi river due to the input from wetland waters in the atchafalaya river basin lambou and hern 1983 explained that the increased doc in atchafalaya river waters was due to primary production within overflow areas during high river discharge relative to low river discharge turner and rabalais 1991 reported relatively lower nitrate and silicate 31 and 6 respectively and higher total phosphorous 30 in the atchafalaya river than in the mississippi river and suggested that these differences were probably due to differences in the contribution from the red river however nitrate input from the red river was found to be negligible accounting for 3 in comparison to total loading of nitrate from the mississippi river turner et al 2007 xu 2006 reported about 27 removal of total kjeldahl nitrogen by comparing composition of waters entering and exiting the atchafalaya river basin the removal was closely related to the interaction of river water with the swamp where denitrification was found to be a major process for nitrogen removal xu 2006 lindau et al 2008 scaroni et al 2011 during the 2011 flooding of the atchafalaya basin scott et al 2014 demonstrated floodplain reduction of the atchafalaya river s nitrate load and a small increase in phosphate and ammonium loads reiman et al 2018 examined the flux of total recoverable metals through the atchafalaya basin however for most elements their method determines a largely particulate metal fraction of their unfiltered samples thus not surprisingly they found that the atchafalaya wetlands were a sink for total recoverable metals just as they are for suspended sediments however this provides limited insight into how the wetlands affect transport of metals in the dissolved and colloidal phases which is likely the more important bioactive phase for most trace elements despite this prior work no studies have yet examined the effect of the atchafalaya river basin on dissolved te fluxes to the louisiana shelf clearly though various processes including biological uptake microbial remineralization of organic matter and changing redox state as well as input from the red and mississippi rivers could affect trace element distributions in the basin therefore we hypothesize that 1 chemical contributions from the red river and wetland interactions can be significant altering the chemical compositions of the atchafalaya river and 2 red river and wetland contributions vary seasonally following the changes in river discharges and floodplain inundation herein we report our investigations of doc nutrient and dissolved trace element distributions in waters from the atchafalaya river basin including the main river channels and surface waters of the surrounding swamps the objective of this study was to quantify the contributions from the red river and wetlands within the basin to chemical fluxes through the atchafalaya river to the louisiana shelf during different flow stages 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description ford and nyman 2011 characterize the atchafalaya river basin as having one of the largest and most undeveloped floodplains in north america fig 1 agriculture is common upstream in the atchafalaya river basin while downstream it retains pristine river floodplain forest including bayous lakes and swamps which extend about 120 km in length north to south and 25 35 km in width ford and nyman 2011 the eastern and western boundaries are constrained by artificial levees to prevent flooding and levees on river itself have isolated large portions of the floodplain from the atchafalaya river at all but the highest river stages during the spring flood pulse fontenot et al 2001 construction activities related to navigation flood control and oil and gas canals have altered the historic water flow patterns reduced water circulation and a large portion of wetland areas in atchafalaya river basin are experiencing low dissolved oxygen concentrations fontenot et al 2001 sabo et al 1999 sampling locations fig 1 were chosen to include the major water sources to the atchafalaya river basin mississippi and red rivers the main exits for water into atchafalaya bay including the mouth of the atchafalaya river and the wax lake outlet plus other sites in the main channels and swamps throughout the basin swamp sampling sites ars1 3 were located in the upper part of the atchafalaya swamp and include the swamp inner channel ars3 which frequently connects to the main river channel however during june 2011 when parts of the atchafalaya river basin were flooded due to the opening of the morganza spillway some adjustment of the sampling locations was necessary that is the ar 4 5 and 7 10 arwl and ars3 sites were not accessible due to flooding also at that time we were not able to access the exact same swamp sites as in the previous sampling campaigns and so water samples were collected near the previous sites supplementary table 4 2 2 sample collection sampling campaigns were conducted during april and november 2010 and june 2011 with different river stages river discharges in april and november 2010 were at high and low stages that are typical of the annual river flow cycle fig 2 and supplementary fig 1 during june 2011 unusually high mississippi river discharge resulted in the opening of the morganza spillway inundating large areas of swamp and floodplains in the atchafalaya river basin the spillway is designed to reduce downstream flood pressure in the lowermost mississippi river basin during major flood events this was only the second time the spillway was opened since its completion in 1954 surface waters were collected for nutrient dissolved organic carbon doc and trace element analysis immediately after collection nutrient and doc samples were filtered in the field using 0 45 µm pore size filters whatman puradisc and kept in an iced cooler for transport back to the lab where they were frozen until analysis trace element samples were collected at the same time as nutrients and doc using clean sampling techniques shiller 2003 specifically an acid cleaned polyethylene bottle was attached to a non metallic pole approximately 5 m length and the bottle was rinsed 3 times with ambient water after sample collection the sample bottle was tightly capped and doubly bagged in new plastic zipper bags and stored in an iced cooler these samples were then filtered using 0 45 µm whatman puradisc and 0 02 µm whatman anotop pore size filters using acid cleaned syringes for total dissolved 0 45 µm and the 0 02 µm dissolved fractions respectively shiller 2003 the colloidal 0 02 0 45 µm phase was determined by the difference between the 0 45 µm and 0 02 µm dissolved fractions this filtration was conducted in a small plastic tent within 2 8 h of sample collection the trace element samples were subsequently acidified in our clean lab to ph 2 by addition of ultra clean 6 m hcl seastar baseline a small boat was used for the stations that were not accessible by foot for ancillary data portable sensors were used for the determination of conductivity salinity and temperature model 30 ysi inc and ph oakton ph 110 series usa 2 3 measurements of nutrients doc and trace elements the frozen nutrient and doc samples were thawed overnight at room temperature just before the measurements nutrients were analyzed using an astoria pacific a2c2 nutrient auto analyzer astoria pacific international oregon usa the detection limits for nutrients were 0 1 0 05 and 1 µmol l for nitrate phosphate and silicate respectively concentrations of doc were determined using a shimadzu toc v total organic carbon analyzer employing the high temperature combustion method guo et al 1995 for doc measurements samples were acidified with concentrated hcl to ph 2 immediately before measurement to remove all the dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations were calculated using calibration curves that were generated at the beginning of the sample analysis certified doc standards university of miami and ultrapure water were measured every eight samples during the run as samples to check the performance of the instrument to ensure the data quality three to five measurements were made for each sample and the precision was 2 the te sample analysis was followed well established procedures which can be found elsewhere e g shiller 2003 joung and shiller 2016 shim et al 2017 boyle et al 2012 briefly samples were analyzed using a sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer sf icp ms thermo fisher element 2 as previously described in shiller 2003 for analysis samples were diluted 33 by addition of

detection limits are shown in supplementary table 1 and the recovery of reference materials can be found in shim et al 2017 2 4 river discharge input and export fluxes estimation hydrological data was obtained from the us army corps of engineers http www mvn usace army mil for the red river input to the atchafalaya river basin the daily discharge from the red river at alexandria and the black river at acme la were combined fig 1 for the mississippi river flow into the atchafalaya river basin the daily discharge was obtained by subtracting the red river input from the discharge at simmesport la the mississippi river flow through the birdfoot delta was taken from the gauge at tarbert landing ms which is located below the old river control structure where the mississippi river division is located during june 2011 flood the additional mississippi river discharge to the atchafalaya river basin through the morganza spillway was obtained from scott et al 2014 we note that the hydrological imbalance between inputs discharge at simmesport plus morganza spillway for june 2011 and outputs discharge at wax lake outlet morgan city was 1 5 and 1 for april and november 2010 and june 2011 respectively to estimate the contributions of various sources to chemical fluxes in the atchafalaya river basin we started by calculating the input concentrations of constituents from the red and mississippi rivers i r f rr c rr f mr c mr where ir is the theoretical fluvial input concentration to the basin derived by assuming conservative mixing of red and mississippi river waters the f s are the percentages of water in the atchafalaya river derived from the red and mississippi river and the c s are the concentration 0 45 µm fraction of the constituent in each river we use this theoretical conservative estimate of the input concentration rather than the measured concentration at ar1 since that station is located 60 km downstream from the mixing point of the two rivers to estimate the relative contribution of the red river to the constituent flux through the basin we simply took the ratio of frr crr ir 100 contributions of wetlands floodplains to chemical flux modifications were estimated by simple concentration comparisons between the most upstream site ar1 input and the lower atchafalaya river basin flow weighted average of sites ar10 and arwl output the wetland constituent contribution proportions were calculated by output input input 100 thus negative values indicate a removal during interactions between wetlands floodplains and river water table 1 in june 2011 due to our inability to collect samples from ar10 and arwl we used concentrations of constituents at site ar6 to represent the lower atchafalaya river basin concentrations i e output for estimating the effects of red river and wetlands contributions to the atchafalaya fluxes we considered only concentration differences 20 to be significant shim et al 2017 this accounts for both analytical error and possible short term temporal variability in river concentrations as well as uncertainty in river mixing ratios and is based on the highest standard deviation i e 7 for u of the reference materials and the estimated input output discharge imbalance for the atchafalaya river basin thus 20 or greater differences represent at least twice the flux uncertainties e g shim et al 2017 for doc and nutrients we accepted differences of 10 or greater as significant variations because the standard variation of doc reference materials was typically 2 3 results river discharges varied significantly seasonally fig 2 and supplementary fig 1 discharge for the atchafalaya river at simmesport la was 10 2 103 and 2 8 103 m3 s during april and november 2010 respectively whereas it was 15 9 103 m3 s during june 2011 in june 2011 the additional mississippi river discharge to the atchafalaya river basin through the morganza spillway was 2 8 103 m3 s for the two weeks of the spillway opening scott et al 2014 results for doc nutrients tes and ancillary parameters such as ph conductivity and temperature are shown in figs 3 and 4 and supplementary figs 2 4 and supplementary tables 2 4 though seasonal variations of tes and nutrients were observed in the most eastern are1 and western arw1 sides of the basin their contributions to the fluxes in the atchafalaya river main stem are likely unimportant due to low water flows and concentrations similar to the main stem thus the data for these stations are listed in the supplementary figures and tables and not further displayed herein doc concentrations were always higher in the red river than the mississippi river during our studies fig 3 and supplementary tables 2 4 the doc concentrations showed low variability along the river from ar1 to the atchafalaya river outlets ar10 and arwl except for a doc maximum in the middle of basin ar4 during april and november 2010 in swamp waters ars1 3 doc concentrations were in general about 2 to 3 fold higher than the concentrations in the atchafalaya river main channel waters throughout the study nitrate and silicate concentrations were higher in the mississippi river than the red river in all sampling periods phosphate was also slightly higher in the mississippi river than the atchafalaya river during april and november 2010 though concentrations were comparable in both rivers during june 2011 at the mid basin station where the doc maximum was observed ar4 nitrate and silica showed a minimum during april and november 2010 however phosphate showed a minimum only in november and not in april 2010 in the lower basin ar6 10 and the wax lake outlet arwl concentrations of all studied nutrients generally showed little variability along the flow path swamp waters showed very low nitrate concentrations relative to the atchafalaya river mainstem regardless of season phosphate concentrations in waters from swamps were lower than the concentrations in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river except during june 2011 as well as waters from ars2 silicate concentrations in swamp waters were higher in comparison to main channel waters ammonia and nitrite were generally very low throughout the basin 1 of the nitrate concentrations except in swamp waters where ammonia was as high as 20 µmol kg during november 2010 supplementary tables 2 4 dissolved trace element distributions are shown in fig 4 see also supplementary tables 2 4 and supplementary figs 1 3 most of the studied trace elements were mainly in the 0 02 µm dissolved fraction except for cr cs fe pb and zn among those five elements fe and pb were the most extreme in that the 0 02 0 45 µm colloidal phase accounted for 80 of the total dissolved 0 45 µm pool for cr cs and zn the colloidal phase was considerable accounting for over 50 for many samples total dissolved 0 45 µm cd cu re u and mo concentrations were higher in the mississippi river than red river during our sampling campaigns whereas total dissolved cs fe mn and rb were higher in the red river than mississippi river other elements showed seasonal changes in which source had the higher concentration for example total dissolved ba was higher in the mississippi than red river during june 2011 but it was lower in the mississippi than red river during the other sampling campaigns in general total dissolved cd cr cs fe mn pb and zn in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river were higher during april 2010 and june 2011 than during november 2010 in contrast concentrations of total dissolved as ba cu mo ni re sr u and v were higher in the atchafalaya river mainstem during november 2010 than the other two periods other elements including total dissolved co and rb also varied seasonally but with slightly higher 5 concentrations in june relative to april and november in the mid basin ar4 where the doc maximum and low nitrate concentrations were observed total dissolved cd re u and ni concentrations showed a minimum whereas a maximum was observed at that site for fe mn and co in swamp waters total dissolved fe mn and co were enriched in comparison to the main channel waters whereas total dissolved cd ni cs re v cr pb cu and mo were relatively low in swamp waters other elements such as as ba rb sr and zn showed similar concentrations in the mainstem and swamp waters 4 discussion 4 1 distributions of doc nutrients and trace elements seasonal variations of doc nutrients and trace elements were observed in the atchafalaya river basin as well as the mississippi and red rivers figs 3 4 and supplementary tables 2 4 and supplementary figs 2 4 where applicable these observations are similar to previous reports for the main channel shen et al 2012 duan et al 2007 2010 bianchi et al 2004 dubois et al 2010 shiller 1997 2002 stolpe et al 2010 the seasonal variations of doc nutrients and some trace elements in the mississippi river have been suggested to result from temporal changes in relative tributary contributions e g ohio missouri and upper mississippi rivers to the mississippi river main stem shen et al 2012 duan and bianchi 2006 bianchi et al 2004 2007 duan et al 2007 2010 shiller 1997 2002 and from redox effects shiller 1997 2002 shiller and stephens 2005 this may also lead to seasonal variability of the chemical constituents in the atchafalaya river since the mississippi river is the major hydrological contributor to the atchafalaya river accounting for typically 85 of the atchafalaya river discharge similar to previous observations within the atchafalaya river basin doc was enriched in swamp waters e g stations ars1 ars3 relative to main channel river waters likely due to decomposition of plant detritus and doc production in the swamp cai et al 2016 shen et al 2012 lambou and hern 1983 battle and mihuc 2000 nitrate and phosphate were however depleted in atchafalaya river basin swamp waters this is typical in swamp waters and is generally the result of biological activity such as uptake and or denitrification as well as ammonification lindau et al 2008 scaroni et al 2010 2011 strohm et al 2007 and formation of ferrous phosphate minerals e g vivianite under organic enriched anoxic conditions withers and jarvie 2008 house 2003 the high ammonium concentrations in swamp waters may have been derived from decomposition of wetland vegetation as observed in other natural wetlands garcía garcía et al 2009 swamp waters were enriched with total dissolved 0 45 µm fe mn and co while cd cu mo re sr and v were depleted relative to the concentrations in the main channel waters this is likely due to reductive dissolution fe mn and co adsorptive loss into the sediment mo re u and v and or formation of mineral phases cd cu under reducing conditions in swamp sediments pore waters tribovillard et al 2006 elbaz poulichet et al 1997 jacobs et al 1985 shea and helz 1988 jiann et al 2005 in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river some metals co varied with other metals for example there were positive correlations between colloidal fe and colloidal co cr cs pb and zn and between colloidal mn and only colloidal co not with others for mn regardless of season in the mainstem of the atchafalaya river fig 5 and supplementary figs 5 and 6 in contrast in the 0 02 µm dissolved phase fe was not correlated with co cr cs pb and zn the similar distributions of cr cs pb and zn in the colloidal phase suggest either their adsorption onto fe mn oxy hydroxides and concurrent removal zachara et al 2001 means et al 1978 johnson et al 1992 brick and moore 1996 shiller 1997 pokrovsky and schott 2002 gossuin et al 2002 and or the same sources i e mississippi or red rivers for the colloidal tes however these fe metal relationships were not observed in swamp waters this is probably related with great concentration differences between fe and other elements in that fe concentrations both phases were at least 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than other elements in swamp waters which hinders observation of small changes of these elements relative to fe or it may simply reflect more metal organic matter complexation relative to metal fe hydroxides in organic rich swamp water than river main channel waters grybos et al 2007 for as ni and rb regardless of size we do not observe any correlation with ph doc or colloidal fe mn and this is probably due to other parameters having the dominant influence on their behaviors e g sulfur or clay minerals cempel and nikel 2006 ferguson and gavis 1972 butterman and reese 2003 with other biogeochemical parameters such as doc and ph however we have not observed correlations supplementary figs 7 9 that have commonly been observed in other systems in particular fe and mn often co vary with doc and ph as for acid leachable metals under low oxygen thus significant correlations between fe mn and doc or ph have been commonly reported in wetland systems shim et al 2017 mora et al 2010 olivie lauquet et al 2001 pokrovsky and schott 2002 küchler et al 1994 viers et al 1997 2000 brick and moore 1996 this good correlation implies that there can be a single dominant process affecting te distribution in some wetlands systems such as activity of microorganisms olivie lauquet et al 2001 or biological macrophytes perennial tree uptake viers et al 2005 though these activities would likely occur in the atchafalaya river basin as well nonetheless our observations suggest that the te distributions in the atchafalaya river basin were governed not by the single dominant factor but by the combination of multiple parameters such as hydrological regime redox conditions ph doc and biological plant and microbial activity as well as changing proportions in and of the different element sources red river mississippi river and swamp 4 2 contributions of doc nutrients and trace elements from the red river and wetlands 4 2 1 input from the red river as mentioned earlier the atchafalaya river is comprised of the combined flow of the entire red river discharge and a fraction of the mississippi river typically 85 of the discharge of the atchafalaya is mississippi river water fig 2 note that because our first sampling site ar1 was located 60 km downstream from where the red river enters the atchafalaya river there may be floodplain input or removal in that 60 km reach see below and table 1 thus in the estimates in this section instead of using actual concentrations at ar 1 we used theoretical concentrations of chemical constituents estimated assuming conservative mixing between red and mississippi rivers waters during our sampling periods the red river contributed 9 13 of the atchafalaya river water table 1 however despite its relatively low hydrological contribution the red river contribution to the atchafalaya river flux of some constituents exceeded its hydrological contribution for example due to the substantially higher doc concentration in the red river than in the mississippi river supplementary tables 2 4 doc from the red river accounted for over 20 of the doc entering the atchafalaya river basin i e red mississippi rivers during april 2010 and june 2011 and 10 for november 2010 shen et al 2012 roughly estimated the red river as contributing about 13 of the doc flux in the atchafalaya river basin red mississippi rivers swamp which is comparable with our estimate in contrast due to the low nitrate in the red river 10 µmol kg compared with the mississippi river 100 µmol kg the red river diluted the mississippi river s nitrate by about 10 phosphate and silicate were also usually lower in the red river than in the mississippi river the red river was a significant source to the atchafalaya river for some tes table 1 during april 2010 and june 2011 the red river contributed 20 of the total dissolved 0 45 µm co cr cs mn fe pb rb and zn inputs from the mississippi and red rivers i e an amount in excess of the red river s contribution to the atchafalaya discharge this was due to the 5 10 fold higher red river concentrations of these elements as compared with the mississippi river during november 2010 the red river contributions of these elements were relatively low in comparison to the other two periods because of both seasonally low red river concentrations and also the low red river discharge contribution to the atchafalaya river manganese was the most extreme case in that its concentration was 45 fold higher in the red river than the mississippi river during april 2010 and 5 10 fold greater during november 2010 and june 2011 this indicates that about 87 of mn loading into the atchafalaya river basin was derived from the red river during april 2010 and 40 for other two periods thus the red river can play a disproportionate role relative to its water discharge in the supply of some constituents doc and certain trace elements into the atchafalaya river basin though it is still usually not the main source of these constituents to the basin or the louisiana shelf in table 1 we compare estimates of the initial composition of the atchafalaya river basin based on conservative discharge weighted mixing of red and mississippi rivers concentrations with observed concentrations at ar1 differences between the two numbers reflect both non conservative mixing e g adsorption desorption due to differences in ph doc and spm as well as additional inputs to the atchafalaya river as it flows through the northern part of the floodplain among doc and nutrients only phosphate during one sampling november 2010 was observed to mix non conservatively among the trace elements 0 45 µm as ba co cs cr cu fe ni re rb and v always mixed roughly conservatively only mn was observed to behave non conservatively during all three sampling campaigns showing removal in april and november 2010 but addition during june 2011 during april 2010 pb showed addition with only mn showing removal during november 2010 cd mo po4 sr u and zn showed addition with mn again being the only element to show removal during june 2011 mn and pb showed addition with no elements showing removal note that although overland flow of mississippi river water due to the opening of the morganza spillway in may june 2011 provided an extra input to the atchafalaya river the extra 2800 m3 s flow through the spillway scott et al 2014 only changed the water mixing ratio slightly even assuming that all of this flow reached ar1 which it did not because mixing experiments were not performed it is difficult to ascribe causes to the apparent non conservative behaviors however because the upper atchafalaya river is highly leveed it seems more likely that observed increases in constituent concentrations are due to desorption processes or hyporheic input rather than to an overland input from the surrounding floodplain we also note that the least amount of non conservative behavior was observed during typical high discharge april 2010 and the greatest amount during the lowest discharge november 2010 this either indicates that at low discharge additional sources hyporheic or anthropogenic are relatively more important or that with increased velocity at high discharge river flow would be too fast to fully interact with floodplains the observation that mn is the only constituent to show removal may indicate that the mississippi river is seeding the more mn rich red river waters with mn removing microbial activity e g shiller and stephens 2005 4 2 2 interaction with wetlands in the atchafalaya river basin another important factor potentially altering the chemical constituents in the atchafalaya river basin is the interactions with the wetlands floodplain in the mid to lower basin though conservative behavior appears to characterize the mixing of most of the tes up to the initial atchafalaya river sampling location ar1 concentration changes going downstream are not always smooth or monotonic for instance during april and november 2010 the mid basin ar4 showed increased concentrations of doc co fe mn and zn and decreased concentrations of nitrate silicate cd cr and ni relative to surrounding stations figs 3 and 4 supplementary figs 2 4 a similar phenomenon was observed at arw2 see supplementary figs 2 4 compositionally the observed concentration changes at ar4 and arw2 are consistent with what would be expected from input of water from the wetlands however the fact that those changes do not persist downstream suggests that these sampling sites were at locations of incomplete mixing of wetland and river water nonetheless these more swamp like element distributions in mid basin clearly indicate that there was an input or interaction from the surrounding wetlands either by overland flow or groundwater in table 1 we also compare the concentrations of chemical constituents between the input to the basin at ar1 and the output from the lower atchafalaya river basin to understand the modification created by interaction between river water and the floodplain for the lower atchafalaya river basin output we used a flow weighted average of our samples at the mouth of the river ar10 and at the wax lake delta arwl except in june 2011 when we used the concentration at ar6 as noted above the ar1 composition already accounts for the red river input and in stream process e g biological uptake desorption hyporheic interaction up to that point as well as some of the extra mississippi river input through the morganza floodway in june 2011 the doc output concentrations differed little from the input during all our sampling periods with concentration variations 15 µmol kg or 5 between in output suggesting insignificant doc input or sources and sinks were balanced for nutrients during april and november 2010 the differences of export relative to input for nitrate and silicate were insignificant however during june 2011 nitrate was removed by 23 µmol kg or 31 relative to the concentration at ar1 while river flows the atchafalaya river basin our result is similar to that of scott et al 2014 who likewise found about 30 removal of nitrate in the basin during june 2011 which they attributed to denitrification phosphate was removed by 0 3 µmol kg in the atchafalaya river basin during april 2010 whereas during the other two sampling campaigns the input output differences were insignificant for trace elements 0 45 µm some showed different seasonal behaviors removal or addition and changes in the magnitudes of their input output differences for example during april 2010 only mn varied significantly with addition of over 100 nmol kg while other elements varied within our limitation 20 during november 2010 mn was again the only element showing an increase while cd mo u and zn decreased slightly but by and large most elements were unchanged during passage through the basin however during june 2011 more elements were affected than at the other two times including apparent removal of cd cr cs cu fe and u as well as input of mn our swamp water results generally support the idea that the input output concentration differences are due to input removal by the wetlands that is although there were significant spatial variations in concentrations in our swamp samples nonetheless the swamp water samples were greatly enriched in mn and fe november only and depleted in cd cs cr cu fe and u relative to the concentrations in main river channel waters table 1 fig 4 manganese was the most extreme in that its average concentrations were 10 fold greater 10 in june 2011 and 100 greater in april and november 2010 in swamp waters than in main river channel water this suggests that even small amounts of swamp water introduction into the river could significantly modify for mn in main river channel water particularly during flooding or high river discharge periods with better hydrological connectivity seasonally or with respect to river stage we observed that more elements were affected by the passage through the basin during the highest river discharge in june 2011 than at the other times this is likely a consequence of the morganza spillway opening which resulted in up to 27 of the water passing through the basin via overland flow stated another way this was enough volume to fill the lower atchafalaya river basin to about 1 7 m during peak flooding and resulted in the inundation of large areas that are rarely exposed to flood waters falcini et al 2012 scott et al 2014 in a sense as suggested by scott et al 2014 the opening of the morganza spillway and resultant induced interaction between substantial quantities of mississippi river water and the floodplain was a large scale diversion experiment this experiment shows the potential of and possible limits on the floodplain s ability to alter fluvial te fluxes in contrast during low river discharge the hydrological connectivity between river and swamp can be very poor additionally immediately before and during our low discharge sampling november 2010 there was no precipitation in the atchafalaya river basin thus the chemical flux alterations we observed then were not likely derived from overland or rain associated groundwater inputs we suggest interactions with the hyporheic zone as the probable mechanism for our low flow changes boano et al 2010 shim et al 2017 finally we note that during our april 2010 typical high river flow sampling we observed the fewest alterations of trace elements in the atchafalaya river basin suggesting that the additional interactions via swamp or hyporheic zone were at a minimum relative to the river discharge interestingly our result showing the fewest number of te alterations during typical high flow in april 2010 is similar to observations in the nearby pearl river basin which has a similar climate and ecosystem to our study site in that study shim et al 2017 also reported minimal wetland contribution to pearl river te fluxes during high river discharge shim et al 2017 suggested that the wetland inputs to the river may have been limited at high discharge due to the faster flushing of water than input removal rates of biogeochemical processes they suggested that moderate discharge periods are just right for the river wetlands interactions allowing both river wetland connectivity and residence time for sustaining biogeochemical processes particularly for the pearl river basin for the atchafalaya basin this sort of rate limitation rennert and rinklebe 2010 may also be exacerbated by the leveeing of the system which further limits hydrological connectivity between river channel and floodplain nonetheless it is important to recognize that though both studies reported similar chemical alterations in river water interacting with floodplains wetlands the seasons of the maximum chemical alterations upon hydrological regimes can be completely different due to a basin s physiographic configuration which may be related with river flood pulse as well as riverscape heterogeneity tockner et al 2000 our estimates of the impact of red river and floodplain wetland contributions to the flux of material through the atchafalaya river suggest that in most instances the red river has the greater impact table 1 only for mn was the impact of the wetlands including hyporheic effects a dominant factor during all sampling periods even doc showed negligible within our uncertainty addition from the wetlands this contrasts with the conclusion of shen et al 2012 who found a substantial doc increase 150 in the atchafalaya relative to the mississippi river which they attributed to wetland inputs this difference in our conclusions might have resulted from shen et al having made too low an estimate of red river doc from the usgs total organic carbon data they used for the red river contribution alternatively the difference may also be due to inter annual variations in that several of their lower atchafalaya river doc concentrations were much higher than all of our determinations we also note that our estimates of fluxes are based on the 0 45 µm dissolved load and do not include the particulate forms which would likely have a large increase in total export during floods such as june 2011 falcini et al 2012 but have been retained during other flow conditions reiman et al 2018 also our snapshot sampling though designed to highlight distinct flow regimes may bias our understanding of the annual impact of wetland interactions thus to fully understand the relative contributions of wetlands and the red river to atchafalaya river fluxes future studies should utilize more frequent time series sampling regardless of the source s of chemical alterations of the atchafalaya river water fluxes of most of the chemical constituents we studied were significantly modified during their transit through the river basin this suggests that the chemical modification in the atchafalaya river basin significantly alters the flux of material reaching the louisiana shelf recently based on surface water δ18o and δ2h strauss et al 2012 suggested that louisiana shelf water was mainly influenced by the atchafalaya river during july 2008 similarly based on the δ18o salinity relationship of the shelf surface middle and bottom waters joung and shiller 2014 suggested a considerable freshwater influence of the atchafalaya river on the louisiana shelf during june july 2009 these findings indicate that during times of shelf bottom water hypoxia the atchafalaya river freshwater influence could be more or equally important for dissolved phases of chemical constituents in the shelf surface than the mississippi river delta outflow despite the lower overall outflow of the atchafalaya given our estimates of the chemical modification of atchafalaya river water this could well impact the establishment maintenance and ecosystem effects of louisiana shelf hypoxia 5 conclusions investigation of temporal and spatial variations of trace elements doc nutrients and other biogeochemical properties in the atchafalaya river as well as the mississippi and red rivers provides important information regarding the chemical transport to the louisiana shelf our results indicate that te distributions in floodplain swamp and associated river waters in atchafalaya river basin were not governed by a single dominant factor but by combinations of multiple biogeochemical processes as well as by relative mixing ratios of source waters seasonal trends of atchafalaya river chemical constituents generally followed those in the mississippi river due to the major hydrological contribution of the mississippi river to the atchafalaya river i e 85 despite its low hydrological contribution relative to the mississippi river red river contributions for some chemicals doc co cr cs fe mn pb rb and zn were significant and exceeded its hydrological contribution 10 of atchafalaya river discharge e g accounting for 40 of mn loading to the lower atchafalaya river interestingly during all our study periods the red river effects on constituent concentrations were generally greater than the effects of the floodplain wetlands though some tes did show observable wetlands impact during all our sampling campaigns mn was only the element that showed consistent addition from wetlands to river while some others were at times removed cd cs u cr fe and cu removed in june 2011 cd u zn and mo removed in november 2010 no downstream decrease in april 2010 our results show that chemical alterations in the atchafalaya river basin were greatest during june 2011 due to the abnormally high river flow and resulting extra inputs through wetlands that were rarely exposed to flooding overall the atchafalaya river with its chemical modification of mississippi river water via contributions from the red river and interactions with floodplain wetlands plays a critical role in chemical distributions on the louisiana shelf thus the atchafalaya river contribution should be adequately accounted for in biogeochemical studies and models of trace elements and nutrients on the louisiana shelf particularly

8627,to study the atmospheric moisture transport processes from the source to a receiver region isotopic analysis of rainwater from port blair as source region the andaman islands bay of bengal has been carried out in addition to the island site rainwater collected at three sites on the indian mainland as receiver region namely nagpur kolkata and tezpur has also been isotopically analyzed we present a daily variation of long term 2012 2015 record of rain isotope from port blair to understand the moisture dynamics on a sub seasonal timescale it was observed that the port blair rainwater oxygen isotope ratios δ18o maintain a temporally dependent correlation with the average rainfall over the core monsoon zone cmz of india though the seasonal rainfall over these two regions appears to be mutually independent rain isotopes are controlled more by the moisture dynamics rather than the individual rainfall events consequently the correlation between rainfall over the cmz and δ18o of port blair rain provides conclusive evidence of the transport of the bay of bengal bob moisture to the central and the northeast indian regions during the summer monsoon season the spatial dependency of port blair rain isotopes with the cmz rain shows interannual variability and also indicates different pathways of the bob moisture to the indian mainland within a given season the pathways of the source moisture to the receiver are identified by the trajectory analysis with port blair being the source area we observed analogous variation in δ18o of island rain and that of the mainland rain and δ18o at these two regions is modulated by the monsoon intra seasonal oscillation miso the correlation between the two isotopic records appears to arise from the propagation of the rain cloud band from the bay to the indian landmass and the associated moisture transport linked to the miso keywords monsoon rain isotope bay of bengal moisture transport 1 introduction atmospheric moisture transport processes is an essential component of the earth s hydrological cycle the bob possesses certain unique characteristics which are believed to play an important role in moisture generation and transport process for example it maintains relatively high sea surface temperature sst especially during the monsoon season than the rest of the indian ocean which often exceeds 28 c favoring convection shenoi et al 2002 the northern bob is also characterized by the genesis of low pressure systems lps which often move westward over india that cause heavy rain over central and northern india sikka 1977 goswami 1987 mooley and shukla 1989 krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 the monsoon intra seasonal oscillation miso modulates the frequency of occurrence of the lps with 4 5 times more number of lps occurring during active phases compared to the break phases goswami and xavier 2005 thus the contribution of bob moisture to the monsoon rain is likely to be modulated strongly on intraseasonal timescales therefore characterization of sources and transport of bob moisture to the core monsoon zone cmz of india on the intraseasonal time scale is critical in understanding the seasonal mean monsoon as well as monsoon intraseasonal variability several techniques have been proposed to study the dynamical behavior of moisture for example isotopic analysis of rainfall is considered to be a reliable means of identifying the moisture source region isotopic evidence of bob vapor reaching the eastern and north eastern regions of india has been provided by several investigators sengupta and sarkar 2006 breitenbach et al 2010 gupta et al 2005 but these studies rely on the isotopic analysis of rainfall from sites located in the mainland thus unable to observe any isotopic variation that would have taken place during its transit from the source region in bob the basic premise of identifying the bob derived rainfall is its depleted isotopic values relative to that of the rainfall originated through the arabian sea moisture delaygue et al 2001 kumar et al 2010 midhun et al 2018 but the isotopic depletion in rainfall may also be caused by other processes such as organized convection lekshmy et al 2014 it has also been argued that the rainfall isotopic compositions may not reflect moisture sources but cumulative convective processes from the source region to the deposition site galewsky et al 2016 this may imply that the rainfall characterizing the isotopic signatures of the arabian sea and bob water would be obliterated when precipitated in the mainland region but such a generalization may undermine the intricate relationship between the moisture transport and building up of the convective systems since these two processes are intricately related their effects on rainwater isotopic composition need to be studied through an integrated approach these studies are important since the isotopic studies are potentially useful to quantify the moisture dynamical process such an approach has recently been reported by dar and ghosh 2017 however some issues such as timescale of the moisture transport its interaction with the large scale convective processes vis à vis isotopic fractionation of rainwater have not been studied yet isotopic studies have also been attempted to understand how the arabian sea and the bob branch of circulation influence the rainfall at a given place midhun et al 2018 demonstrated that the spatial distribution of rain isotopic composition across an east west transect in northern india was characterized by high and low values according to these authors the high values were governed by the arabian sea circulation while the bob circulation was responsible for the low values the dynamical behavior of moisture its genesis in the neighboring ocean and transport pathways to the indian continent has also been studied by the meteorologists findlater 1969a b krishnamurti et al 1976 pisharoty 1965 findlater 1969b saha 1970 dewan et al 1984 ordóñez et al 2012 fig 1 shows the climatological 2006 2015 vapor flux at 850 mbar for the a south west monsoon may to september and b the non monsoon november to march seasons over the south asian region it is evident from this figure that major moisture flows during the summer months to the indian landmass is sustained by a strong south westerly circulation however the moisture content of the arabian sea branch is progressively reduced due to rain out process as it reaches the middle of peninsular india bavadekar and mooley 1981 as the moist air from the arabian sea enters the indian coast it is orographically lifted by the western ghats mountain range and produces heavy rain thus the relatively dry air is recharged with moisture derived from the bay of bengal bob and moves to eastern india and northern indo gangetic plain following the wind pattern shown in fig 1 a monsoon rain over the core monsoon zone cmz rajeevan et al 2010 arises from the convergence of moisture partly coming directly from the arabian sea and partly coming from the bob it is also obvious from fig 1 b that no such strong circulation from the bob to the indian landmass is discernible during the winter season therefore an important aspect regarding the seasonal mean rainfall over central india is the partitioning of moisture source from the arabian sea and the bob as mentioned earlier the isotopic studies offer a means to identify these two sources of moisture midhun et al 2018 but the moisture transport processes is strongly modulated by other meteorological phenomena and how the isotopic properties of rainfall are related to those processes is not yet studied for example the northward propagating monsoon intraseasonal oscillations miso manifested as active and break spells of indian monsoon goswami 2012 contributes significantly to the seasonal mean rainfall goswami and xavier 2005 goswami et al 2006 the anomalous winds associated with the active break spells strengthen weaken the climatological moisture transports see fig 1 and thereby increase or decrease the contribution of bob moisture to the rainfall over the cmz how the isotopic values of rainfall are linked to the active and break phases of monsoon is yet to be characterized in this work we carried out isotopic analysis of rainfall at a source location andaman island in the bob and at a few destination sites in mainland india and endeavor to address the above mentioned issues the main objectives are 1 how do the isotopic values of rainfall in the bob compare with that at the mainland location in india 2 do the precipitation isotopes over the bob respond to the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation and in turn to the active and break phases of the monsoon 3 what are the time scales associated with the vapor transport from bob to the mainland 2 method 2 1 rainwater collection and isotopic measurements the rainfall sampling in port blair the andaman island is considered as representative of the moisture source area i e bob daily rainwater was collected at the pondicherry university campus port blair for three years 2012 2014 in 2015 rainwater was collected at the national institute of ocean technology campus which is approximately 4 km aerially north west of the university campus the cmz in central india is considered as the target area nagpur and few more sites from the mainland namely kolkata and tezpur were also considered for rainwater sampling which are known to receive moisture from bob during the summer monsoon however for the target sites daily rainwater samples have been collected for the year 2015 table 1 to collect rain samples a 2 l plastic bottle fitted with a 20 3 cm diameter funnel was used a tube was attached to the tip of the funnel that touched the bottom of the plastic bottle that helped reduce the exposed surface area additionally a table tennis ball was placed inside the funnel to avoid evaporation the amount of the rainwater sample collected in 2015 was obtained in the field and converted to rain rate mm day using a calibration equation http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf the rainfall record was also obtained from the india meteorological department imd site for all the studied years in 2015 ground level vapor was collected in port blair at the institute campus from from 24th may to 4th october table 1 using cryogenic trapping method http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents miba water vapor protocol pdf in brief a metal trap was cooled to about 80 c temperature using a mixture of ethanol and liquid nitrogen the air flow rate was controlled at 800 ml min to ensure an adequate amount 2 ml of vapor collected in 3 h 0800 1100 h a total of 107 vapor samples were collected 24th may to 4th oct no of days 134 the number of successive missing days during the entire collection period was mostly one or two except during 17 september 2015 to 25 september 2015 when vapor samples could not be collected due to unavailability of liquid nitrogen temperature relative humidity and rainfall were monitored throughout the collection period the rain and condensed vapor samples were transferred to leak proof plastic bottle and then shipped to indian institute of tropical meteorology pune for isotopic analysis the isotopic δ18o and δ2h ratios were determined using an lgr liquid water and water vapor isotope analyzer model tiwa 45 ep the overall analytical precision obtained for δ18o δ2h was about 0 1 1 2 2 spectral analysis in order to examine the spectral characteristics of the rain isotopic data fft was performed on the rainwater δ18o time series using the open software ncar command language ncl https doi org 10 5065 d6wd3xh5 the method however requires continuous data on an equal time interval since rainfall and hence its δ18o data is not available on a daily basis interpolated data were used to fill the gaps in this context it is to be noted that the interpolated isotopic values for non rainy days which are nothing but ratios of two numbers may not be physically viable but in the absence of daily data interpolated data may be the only option at least in the present context in order to give more credence to our spectral estimates we have determined the spectral peaks for vapor isotope data as well interpolation of vapor isotope data does not suffer from the same problem as the rain isotope since vapor is always present in the atmosphere hence the missing values of vapor isotope data which was not available due to logistic reason could reliably be interpolated and a continuous record generated on the other hand since the isotopic record of rainfall in the andaman region primarily reflects the isotopic composition of moisture rather than the individual rain events the spectral behavior of δ18o of moisture is expected to be manifested in rain isotopes as well with this consideration we collected vapor samples and produced a near continuous vapor isotopic record in this paper we use this dataset only to determine the spectral characteristics the other details of vapor isotope data will be presented elsewhere the missing values have been interpolated using the cubic spline both for the rain isotope chakraborty et al 2016 as well as the vapor isotope 2 3 rainfall data the rainfall station data of indian meteorological department imd at port blair 11 67 n 92 73 e was provided by the national data center imd pune the data consists of rainfall averaged over 24 h at 08 30 h daily gridded rainfall data of the tropical rain measuring mission trmm 3b42 v2 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 was used to investigate the response of rainwater δ18o to rainfall over a wider spatial scale for the year 2012 to 2014 for 2015 imd gridded rainfall data was used imd spatial gridded daily rainfall data 1951 2000 was used to calculate the daily climatology and hence the standardized daily rainfall anomaly rajeevan et al 2008 2 4 trajectory analysis forward backward trajectories were plotted using the noaa hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model stein et al 2015 in order to predict the moisture pathways and transport travel time from a source region we have calculated the mean cloud base height at the bob using an empirical formula outlined in betts and ridgway 1989 and later modified by patil parasnis 2003 accordingly the average and maximum cloud base heights were obtained as 320 m and 1720 m respectively therefore the gdas 1 global 2006 present data were used to run the hysplit model between 500 m and 1500 m above model ground level for the travel time considering the mean wind speed during the monsoon time as 7 m s the average time to reach the moisture from the bob to the mainland sites have been calculated thereby the model run time durations were varied from 4 to 7 days for backward trajectory to 8 10 days for forward trajectory 2 5 olr analysis kalpana 1 vhrr mahakur et al 2013 outgoing longwave radiation olr data were used to quantify the convective activities and visualize its propagation time latitude longitude hovmöller diagram was plotted for daily olr anomaly averaged over specified areas to reveal the northward westward propagation of the convection band 3 results the time series plots of daily rainfall and its oxygen isotopic composition for the year 2014 and 2015 over the port blair site are shown in fig s1 the rainfall δ18o plots for the year 2012 13 have been presented in chakraborty et al 2016 the local meteoric water line lmwl of the port blair site for the years 2012 2015 are given below δ2h 7 10 0 19 δ18o 9 42 0 80 r2 0 94 n 82 2012 δ2h 6 75 0 15 δ18o 5 11 0 60 r2 0 96 n 92 2013 δ2h 6 52 0 17 δ18o 3 45 0 71 r2 0 93 n 111 2014 δ2h 7 70 0 23 δ18o 8 83 0 79 r2 0 91 n 111 2015 the slope varies from 6 5 to 7 7 further studies showed that the slope for the following years 2016 2017 were 7 35 and 7 82 respectively sinha 2018 the variability of the slope was mostly constrained within a narrow range of 6 63 7 82 implying that the raindrops in the bob area were subjected to moderate evaporation which also contributed to the amount effect on the other hand the intercept had a larger variability from 3 67 to 9 42 this most probably implies a relatively diverse moisture source for the bob region such as the primary moisture evaporated from the sea and the secondary moisture generated out of raindrop evaporation dangaard 1964 3 1 spectral analysis of the isotopic data the spectral analysis revealed that δ18o of port blair rain is characterized by a periodicity band of 10 25 days fig 2 a d shows the spectral characteristics of the rain isotope upper panel and rainfall record lower panel for the years 2012 15 the periodicity band of 10 25 day is probably associated with the 10 20 day mode of monsoon sub seasonal variations chatterjee and goswami 2004 and appears to be distinctly different from the synoptic scale variations which take place in timescales 10 days on the other hand spectral analysis of port blair vapor δ18o record for 2015 yields a significant peak at 12 14 days fig 2 e left panel in accordance with the rainfall record middle panel both the periodicities also show strong coherency as shown in the right panel of the fig 2 e in addition we have calculated the periodicities of the rain δ18o using the lomb scargle periodogram method a spectral method which accounts the presence of missing values and found similar results fig s2 hence we believe that the interpolated values in rain δ18o do not incorporate any significant error in estimating the spectral features and hence the derived periodicities may be considered as representative values in this context it may be noted that the cross spectrum analysis between rain and its isotopes yielded coherent peaks but their significance was below 90 fig s3 one of the possible reasons is that the isotopic values were obtained on a point source while the rainfall values represented an area of 1 1 dimension nevertheless the cross spectrum analysis of rain isotopes and vapor isotopes yielded strong coherent peak at 90 significance level fig 2 e though the vapor isotope peak was leading the rain isotope peak by about 5 6 days fig s4 this most probably implies that the mean residence time of the vapor in the atmosphere is about 5 6 days our estimate matches well with the residence time measured using the lagrangian moisture source diagnostic by läderach and sodemann 2016 for the bay of bengal region 3 2 amount effect the amount effect results primarily due to the preferential removal of the heavier isotopes during moisture condensation followed by the rain out process dansgaard 1964 however the effect may be obliterated by various atmospheric factors such as re evaporation of raindrops beneath the cloud base advection of air parcel s having moisture with different isotopic values moisture convergence atmospheric circulation and cloud microphysical processes are also believed to modulate the amount effect risi et al 2008 laskar et al 2013 showed that the amount effect is typically valid over the andaman region the year 2012 shows a relatively good negative correlation r 0 29 n 82 p 0 01 between the amount of daily rain and their respective δ18o values while 2013 and 2014 show poor correlation the year 2015 shows the best correlation r 0 40 n 98 p 0 01 implying that amount effect undergoes considerable inter annual variability in 2015 we have also investigated the effect of heavy rainfall events on δ18o in order to examine whether a few heavy rainfall events could affect the rainfall δ18o correlation significantly six events had been identified when rainfall was more than a mean 2 standard deviation since the rainfall does not follow a normal distribution we have also used the percentile method to identify the heavy rainfall events and found a similar result the correlation coefficient r was recalculated after excluding those events and found to be r 0 35 n 92 p 0 01 a similar analysis was done with the port blair rainfall data daily updated imd website data and r value was found to be 0 37 this exercise demonstrates that the amount effect dominantly represented by the normal rain events and anomalously high rain events do not affect it significantly in addition to station data the port blair δ18o and the imd gridded 1 1 rainfall data has also been plotted fig s5 to examine the effect of larger scale rainfall variability on rainwater isotopic composition towards this the port blair δ18o has been correlated with the area averaged rainfall over the port blair imd gridded data with increasing grid size the results show that the correlation coefficient increases when the rainfall is averaged over a larger area reaching a maximum value r 0 50 n 98 p 0 01 for an area of 5 lat 5 lon analysis of other years rain isotope data also yields a similar result not shown 4 discussion an understanding of the amount effect for a specific region is important for two reasons firstly it helps to understand the processes that control the rainwater isotopic composition and secondly rainfall reconstruction using proxy records that rely solely on this hypothesis the basic premise of the amount effect is that heavy rainfall depletes the isotopic composition of the rainfall the consequences of this argument are that the active break period rain would have lighter heavier isotopic composition a premise that has often been used to reconstruct past rainfall e g ghosh et al 2017 but never been documented using modern days isotopic vis a vis rainfall data over a large spatial and temporal domain the reason for not attempting such an exercise is the lack of a robust rain isotope dataset on the daily scale over a wide region an alternative approach albeit a less rigorous method is to analyze the spectral characteristics of the rain isotope data a reasonable match of the periodicities found in the rain isotope record of port blair with that of the rainfall data as discussed before indeed gives credence to the idea that the amount effect is valid at least on the intra seasonal time scale in the andaman region in this context it may be mentioned that high depletions in rain oxygen isotopes near the west coast of india are believed to be driven not by amount effect but by large scale organized convection this hypothesis proposed by lekshmy et al 2014 however is not consistent with our observation in respect of the andaman island region which is equally affected by large scale convection but is also subjected to amount effect this apparent dichotomy may be addressed by means of intra seasonal variability of monsoon since it is the common link both for the large scale organized convective system as well as the rain isotopes as mentioned earlier the 2015 isotopic data have been used to examine how the amount effect behaved on a large spatial scale the exercise demonstrates that the amount effect remains significant approximately for an area of 550 km 550 km however decreases thereafter but what would happen when the rain isotopes are correlated with rainfall of a distant region a region which is physically separated from the rain collection site to examine this behavior we have analyzed the rainfall over the cmz an area about 2 8 million km2 in central india and is approximately 2000 km away from the andaman island fig 1 b the reason for taking the cmz is that the rainfall over this region is a proxy for all india summer monsoon rainfall variability rajeevan et al 2010 the port blair δ18o shows weak but a significant positive correlation with the cmz rainfall fig 3 a d depicts the nature of inter annual variability of the relationship of these two parameters the year 2012 shows a negative correlation while the following three successive years 2013 2015 show positive correlations for 2015 the correlation r between port blair δ18o and cmz average rain is 0 350 n 96 p 0 01 excluding two outliers however the rainfall at port blair does not show any reasonable correlation with the cmz averaged rainfall r varies from 0 014 to 0 091 here we discuss the possible implications of the port blair δ18o and the cmz rainfall relationship we propose a hypothesis that the above mentioned isotope rain amount correlation is arising due to moisture flow from the bob to india during the monsoon season we test this hypothesis by carrying out a correlation analysis between rain isotope at port blair and a central indian site nagpur followed by two more sites these are kolkata in east and tezpur in northeast india both of which are known to receive bob moistures during the summer monsoon before analyzing the rainwater isotope data of these two regions island vs mainland we first discuss the propagation of the rain convection band over the bob and their possible implications on rain isotopes 4 1 propagation of the rain band time latitude hovmöller diagram of the unfiltered olr anomaly has been shown in fig 4 a to illustrate the northward propagations for the years 2012 through 2015 it is clear that all the years except 2012 show strong northward propagation as revealed by the black arrows it is observed that the northward propagation is largely dominated by 30 60 day mode to illustrate the westward propagation time longitude hovmöller diagram has been plotted fig 4 b it is noted that while the 30 60 day mode is weak during the drought year of 2012 the 10 20 day mode also seems to be relatively less active during this year the weak propagation of rain band and in turn the moisture flow in the year 2012 are most probably responsible for making this year characteristically different in terms of the isotopic signature compared to other years 2013 2015 for example the scatter plot between port blair δ18o and the cmz rainfall yields a negative correlation with this year fig 3 a while another three years show a positive correlation fig 3 b d one possible implication is that the central indian region in 2012 may have received the maximum moisture from the indian ocean arabian sea and a relatively small amount from the bob another characteristic of this year is the display of opposite trends in port blair δ18o anomaly and in the cmz rainfall anomaly as depicted in fig s6 a while another three years fig s6 b d showed the respective trends in the same direction it has been observed that the 2015 monsoon was strongly affected by the el niño southern oscillation enso though the effect was subdued strong in the early later phase of the monsoon iitm monsoon report 2015 http www tropmet res in lip publication rr pdf rr 185 pdf fig 5 a shows the cmz rainfall anomaly for 2015 which has been constructed by subtracting the climatological mean reference years 1951 2000 from the 2015 cmz rainfall data this figure shows that during the month of june and later part of july the cmz had positive rainfall anomaly while august and september were mostly characterized by negative rainfall anomaly the active periods defined as rainfall 1σ for three successive days are shown by green bars and the break periods defined as rainfall 1σ for three successive days are noted by red bars the intervening periods are denoted by blue bars in order to compare the port blair δ18o with the 2015 cmz rainfall anomaly we have re plotted this anomaly diagram by subtracting the individual days of rainfall from the jun sep jjas mean it appears from fig 5 b that the pattern of variability is quite similar to that of fig 5 a fig 5 b shows positive values in the early phase of the monsoon and negative values in the later phase of the monsoon blue bars this characteristic feature of monsoon was also manifested in the δ18o record of port blair rain as revealed in the mean variability that is rain δ18o also showing positive negative anomaly during the initial later phase of the monsoon red bars it could be the reason for a weak but significant positive correlation between cmz rain and port blair δ18o as mentioned earlier this may have implications in studying the large scale behavior of monsoon based on limited isotopic records of rainfall from the andaman island e g the effect of enso or west pacific on indian monsoon but due to the lack of long term rain isotopic records it is not possible to make a comprehensive assessment of this effect at this moment we found that the port blair δ18o also responds to the active phase of rainfall the active break phase of the monsoon is characterized by intense subdued rain hence δ18o is expected to show strong week correlation with the rainfall of the respective phases of active break via the amount effect fig s7 shows a scatter diagram between cmz standardized rainfall and the port blair δ18o for both the phases for the active case the correlation is quite strong but for the break period the correlation is nearly non existent since the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation is related to the active break phases of monsoon the characteristic periodicity of 10 14 days observed in port blair δ18o strongly indicates that rain isotopes in this region respond to the active periods and in turn to the westward propagation the above section may be summarized as follows the moisture flow is a dynamical process the advected moisture flows from indian ocean arabian sea in about 10 20 days considering a mean wind speed of 7 ms 1 while reaching the bob it also gets a component from the bob secondly the moisture is continuously recycled where a significant amount may come from the evaporation of raindrops the recycled moisture is fed into the cloud system which slowly builds up over a time period of 10 25 days it is now being realized that the rain isotopic composition is not completely dependent on the moisture source but cumulative convective processes from the source region to the deposition site galewsky et al 2016 however the large scale convective processes occur in timescales of 10 20 days and 30 60 days we have shown that the rain isotopic variability is characterized by 10 20 days cycle hence it supports the above mentioned notion this is how a large convection system is built which moves to indian landmass by means of westward northward propagation hence a year which experiences strong propagation would yield a better correlation between rain vs δ18o and δ18osource vs δ18otarget between bob and the cmz like the year 2015 but a year such as 2012 characterized by weak propagation is likely to yield poor correlation in this context this is to be noted that the other mode of monsoon variability characterized by 30 60 day periodicity is difficult to identify mainly due to the lack of long time records 4 2 spatial variability of the isotope rainfall relationship fig 6 shows the spatial correlation between port blair δ18o data as reference fixed time series and trmm derived daily rainfall data at each grid point over the indian sub continent for the studied years during the jjas period latitudinal averaged 20 n 25 n values show the sequential development of correlation pattern at each longitudinal grid 0 25 from lead 0 to lead 12 days in rain shown top to bottom for the years 2012 15 fig 6 a d the correlation pattern has been examined for the central indian part gray bar in all the years but 2012 port blair δ18o shows a significant positive correlation with the rain over cmz at 0 lead as an exception a significant negative correlation is seen with the rainfall in the western part of india for the year 2012 at 0 lead the appearance of a negative correlation at the west end explains the opposite trend observed in fig s6 a with increased lead time the positive correlation gets improved and reaches the maximum at the lead time of 9 12 days for 2012 on the other hand for the cases of 2013 15 the port blair δ18o shows better positive correlation with the rain at 0 lead time further the correlation decreases and becomes negative as the bob moistures move westward eastward with the increased lead time of 6 12 days as shown in fig 6 b d interestingly we found that the bob moisture may contribute directly through westward propagation year 2013 or sometimes takes a reversal from east to west years 2014 and 2015 the moisture transport timescale and pathways are discussed in the subsequent sections the positive correlation is most prominent in the year 2015 the pattern remains strong even at the lead time of 6 days and moved eastward afterward the positive correlation vanishes see fig 6 d lead 9 and it turns significantly negative at lead time 12 this analysis shows that the correlation pattern between rain isotope of the andaman island and the rainfall over central india oscillates with a period of 10 12 days the coherent nature of correlations appears to arise due to the interplay of the 10 20 day mode and the 30 60 day mode of summer monsoon variability in some cases the transport of moisture from bob is negligible over central india year 2012 though in general the moisture from the bob plays a significant role in rainfall over the indian subcontinent 4 3 timescale of moisture transport from source to receiver forward backward trajectories have been calculated to estimate the moisture transport time from bob to the three mainland sites the respective average travel time for the central indian east and north eastern indian region was found to be 10 4 and 7 days respectively fig 7 it was also observed that the bob moisture near the andaman island usually travelled to the western pacific through the southeast asian region however few trajectories have shown direct moisture pathways from the island port blair to the mainland fig 7 a dashed curves and in some anomalous cases moisture paths suffered an inversion at around the southeast asian region and reached the indian mainland fig 7 a solid curves 4 4 lag relations between the island and mainland δ18o time series if moisture from the bob is transported to central india then the port blair δ18o should be associated with the cmz rain δ18o with proper lag adjustment for moisture travel time a one to one correlation may not be done due to the uneven occurrence of rain events and the difference in sample numbers between port blair and available sampling sites on the indian mainland we do not have a comprehensive rain δ18o time series from a central indian location but a lower resolution record is available from nagpur 21 n 79 e 18 rain samples were collected in 2015 during the jjas season and analyzed for isotope a scatter diagram and time series not shown between port blair δ18o and nagpur δ18o practically shows no correlation or trend r 0 09 n 18 but when the nagpur δ18o values are lagged by 10 days moisture travel time a similar time varying pattern of δ18o was found between these two time series fig 8 a one to one correlation was not feasible due to the difference in the number of data points and non synchronous rain events at these two distant sites in comparison to port blair rain δ18oavg 2 86 nagpur isotopic variation in the year 2015 has an average δ18o value of 3 41 which is around 0 55 depleted and characterized by higher variability min 12 27 max 1 89 as moisture gets depleted in the heavy isotope due to rainout process thus isotopic characteristic of the target region may be depleted in heavy isotope as well as influenced by the signature of other moisture source and local moisture convection apart from the above observations the difference in δ18o values and some mismatch particularly the high depletions may be explained as follows firstly the moisture that produces rain over the andaman island only a fraction of its reach the indian region while the majority of them move off the indian landmass as stated earlier forward trajectory analysis using the hysplit model on a weekly timescale with port blair being the source area clearly shows this kind of behavior out of the 23 cases analyzed that is 23 weeks from may week 1 to sep week 5 only 8 9 of them showed that moistures moved to the indian region while in the rest of the cases they moved elsewhere not shown secondly when the bob moisture reaches mainland the transport pathways were not always directly to india in several cases it first moved to east and northeast and then suffered inversion and moved towards india fig 7 a while travelling to the continental regions of the south east asian countries it may have picked up recycled moisture which in turn diluted the initial isotopic signature of the moisture originally derived from the bob nevertheless the similar variations in δ18o provide a strong indication that part of the bob moisture eventually travelled to the central indian location nagpur directly or indirectly in about 10 days an example of heavy depletion in δ18o has been discussed later we have also tested this hypothesis for another location kolkata that lies in the peripheral region of the easternmost boundary of cmz a similar trend was also found in this case kolkata is known to receive sufficient vapors from the bob sengupta and sarkar 2006 that cause intense rainfall over this region we have collected about 50 samples in 2015 and δ18o δ18oavg 6 05 time series has been constructed with 4 days lag and superimposed over port blair δ18o fig 8 b interestingly back trajectories have shown that on many occasions moisture was sourced from bob fig 7 b the rain isotopes δ18o achieved the lowest values at kolkata 14 in the last week of july and the first week of august further analysis also shows that the major amount of moisture was generated in the northern bob caused intense rain during this time in the south bengal region including kolkata and its surrounding areas not shown this is the time when a low pressure system lps formed over north of bob and adjoining areas of bangladesh and the gangetic west bengal which rapidly concentrated into a depression over northeast bob at 22 n 90 8 e on 26 jul 2015 imd daily weather report for the next couple of days it remained stationary and caused heavy rain and thunderstorm at most places in gangetic west bengal on 29 july 2015 on 30th july it moved north westward and intensified into cyclonic storm komen cantered at about 300 km east southeast of kolkata the isotopic results support the notion that lps transport moisture from the bob to the mainland sikka 1977 goswami 1987 but contradict the so called single source of bob moisture to the kolkata region sengupta and sarkar 2006 north east india is also known to receive a significant amount of bob vapor hence we test our hypothesis at one of the sites tezpur in assam about 52 rain samples were collected from april to september in 2015 and found very similar isotopic variations as over the port blair region a well matched pattern was found when 7 days moisture travel time lagged time series of tezpur δ18o δ18oavg 6 01 was plotted over port blair δ18o fig 8 c back trajectories at ground level have been performed for some random dates and shown in fig 7 c it is evident from these figs 8 c and 7 c that the moisture source for the tezpur region was mostly from the bob as the moisture travel time depends on circulation pattern and may vary within the season thus all the three sites over mainland show some δ18o peaks that may also match well with isotopic variations of port blair rain if the lag time adjusted with the speculated error of 1 day for the particular period of time marked by rectangles fig 8 5 conclusions and scope of future work the moisture transport processes over the bay of bengal have been investigated by means of isotopic analysis of daily rainfall at the moisture source as well as on the moisture destination sites dual site analysis of daily rainwater isotope instead of the traditional method of the single destination site analysis seems to offer an alternative method and a better understanding of the moisture dynamical processes the basic foundation of this assertion is the presence of a significant correlation between the isotopic records on the source area and at the target area though the rainfall in these places seems to be independent the nature of the correlation between the two isotopic records appears to be modulated by the isotope amount effect propagation of the rain cloud band from the bob to the indian landmass and the associated moisture transport pathways the study also establishes the time scale of the moisture transport and the building of the convective systems by means of isotopic characteristics building up of the large scale convective system specifically in the northern indian ocean is known to happen in 10 20 days and 30 60 days time scale which manifest in the form of westward and northward propagation of the rain cloud band during this timeframe the moisture is steadily fed into the convective clouds on the other hand the transport of moisture from the equatorial indian ocean to the bay of bengal takes about the same time 10 20 days our study demonstrates that the moisture transport time and the time frame to build a large scale convective system is intricately related the spectral characteristics of the isotopic time series provide compelling evidence that the isotopic composition of moisture rainfall responds to this timeframe and in turn get modulated by these processes since rain isotopes are strongly modulated by the moisture dynamics in the subseasonal scale including the moisture generated from the sea surface its systematic study would be helpful to monitor the long term changes in the subseasonal moisture transport and hence the temporal variability pattern of rain derived from the bob moisture over the indian subcontinent one of the potential applications of this moisture transport process could be to investigate how the moisture generation and in turn the transport process in the bob would respond to global warming in the coming decades the bob is characterized by a shallow stratified layer of fresh water which maintains a threshold sea surface temperature for charging the cloud base air mass with the required moist static energy for sustaining large scale organized convection in the atmosphere during the summer months shenoi et al 2002 increased use of river water for the societal needs may reduce the continental runoff in the foreseeable future additionally the melting of mountain glaciers may worsen this problem this in turn is likely to have an adverse effect on the bob stratification process and hence the monsoon rainfall the situation may get further aggravated due to the decreasing trend of moisture transport from the indian ocean as a result of weakening

8627,to study the atmospheric moisture transport processes from the source to a receiver region isotopic analysis of rainwater from port blair as source region the andaman islands bay of bengal has been carried out in addition to the island site rainwater collected at three sites on the indian mainland as receiver region namely nagpur kolkata and tezpur has also been isotopically analyzed we present a daily variation of long term 2012 2015 record of rain isotope from port blair to understand the moisture dynamics on a sub seasonal timescale it was observed that the port blair rainwater oxygen isotope ratios δ18o maintain a temporally dependent correlation with the average rainfall over the core monsoon zone cmz of india though the seasonal rainfall over these two regions appears to be mutually independent rain isotopes are controlled more by the moisture dynamics rather than the individual rainfall events consequently the correlation between rainfall over the cmz and δ18o of port blair rain provides conclusive evidence of the transport of the bay of bengal bob moisture to the central and the northeast indian regions during the summer monsoon season the spatial dependency of port blair rain isotopes with the cmz rain shows interannual variability and also indicates different pathways of the bob moisture to the indian mainland within a given season the pathways of the source moisture to the receiver are identified by the trajectory analysis with port blair being the source area we observed analogous variation in δ18o of island rain and that of the mainland rain and δ18o at these two regions is modulated by the monsoon intra seasonal oscillation miso the correlation between the two isotopic records appears to arise from the propagation of the rain cloud band from the bay to the indian landmass and the associated moisture transport linked to the miso keywords monsoon rain isotope bay of bengal moisture transport 1 introduction atmospheric moisture transport processes is an essential component of the earth s hydrological cycle the bob possesses certain unique characteristics which are believed to play an important role in moisture generation and transport process for example it maintains relatively high sea surface temperature sst especially during the monsoon season than the rest of the indian ocean which often exceeds 28 c favoring convection shenoi et al 2002 the northern bob is also characterized by the genesis of low pressure systems lps which often move westward over india that cause heavy rain over central and northern india sikka 1977 goswami 1987 mooley and shukla 1989 krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 the monsoon intra seasonal oscillation miso modulates the frequency of occurrence of the lps with 4 5 times more number of lps occurring during active phases compared to the break phases goswami and xavier 2005 thus the contribution of bob moisture to the monsoon rain is likely to be modulated strongly on intraseasonal timescales therefore characterization of sources and transport of bob moisture to the core monsoon zone cmz of india on the intraseasonal time scale is critical in understanding the seasonal mean monsoon as well as monsoon intraseasonal variability several techniques have been proposed to study the dynamical behavior of moisture for example isotopic analysis of rainfall is considered to be a reliable means of identifying the moisture source region isotopic evidence of bob vapor reaching the eastern and north eastern regions of india has been provided by several investigators sengupta and sarkar 2006 breitenbach et al 2010 gupta et al 2005 but these studies rely on the isotopic analysis of rainfall from sites located in the mainland thus unable to observe any isotopic variation that would have taken place during its transit from the source region in bob the basic premise of identifying the bob derived rainfall is its depleted isotopic values relative to that of the rainfall originated through the arabian sea moisture delaygue et al 2001 kumar et al 2010 midhun et al 2018 but the isotopic depletion in rainfall may also be caused by other processes such as organized convection lekshmy et al 2014 it has also been argued that the rainfall isotopic compositions may not reflect moisture sources but cumulative convective processes from the source region to the deposition site galewsky et al 2016 this may imply that the rainfall characterizing the isotopic signatures of the arabian sea and bob water would be obliterated when precipitated in the mainland region but such a generalization may undermine the intricate relationship between the moisture transport and building up of the convective systems since these two processes are intricately related their effects on rainwater isotopic composition need to be studied through an integrated approach these studies are important since the isotopic studies are potentially useful to quantify the moisture dynamical process such an approach has recently been reported by dar and ghosh 2017 however some issues such as timescale of the moisture transport its interaction with the large scale convective processes vis à vis isotopic fractionation of rainwater have not been studied yet isotopic studies have also been attempted to understand how the arabian sea and the bob branch of circulation influence the rainfall at a given place midhun et al 2018 demonstrated that the spatial distribution of rain isotopic composition across an east west transect in northern india was characterized by high and low values according to these authors the high values were governed by the arabian sea circulation while the bob circulation was responsible for the low values the dynamical behavior of moisture its genesis in the neighboring ocean and transport pathways to the indian continent has also been studied by the meteorologists findlater 1969a b krishnamurti et al 1976 pisharoty 1965

november to march seasons over the south asian region it is evident from this figure that major moisture flows during the summer months to the indian landmass is sustained by a strong south westerly circulation however the moisture content of the arabian sea branch is progressively reduced due to rain out process as it reaches the middle of peninsular india bavadekar and mooley 1981 as the moist air from the arabian sea enters the indian coast it is orographically lifted by the western ghats mountain range and produces heavy rain thus the relatively dry air is recharged with moisture derived from the bay of bengal bob and moves to eastern india and northern indo gangetic plain following the wind pattern shown in fig 1 a monsoon rain over the core monsoon zone cmz rajeevan et al 2010 arises from the convergence of moisture partly coming directly from the arabian sea and partly coming from the bob it is also obvious from fig 1 b that no such strong circulation from the bob to the indian landmass is discernible during the winter season therefore an important aspect regarding the seasonal mean rainfall over central india is the partitioning of moisture source from the arabian sea and the bob as mentioned earlier the isotopic studies offer a means to identify these two sources of moisture midhun et al 2018 but the moisture transport processes is strongly modulated by other meteorological phenomena and how the isotopic properties of rainfall are related to those processes is not yet studied for example the northward propagating monsoon intraseasonal oscillations miso manifested as active and break spells of indian monsoon goswami 2012 contributes significantly to the seasonal mean rainfall goswami and xavier 2005 goswami et al 2006 the anomalous winds associated with the active break spells strengthen weaken the climatological moisture transports see fig 1 and thereby increase or decrease the contribution of bob moisture to the rainfall over the cmz how the isotopic values of rainfall are linked to the active and break phases of monsoon is yet to be characterized in this work we carried out isotopic analysis of rainfall at a source location andaman island in the bob and at a few destination sites in mainland india and endeavor to address the above mentioned issues the main objectives are 1 how do the isotopic values of rainfall in the bob compare with that at the mainland location in india 2 do the precipitation isotopes over the bob respond to the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation and in turn to the active and break phases of the monsoon 3 what are the time scales associated with the vapor transport from bob to the mainland 2 method 2 1 rainwater collection and isotopic measurements the rainfall sampling in port blair the andaman island is considered as representative of the moisture source area i e bob daily rainwater was collected at the pondicherry university campus port blair for three years 2012 2014 in 2015 rainwater was collected at the national institute of ocean technology campus which is approximately 4 km aerially north west of the university campus the cmz in central india is considered as the target area nagpur and few more sites from the mainland namely kolkata and tezpur were also considered for rainwater sampling which are known to receive moisture from bob during the summer monsoon however for the target sites daily rainwater samples have been collected for the year 2015 table 1 to collect rain samples a 2 l plastic bottle fitted with a 20 3 cm diameter funnel was used a tube was attached to the tip of the funnel that touched the bottom of the plastic bottle that helped reduce the exposed surface area additionally a table tennis ball was placed inside the funnel to avoid evaporation the amount of the rainwater sample collected in 2015 was obtained in the field and converted to rain rate mm day using a calibration equation http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf the rainfall record was also obtained from the india meteorological department imd site for all the studied years in 2015 ground level vapor was collected in port blair at the institute campus from from 24th may to 4th october table 1 using cryogenic trapping method http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents miba water vapor protocol pdf in brief a metal trap was cooled to about 80 c temperature using a mixture of ethanol and liquid nitrogen the air flow rate was controlled at 800 ml min to ensure an adequate amount 2 ml of vapor collected in 3 h 0800 1100 h a total of 107 vapor samples were collected 24th may to 4th oct no of days 134 the number of successive missing days during the entire collection period was mostly one or two except during 17 september 2015 to 25 september 2015 when vapor samples could not be collected due to unavailability of liquid nitrogen temperature relative humidity and rainfall were monitored throughout the collection period the rain and condensed vapor samples were transferred to leak proof plastic bottle and then shipped to indian institute of tropical meteorology pune for isotopic analysis the isotopic δ18o and δ2h ratios were determined using an lgr liquid water and water vapor isotope analyzer model tiwa 45 ep the overall analytical precision obtained for δ18o δ2h was about 0 1 1 2 2 spectral analysis in order to examine the spectral characteristics of the rain isotopic data fft was performed on the rainwater δ18o time series using the open software ncar command language ncl https doi org 10 5065 d6wd3xh5 the method however requires continuous data on an equal time interval since rainfall and hence its δ18o data is not available on a daily basis interpolated data were used to fill the gaps in this context it is to be noted that the interpolated isotopic values for non rainy days which are nothing but ratios of two numbers may not be physically viable but in the absence of daily data interpolated data may be the only option at least in the present context in order to give more credence to our spectral estimates we have determined the spectral peaks for vapor isotope data as well interpolation of vapor isotope data does not suffer from the same problem as the rain isotope since vapor is always present in the atmosphere hence the missing values of vapor isotope data which was not available due to logistic reason could reliably be interpolated and a continuous record generated on the other hand since the isotopic record of rainfall in the andaman region primarily reflects the isotopic composition of moisture rather than the individual rain events the spectral behavior of δ18o of moisture is expected to be manifested in rain isotopes as well with this consideration we collected vapor samples and produced a near continuous vapor isotopic record in this paper we use this dataset only to determine the spectral characteristics the other details of vapor isotope data will be presented elsewhere the missing values have been interpolated using the cubic spline both for the rain isotope chakraborty et al 2016 as well as the vapor isotope 2 3 rainfall data the rainfall station data of indian meteorological department imd at port blair 11 67 n 92 73 e was provided by the national data center imd pune the data consists of rainfall averaged over 24 h at 08 30 h daily gridded rainfall data of the tropical rain measuring mission trmm 3b42 v2 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 was used to investigate the response of rainwater δ18o to rainfall over a wider spatial scale for the year 2012 to 2014 for 2015 imd gridded rainfall data was used imd spatial gridded daily rainfall data 1951 2000 was used to calculate the daily climatology and hence the standardized daily rainfall anomaly rajeevan et al 2008 2 4 trajectory analysis forward backward trajectories were plotted using the noaa hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model stein et al 2015 in order to predict the moisture pathways and transport travel time from a source region we have calculated the mean cloud base height at the bob using an empirical formula outlined in betts and ridgway 1989 and later modified by patil parasnis 2003 accordingly the average and maximum cloud base heights were obtained as 320 m and 1720 m respectively therefore the gdas 1 global 2006 present data were used to run the hysplit model between 500 m and 1500 m above model ground level for the travel time considering the mean wind speed during the monsoon time as 7 m s the average time to reach the moisture from the bob to the mainland sites have been calculated thereby the model run time durations were varied from 4 to 7 days for backward trajectory to 8 10 days for forward trajectory 2 5 olr analysis kalpana 1 vhrr mahakur et al 2013 outgoing longwave radiation olr data were used to quantify the convective activities and visualize its propagation time latitude longitude hovmöller diagram was plotted for daily olr anomaly averaged over specified areas to reveal the northward westward propagation of the convection band 3 results the time series plots of daily rainfall and its oxygen isotopic composition for the year 2014 and 2015 over the port blair site are shown in fig s1 the rainfall δ18o plots for the year 2012 13 have been presented in chakraborty et al 2016 the local meteoric water line lmwl of the port blair site for the years 2012 2015 are given below δ2h 7 10 0 19 δ18o 9 42 0 80 r2 0 94 n 82 2012 δ2h 6 75 0 15 δ18o 5 11 0 60 r2 0 96 n 92 2013 δ2h 6 52 0 17 δ18o 3 45 0 71 r2 0 93 n 111 2014 δ2h 7 70 0 23 δ18o 8 83 0 79 r2 0 91 n 111 2015 the slope varies from 6 5 to 7 7 further studies showed that the slope for the following years 2016 2017 were 7 35 and 7 82 respectively sinha 2018 the variability of the slope was mostly constrained within a narrow range of 6 63 7 82 implying that the raindrops in the bob area were subjected to moderate evaporation which also contributed to the amount effect on the other hand the intercept had a larger variability from 3 67 to 9 42 this most probably implies a relatively diverse moisture source for the bob region such as the primary moisture evaporated from the sea and the secondary moisture generated out of raindrop evaporation dangaard 1964 3 1 spectral analysis of the isotopic data the spectral analysis revealed that δ18o of port blair rain is characterized by a periodicity band of 10 25 days fig 2 a d shows the spectral characteristics of the rain isotope upper panel and rainfall record lower panel for the years 2012 15 the periodicity band of 10 25 day is probably associated with the 10 20 day mode of monsoon sub seasonal variations chatterjee and goswami 2004 and appears to be distinctly different from the synoptic scale variations which take place in timescales 10 days on the other hand spectral analysis of port blair vapor δ18o record for 2015 yields a significant peak at 12 14 days fig 2 e left panel in accordance with the rainfall record middle panel both the periodicities also show strong coherency as shown in the right panel of the fig 2 e in addition we have calculated the periodicities of the rain δ18o using the lomb scargle periodogram method a spectral method which accounts the presence of missing values and found similar results fig s2 hence we believe that the interpolated values in rain δ18o do not incorporate any significant error in estimating the spectral features and hence the derived periodicities may be considered as representative values in this context it may be noted that the cross spectrum analysis between rain and its isotopes yielded coherent peaks but their significance was below 90 fig s3 one of the possible reasons is that the isotopic values were obtained on a point source while the rainfall values represented an area of 1 1 dimension nevertheless the cross spectrum analysis of rain isotopes and vapor isotopes yielded strong coherent peak at 90 significance level fig 2 e though the vapor isotope peak was leading the rain isotope peak by about 5 6 days fig s4 this most probably implies that the mean residence time of the vapor in the atmosphere is about 5 6 days our estimate matches well with the residence time measured using the lagrangian moisture source diagnostic by läderach and sodemann 2016 for the bay of bengal region 3 2 amount effect the amount effect results primarily due to the preferential removal of the heavier isotopes during moisture condensation followed by the rain out process dansgaard 1964 however the effect may be obliterated by various atmospheric factors such as re evaporation of raindrops beneath the cloud base advection of air parcel s having moisture with different isotopic values moisture convergence atmospheric circulation and cloud microphysical processes are also believed to modulate the amount effect risi et al 2008 laskar et al 2013 showed that the amount effect is typically valid over the andaman region the year 2012 shows a relatively good negative correlation r 0 29 n 82 p 0 01 between the amount of daily rain and their respective δ18o values while 2013 and 2014 show poor correlation the year 2015 shows the best correlation r 0 40 n 98 p 0 01 implying that amount effect undergoes considerable inter annual variability in 2015 we have also investigated the effect of heavy rainfall events on δ18o in order to examine whether a few heavy rainfall events could affect the rainfall δ18o correlation significantly six events had been identified when rainfall was more than a mean 2 standard deviation since the rainfall does not follow a normal distribution we have also used the percentile method to identify the heavy rainfall events and found a similar result the correlation coefficient r was recalculated after excluding those events and found to be r 0 35 n 92 p 0 01 a similar analysis was done with the port blair rainfall data daily updated imd website data and r value was found to be 0 37 this exercise demonstrates that the amount effect dominantly represented by the normal rain events and anomalously high rain events do not affect it significantly in addition to station data the port blair δ18o and the imd gridded 1 1 rainfall data has also been plotted fig s5 to examine the effect of larger scale rainfall variability on rainwater isotopic composition towards this the port blair δ18o has been correlated with the area averaged rainfall over the port blair imd gridded data with increasing grid size the results show that the correlation coefficient increases when the rainfall is averaged over a larger area reaching a maximum value r 0 50 n 98 p 0 01 for an area of 5 lat 5 lon analysis of other years rain isotope data also yields a similar result not shown 4 discussion an understanding of the amount effect for a specific region is important for two reasons firstly it helps to understand the processes that control the rainwater isotopic composition and secondly rainfall reconstruction using proxy records that rely solely on this hypothesis the basic premise of the amount effect is that heavy rainfall depletes the isotopic composition of the rainfall the consequences of this argument are that the active break period rain would have lighter heavier isotopic composition a premise that has often been used to reconstruct past rainfall e g ghosh et al 2017 but never been documented using modern days isotopic vis a vis rainfall data over a large spatial and temporal domain the reason for not attempting such an exercise is the lack of a robust rain isotope dataset on the daily scale over a wide region an alternative approach albeit a less rigorous method is to analyze the spectral characteristics of the rain isotope data a reasonable match of the periodicities found in the rain isotope record of port blair with that of the rainfall data as discussed before indeed gives credence to the idea that the amount effect is valid at least on the intra seasonal time scale in the andaman region in this context it may be mentioned that high depletions in rain oxygen isotopes near the west coast of india are believed to be driven not by amount effect but by large scale organized convection this hypothesis proposed by lekshmy et al 2014 however is not consistent with our observation in respect of the andaman island region which is equally affected by large scale convection but is also subjected to amount effect this apparent dichotomy may be addressed by means of intra seasonal variability of monsoon since it is the common link both for the large scale organized convective system as well as the rain isotopes as mentioned earlier the 2015 isotopic data have been used to examine how the amount effect behaved on a large spatial scale the exercise demonstrates that the amount effect remains significant approximately for an area of 550 km 550 km however decreases thereafter but what would happen when the rain isotopes are correlated with rainfall of a distant region a region which is physically separated from the rain collection site to examine this behavior we have analyzed the rainfall over the cmz an area about 2 8 million km2 in central india and is approximately 2000 km away from the andaman island fig 1 b the reason for taking the cmz is that the rainfall over this region is a proxy for all india summer monsoon rainfall variability rajeevan et al 2010 the port blair δ18o shows weak but a significant positive correlation with the cmz rainfall fig 3 a d depicts the nature of inter annual variability of the relationship of these two parameters the year 2012 shows a negative correlation while the following three successive years 2013 2015 show positive correlations for 2015 the correlation r between port blair δ18o and cmz average rain is 0 350 n 96 p 0 01 excluding two outliers however the rainfall at port blair does not show any reasonable correlation with the cmz averaged rainfall r varies from 0 014 to 0 091 here we discuss the possible implications of the port blair δ18o and the cmz rainfall relationship we propose a hypothesis that the above mentioned isotope rain amount correlation is arising due to moisture flow from the bob to india during the monsoon season we test this hypothesis by carrying out a correlation analysis between rain isotope at port blair and a central indian site nagpur followed by two more sites these are kolkata in east and tezpur in northeast india both of which are known to receive bob moistures during the summer monsoon before analyzing the rainwater isotope data of these two regions island vs mainland we first discuss the propagation of the rain convection band over the bob and their possible implications on rain isotopes 4 1 propagation of the rain band time latitude hovmöller diagram of the unfiltered olr anomaly has been shown in fig 4 a to illustrate the northward propagations for the years 2012 through 2015 it is clear that all the years except 2012 show strong northward propagation as revealed by the black arrows it is observed that the northward propagation is largely dominated by 30 60 day mode to illustrate the westward propagation time longitude hovmöller diagram has been plotted fig 4 b it is noted that while the 30 60 day mode is weak during the drought year of 2012 the 10 20 day mode also seems to be relatively less active during this year the weak propagation of rain band and in turn the moisture flow in the year 2012 are most probably responsible for making this year characteristically different in terms of the isotopic signature compared to other years 2013 2015 for example the scatter plot between port blair δ18o and the cmz rainfall yields a negative correlation with this year fig 3 a while another three years show a positive correlation fig 3 b d one possible implication is that the central indian region in 2012 may have received the maximum moisture from the indian ocean arabian sea and a relatively small amount from the bob another characteristic of this year is the display of opposite trends in port blair δ18o anomaly and in the cmz rainfall anomaly as depicted in fig s6 a while another three years fig s6 b d showed the respective trends in the same direction it has been observed that the 2015 monsoon was strongly affected by the el niño southern oscillation enso though the effect was subdued strong in the early later phase of the monsoon iitm monsoon report 2015 http www tropmet res in lip publication rr pdf rr 185 pdf fig 5 a shows the cmz rainfall anomaly for 2015 which has been constructed by subtracting the climatological mean reference years 1951 2000 from the 2015 cmz rainfall data this figure shows that during the month of june and later part of july the cmz had positive rainfall anomaly while august and september were mostly characterized by negative rainfall anomaly the active periods defined as rainfall 1σ for three successive days are shown by green bars and the break periods defined as rainfall 1σ for three successive days are noted by red bars the intervening periods are denoted by blue bars in order to compare the port blair δ18o with the 2015 cmz rainfall anomaly we have re plotted this anomaly diagram by subtracting the individual days of rainfall from the jun sep jjas mean it appears from fig 5 b that the pattern of variability is quite similar to that of fig 5 a fig 5 b shows positive values in the early phase of the monsoon and negative values in the later phase of the monsoon blue bars this characteristic feature of monsoon was also manifested in the δ18o record of port blair rain as revealed in the mean variability that is rain δ18o also showing positive negative anomaly during the initial later phase of the monsoon red bars it could be the reason for a weak but significant positive correlation between cmz rain and port blair δ18o as mentioned earlier this may have implications in studying the large scale behavior of monsoon based on limited isotopic records of rainfall from the andaman island e g the effect of enso or west pacific on indian monsoon but due to the lack of long term rain isotopic records it is not possible to make a comprehensive assessment of this effect at this moment we found that the port blair δ18o also responds to the active phase of rainfall the active break phase of the monsoon is characterized by intense subdued rain hence δ18o is expected to show strong week correlation with the rainfall of the respective phases of active break via the amount effect fig s7 shows a scatter diagram between cmz standardized rainfall and the port blair δ18o for both the phases for the active case the correlation is quite strong but for the break period the correlation is nearly non existent since the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation is related to the active break phases of monsoon the characteristic periodicity of 10 14 days observed in port blair δ18o strongly indicates that rain isotopes in this region respond to the active periods and in turn to the westward propagation the above section may be summarized as follows the moisture flow is a dynamical process the advected moisture flows from indian ocean arabian sea in about 10 20 days considering a mean wind speed of 7 ms 1 while reaching the bob it also gets a component from the bob secondly the moisture is continuously recycled where a significant amount may come from the evaporation of raindrops the recycled moisture is fed into the cloud system which slowly builds up over a time period of 10 25 days it is now being realized that the rain isotopic composition is not completely dependent on the moisture source but cumulative convective processes from the source region to the deposition site galewsky et al 2016 however the large scale convective processes occur in timescales of 10 20 days and 30 60 days we have shown that the rain isotopic variability is characterized by 10 20 days cycle hence it supports the above mentioned notion this is how a large convection system is built which moves to indian landmass by means of westward northward propagation hence a year which experiences strong propagation would yield a better correlation between rain vs δ18o and δ18osource vs δ18otarget between bob and the cmz like the year 2015 but a year such as 2012 characterized by weak propagation is likely to yield poor correlation in this context this is to be noted that the other mode of monsoon variability characterized by 30 60 day periodicity is difficult to identify mainly due to the lack of long time records 4 2 spatial variability of the isotope rainfall relationship fig 6 shows the spatial correlation between port blair δ18o data as reference fixed time series and trmm derived daily rainfall data at each grid point over the indian sub continent for the studied years during the jjas period latitudinal averaged 20 n 25 n values show the sequential development of correlation pattern at each longitudinal grid 0 25 from lead 0 to lead 12 days in rain shown top to bottom for the years 2012 15 fig 6 a d the correlation pattern has been examined for the central indian part gray bar in all the years but 2012 port blair δ18o shows a significant positive correlation with the rain over cmz at 0 lead as an exception a significant negative correlation is seen with the rainfall in the western part of india for the year 2012 at 0 lead the appearance of a negative correlation at the west end explains the opposite trend observed in fig s6 a with increased lead time the positive correlation gets improved and reaches the maximum at the lead time of 9 12 days for 2012 on the other hand for the cases of 2013 15 the port blair δ18o shows better positive correlation with the rain at 0 lead time further the correlation decreases and becomes negative as the bob moistures move westward eastward with the increased lead time of 6 12 days as shown in fig 6 b d interestingly we found that the bob moisture may contribute directly through westward propagation year 2013 or sometimes takes a reversal from east to west years 2014 and 2015 the moisture transport timescale and pathways are discussed in the subsequent sections the positive correlation is most prominent in the year 2015 the pattern remains strong even at the lead time of 6 days and moved eastward afterward the positive correlation vanishes see fig 6 d lead 9 and it turns significantly negative at lead time 12 this analysis shows that the correlation pattern between rain isotope of the andaman island and the rainfall over central india oscillates with a period of 10 12 days the coherent nature of correlations appears to arise due to the interplay of the 10 20 day mode and the 30 60 day mode of summer monsoon variability in some cases the transport of moisture from bob is negligible over central india year 2012 though in general the moisture from the bob plays a significant role in rainfall over the indian subcontinent 4 3 timescale of moisture transport from source to receiver forward backward trajectories have been calculated to estimate the moisture transport time from bob to the three mainland sites the respective average travel time for the central indian east and north eastern indian region was found to be 10 4 and 7 days respectively fig 7 it was also observed that the bob moisture near the andaman island usually travelled to the western pacific through the southeast asian region however few trajectories have shown direct moisture pathways from the island port blair to the mainland fig 7 a dashed curves and in some anomalous cases moisture paths suffered an inversion at around the southeast asian region and reached the indian mainland fig 7 a solid curves 4 4 lag relations between the island and mainland δ18o time series if moisture from the bob is transported to central india then the port blair δ18o should be associated with the cmz rain δ18o with proper lag adjustment for moisture travel time a one to one correlation may not be done due to the uneven occurrence of rain events and the difference in sample numbers between port blair and available sampling sites on the indian mainland we do not have a comprehensive rain δ18o time series from a central indian location but a lower resolution record is available from nagpur 21 n 79 e 18 rain samples were collected in 2015 during the jjas season and analyzed for isotope a scatter diagram and time series not shown between port blair δ18o and nagpur δ18o practically shows no correlation or trend r 0 09 n 18 but when the nagpur δ18o values are lagged by 10 days moisture travel time a similar time varying pattern of δ18o was found between these two time series fig 8 a one to one correlation was not feasible due to the difference in the number of data points and non synchronous rain events at these two distant sites in comparison to port blair rain δ18oavg 2 86 nagpur isotopic variation in the year 2015 has an average δ18o value of 3 41 which is around 0 55 depleted and characterized by higher variability min 12 27 max 1 89 as moisture gets depleted in the heavy isotope due to rainout process thus isotopic characteristic of the target region may be depleted in heavy isotope as well as influenced by the signature of other moisture source and local moisture convection apart from the above observations the difference in δ18o values and some mismatch particularly the high depletions may be explained as follows firstly the moisture that produces rain over the andaman island only a fraction of its reach the indian region while the majority of them move off the indian landmass as stated earlier forward trajectory analysis using the hysplit model on a weekly timescale with port blair being the source area clearly shows this kind of behavior out of the 23 cases analyzed that is 23 weeks from may week 1 to sep week 5 only 8 9 of them showed that moistures moved to the indian region while in the rest of the cases they moved elsewhere not shown secondly when the bob moisture reaches mainland the transport pathways were not always directly to india in several cases it first moved to east and northeast and then suffered inversion and moved towards india fig 7 a while travelling to the continental regions of the south east asian countries it may have picked up recycled moisture which in turn diluted the initial isotopic signature of the moisture originally derived from the bob nevertheless the similar variations in δ18o provide a strong indication that part of the bob moisture eventually travelled to the central indian location nagpur directly or indirectly in about 10 days an example of heavy depletion in δ18o has been discussed later we have also tested this hypothesis for another location kolkata that lies in the peripheral region of the easternmost boundary of cmz a similar trend was also found in this case kolkata is known to receive sufficient vapors from the bob sengupta and sarkar 2006 that cause intense rainfall over this region we have collected about 50 samples in 2015 and δ18o δ18oavg 6 05 time series has been constructed with 4 days lag and superimposed over port blair δ18o fig 8 b interestingly back trajectories have shown that on many occasions moisture was sourced from bob fig 7 b the rain isotopes δ18o achieved the lowest values at kolkata 14 in the last week of july and the first week of august further analysis also shows that the major amount of moisture was generated in the northern bob caused intense rain during this time in the south bengal region including kolkata and its surrounding areas not shown this is the time when a low pressure system lps formed over north of bob and adjoining areas of bangladesh and the gangetic west bengal which rapidly concentrated into a depression over northeast bob at 22 n 90 8 e on 26 jul 2015 imd daily weather report for the next couple of days it remained stationary and caused heavy rain and thunderstorm at most places in gangetic west bengal on 29 july 2015 on 30th july it moved north westward and intensified into cyclonic storm komen cantered at about 300 km east southeast of kolkata the isotopic results support the notion that lps transport moisture from the bob to the mainland sikka 1977 goswami 1987 but contradict the so called single source of bob moisture to the kolkata region sengupta and sarkar 2006 north east india is also known to receive a significant amount of bob vapor hence we test our hypothesis at one of the sites tezpur in assam about 52 rain samples were collected from april to september in 2015 and found very similar isotopic variations as over the port blair region a well matched pattern was found when 7 days moisture travel time lagged time series of tezpur δ18o δ18oavg 6 01 was plotted over port blair δ18o fig 8 c back trajectories at ground level have been performed for some random dates and shown in fig 7 c it is evident from these figs 8 c and 7 c that the moisture source for the tezpur region was mostly from the bob as the moisture travel time depends on circulation pattern and may vary within the season thus all the three sites over mainland show some δ18o peaks that may also match well with isotopic variations of port blair rain if the lag time adjusted with the speculated error of 1 day for the particular period of time marked by rectangles fig 8 5 conclusions and scope of future work the moisture transport processes over the bay of bengal have been investigated by means of isotopic analysis of daily rainfall at the moisture source as well as on the moisture destination sites dual site analysis of daily rainwater isotope instead of the traditional method of the single destination site analysis seems to offer an alternative method and a better understanding of the moisture dynamical processes the basic foundation of this assertion is the presence of a significant correlation between the isotopic records on the source area and at the target area though the rainfall in these places seems to be independent the nature of the correlation between the two isotopic records appears to be modulated by the isotope amount effect propagation of the rain cloud band from the bob to the indian landmass and the associated moisture transport pathways the study also establishes the time scale of the moisture transport and the building of the convective systems by means of isotopic characteristics building up of the large scale convective system specifically in the northern indian ocean is known to happen in 10 20 days and 30 60 days time scale which manifest in the form of westward and northward propagation of the rain cloud band during this timeframe the moisture is steadily fed into the convective clouds on the other hand the transport of moisture from the equatorial indian ocean to the bay of bengal takes about the same time 10 20 days our study demonstrates that the moisture transport time and the time frame to build a large scale convective system is intricately related the spectral characteristics of the isotopic time series provide compelling evidence that the isotopic composition of moisture rainfall responds to this timeframe and in turn get modulated by these processes since rain isotopes are strongly modulated by the moisture dynamics in the subseasonal scale including the moisture generated from the sea surface its systematic study would be helpful to monitor the long term changes in the subseasonal moisture transport and hence the temporal variability pattern of rain derived from the bob moisture over the indian subcontinent one of the potential applications of this moisture transport process could be to investigate how the moisture generation and in turn the transport process in the bob would respond to global warming in the coming decades the bob is characterized by a shallow stratified layer of fresh water which maintains a threshold sea surface temperature for charging the cloud base air mass with the required moist static energy for sustaining large scale organized convection in the atmosphere during the summer months shenoi et al 2002 increased use of river water for the societal needs may reduce the continental runoff in the foreseeable future additionally the melting of mountain glaciers may worsen this problem this in turn is likely to have an adverse effect on the

8628,a study was conducted to assess the projected impact of future climate on alamo lake and the bill williams river basin we analyzed simulations of three selected representative concentration pathways 8 5 global climate models gcm i e hadgem2 es mpi esm lr and gfdl esm2m these gcms which were part of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report were selected as well performing gcms that represent the historic climatology and prevailing precipitation bearing synoptic conditions in the southwest us an analysis of both statistically and dynamically downscaled simulations projected increase in the frequency of dry winters during the mid 21st century 2020 2059 in two out of the three selected gcms for summer precipitation the statistically downscaled simulations are inconclusive whereas the dynamically downscaled simulations showed significant but contradicting future projections in order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic cycle at the bill williams river basins we developed a modeling framework that includes the following components 1 a weather generator that produces realizations of likely hourly precipitation events over the basin 2 a hydrologic model that is based on the colorado basin river forecast center cbrfc national weather service modeling configuration that predicts flow at ten internal points and inflow into alamo lake and 3 a lake model with the existing operation rules to simulates the lake outflow and levels using the above described modeling framework the impact of the projected mid 21 century climate on alamo lake was examined with respect to the total outflow from the dam the frequency of large outflow events and the frequency of high and low lake levels the results show that dynamic downscaling provides a larger range of impacts than those provided by statistical downscaling the results also indicate a wide range of impact scenarios with contradicting trends among the selected climate projections for mid 21st century these results imply increasing challenges in operating the lake at its target level this modeling framework can potentially be used to examine various future scenarios and to develop recommendations for a sustainable management scheme for the alamo lake keywords bill williams river alamo lake statistical downscaling dynamical downscaling hydrologic impact assessment arid hydrology 1 introduction we conducted a hydrologic impact assessment using projected climate for the mid 21st century at the bill williams river bwr watershed and alamo lake a tributary of the colorado river upstream of lake havasu several studies have explored the projected impact of future climate on the colorado river flow e g christensen and lettenmaier 2007 vano et al 2014 gautam and mascaro 2018 however because of the large spatial climate variability within the colorado river watershed these basin wide studies may not be representative of the bwr tributary in the arid water scarce bwr watershed the precipitation high spatiotemporal variability triggers highly variable streamflow events in ephemeral streams therefore even small projected climatic changes may be a cause of concern our objective in this study is to evaluate the differences in the hydrologic assessment that result from the selection of gcms or the selection of downscaling methodology for hydrologic impact assessment studies a downscaling of global climate models gcms future projections is often needed in order to bridge the scale gap between the coarse gcm simulations and the required finer resolution for regional and local watershed studies two fundamental downscaling approaches are often used statistical downscaling sd and dynamical downscaling dd statistical downscaling sd procedures derive empirical relationships between atmospheric forcing data of the gcm and surface variable of interest in finer resolution to apply those relationships to future gcms projections it assumes that the statistical relationship between the predictors gcm and predictand surface variables do not change over time and are therefore stationary e g carpenter and georgakakos 2001 the sd procedures main advantage is that they do not require special computational resources and therefore can be used to produce high resolution simulations and can be applied for a large number of gcms dynamically downscale dd models use regional climate models nested within the gcm to simulate local climate features they respond in physically consistent ways to resolve regional atmospheric processes and simulate mesoscale variables of interest such as convective storms extreme events and snowfall versus rainfall they simulate internally consistent multivariate quantities within an atmospheric column the main limitation associated with dd is the requirement for intensive computational resources therefore dd simulations are only available for a limited number of gcms general discussion of the pros and cons of selecting one downscaling approach over the other have been the subject of multiple manuscripts e g fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 kotamarthi et al 2016 local hydrologic impact assessment studies for various objectives often face the dilemma of having to choose between sd and dd approaches sd simulations are easier to obtain and there are several readily available datasets that include simulations for many different gcms dd simulations on the other hand require a high level of expertise to produce and are available for only a few gcms this study is geared to evaluate the differences in the hydrologic assessment that result from selecting one downscaling approach over the other we compared between the state of the art dd and sd datasets that are available for the study area to assess the hydrologic impact of the projected climate a hydrologic modeling framework was developed for the bill williams river and alamo lake which consists of a 1 precipitation weather generator wg that produces ensembles of equally likely to occur hourly precipitation sequences 2 hydrologic model that simulates flow in internal points in the basin and inflow into alamo lake and 3 lake model that simulates lake levels and outflow the objective of the wg is to transform the climate models simulations into precipitation ensembles that can be used as input to the hydrologic model a wg ensemble with sufficient realizations represents the spatio temporal variability of the observed record in addition the wg was further modified to reflect changes that were identified by comparing the historic and projected climate models simulations to generate precipitation ensembles that reflect the projected changes this approach provides a tool to translate a single climate model simulation into an ensemble that can be used as input for the hydrologic model and thus simulate a distribution of model outcomes rather than a single simulation this is an attractive approach for water resources planning in arid regions that have large inter and intra annual climate variability and its hydrologic response is very sensitive to nuances in precipitation patterns in the next section section 2 we discuss the selected gcms and their performance for the study area the study area and its hydrologic characteristics are presented in section 3 section 4 is dedicated to the description of the hydrologic modeling framework that is implemented in this study following the results presented in section 5 in section 6 we provide a summary and conclusions 2 selected climate models three gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 simulated with representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp 8 5 were selected for this study the selected gcms are 1 hadgem2 es global environmental model version 2 from the united kingdom meteorological office the hadley centre 2 mpi esm lr earth system model running on low resolution lr grid from the max planck institute for meteorology and 3 gfdl esm2m noaa geophysical fluid dynamic laboratory earth system model these gcms were selected to be dynamically downscaled because of their good performance over north america and because they represent the range of the north america climate sensitivity that is provided by all cmip 5 gcms sheffield et al 2013 i and ii dd precipitation simulations of the three gcms are available for the historic period 1950 2005 and future projections with rcp 8 5 2006 2100 at 25 km horizontal grid resolution from national center for atmospheric research ncar and the university of arizona department of hydrology and atmospheric sciences the simulations followed the specifications of the north america coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex program https na cordex org an initiative sponsored by the world climate research program to provide regional climate downscaling data for regional climate change adaptation and impacts assessment the three gcms were downscaled for the domain of the na cordex program using the advanced research version of the weather research and forecasting wrf model version 3 1 as the regional climate model the configuration of the wrf model is described in castro et al 2017 the simulations are available at 3 hour intervals for the wrf hadgem2 es and 6 hour intervals for the wrf mpi esm lr and wrf gfdl esm2m an equivalent wrf reanalysis 6 hour precipitation dataset 1979 2015 nested within era interim global reanalysis dee et al 2011 is also available at a similar spatial resolution and model configuration as the dd simulations sd daily precipitation for 1950 2005 and 2006 2099 at 0 0625 6 km horizontal grid spacing for the three gcms is available for the western u s from the state of the art localized constructed analogs loca methodology pierce et al 2014 loca s leading downscaling assumption is that the forecast will evolve the same way as the best matching historical event an observed gridded precipitation with similar spatiotemporal resolution for 1950 2015 is available from livneh et al 2013 this dataset which was used as the reference for the derivation of the loca dataset was developed for the conterminous mexico and u s and regions in canada south of 53 n in the southwest u s a credible gcm to be used for hydrologic impact assessment should be one that represents the precipitation characteristics of both winter and summer the prevailing winter storms november march originate from large scale low pressure frontal systems approaching from the west and southwest these storms that may last for a few days to drop persistent rain over large areas often produce snowfall at higher elevations however in our study area the falling snow commonly melts within a few days and is not a major runoff component into alamo lake the prevailing summer rainfall june september is driven by the north american monsson nam climate system which triggers isolated convective cells that often produce intense short lived rainfall events while winter rainfall events generate gradual rising streamflow events with low flow that persists following the rain event summer rainfall events trigger quick and sudden rising flow followed by short lived low flow a comprehensive evaluation analysis of gcms for winter precipitation is available from the california department of water resources 2015 who used 3 step model screening process to evaluate the historical performance of 31 cmip 5 gcms in three sequential spatial scales i e global southwestern u s and california most winter storms to hit arizona originate in the mid latitude pacific ocean and cross over california in their analysis the hadgem2 es was selected among the 10 top performing gcms while the mpi esm lr and gfdl esm2m were selected among the 15 top performing models dominated by regional mesoscale processes representing the nam in the relatively coarse gcm is a challenge e g castro et al 2012 2017 bukovsky et al 2013 2015 geil et al 2013 evaluation of large scale features of the nam system by gcms is an active research topic e g arritt et al 2000 liang et al 2008 lin et al 2008 geil et al 2013 pascale et al 2016 the selected gcms for this study were reported to well represent the nam system geil et al 2013 given our study objective to evaluate the selection impact of the downscaling methodology on hydrologic impact assessments a case can be made that three gcms and one rcm i e wrf as analyzed in this study may not be sufficient to reach conclusions that can be generalized for all sd and dd simulations as mentioned above the selection of the three gcms is constrained by the limited availability of dd simulations the selected datasets as far as we know are the only high resolution datasets readily available and any future climate study conducted in this region would have likely contemplated the use of the dd and sd datasets presented herein therefore it is likely that for the southwest u s region the selected datasets well represent the consequence of the selection of a downscaling procedure 3 study area the bill williams river watershed hereinafter bwr 5393 mile2 13 968 km2 in west central arizona is a tributary of the colorado river that drains into lake havasu just upstream of parker dam alamo dam 36 miles 58 km upstream of the confluence with the colorado river was built in 1968 to form alamo lake as a multi purpose facility with a primary objective to control flooding downstream of the dam on the lower bwr secondary objectives of the lake include water supply and conservation recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement at the site of the dam the contributing drainage area is about 4770 mile2 12 354 km2 from mainly three ephemeral tributaries with a few perennial sections which drain into alamo lake big sandy river santa maria river and burro creek no significant flood control structures exist in the drainage area of these tributaries a map of the bwr watershed with the eleven sub basins that were used for the model development further discussed in section 4 is in fig 1 the diverse physiography of the bwr watershed spans from high elevation forested mountains to rugged desert terrain in the lower elevations detailed hydrologic and geomorphic description of the watershed is provided in house et al 1999 operated by the u s army corp of engineers usace releases from alamo dam have a direct impact on the operation of the lower colorado river by the bureau of reclamation downstream of alamo lake the lower bwr flows through a series of alternating narrow canyons and wider alluvial valley reaches the peak discharge in the u s geological survey usgs gauge just below alamo dam usgs09426000 during the pre dam era was estimated at 200 000 cfs 5660 cms in february 1891 patterson and somers 1966 while post dam maximum discharge as of october 2017 has not exceeded 7000 cfs 200 cms which is the maximum possible release rate from the dam 3 1 climate models evaluation a comparison of the average monthly total precipitation among the sd dd raw gcm wrf era interim reanalysis and gridded observations for the historical period 1950 2005 is shown in fig 2 for the had gem2 es left mpi esm lr center and gfdl esm2m right this figure compares among the spatial averages over the entire bwr watershed and it represents well the results for each of the eleven sub basins figures for the sub basins are not included it is seen that the sd simulations closely follow the observed gridded dataset this is expected because the sd procedure was designed to conform to the observed record the wrf era interim reanalysis follows the seasonal patterns fairly well which is indicative of the skill of wrf for producing monthly climatological averages when it is nested within optimal boundary conditions the added value of wrf is also seen by comparing the raw gcms to the dd simulations marked differences are seen for the summer where raw gcms underestimate the precipitation and dd overestimated by had and lagged by about 1 month by the gfdl 3 2 observation datasets hourly mean areal precipitation map 1 october 1980 30 september 2010 data from the colorado basin river forecast center cbrfc national weather service nws www cbrfc noaa gov are available for eleven sub basins in the bwr watershed table 1 these historical map time series were derived by cbrfc for the purpose of calibration of their hydrologic models using elevation thresholds each of the three tributaries that drain into alamo lake fig 1 was divided into three sub basins upper middle and lower two additional downstream sub basins upper and lower just upstream of the lake were configured by cbrfc the map derivation procedure consists of quality control of the rain gauge records and spatial interpolation with the mountain mapper technique used by the nws river forecast system schaake et al 2004 the inflow into alamo lake was calculated from a mass balance equation using lake s water level from the usace 1980 2010 outflow from the lake as observed at the gauge just below the dam and estimated monthly lake evaporation from cbrfc for the analyses of future projections we used the historic monthly evaporation values it is likely that future climate may impact the lake evaporation however lake evaporation is a complex process and the projection of future evaporation requires analysis of the lake energy balance in addition to the energy and hydrodynamic atmospheric conditions over the lake e g shilo et al 2015 3 3 hydrologic analysis there are two wet seasons winter and summer in the bwr watershed the winter november march peaks in january february and the summer extends from july to september the spring april june is relatively dry with mean areal precipitation of 21 mm and less than 1000 acre feet inflow to the lake the fall october is generally very dry with infrequent very wet storms that have synoptic rainfall bearing conditions that are often different than the ones of the winter storms the difference between winter and summer map is seen in fig 3 for the average over the entire bwr watershed average winter november march and summer june september precipitation as indicated by the dashed lines are 180 and 130 mm season respectively although the winter season is occasionally very wet with a maximum of 430 mm it is more often drier than the average which implies a more skewed distribution skewness coefficients are 0 95 and 0 52 for winter and summer respectively the higher variability of winter precipitation can also be shown by comparing the coefficient of variations 0 6 and 0 4 for winter and summer respectively compared with summer winter streamflow events are longer with larger volume higher daily maximum and the duration between the streamflow events is shorter the shorter duration between winter streamflow events may be attributed to the longer events that have long lasting baseflow shamir et al 2017 in fig 4 total seasonal winter and summer inflow into alamo lake are compared with total seasonal outflow from the lake notice that although average summer precipitation is 75 of the average winter precipitation the average summer inflow into alamo lake is only 10 of the average winter inflow even the largest releases recorded for the summer are relatively small compared with winter releases it is also noted that many of the winters had very low inflows this large seasonal difference between precipitation and streamflow ratio underscores the necessity to consider the properties of the precipitation events and their interaction with land surface processes that control the generation of streamflow 4 hydrologic modeling framework in order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic system in the bwr a hydrologic modeling framework that comprises the following three models was configured precipitation weather generator wg hydrologic model and lake model future projections were applied by modifying the wg to generate hourly precipitation ensembles that reflect the projected changes as inferred from comparing between the simulations of the historic and future periods for each of the downscaled climate models thus the only projected future change that is being considered in this study is the projected change in precipitation the detailed development and evaluation of the hydrologic framework is described in shamir et al 2017 in this section we provide a description of the modeling framework components 4 1 precipitation weather generator the above analysis of the bwr watershed precipitation and lake inflow points to the importance of representing the temporal and spatial characteristics of the rainfall events the purpose of the precipitation wg is to produce numerous equally likely random realistic scenarios of hourly precipitation sequences an ensemble that includes a sufficient number of realizations of these scenarios should represent the spatiotemporal statistical characteristics of the observed record the natural variability of events and their likelihood to occur based on analysis of the map from cbrfc 1980 2010 a wg was developed to simulate likely hourly maps for the 11 sub basins of the bwr watersheds since the wg was developed to describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of the maps time series that were used as input for the development and calibration of the sac sma hydrologic model the wg realizations can be used as precipitation input to the hydrologic model by modifying the wg to reflect the changes that were identified from comparing between the historic and projected simulations of the climate models it is also possible to assess the impact of projected future precipitation changes on the lake inflow and lake level the precipitation wg concept that is presented herein is following on previous work by shamir et al 2007a b 2015 shamir 2017 and wang et al 2007 a detailed description and evaluation of the wg for the bwr watershed is provided in shamir et al 2017 and a brief description is provided below the wg is comprised of two successive modules 1 a point process module to derive hourly map that represents the entire bwr watershed fig 5 left side and 2 a spatial disaggregation module to estimate hourly maps in the eleven sub basins fig 5 right side 4 2 point process module the point process model is developed for three wetness categories wet medium and dry for both winter november march and summer june september the spring april may and fall october were assumed to be dry the highly skewed precipitation distribution and the very large inter annual variability in the arid southwest u s calls for a wg with wetness categories that can be developed independently shamir et al 2007a b the wetness categories represent the tercile statistics of the total observed seasonal summer and winter precipitation during 1980 2010 the selection of a wetness category in the wg for a given season is sampled from a uniform distribution i e a distribution that has constant probability and it is independent from the selected wetness category of the previous seasons following the sampling of a wetness category the duration of winter or summer is determined by sampling the season s precipitation onset and offset the onsets were identified in the observed record as the duration since 1 june and 1 november for the summer and winter respectively when the cumulative areal average precipitation over the entire basin exceeded 10 mm the offset of the seasons were selected as the last precipitation event prior to end of september and the end of march for the summer and winter respectively the onset and offset of the rainy season are selected from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation calculated from the historical record for the winter and summer and for the different wetness categories following the selection of the wetness category and the duration of the rainy period a precipitation time series is being created for the season winter or summer by sequentially sampling from the following distributions inter arrival time of storms duration of storms the chance for an hourly precipitation event to occur and the magnitude of the hourly event this sequential sampling repeats until a time series is generated for the duration from the season s onset to its offset as seen in looping arrow in fig 5 each of this distribution was developed independently for the three wetness categories i e wet medium and dry the point process module is based on the assumption that precipitation storm events tend to arrive in clusters as a response to a transient synoptic scale atmospheric disturbance each synoptic event may produce multiple hourly precipitation pulses with possible multiple dry hours in between the definition of a storm is a key component that is required for the derivation of a sample of observed storms to be used for the development of the wg parameters our storm definition procedure is based on the assumption that the distribution of storms inter arrival time constitutes a poisson stochastic process and therefore the distribution of storms inter arrival times conforms to an exponential distribution restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 thus it is possible by selecting the minimum inter arrival time between storms i e the number of dry hours beyond which the occurrence of rainfall marks the beginning of a new event to develop a statistical sample of storms with inter arrival distribution that has a coefficient of variation of one as in an exponential distribution in this study the minimum inter arrival time were prescribed to 84 and 36 h for the winter and summer respectively a storm event is defined as one that follows the previous storm by a period that is longer than the minimum inter arrival time starts and ends with an occurrence of hourly precipitation events 4 3 precipitation wg spatial distribution the bwr basin wide hourly map realizations that were derived by the point process module are further disaggregated into map for the 11 sub basins the disaggregation consists of two steps first for each wet hour a wetness category in each sub basin is independently assigned the wetness categories which can also include an assignment of no rain event were sampled for winter and summer from a uniform random distribution with chances coefficients as calculated from the observed sub basins map records the chance coefficients indicate the chance of a precipitation event in a sub basin to be in a particular tercile independently of the other sub basins as a function of the wetness category of the average master time series second the magnitude of the hourly precipitation in the sub basins if in the upper tercile is assigned from a generalized pareto distribution with its threshold parameter being the observed 67th percentile in each of the sub basins otherwise the precipitation magnitude is selected from a log normal distribution the parameters of these distributions were derived independently for each sub basin from the observed non zero hourly events in order to better simulate large extreme events we added a chance of one day per winter to sample an upper tercile precipitation event from generalized pareto distributions that were parameterized to represent the annual maxima series of the observed records for each sub basin the threshold parameters of the generalized pareto distributions are assigned as the lowest value of the annual maxima series in the sub basins fig 5 outlines the different wg components the left column describes the sequential sampling process that is used to derive the entire basin areal average hourly time series and the right column describes the sequential sampling process that is used to disaggregate the areal average to areal averages in the sub basins following the selection of a wetness category for a given season winter or summer the duration of the rainy season is selected as the time between the seasonal onset and offset the looping arrow indicates a repetitive sampling sequence that continues until the precipitation simulation is completed for the identified rainy season duration in shamir et al 2017 in addition to detailed description of the wg development the performance of the wg was comprehensively assessed for the winter and summer with respect to the distribution of hourly precipitation frequency of occurrence of hourly events distribution of seasonal totals and occurrence of extreme hourly events these are perceived as precipitation features that control runoff generation in ephemeral streams in figs 6 and 7 we provide an example for the wg performance in simulating the distribution of the winter hourly precipitation and frequency of occurrence of hourly precipitation respectively in these figures the cumulative distributions of 100 wg realizations each 30 years of hourly map for the 11 sub basins similar to the dimension that available for the observed record are shown as gray lines the wg realizations are compared with the cumulative distribution of the observed maps from cbrfc which are shown in red while the cumulative distributions in fig 6 are derived for all non zero precipitation events during the 30 years period in fig 7 the distributions are of a seasonal index and therefore the ensemble comprised of 100 realizations each includes 30 values the wg simulations of the hourly precipitation show tight spread and overall match very well the distribution shape of the observed records in the sub basins fig 6 since the wg was designed to represent the inter and intra annual variability tight spread of the realization and a good match of the shape of the observed distributions are considered favorable traits when comparing multi year time series the lower right panel which compares the distributions of the areal weighted averages over the entire bill williams watershed offers an evaluation measure for the spatial module performance of the wg the inter annual variability of the ensemble is presented by the spread between the realizations of the count of non zero precipitation occurrence distributions fig 7 the distributions of the ensemble s realizations encompass well the observed distributions in the sub basins and slightly underestimate the frequency over the entire watershed lower right panel to the authors knowledge there is no formal methodology for evaluating the performance of a wg ensemble the spread of the ensemble realizations should represent the uncertainty that is associated with the observed record the width of the ensemble spread should neither be too wide or too narrow a narrow spread does not describe the uncertainty and variability in the data while a spread that is too wide may fail to capture the unique characteristics of the data 4 4 hydrologic model sacramento soil moisture accounting in this hydrologic framework we implemented the cbrfc hydrologic model configuration and parameters for the bwr watershed the cbrfc uses the nws river forecast system which includes the following components 1 the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma as hydrologic model that continuously updates the soil moisture conditions and simulates runoff and streamflow in the channels burnash et al 1973 the snow17 model which keeps track of snow accumulation and ablation in the basins anderson 1976 and a unit hydrograph to route the channels streamflow into the sub basins outlets the cbrfc operational model is mainly used to simulate high flow events and in order to accommodate water resources studies the sac sma parameters were further tuned the tuning of the parameters was conducted by comparing the daily streamflow simulations to the observed daily flows at the big sandy usgs 09424450 burro creek usgs 09424447 and santa maria usgs 09424900 fig 1 we used the map time series as input for the sac sma model in order to simulate the daily streamflow that were used for the tuning of the parameters the simulated winter and summer cumulative distributions of the daily inflow into the lake are compared to the calculated inflow in fig 8 for the winter the calculated and simulated cumulative distributions matched very well on the other hand for the summer the simulation overestimated the calculated record the weak model performance during the summer period was also visually noticeable in the hydrographs calibrating to match well the summer events requires to compromise the winter model performance the lack of performance during the summer is thought to be attributed to the inability to capture the characteristics of the short and local intense rainfall characteristics of the summer rainfall the use of map over relatively large basins likely has a smoothing effect that misrepresents the convective characteristics of the summer rainfall events thus a good simulation of summer events requires higher resolution model configuration with input data to represents the convective summer storm characteristics 4 5 alamo lake model an hourly mass balance model that simulates lake level storage and releases from the dam as a function of inflow into the lake is described below the lake operation rules are based on rain on the ground strategy which implies that the operation rules are reactive to observed inflow into the lake the physical dimensions of the lake and the relationships between water level storage and surface area are from kirby and burnham 1998 bill williams river corridor technical committee 1994 and the u s army corps of engineers usace website http resreg spl usace army mil pages alamo php the operational rules that specify dam releases as a function of lake level and season the specification of the dam s dimensions and the monthly lake evaporation values are from the usace operational manual 2003 the operation of the lake is intended to maintain the lake water level at or near 1125 feet 342 9 m for as long as possible this level is considered optimal to satisfy all the objectives of the authorizing legislation and optimize downstream benefits the actual operation of the dam often deviates from the recommended rules during storm events that impact large areas of the colorado river basin releases from alamo dam are coordinated in order to control the flow on the colorado river other cases of deviation from the operational rules may be subjective operational considerations such as dam maintenance and specific downstream demands the simulations and observations of the lake s water level and outflow are shown in fig 9 it is seen that although the lake s actual operation had occasionally deviated from the rules the simulated water level and outflow overall do well at representing the observed record it is important to note that the flood control storage compartment of the lake holds about 600 000 acre feet 740 106 m3 and at this water level the maximum release rate is 7000 cfs 200 cms this is a relatively large storage volume that has been utilized to store water during flood events in the colorado river basin however at the maximum release rate it takes more than 40 days to drain the entire volume of the flood control storage which may be too slow in emergency situations 5 results 5 1 dd vs sd historical period cumulative distributions of the historical inter annual daily precipitation characteristics mean standard deviation and number of rainy days from top to bottom respectively for the dd sd reanalysis and observed map are compared in fig 10 the wrf reanalysis simulation matches well the observed map distribution which implies that at least at the scale analyzed herein the reanalysis simulation captures precipitation features that are important for hydrologic assessment the sd simulations of the three models are as expected very similar to each other since they were created to conform to the livneh dataset however compared with the observed map the sd simulations and therefore also the livneh dataset underestimate the mean and standard deviation and overestimate the number of daily events this underestimation suggests that although the loca well represent the livneh dataset it does not do well representing the cbrfc map for the study area the dd simulations exhibit larger differences among the gcms the three dd simulations overestimate the mean and standard deviation and the frequency of the daily precipitation is underestimated by the mpi and overestimated by both had and gfdl these differences seen in fig 10 between the downscaled simulations dd and sd and the observed map imply that the downscaled simulations are not adequate as rainfall input to the hydrologic model that was developed with the observed map time series in order to use the downscaled simulations as rainfall input to the hydrologic model it is necessary to modify the simulations to have similar characteristics to the input that was used for the configuration of the hydrologic model bias correcting of the sd and dd simulations a practice commonly used may show a good fit in the upper panel of fig 10 but will likely not resolve the differences that are seen in the middle and lower panels which are important precipitation features in arid environment 5 2 sd vs dd future change 5 2 1 tercile analysis the projected mid 21st century 2020 2059 precipitation changes analysis looking at rainfall characteristics that were used for the development of the wg is presented in this section the distributions of the downscaled simulations of the different wg features such as the duration of the storms the time between storms and the hourly magnitudes were compared between the historic and projected periods for the three wetness categories this comparison showed no statistically significant differences between the historic and projected periods for these features which implies that the historic wetness categories represent well the projected rainfall characteristics of the matching wetness category the most notable difference between the historic and projected periods is the frequency in which the wetness categories are projected to occur in the future the projected frequencies of the seasonal wetness categories in mid 21st century as defined by the terciles of the historic period are listed in table 2 in this table chances that are significantly different than the historical period are indicated the significance test was determined from a monte carlo experiment in this experiment we randomly sampled from a continuous uniform distribution that is taking values from 0 to 1 we sampled an ensemble of 100 000 members each member with a sample size of 40 to represent the 40 year the future projection duration of interest the statistical distribution of the tercile values of the ensemble members can be used to estimate the chance of a randomly selected value to be in a given tercile in this monte carlo experiment we found that 5 1 of the terciles were below 0 22 0 18 and above 0 46 0 51 thus it can deduced for example that a given projected wetness category with frequency that is either below 0 18 or above 0 51 has chance of less than 1 to be selected from a uniform distribution and therefore we assume that it is significantly different than 33 for winter season the mpi dd and sd simulations projected a significantly higher frequency of dry winters the dd mpi indicates decreased frequency in wet winters and the sd mpi indicates decreased in normal winters the dd gfdl similarly to the dd mpi shows increase and decrease frequency of dry and normal winters respectively no significant changes in winter projections are seen for the had gcm the projection for higher frequency of dry winters is congruent with the assessment of climate change in the southwest u s report garfin et al 2013 that projected a decrease trend in winter precipitation for the summer season the dd had projected a lower frequency of dry and normal summers and a higher frequency of wet summers in mid 21st century the only other significant result is shown for the dd gfdl that projected decrease frequency of dry summers an analysis of the gcms that participated in the ipcc fifth assessment report indicated a delay in the onset of the monsoon season and increase rainfall in the late summer cook and seager 2013 5 2 2 hydrologic impact results in order to assess the projected hydrologic impact we modified the wg by applying the frequencies of winter and summer wetness categories as indicated in table 2 to generate six additional ensembles sd and dd for three gcms of maps for the eleven sub basins that represent the mid 21st century projections each ensemble consists of 100 realizations of hourly precipitation and each realization is 30 year long these ensembles were used as input to the hydrologic model and the lake model to generate ensembles of lake inflow outflow and water level in fig 11 the cumulative distributions from the 100 realizations of the 30 year mean annual precipitation over the entire bwr watershed are shown the right panel of this figure shows the ratio between the quantiles of the cumulative distributions of the historic and projected simulations the average changes of all the ratios of the quantiles are indicated in the upper right while the dd mpi has a clear signal of drying the dd had and sd had are showing a wetting trend the smallest changes are found for the gfdl for both the mpi and had the largest changes are seen for the dd simulations this behavior is likely the result of the changes in the forcing of the regional climate model as manifested in table 2 as in fig 11 in fig 12 we plot the 30 year mean annual inflow into the lake as expected the direction of the trends for the different projections are similar to the ones shown in fig 11 for the precipitation however the magnitude of the projected change is much larger for the lake inflow the two extreme examples are the dd had with average projection to increase the precipitation by 16 and lake inflow by 42 and the dd mpi with average projection to decrease the precipitation by 9 and lake inflow by 23 this underscores the high sensitivity of the bwr watershed to small changes in precipitation which is attributed to the complex hydrologic response in ephemeral streams the results for the projected changes in the outflow from the lake not shown are very similar to the changes projected for the inflow projected average changes are within 2 of the changes indicated in fig 12 the projected climatic impact on the lake is shown in fig 13 in this figure the cumulative distribution of the percent of the time in the 30 year duration that the water level is projected to drop below 1070 feet which is the optimal lake level for operations see fig 8 is shown while the had showed less events with lake level below this marker the mpi showed a substantial increase in frequency of the lake levels dropping below this marker it is seen that the mpi and had dd simulations produce the extreme wet and dry events respectively the projected extreme high levels of the lake are explored in fig 14 for 1171 3 and 1235 feet water levels which are the flood control threshold and the dam s crest fig 9 respectively we note that the projected encroachment into the flood control reservoir is not substantially different from the historic period and the probabilities for this exceedance are fairly small moreover with the current lake operational rules the chance to reach the crest level is less than 0 1 in frequency of 95 this is because of the large flood control storage that provides a buffer and requires multiple days of very large flow 6 summary and conclusions the objective of this study is to assess the impact the downscaling methodology statistical versus dynamical of the projected mid 21st century on hydrologic assessment in an arid environment our study area the bill williams river watershed that drains into alamo lake is comprised of three ephemeral rivers that are highly sensitive to temporal and spatial precipitation characteristics precipitation projections are available from three cmip5 rcp8 5 gcms that were found to well perform for southwest u s i e hadgem2 es mpi esm lr and gfdl esm2m for these three gcms dynamical downscaled projections using wrf were compared to statistical downscaled projections available from the loca dataset hydrologic assessment was carried out using a modeling framework that is based on the operational hydrologic model configuration used by the nws cbrfc this hydrologic model consists of the sac sma hydrologic model that runs with hourly mean areal precipitation to generate streamflow in ten internal locations and inflow into alamo lake the lake outflow was simulated using usace dam operational rules and lake specifications a precipitation weather generator that represents the temporal and spatial statistical characteristics of the cbrfc map that forces the hydrologic model was developed this wg is developed to produce ensembles of likely to occur hourly precipitation that are congruent with the hydrologic model input the wg was further modified to generate ensembles that reflect the projected mid 21st century as found by the sd and dd simulations of the three selected gcms these ensembles were created by modifying the wg to reflect the projected precipitation changes that were analyzed by comparing the historic and future periods of the climate projections the main findings of this study are that the dd simulations of the mpi and the had showed larger range of projected changes than their corresponding sd simulations these changes however are contradicting in their mid 21st century projection trends as while the mpi projected a drying trend the had projected a wetting trend the projected changes in the frequency of occurrence of dry or wet season imply projected increase in climate variability on the other hand the contradicting trends between the dd mpi and dd had points to the increase uncertainty in the projected future precipitation these changes in wetting and drying are magnified during the progression from precipitation to streamflow to lake inflow and changes to lake level changes in risk of lake flooding were not clearly identified in this study however the main finding points to an increasing challenge to operate the lake in its target water level we note that although the study did not yield a clear trend of drying or wetting it provides uncertainty bounds that can be useful for future planning of the lake operations these uncertainty bounds are much wider when considering the dynamically downscaled models of the mpi and had relying solely on statistically downscaled projections may underestimate the degree of change in projected precipitation this information should guide an adaptive lake operation that can adjust and respond to these uncertain lake water level changes finally we stress that our study used a limited number of downscaled model simulations which may not represent all other statistically and dynamically downscaling procedures moreover the study was conducted in the bill williams river watershed located in the arid southwest us thus the generalization of our conclusions to other downscaled datasets and other regions may not be appropriate acknowledgements funding for this project was provided by the bureau of

8628,a study was conducted to assess the projected impact of future climate on alamo lake and the bill williams river basin we analyzed simulations of three selected representative concentration pathways 8 5 global climate models gcm i e hadgem2 es mpi esm lr and gfdl esm2m these gcms which were part of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report were selected as well performing gcms that represent the historic climatology and prevailing precipitation bearing synoptic conditions in the southwest us an analysis of both statistically and dynamically downscaled simulations projected increase in the frequency of dry winters during the mid 21st century 2020 2059 in two out of the three selected gcms for summer precipitation the statistically downscaled simulations are inconclusive whereas the dynamically downscaled simulations showed significant but contradicting future projections in order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic cycle at the bill williams river basins we developed a modeling framework that includes the following components 1 a weather generator that produces realizations of likely hourly precipitation events over the basin 2 a hydrologic model that is based on the colorado basin river forecast center cbrfc national weather service modeling configuration that predicts flow at ten internal points and inflow into alamo lake and 3 a lake model with the existing operation rules to simulates the lake outflow and levels using the above described modeling framework the impact of the projected mid 21 century climate on alamo lake was examined with respect to the total outflow from the dam the frequency of large outflow events and the frequency of high and low lake levels the results show that dynamic downscaling provides a larger range of impacts than those provided by statistical downscaling the results also indicate a wide range of impact scenarios with contradicting trends among the selected climate projections for mid 21st century these results imply increasing challenges in operating the lake at its target level this modeling framework can potentially be used to examine various future scenarios and to develop recommendations for a sustainable management scheme for the alamo lake keywords bill williams river alamo lake statistical downscaling dynamical downscaling hydrologic impact assessment arid hydrology 1 introduction we conducted a hydrologic impact assessment using projected climate for the mid 21st century at the bill williams river bwr watershed and alamo lake a tributary of the colorado river upstream of lake havasu several studies have explored the projected impact of future climate on the colorado river flow e g christensen and lettenmaier 2007 vano et al 2014 gautam and mascaro 2018 however because of the large spatial climate variability within the colorado river watershed these basin wide studies may not be representative of the bwr tributary in the arid water scarce bwr watershed the precipitation high spatiotemporal variability triggers highly variable streamflow events in ephemeral streams therefore even small projected climatic changes may be a cause of concern our objective in this study is to evaluate the differences in the hydrologic assessment that result from the selection of gcms or the selection of downscaling methodology for hydrologic impact assessment studies a downscaling of global climate models gcms future projections is often needed in order to bridge the scale gap between the coarse gcm simulations and the required finer resolution for regional and local watershed studies two fundamental downscaling approaches are often used statistical downscaling sd and dynamical downscaling dd statistical downscaling sd procedures derive empirical relationships between atmospheric forcing data of the gcm and surface variable of interest in finer resolution to apply those relationships to future gcms projections it assumes that the statistical relationship between the predictors gcm and predictand surface variables do not change over time and are therefore stationary e g carpenter and georgakakos 2001 the sd procedures main advantage is that they do not require special computational resources and therefore can be used to produce high resolution simulations and can be applied for a large number of gcms dynamically downscale dd models use regional climate models nested within the gcm to simulate local climate features they respond in physically consistent ways to resolve regional atmospheric processes and simulate mesoscale variables of interest such as convective storms extreme events and snowfall versus rainfall they simulate internally consistent multivariate quantities within an atmospheric column the main limitation associated with dd is the requirement for intensive computational resources therefore dd simulations are only available for a limited number of gcms general discussion of the pros and cons of selecting one downscaling approach over the other have been the subject of multiple manuscripts e g fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 kotamarthi et al 2016 local hydrologic impact assessment studies for various objectives often face the dilemma of having to choose between sd and dd approaches sd simulations are easier to obtain and there are several readily available datasets that include simulations for many different gcms dd simulations on the other hand require a high level of expertise to produce and are available for only a few gcms this study is geared to evaluate the differences in the hydrologic assessment that result from selecting one downscaling approach over the other we compared between the state of the art dd and sd datasets that are available for the study area to assess the hydrologic impact of the projected climate a hydrologic modeling framework was developed for the bill williams river and alamo lake which consists of a 1 precipitation weather generator wg that produces ensembles of equally likely to occur hourly precipitation sequences 2 hydrologic model that simulates flow in internal points in the basin and inflow into alamo lake and 3 lake model that simulates lake levels and outflow the objective of the wg is to transform the climate models simulations into precipitation ensembles that can be used as input to the hydrologic model a wg ensemble with sufficient realizations represents the spatio temporal variability of the observed record in addition the wg was further modified to reflect changes that were identified by comparing the historic and projected climate models simulations to generate precipitation ensembles that reflect the projected changes this approach provides a tool to translate a single climate model simulation into an ensemble that can be used as input for the hydrologic model and thus simulate a distribution of model outcomes rather than a single simulation this is an attractive approach for water resources planning in arid regions that have large inter and intra annual climate variability and its hydrologic response is very sensitive to nuances in precipitation patterns in the next section section 2 we discuss the selected gcms and their performance for the study area the study area and its hydrologic characteristics are presented in section 3 section 4 is dedicated to the description of the hydrologic modeling framework that is implemented in this study following the results presented in section 5 in section 6 we provide a summary and conclusions 2 selected climate models three gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 simulated with representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp 8 5 were selected for this study the selected gcms are 1 hadgem2 es global environmental model version 2 from the united kingdom meteorological office the hadley centre 2 mpi esm lr earth system model running on low resolution lr grid from the max planck institute for meteorology and 3 gfdl esm2m noaa geophysical fluid dynamic laboratory earth system model these gcms were selected to be dynamically downscaled because of their good performance over north america and because they represent the range of the north america climate sensitivity that is provided by all cmip 5 gcms sheffield et al 2013 i and ii dd precipitation simulations of the three gcms are available for the historic period 1950 2005 and future projections with rcp 8 5 2006 2100 at 25 km horizontal grid resolution from national center for atmospheric research ncar and the university of arizona department of hydrology and atmospheric sciences the simulations followed the specifications of the north america coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex program https na cordex org an initiative sponsored by the world climate research program to provide regional climate downscaling data for regional climate change adaptation and impacts assessment the three gcms were downscaled for the domain of the na cordex program using the advanced research version of the weather research and forecasting wrf model version 3 1 as the regional climate model the configuration of the wrf model is described in castro et al 2017 the simulations are available at 3 hour intervals for the wrf hadgem2 es and 6 hour intervals for the wrf mpi esm lr and wrf gfdl esm2m an equivalent wrf reanalysis 6 hour precipitation dataset 1979 2015 nested within era interim global reanalysis dee et al 2011 is also available at a similar spatial resolution and model configuration as the dd simulations sd daily precipitation for 1950 2005 and 2006 2099 at 0 0625 6 km horizontal grid spacing for the three gcms is available for the western u s from the state of the art localized constructed analogs loca methodology pierce et al 2014 loca s leading downscaling assumption is that the forecast will evolve the same way as the best matching historical event an observed gridded precipitation with similar spatiotemporal resolution for 1950 2015 is available from livneh et al 2013 this dataset which was used as the reference for the derivation of the loca dataset was developed for the conterminous mexico and u s and regions in canada south of 53 n in the southwest u s a credible gcm to be used for hydrologic impact assessment should be one that represents the precipitation characteristics of both winter and summer the prevailing winter storms november march originate from large scale low pressure frontal systems approaching from the west and southwest these storms that may last for a few days to drop persistent rain over large areas often produce snowfall at higher elevations however in our study area the falling snow commonly melts within a few days and is not a major runoff component into alamo lake the prevailing summer rainfall june september is driven by the north american monsson nam climate system which triggers isolated convective cells that often produce intense short lived rainfall events while winter rainfall events generate gradual rising streamflow events with low flow that persists following the rain event summer rainfall events trigger quick and sudden rising flow followed by short lived low flow a comprehensive evaluation analysis of gcms for winter precipitation is available from the california department of water resources 2015 who used 3 step model screening process to evaluate the historical performance of 31 cmip 5 gcms in three sequential spatial scales i e global southwestern u s and california most winter storms to hit arizona originate in the mid latitude pacific ocean and cross over california in their analysis the hadgem2 es was selected among the 10 top performing gcms while the mpi esm lr and gfdl esm2m were selected among the 15 top performing models dominated by regional mesoscale processes representing the nam in the relatively coarse gcm is a challenge e g castro et al 2012 2017 bukovsky et al 2013 2015 geil et al 2013 evaluation of large scale features of the nam system by gcms is an active research topic e g arritt et al 2000 liang et al 2008 lin et al 2008 geil et al 2013 pascale et al 2016 the selected gcms for this study were reported to well represent the nam system geil et al 2013 given our study objective to evaluate the selection impact of the downscaling methodology on hydrologic impact assessments a case can be made that three gcms and one rcm i e wrf as analyzed in this study may not be sufficient to reach conclusions that can be generalized for all sd and dd simulations as mentioned above the selection of the three gcms is constrained by the limited availability of dd simulations the selected datasets as far as we know are the only high resolution datasets readily available and any future climate study conducted in this region would have likely contemplated the use of the dd and sd datasets presented herein therefore it is likely that for the southwest u s region the selected datasets well represent the consequence of the selection of a downscaling procedure 3 study area the bill williams river watershed hereinafter bwr 5393 mile2 13 968 km2 in west central arizona is a tributary of the colorado river that drains into lake havasu just upstream of parker dam alamo dam 36 miles 58 km upstream of the confluence with the colorado river was built in 1968 to form alamo lake as a multi purpose facility with a primary objective to control flooding downstream of the dam on the lower bwr secondary objectives of the lake include water supply and conservation recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement at the site of the dam the contributing drainage area is about 4770 mile2 12 354 km2 from mainly three ephemeral tributaries with a few perennial sections which drain into alamo lake big sandy river santa maria river and burro creek no significant flood control structures exist in the drainage area of these tributaries a map of the bwr watershed with the eleven sub basins that were used for the model development further discussed in section 4 is in fig 1 the diverse physiography of the bwr watershed spans from high elevation forested mountains to rugged desert terrain in the lower elevations detailed hydrologic and geomorphic description of the watershed is provided in house et al 1999 operated by the u s army corp of engineers usace releases from alamo dam have a direct impact on the operation of the lower colorado river by the bureau of reclamation downstream of alamo lake the lower bwr flows through a series of alternating narrow canyons and wider alluvial valley reaches the peak discharge in the u s geological survey usgs gauge just below alamo dam usgs09426000 during the pre dam era was estimated at 200 000 cfs 5660 cms in february 1891 patterson and somers 1966 while post dam maximum discharge as of october 2017 has not exceeded 7000 cfs 200 cms which is the maximum possible release rate from the dam 3 1 climate models evaluation a comparison of the average monthly total precipitation among the sd dd raw gcm wrf era interim reanalysis and gridded observations for the historical period 1950 2005 is shown in fig 2 for the had gem2 es left mpi esm lr center and gfdl esm2m right this figure compares among the spatial averages over the entire bwr watershed and it represents well the results for each of the eleven sub basins figures for the sub basins are not included it is seen that the sd simulations closely follow the observed gridded dataset this is expected because the sd procedure was designed to conform to the observed record the wrf era interim reanalysis follows the seasonal patterns fairly well which is indicative of the skill of wrf for producing monthly climatological averages when it is nested within optimal boundary conditions the added value of wrf is also seen by comparing the raw gcms to the dd simulations marked differences are seen for the summer where raw gcms underestimate the precipitation and dd overestimated by had and lagged by about 1 month by the gfdl 3 2 observation datasets hourly mean areal precipitation map 1 october 1980 30 september 2010 data from the colorado basin river forecast center cbrfc national weather service nws www cbrfc noaa gov are available for eleven sub basins in the bwr watershed table 1 these historical map time series were derived by cbrfc for the purpose of calibration of their hydrologic models using elevation thresholds each of the three tributaries that drain into alamo lake fig 1 was divided into three sub basins upper middle and lower two additional downstream sub basins upper and lower just upstream of the lake were configured by cbrfc the map derivation procedure consists of quality control of the rain gauge records and spatial interpolation with the mountain mapper technique used by the nws river forecast system schaake et al 2004 the inflow into alamo lake was calculated from a mass balance equation using lake s water level from the usace 1980 2010 outflow from the lake as observed at the gauge just below the dam and estimated monthly lake evaporation from cbrfc for the analyses of future projections we used the historic monthly evaporation values it is likely that future climate may impact the lake evaporation however lake evaporation is a complex process and the projection of future evaporation requires analysis of the lake energy balance in addition to the energy and hydrodynamic atmospheric conditions over the lake e g shilo et al 2015 3 3 hydrologic analysis there are two wet seasons winter and summer in the bwr watershed the winter november march peaks in january february and the summer extends from july to september the spring april june is relatively dry with mean areal precipitation of 21 mm and less than 1000 acre feet inflow to the lake the fall october is generally very dry with infrequent very wet storms that have synoptic rainfall bearing conditions that are often different than the ones of the winter storms the difference between winter and summer map is seen in fig 3 for the average over the entire bwr watershed average winter november march and summer june september precipitation as indicated by the dashed lines are 180 and 130 mm season respectively although the winter season is occasionally very wet with a maximum of 430 mm it is more often drier than the average which implies a more skewed distribution skewness coefficients are 0 95 and 0 52 for winter and summer respectively the higher variability of winter precipitation can also be shown by comparing the coefficient of variations 0 6 and 0 4 for winter and summer respectively compared with summer winter streamflow events are longer with larger volume higher daily maximum and the duration between the streamflow events is shorter the shorter duration between winter streamflow events may be attributed to the longer events that have long lasting baseflow shamir et al 2017 in fig 4 total seasonal winter and summer inflow into alamo lake are compared with total seasonal outflow from the lake notice that although average summer precipitation is 75 of the average winter precipitation the average summer inflow into alamo lake is only 10 of the average winter inflow even the largest releases recorded for the summer are relatively small compared with winter releases it is also noted that many of the winters had very low inflows this large seasonal difference between precipitation and streamflow ratio underscores the necessity to consider the properties of the precipitation events and their interaction with land surface processes that control the generation of streamflow 4 hydrologic modeling framework in order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic system in the bwr a hydrologic modeling framework that comprises the following three models was configured precipitation weather generator wg hydrologic model and lake model future projections were applied by modifying the wg to generate hourly precipitation ensembles that reflect the projected changes as inferred from comparing between the simulations of the historic and future periods for each of the downscaled climate models thus the only projected future change that is being considered in this study is the projected change in precipitation the detailed development and evaluation of the hydrologic framework is described in shamir et al 2017 in this section we provide a description of the modeling framework components 4 1 precipitation weather generator the above analysis of the bwr watershed precipitation and lake inflow points to the importance of representing the temporal and spatial characteristics of the rainfall events the purpose of the precipitation wg is to produce numerous equally likely random realistic scenarios of hourly precipitation sequences an ensemble that includes a sufficient number of realizations of these scenarios should represent the spatiotemporal statistical characteristics of the observed record the natural variability of events and their likelihood to occur based on analysis of the map from cbrfc 1980 2010 a wg was developed to simulate likely hourly maps for the 11 sub basins of the bwr watersheds since the wg was developed to describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of the maps time series that were used as input for the development and calibration of the sac sma hydrologic model the wg realizations can be used as precipitation input to the hydrologic model by modifying the wg to reflect the changes that were identified from comparing between the historic and projected simulations of the climate models it is also possible to assess the impact of projected future precipitation changes on the lake inflow and lake level the precipitation wg concept that is presented herein is following on previous work by shamir et al 2007a b 2015 shamir 2017 and wang et al 2007 a detailed description and evaluation of the wg for the bwr watershed is provided in shamir et al 2017 and a brief description is provided below the wg is comprised of two successive modules 1 a point process module to derive hourly map that represents the entire bwr watershed fig 5 left side and 2 a spatial disaggregation module to estimate hourly maps in the eleven sub basins fig 5 right side 4 2 point process module the point process model is developed for three wetness categories wet medium and dry for both winter november march and summer june september the spring april may and fall october were assumed to be dry the highly skewed precipitation distribution and the very large inter annual variability in the arid southwest u s calls for a wg with wetness categories that can be developed independently shamir et al 2007a b the wetness categories represent the tercile statistics of the total observed seasonal summer and winter precipitation during 1980 2010 the selection of a wetness category in the wg for a given season is sampled from a uniform distribution i e a distribution that has constant probability and it is independent from the selected wetness category of the previous seasons following the sampling of a wetness category the duration of winter or summer is determined by sampling the season s precipitation onset and offset the onsets were identified in the observed record as the duration since 1 june and 1 november for the summer and winter respectively when the cumulative areal average precipitation over the entire basin exceeded 10 mm the offset of the seasons were selected as the last precipitation event prior to end of september and the end of march for the summer and winter respectively the onset and offset of the rainy season are selected from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation calculated from the historical record for the winter and summer and for the different wetness categories following the selection of the wetness category and the duration of the rainy period a precipitation time series is being created for the season winter or summer by sequentially sampling from the following distributions inter arrival time of storms duration of storms the chance for an hourly precipitation event to occur and the magnitude of the hourly event this sequential sampling repeats until a time series is generated for the duration from the season s onset to its offset as seen in looping arrow in fig 5 each of this distribution was developed independently for the three wetness categories i e wet medium and dry the point process module is based on the assumption that precipitation storm events tend to arrive in clusters as a response to a transient synoptic scale atmospheric disturbance each synoptic event may produce multiple hourly precipitation pulses with possible multiple dry hours in between the definition of a storm is a key component that is required for the derivation of a sample of observed storms to be used for the development of the wg parameters our storm definition procedure is based on the assumption that the distribution of storms inter arrival time constitutes a poisson stochastic process and therefore the distribution of storms inter arrival times conforms to an exponential distribution restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 thus it is possible by selecting the minimum inter arrival time between storms i e the number of dry hours beyond which the occurrence of rainfall marks the beginning of a new event to develop a statistical sample of storms with inter arrival distribution that has a coefficient of variation of one as in an exponential distribution in this study the minimum inter arrival time were prescribed to 84 and 36 h for the winter and summer respectively a storm event is defined as one that follows the previous storm by a period that is longer than the minimum inter arrival time starts and ends with an occurrence of hourly precipitation events 4 3 precipitation wg spatial distribution the bwr basin wide hourly map realizations that were derived by the point process module are further disaggregated into map for the 11 sub basins the disaggregation consists of two steps first for each wet hour a wetness category in each sub basin is independently assigned the wetness categories which can also include an assignment of no rain event were sampled for winter and summer from a uniform random distribution with chances coefficients as calculated from the observed sub basins map records the chance coefficients indicate the chance of a precipitation event in a sub basin to be in a particular tercile independently of the other sub basins as a function of the wetness category of the average master time series second the magnitude of the hourly precipitation in the sub basins if in the upper tercile is assigned from a generalized pareto distribution with its threshold parameter being the observed 67th percentile in each of the sub basins otherwise the precipitation magnitude is selected from a log normal distribution the parameters of these distributions were derived independently for each sub basin from the observed non zero hourly events in order to better simulate large extreme events we added a chance of one day per winter to sample an upper tercile precipitation event from generalized pareto distributions that were parameterized to represent the annual maxima series of the observed records for each sub basin the threshold parameters of the generalized pareto distributions are assigned as the lowest value of the annual maxima series in the sub basins fig 5 outlines the different wg components the left column describes the sequential sampling process that is used to derive the entire basin areal average hourly time series and the right column describes the sequential sampling process that is used to disaggregate the areal average to areal averages in the sub basins following the selection of a wetness category for a given season winter or summer the duration of the rainy season is selected as the time between the seasonal onset and offset the looping arrow indicates a repetitive sampling sequence that continues until the precipitation simulation is completed for the identified rainy season duration in shamir et al 2017 in addition to detailed description of the wg development the performance of the wg was comprehensively assessed for the winter and summer with respect to the distribution of hourly precipitation frequency of occurrence of hourly events distribution of seasonal totals and occurrence of extreme hourly events these are perceived as precipitation features that control runoff generation in ephemeral streams in figs 6 and 7 we provide an example for the wg performance in simulating the distribution of the winter hourly precipitation and frequency of occurrence of hourly precipitation respectively in these figures the cumulative distributions of 100 wg realizations each 30 years of hourly map for the 11 sub basins similar to the dimension that available for the observed record are shown as gray lines the wg realizations are compared with the cumulative distribution of the observed maps from cbrfc which are shown in red while the cumulative distributions in fig 6 are derived for all non zero precipitation events during the 30 years period in fig 7 the distributions are of a seasonal index and therefore the ensemble comprised of 100 realizations each includes 30 values the wg simulations of the hourly precipitation show tight spread and overall match very well the distribution shape of the observed records in the sub basins fig 6 since the wg was designed to represent the inter and intra annual variability tight spread of the realization and a good match of the shape of the observed distributions are considered favorable traits when comparing multi year time series the lower right panel which compares the distributions of the areal weighted averages over the entire bill williams watershed offers an evaluation measure for the spatial module performance of the wg the inter annual variability of the ensemble is presented by the spread between the realizations of the count of non zero precipitation occurrence distributions fig 7 the distributions of the ensemble s realizations encompass well the observed distributions in the sub basins and slightly underestimate the frequency over the entire watershed lower right panel to the authors knowledge there is no formal methodology for evaluating the performance of a wg ensemble the spread of the ensemble realizations should represent the uncertainty that is associated with the observed record the width of the ensemble spread should neither be too wide or too narrow a narrow spread does not describe the uncertainty and variability in the data while a spread that is too wide may fail to capture the unique characteristics of the data 4 4 hydrologic model sacramento soil moisture accounting in this hydrologic framework we implemented the cbrfc hydrologic model configuration and parameters for the bwr watershed the cbrfc uses the nws river forecast system which includes the following components 1 the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma as hydrologic model that continuously updates the soil moisture conditions and simulates runoff and streamflow in the channels burnash et al 1973 the snow17 model which keeps track of snow accumulation and ablation in the basins anderson 1976 and a unit hydrograph to route the channels streamflow into the sub basins outlets the cbrfc operational model is mainly used to simulate high flow events and in order to accommodate water resources studies the sac sma parameters were further tuned the tuning of the parameters was conducted by comparing the daily streamflow simulations to the observed daily flows at the big sandy usgs 09424450 burro creek usgs 09424447 and santa maria usgs 09424900 fig 1 we used the map time series as input for the sac sma model in order to simulate the daily streamflow that were used for the tuning of the parameters the simulated winter and summer cumulative distributions of the daily inflow into the lake are compared to the calculated inflow in fig 8 for the winter the calculated and simulated cumulative distributions matched very well on the other hand for the summer the simulation overestimated the calculated record the weak model performance during the summer period was also visually noticeable in the hydrographs calibrating to match well the summer events requires to compromise the winter model performance the lack of performance during the summer is thought to be attributed to the inability to capture the characteristics of the short and local intense rainfall characteristics of the summer rainfall the use of map over relatively large basins likely has a smoothing effect that misrepresents the convective characteristics of the summer rainfall events thus a good simulation of summer events requires higher resolution model configuration with input data to represents the convective summer storm characteristics 4 5 alamo lake model an hourly mass balance model that simulates lake level storage and releases from the dam as a function of inflow into the lake is described below the lake operation rules are based on rain on the ground strategy which implies that the operation rules are reactive to observed inflow into the lake the physical dimensions of the lake and the relationships between water level storage and surface area are from kirby and burnham 1998 bill williams river corridor technical committee 1994 and the u s army corps of engineers usace website http resreg spl usace army mil pages alamo php the operational rules that specify dam releases as a function of lake level and season the specification of the dam s dimensions and the monthly lake evaporation values are from the usace operational manual 2003 the operation of the lake is intended to maintain the lake water level at or near 1125 feet 342 9 m for as long as possible this level is considered optimal to satisfy all the objectives of the authorizing legislation and optimize downstream benefits the actual operation of the dam often deviates from the recommended rules during storm events that impact large areas of the colorado river basin releases from alamo dam are coordinated in order to control the flow on the colorado river other cases of deviation from the operational rules may be subjective operational considerations such as dam maintenance and specific downstream demands the simulations and observations of the lake s water level and outflow are shown in fig 9 it is seen that although the lake s actual operation had occasionally deviated from the rules the simulated water level and outflow overall do well at representing the observed record it is important to note that the flood control storage compartment of the lake holds about 600 000 acre feet 740 106 m3 and at this water level the maximum release rate is 7000 cfs 200 cms this is a relatively large storage volume that has been utilized to store water during flood events in the colorado river basin however at the maximum release rate it takes more than 40 days to drain the entire volume of the flood control storage which may be too slow in emergency situations 5 results 5 1 dd vs sd historical period cumulative distributions of the historical inter annual daily precipitation characteristics mean standard deviation and number of rainy days from top to bottom respectively for the dd sd reanalysis and observed map are compared in fig 10 the wrf reanalysis simulation matches well the observed map distribution which implies that at least at the scale analyzed herein the reanalysis simulation captures precipitation features that are important for hydrologic assessment the sd simulations of the three models are as expected very similar to each other since they were created to conform to the livneh dataset however compared with the observed map the sd simulations and therefore also the livneh dataset underestimate the mean and standard deviation and overestimate the number of daily events this underestimation suggests that although the loca well represent the livneh dataset it does not do well representing the cbrfc map for the study area the dd simulations exhibit larger differences among the gcms the three dd simulations overestimate the mean and standard deviation and the frequency of the daily precipitation is underestimated by the mpi and overestimated by both had and gfdl these differences seen in fig 10 between the downscaled simulations dd and sd and the observed map imply that the downscaled simulations are not adequate as rainfall input to the hydrologic model that was developed with the observed map time series in order to use the downscaled simulations as rainfall input to the hydrologic model it is necessary to modify the simulations to have similar characteristics to the input that was used for the configuration of the hydrologic model bias correcting of the sd and dd simulations a practice commonly used may show a good fit in the upper panel of fig 10 but will likely not resolve the differences that are seen in the middle and lower panels which are important precipitation features in arid environment 5 2 sd vs dd future change 5 2 1 tercile analysis the projected mid 21st century 2020 2059 precipitation changes analysis looking at rainfall characteristics that were used for the development of the wg is presented in this section the distributions of the downscaled simulations of the different wg features such as the duration of the storms the time between storms and the hourly magnitudes were compared between the historic and projected periods for the three wetness categories this comparison showed no statistically significant differences between the historic and projected periods for these features which implies that the historic wetness categories represent well the projected rainfall characteristics of the matching wetness category the most notable difference between the historic and projected periods is the frequency in which the wetness categories are projected to occur in the future the projected frequencies of the seasonal wetness categories in mid 21st century as defined by the terciles of the historic period are listed in table 2 in this table chances that are significantly different than the historical period are indicated the significance test was determined from a monte carlo experiment in this experiment we randomly sampled from a continuous uniform distribution that is taking values from 0 to 1 we sampled an ensemble of 100 000 members each member with a sample size of 40 to represent the 40 year the future projection duration of interest the statistical distribution of the tercile values of the ensemble members can be used to estimate the chance of a randomly selected value to be in a given tercile in this monte carlo experiment we found that 5 1 of the terciles were below 0 22 0 18 and above 0 46 0 51 thus it can deduced for example that a given projected wetness category with frequency that is either below 0 18 or above 0 51 has chance of less than 1 to be selected from a uniform distribution and therefore we assume that it is significantly different than 33 for winter season the mpi dd and sd simulations projected a significantly higher frequency of dry winters the dd mpi indicates decreased frequency in wet winters and the sd mpi indicates decreased in normal winters the dd gfdl similarly to the dd mpi shows increase and decrease frequency of dry and normal winters respectively no significant changes in winter projections are seen for the had gcm the projection for higher frequency of dry winters is congruent with the assessment of climate change in the southwest u s report garfin et al 2013 that projected a decrease trend in winter precipitation for the summer season the dd had projected a lower frequency of dry and normal summers and a higher frequency of wet summers in mid 21st century the only other significant result is shown for the dd gfdl that projected decrease frequency of dry summers an analysis of the gcms that participated in the ipcc fifth assessment report indicated a delay in the onset of the monsoon season and increase rainfall in the late summer cook and seager 2013 5 2 2 hydrologic impact results in order to assess the projected hydrologic impact we modified the wg by applying the frequencies of winter and summer wetness categories as indicated in table 2 to generate six additional ensembles sd and dd for three gcms of maps for the eleven sub basins that represent the mid 21st century projections each ensemble consists of 100 realizations of hourly precipitation and each realization is 30 year long these ensembles were used as input to the hydrologic model and the lake model to generate ensembles of lake inflow outflow and water level in fig 11 the cumulative distributions from the 100 realizations of the 30 year mean annual precipitation over the entire bwr watershed are shown the right panel of this figure shows the ratio between the quantiles of the cumulative distributions of the historic and projected simulations the average changes of all the ratios of the quantiles are indicated in the upper right while the dd mpi has a clear signal of drying the dd had and sd had are showing a wetting trend the smallest changes are found for the gfdl for both the mpi and had the largest changes are seen for the dd simulations this behavior is likely the result of the changes in the forcing of the regional climate model as manifested in table 2 as in fig 11 in fig 12 we plot the 30 year mean annual inflow into the lake as expected the direction of the trends for the different projections are similar to the ones shown in fig 11 for the precipitation however the magnitude of the projected change is much larger for the lake inflow the two extreme examples are the dd had with average projection to increase the precipitation by 16 and lake inflow by 42 and the dd mpi with average projection to decrease the precipitation by 9 and lake inflow by 23 this underscores the high sensitivity of the bwr watershed to small changes in precipitation which is attributed to the complex hydrologic response in ephemeral streams the results for the projected changes in the outflow from the lake not shown are very similar to the changes projected for the inflow projected average changes are within 2 of the changes indicated in fig 12 the projected climatic impact on the lake is shown in fig 13 in this figure the cumulative distribution of the percent of the time in the 30 year duration that the water level is projected to drop below 1070 feet which is the optimal lake level for operations see fig 8 is shown while the had showed less events with lake level below this marker the mpi showed a substantial increase in frequency of the lake levels dropping below this marker it is seen that the mpi and had dd simulations produce the extreme wet and dry events respectively the projected extreme high levels of the lake are explored in fig 14 for 1171 3 and 1235 feet water levels which are the flood control threshold and the dam s crest fig 9 respectively we note that the projected encroachment into the flood control reservoir is not substantially different from the historic period and the probabilities for this exceedance are fairly small moreover with the current lake operational rules the chance to reach the crest level is less than 0 1 in frequency of 95 this is because of the large flood control storage that provides a buffer and requires multiple days of very large flow 6 summary and conclusions the objective of this study is to assess the impact the downscaling methodology statistical versus dynamical of the projected mid 21st century on hydrologic assessment in an arid environment our study area the bill williams river watershed that drains into alamo lake is comprised of three ephemeral rivers that are highly sensitive to temporal and spatial precipitation characteristics precipitation projections are available from three cmip5 rcp8 5 gcms that were found to well perform for southwest u s i e hadgem2 es mpi esm lr and gfdl esm2m for these three gcms dynamical downscaled projections using wrf were compared to statistical downscaled projections available from the loca dataset hydrologic assessment was carried out using a modeling framework that is based on the operational hydrologic model configuration used by the nws cbrfc this hydrologic model consists of the sac sma hydrologic model that runs with hourly mean areal precipitation to generate streamflow in ten internal locations and inflow into alamo lake the lake outflow was simulated using usace dam operational rules and lake specifications a precipitation weather generator that represents the temporal and spatial statistical characteristics of the cbrfc map that forces the hydrologic model was developed this wg is developed to produce ensembles of likely to occur hourly precipitation that are congruent with the hydrologic model input the wg was further modified to generate ensembles that reflect the projected mid 21st century as found by the sd and dd simulations of the three selected gcms these ensembles were created by modifying the wg to reflect the projected precipitation changes that were analyzed by comparing the historic and future periods of the climate projections the main findings of this study are that the dd simulations of the mpi and the had showed larger range of projected changes than their corresponding sd simulations these changes however are contradicting in their mid 21st century projection trends as while the mpi projected a drying trend the had projected a wetting trend the projected changes in the frequency of occurrence of dry or wet season imply projected increase in climate variability on the other hand the contradicting trends between the dd mpi and dd had points to the increase uncertainty in the projected future precipitation these changes in wetting and drying are magnified during the progression from precipitation to streamflow to lake inflow and changes to lake level changes in risk of lake flooding were not clearly identified in this study however the main finding points to an increasing challenge to operate the lake in its target water level we note that although the study did not yield a clear trend of drying or wetting it provides uncertainty bounds that can be useful for future planning of the lake operations these uncertainty bounds are much wider when considering the dynamically downscaled models of the mpi and had relying solely on statistically downscaled projections may underestimate the degree of change in projected precipitation this information should guide an adaptive lake operation that can adjust and respond to these uncertain lake water level changes finally we stress that our study used a limited number of downscaled model simulations which may not represent all other statistically and dynamically downscaling procedures moreover the study was conducted in the bill williams river watershed located in the arid southwest us thus the generalization of our conclusions to other downscaled datasets and other regions may not be appropriate acknowledgements funding for this project was provided by the bureau of

8629,this paper studies the relationship between drinking water contamination and treatment costs using a panel data for norwegian local governments in the period 2003 2021 because contamination and costs affect each other we derive and estimate a set of reduced form equations that take the two way causality into account our results indicate that while post treatment contamination has little if any effect on treatment costs increased expenditures reduce contamination in the following years data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction access to high quality drinking water is important for human health and development and concerns about drinking water quality are on the rise 1 water treatment is generally costly 2 and in a world of scarce resources it is vital to learn more about how water contamination affects costs and to which extent expenditures on water treatment are effective in combating post treatment contamination 3 this paper addresses these issues by studying the link between drinking water contamination and costs associated with water supply in norwegian local governments drinking water contamination that is post treatment contamination happens via pipeline leaks problems at treatment plants or if there are shocks to the source water quality such contamination could spark higher costs caused by additional treatment measures capital investments or even investments in new water sources 4 5 at the same time higher spending on water supply systems should all else equal contribute to less contamination in the drinking water this form of two way causality is challenging as we cannot estimate the effect one of the variables has on the other without taking the reverse causality into account we solve the two way causality by transforming the model from a structural model where costs are regressed on contemporaneous contamination and vice versa to a reduced form model where only pre determined values of contamination are included when studying costs and vice versa using this technique we essentially end up with equations on a form well known from time series econometrics as vector auto regressions 6 a difference compared to time series models is that we also include exogenous variables which is often not the case in time series analysis importantly this method allows us to study dynamic relationships and obtain consistent estimators even in the presence of two way causality when we estimate a model that gives treatment costs as a function of past contamination and vice versa we can see if one of the variable changes systematically if the other one changes first in the empirical analysis we use data on water quality and water supply costs for norwegian local governments that cover nearly two decades from 2003 to 2021 our analysis reveals several interesting relationships first the level of treatment costs is very strongly autocorrelated probably indicating a mix of variation in persistent factors that affect the cost level and the cost efficiency in the local governments see renzetti and dupont and 7 for studies on efficiency in water supply and 8 9 and 10 for discussions on efficiency in local governments in norway second we find only a weak indication that contamination leads to an increase in treatment costs this can indicate that the necessary measures do not require significant additional costs third while contamination is also autocorrelated there is seemingly a large degree of randomness in contamination fourth we find that higher expenditures in the past are associated with less contamination in the drinking water our study contributes to a broad literature on water contamination and costs as treatment costs rise local governments and drinking water treatment plants must look for cost efficient ways to meet required water quality standards in a recent review and synthesis ref 11 discuss the literature on effects from source water quality on drinking water treatment costs a central idea in this literature is that source water protection can be useful as it reduces traditional treatment costs they note that while it is commonly assumed that source water protection is superior less expensive that is to traditional water treatment actual evidence is scarce 12 13 however ref 3 find significant effects of forest land use on costs of the drinking water supply forests provide filtering and purification services impacting source water quality nevertheless ref 11 conclude that while their work reveals a large range of elasticities in the literature the effect is smaller and the ranges mostly narrower in studies that incorporate control variables hence their analysis of the literature does not offer much support to the notion that source water protection is more cost efficient than traditional water treatment of the surveyed papers refs 14 15 who both apply refined econometric techniques to relatively recent time series and panel data reach conclusions that are generally in line with the conclusions in ref 11 our paper differs from those studied by ref 11 in the sense that we study the effects of contamination of water that comes out of a drinking water plant rather than source water hence we study how post treatment contamination affects costs and how treatment affects quality our paper thus helps to fill a closely related although not identical gap in the literature we observe both contamination and treatment costs aggregated at the municipal level which makes specific inferences with regard to policy difficult but the vector autoregression framework addressing the potential two way causality between treatment and contamination can readily be applied to observations on the treatment plant level plant level observations would yield policy relevant information about relationships between expenditures and drinking water quality for municipal decision makers in a review of the economics of water quality ref 16 discusses issues that in a broader view are of relevance to our study of the relationship between water quality and treatment costs in particular the review points out that the policy instrument choice with uniform water quality standards are likely not efficient because of significant economies of scale in drinking water treatment the per capita cost of achieving a given standard may differ by orders of magnitude for large and small water systems thus at least for some type of contamination it may be more efficient to set local standards reflecting local preferences for the trade off between risk reduction and control costs 17 however preferences may have a limited relation to objective water quality 18 making such assessments difficult notwithstanding the discussion highlights the importance of detailed and local information as well as controlling for the size of the municipal population 2 data and methodology 2 1 local government water supply norwegian local governments are responsible for a wide array of public services including supply of drinking water there are more than 1 000 local government drinking water plants in norway and these supply drinking water to roughly 85 of the norwegian population the main revenue sources for local governments are taxes grants from the central government and user charges whereas the local governments have a large degree of discretion on the expenditure side revenues are heavily regulated under central standards the opportunity to influence current revenues is in practice limited to property tax and user charges that are limited to covering costs statistics norway publishes costs and user charges related to the supply of drinking water by law the user charges should cover average treatment so these are very tightly correlated similar arrangements with user charges set to average costs is also used in other countries 3 in norway user charges are set in the budget of local governments budgets for year t 1 are set in year t and are with regard to water user charges based on contamination data for year t 1 19 however decision makers are most likely informed about contamination events before the data are made public in particular serious contamination events make headline news some norwegian cases are discussed in refs 20 21 and 22 2 2 water quality data the owners of water supply systems are required to report test results on water quality to the norwegian food safety authority mattilsynet each year statistics norway ssb publishes summary data the variable provided by ssb gives the share of the population that have access to water that satisfies a variety of test criteria as listed in table 1 table 2 summarizes the data for the test results the data forms an unbalanced panel for contamination events in norwegian municipalities in the first row we see the averages for the dataset as a whole these indicate that a large majority of norwegian citizens have access to satisfactory tap water the numbers are particularly high for e coli and intestinal enterococci at above 96 which are the more serious types of contamination further we note that we have much fewer observations for intestinal enterococci than for the other pollutants this is because we do not have data for intestinal enterococci prior to 2009 in fig 1 we present the development of water contamination over time we define water contamination as a dummy equal to one if contamination of any sort is found in a local government and graph the percentage of local governments where the dummy is equal to one we see that the share of local governments with contaminated drinking water was rather stable in the first years until a downward trend startet around 2011 in the period 2003 2016 hovering around about 45 50 from 2017 the share stabilizes at about 7 9 in our subsequent analysis we consider this general water contamination dummy variable as the main case we run robustness checks with separate contamination type dummies to see whether results differ substantially for the different contamination types we also run our analysis with a reduced sample that excludes the observations subsequent to the level shift in 2017 2 3 costs of water supply table 3 and fig 2 presents descriptive statistics for the treatment costs per capita table 3 represents statistics across municipalities fig 2 represents the mean treatment costs across time from table 3 the main take away is that there is substantial variation in treatment costs across municipalities fig 2 is perhaps more interesting as it shows a very steady time trend the mean treatment costs per capita increase a little bit every year and when we add all together it is about doubled in real prices in 2021 compared to 2003 it is an interesting observation as there seems to be a downward trend in contamination while there is an upward trend in costs 2 4 correlations table 4 presents a set of correlations between our variables of interest in the present and past we first observe that the contemporary correlation between treatment costs and contamination is significantly negative this can be interpreted in favor of a hypothesis that high expenditures lead to less contamination however it would also be consistent with the very counter intuitive result that high contamination leads to lower treatment costs hence one ought to be very cautious when interpreting such raw correlations probably more interesting is it that the correlation between contamination and past expenditures is also negative since the past is by definition pre determined this lends greater support to the hypothesis that high expenditures give less contamination but we cannot conclude without first conducting a thorough econometric analysis that properly models the autocorrelation structure in the variables we will discuss such issues in greater detail in the methodology section below when we look at the correlation between present treatment costs and past contamination we see that costs are not correlated to last year s contamination but positively correlated to contamination two years ago this is consistent with a hypothesis that contamination leads to an increase in future water supply costs the zero correlation between treatment costs and contamination in the year before can indicate that it takes a while to plan and implement policies that lead to higher costs finally we observe that both treatment costs and contamination are strongly autoregressive that is both variables depend strongly on past values of itself the autocorrelation is particularly strong for treatment costs about 0 9 for both the first and the second lag for contamination the correlation between the present value and the first lag is close to 0 6 while the correlation between the present value and the second lag is almost 0 5 2 5 methodology we want to study the relationship between water costs and contamination in addition it is reasonable to assume that there is substantial autocorrelation in both costs and contamination and that a model should thus include lagged dependent variables in each equation furthermore there are several other local government characteristics that can have an affect on the variables of interest hence we use the following model as a point of departure for our empirical analysis 1 c i t β 0 β 1 c i t 1 β 2 q i t β x x i t ξ i δ t u i t 2 q i t α 0 α 1 c i t α 2 q i t 1 α x x i t ε i γ t v i t c i t is the cost of water treatment in local government i in year t while q i t is a dummy equal to one if contamination of any sort is discovered in i s the drinking water in year t x i t is a vector of exogenous control variables that contain fiscal and demographic variables that can be correlated with the quality of the drinking water and treatment costs specifically the vector includes local government revenue and debt both measured per capita in addition to the population size in the local government we report descriptive statistics for these variables in the appendix the error terms in the two equations consist of three parts one that varies only across local governments ξ i and ε i one that varies over time but is identical for all local governments δ t and γ t and one that varies both over time and across local governments u i t and v i t in order to avoid bias from omitted variables that vary only across local governments we remove the first part of the error term by using local government fixed effects in the regression model similarly we avoid omitted variable bias stemming from trends that affect all local governments identically by adding year dummies time fixed effects to the regression thus canceling out the time specific error terms note that while studies often control for factors such as volume of treated water labor costs chemical and energy prices and so forth 7 23 27 we do not include such factors explicitly chemical and energy prices and other macro variables are captured by time dummies volume and labor costs are scale variables that are partly captured by the local government fixed effects and partly by the population size of the local government due to the very high coverage of local government water plants estimations of the structural equations 1 and 2 will produce biased estimates since present water contamination is a determinant for treatment costs in 1 while present treatment costs is a determinant for contamination in 2 the bias is discussed more closely in the appendix there we show that if we assume contamination to cause higher treatment costs while higher treatment costs contribute to less contamination estimations of equations 1 and 2 will likely underestimate both effects one way to circumvent this problem is to solve the two equation for treatment costs and contamination and obtain the reduced form where we for sake of notation skip the error term components that cancel under fixed effects c i t β 0 β 2 α 0 1 α 1 β 1 β 1 1 α 1 β 1 c i t 1 β 2 α 2 1 α 1 β 1 q i t 1 β 2 α x β x 1 α 1 β 1 x i t u i t β 2 v i t 1 α 1 β 1 3 c i t θ 0 θ 1 c i t 1 θ 2 q i t 1 θ x x i t κ i t q i

include only pre determined endogenous variables in addition to the vector of exogenous control variables on the right hand side given that we control adequately for the dynamic relationships in practice include sufficient lags for the dependent variable we can estimate these equations using ols and obtain consistent estimators for notational simplicity the model we derived here includes only one lag a single lag is probably not enough to capture the dynamic relationship though for example it may take several years for a local government to make the necessary investments following a period with poor water quality hence it is possible that we do not observe an effect on costs after just one year consequently we will include up to four lags in the empirical models that we estimate compared to non linear techniques such as logit the linear probability estimator has the advantage that it is readily interpreted and the disadvantage that it could predict infeasible probability estimates however as we are merely interested in how expenditures affect the probability of contamination not to estimate the exact probability the linear estimator serves well for our purpose we have estimated the main results also using logit and the results are qualitatively similar note that since lagged dependent variables are correlated with the error term in previous years including such in the regression might bias our results see ref 28 for more hence one can argue that we should use gmm techniques such as those suggested by refs 29 30 however when using fixed effects the bias fades away as the length of the time series in the panel data grows and with a long series such as ours the bias will not be particularly severe moreover as it is not the coefficients of the lagged dependent variable that is of central interest the bias is only relevant if it spills over to the coefficients of main interest θ 2 and φ 1 as the correlation between treatment costs and contamination is not very strong see table 4 this should not be a major problem as we work with panel data and can control effectively for trends using time dummies we are not too concerned about stationarity of the variables however since we use techniques that are closely related to time series econometrics we find it worthwhile to comment briefly on the issue contamination is a dummy which cannot drift off but treatment costs can be non stationary even though we of course use fixed prices the same goes for some of the control variables in particular population size local government revenues and local government debt we have tested these variables for unit roots using an augmented dickey fuller test that has been adopted for non balanced panel data 31 and the conclusion is that all variables are stationary test results are provided in the online appendix see table oa1 3 results table 5 gives the results for the regressions with treatment costs per capita as the dependent variable a first observation is that there is very strong autocorrelation in the level of treatment costs as was also evident from the descriptive statistics we further see that there are some indications that past contamination can lead to increased treatment costs the link is relatively weak though and only significant in the ols analyses that make use of variation both between and within local governments the coefficients indicate that local governments that experience contamination in the year before is associated with about nok20 more in treatment costs per capita than those with no contamination the longer lags are far from being statistically significant on any conventional level of significance when we look at the fe results we see that with the exception of the simplest fe model in column b the coefficients are largely in the same ballpark as the ols results although not statistically significant regardless if we were to interpret these results as suggesting an effect of nok20 this is an effect that makes up only about 1 1 of the mean treatment costs per capita hence there is very little in our data that suggests contamination has an important effect on treatment costs a likely explanation is that actual water treatment represents a small share of the incurred costs and that the bulk of costs are related to water sources or the water supply system in the most general model reported in column i we see that indebted local governments have higher treatment costs the small effect notwithstanding a potential explanation is that investments in water treatment plants or the water supply system which would be included in our cost data are expensive and local governments with such recent investments are likely indebted we also observe that population size has a significant effect suggesting economies of scale in water supply systems 16 for robustness we reran the specification reported in column e for the separate contamination types results are reported in the online appendix table oa2 effect sizes are similar to the main results apart from contamination by intestinal enterococci where there is seemingly no effect most likely because there are few events for this type of contamination table oa4 reports a specification with a more detailed structure for the population variable but it seems the municipal fixed effects adequately captures population size effects if we estimate the model for treatment costs in oa4 without municipal fixed effects we get that treatment costs per capita is lower the larger the municipality similar to the main specification in table 5 we also reran the specification reported in column e after limiting the sample to the years 2003 2016 to see whether the change in contamination level in more recent years impacts our results see column a in table oa5 in the online appendix we conclude that time and municipal fixed effects appropriately accounts for the shift in level table 6 reports the results for the regressions with contamination as the dependent variable note that since contamination is a dummy the table reports a linear probability model we have also estimated the models using logit this does not qualitatively change the conclusions below see online appendix table oa6 for results we see that the autocorrelation in contamination is not nearly as strong as for treatment costs this suggests that although some local governments are consistently more exposed to contamination than others there is a substantial element of unpredictability and probably unfortunate coincidences involved when we turn the attention to the effect past expenditures have on present contamination we see in the two first columns that when we include only one lag the coefficient for this lag is significantly negative hence the results suggest that higher expenditures in the past reduces the risk of contamination in the present the fe coefficient in column b indicate that if treatment costs per capita at t 1 increase by nok250 the probability of contamination at t is reduced by almost 1 the interpretation of the coefficient is the effect per 1 nok this reduction in contamination probability translates to about 2 8 of the unconditional probability of contamination in our data that is the average of the contamination dummy if we let treatment costs increase by a full standard deviation nok704 the effect on the probability is about 2 7 or about 7 5 of the mean unconditional probability when we include more lags the coefficient for the first lag turns positive sometimes even significantly so while the second lag is significantly negative throughout this likely as a straightforward explanation in that it takes time from measures are taken and thus costs are increased until these have an effect on the water quality hence the negative coefficient in the one lag specification is probably an omitted variable bias where the negative effect from the second lag is partly captured by the coefficient for the first lag the negative coefficient for the second lag is also substantially larger than the one for the first lag in the one lag specification which we would expect since it is only partially captured in the simplest model the model does not suggest that the effects take very long time though since the third and fourth lag are never close to being significant on any conventional significance level if we look at the most general model in column i which includes four lags and the set of control variables the coefficient is about twice of the first lag coefficient discussed above hence an increase in treatment costs per capita by nok250 at t 2 would imply a reduced probability of contamination by about 2 or roughly 5 6 of the unconditional probability an increase in treatment costs by a full standard deviation would imply a reduction in the probability of contamination by about 5 6 or 15 5 of the unconditional probability our data thus suggest that variation in treatment costs can be an important determinant for contamination risk it is also worth noting that the coefficient remains relatively stable across specifications also when changing between ols and fe it thus seems that

8629,this paper studies the relationship between drinking water contamination and treatment costs using a panel data for norwegian local governments in the period 2003 2021 because contamination and costs affect each other we derive and estimate a set of reduced form equations that take the two way causality into account our results indicate that while post treatment contamination has little if any effect on treatment costs increased expenditures reduce contamination in the following years data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction access to high quality drinking water is important for human health and development and concerns about drinking water quality are on the rise 1 water treatment is generally costly 2 and in a world of scarce resources it is vital to learn more about how water contamination affects costs and to which extent expenditures on water treatment are effective in combating post treatment contamination 3 this paper addresses these issues by studying the link between drinking water contamination and costs associated with water supply in norwegian local governments drinking water contamination that is post treatment contamination happens via pipeline leaks problems at treatment plants or if there are shocks to the source water quality such contamination could spark higher costs caused by additional treatment measures capital investments or even investments in new water sources 4 5 at the same time higher spending on water supply systems should all else equal contribute to less contamination in the drinking water this form of two way causality is challenging as we cannot estimate the effect one of the variables has on the other without taking the reverse causality into account we solve the two way causality by transforming the model from a structural model where costs are regressed on contemporaneous contamination and vice versa to a reduced form model where only pre determined values of contamination are included when studying costs and vice versa using this technique we essentially end up with equations on a form well known from time series econometrics as vector auto regressions 6 a difference compared to time series models is that we also include exogenous variables which is often not the case in time series analysis importantly this method allows us to study dynamic relationships and obtain consistent estimators even in the presence of two way causality when we estimate a model that gives treatment costs as a function of past contamination and vice versa we can see if one of the variable changes systematically if the other one changes first in the empirical analysis we use data on water quality and water supply costs for norwegian local governments that cover nearly two decades from 2003 to 2021 our analysis reveals several interesting relationships first the level of treatment costs is very strongly autocorrelated probably indicating a mix of variation in persistent factors that affect the cost level and the cost efficiency in the local governments see renzetti and dupont and 7 for studies on efficiency in water supply and 8 9 and 10 for discussions on efficiency in local governments in norway second we find only a weak indication that contamination leads to an increase in treatment costs this can indicate that the necessary measures do not require significant additional costs third while contamination is also autocorrelated there is seemingly a large degree of randomness in contamination fourth we find that higher expenditures in the past are associated with less contamination in the drinking water our study contributes to a broad literature on water contamination and costs as treatment costs rise local governments and drinking water treatment plants must look for cost efficient ways to meet required water quality standards in a recent review and synthesis ref 11 discuss the literature on effects from source water quality on drinking water treatment costs a central idea in this literature is that source water protection can be useful as it reduces traditional treatment costs they note that while it is commonly assumed that source water protection is superior less expensive that is to traditional water treatment actual evidence is scarce 12 13 however ref 3 find significant effects of forest land use on costs of the drinking water supply forests provide filtering and purification services impacting source water quality nevertheless ref 11 conclude that while their work reveals a large range of elasticities in the literature the effect is smaller and the ranges mostly narrower in studies that incorporate control variables hence their analysis of the literature does not offer much support to the notion that source water protection is more cost efficient than traditional water treatment of the surveyed papers refs 14 15 who both apply refined econometric techniques to relatively recent time series and panel data reach conclusions that are generally in line with the conclusions in ref 11 our paper differs from those studied by ref 11 in the sense that we study the effects of contamination of water that comes out of a drinking water plant rather than source water hence we study how post treatment contamination affects costs and how treatment affects quality our paper thus helps to fill a closely related although not identical gap in the literature we observe both contamination and treatment costs aggregated at the municipal level which makes specific inferences with regard to policy difficult but the vector autoregression framework addressing the potential two way causality between treatment and contamination can readily be applied to observations on the treatment plant level plant level observations would yield policy relevant information about relationships between expenditures and drinking water quality for municipal decision makers in a review of the economics of water quality ref 16 discusses issues that in a broader view are of relevance to our study of the relationship between water quality and treatment costs in particular the review points out that the policy instrument choice with uniform water quality standards are likely not efficient because of significant economies of scale in drinking water treatment the per capita cost of achieving a given standard may differ by orders of magnitude for large and small water systems thus at least for some type of contamination it may be more efficient to set local standards reflecting local preferences for the trade off between risk reduction and control costs 17 however preferences may have a limited relation to objective water quality 18 making such assessments difficult notwithstanding the discussion highlights the importance of detailed and local information as well as controlling for the size of the municipal population 2 data and methodology 2 1 local government water supply norwegian local governments are responsible for a wide array of public services including supply of drinking water there are more than 1 000 local government drinking water plants in norway and these supply drinking water to roughly 85 of the norwegian population the main revenue sources for local governments are taxes grants from the central government and user charges whereas the local governments have a large degree of discretion on the expenditure side revenues are heavily regulated under central standards the opportunity to influence current revenues is in practice limited to property tax and user charges that are limited to covering costs statistics norway publishes costs and user charges related to the supply of drinking water by law the user charges should cover average treatment so these are very tightly correlated similar arrangements with user charges set to average costs is also used in other countries 3 in norway user charges are set in the budget of local governments budgets for year t 1 are set in year t and are with regard to water user charges based on contamination data for year t 1 19 however decision makers are most likely informed about contamination events before the data are made public in particular serious contamination events make headline news some norwegian cases are discussed in refs 20 21 and 22 2 2 water quality data the owners of water supply systems are required to report test results on water quality to the norwegian food safety authority mattilsynet each year statistics norway ssb publishes summary data the variable provided by ssb gives the share of the population that have access to water that satisfies a variety of test criteria as listed in table 1 table 2 summarizes the data for the test results the data forms an unbalanced panel for contamination events in norwegian municipalities in the first row we see the averages for the dataset as a whole these indicate that a large majority of norwegian citizens have access to satisfactory tap water the numbers are particularly high for e coli and intestinal enterococci at above 96 which are the more serious types of contamination further we note that we have much fewer observations for intestinal enterococci than for the other pollutants this is because we do not have data for intestinal enterococci prior to 2009 in fig 1 we present the development of water contamination over time we define water contamination as a dummy equal to one if contamination of any sort is found in a local government and graph the percentage of local governments where the dummy is equal to one we see that the share of local governments with contaminated drinking water was rather stable in the first years until a downward trend startet around 2011 in the period 2003 2016 hovering around about 45 50 from 2017 the share stabilizes at about 7 9 in our subsequent analysis we consider this general water contamination dummy variable as the main case we run robustness checks with separate contamination type dummies to see whether results differ substantially for the different contamination types we also run our analysis with a reduced sample that excludes the observations subsequent to the level shift in 2017 2 3 costs of water supply table 3 and fig 2 presents descriptive statistics for the treatment costs per capita table 3 represents statistics across municipalities fig 2 represents the mean treatment costs across time from table 3 the main take away is that there is substantial variation in treatment costs across municipalities fig 2 is perhaps more interesting as it shows a very steady time trend the mean treatment costs per capita increase a little bit every year and when we add all together it is about doubled in real prices in 2021 compared to 2003 it is an interesting observation as there seems to be a downward trend in contamination while there is an upward trend in costs 2 4 correlations table 4 presents a set of correlations between our variables of interest in the present and past we first observe that the contemporary correlation between treatment costs and contamination is significantly negative this can be interpreted in favor of a hypothesis that high expenditures lead to less contamination however it would also be consistent with the very counter intuitive result that high contamination leads to lower treatment costs hence one ought to be very cautious when interpreting such raw correlations probably more interesting is it that the correlation between contamination and past expenditures is also negative since the past is by definition pre determined this lends greater support to the hypothesis that high expenditures give less contamination but we cannot conclude without first conducting a thorough econometric analysis that properly models the autocorrelation structure in the variables we will discuss such issues in greater detail in the methodology section below when we look at the correlation between present treatment costs and past contamination we see that costs are not correlated to last year s contamination but positively correlated to contamination two years ago this is consistent with a hypothesis that contamination leads to an increase in future water supply costs the zero correlation between treatment costs and contamination in the year before can indicate that it takes a while to plan and implement policies that lead to higher costs finally we observe that both treatment costs and contamination are strongly autoregressive that is both variables depend strongly on past values of itself the autocorrelation is particularly strong for treatment costs about 0 9 for both the first and the second lag for contamination the correlation between the present value and the first lag is close to 0 6 while the correlation between the present value and the second lag is almost 0 5 2 5 methodology we want to study the relationship between water costs and contamination in addition it is reasonable to assume that there is substantial autocorrelation in both costs and contamination and that a model should thus include lagged dependent variables in each equation furthermore there are several other local government characteristics that can have an affect on the variables of interest hence we use the following model as a point of departure for our empirical analysis 1 c i t β 0 β 1 c i t 1 β 2 q i t β x x i t ξ i δ t u i t 2 q i t α 0 α 1 c i t α 2 q i t 1 α x x i t ε i γ t v i t c i t is the cost of water treatment in local government i in year t while q i t is a dummy equal to one if contamination of any sort is discovered in i s the drinking water in year t x i t is a vector of exogenous control variables that contain fiscal and demographic variables that can be correlated with the quality of the drinking water and treatment costs specifically the vector includes local government revenue and debt both measured per capita in addition to the population size in the local government we report descriptive statistics for these variables in the appendix the error terms in the two equations consist of three parts one that varies only across local governments ξ i and ε i one that varies over time but is identical for all local governments δ t and γ t and one that varies both over time and across local governments u i t and v i t in order to avoid bias from omitted variables that vary only across local governments we remove the first part of the error term by using local government fixed effects in the regression model similarly we avoid omitted variable bias stemming from trends that affect all local governments identically by adding year dummies time fixed effects to the regression thus canceling out the time specific error terms note that while studies often control for factors such as volume of treated water labor costs chemical and energy prices and so forth 7 23 27 we do not include such factors explicitly chemical and energy prices and other macro variables are captured by time dummies volume and labor costs are scale variables that are partly captured by the local government fixed effects and partly by the population size of the local government due to the very high coverage of local government water plants estimations of the structural equations 1 and 2 will produce biased estimates since present water contamination is a determinant for treatment costs in 1 while present treatment costs is a determinant for contamination in 2 the bias is discussed more closely in the appendix there we show that if we assume contamination to cause higher treatment costs while higher treatment costs contribute to less contamination estimations of equations 1 and 2 will likely underestimate both effects one way to circumvent this problem is to solve the two equation for treatment costs and contamination and obtain the reduced form where we for sake of notation skip the error term components that cancel under fixed effects c i t β 0 β 2 α 0 1 α 1 β 1 β 1 1 α 1 β 1 c i t 1 β 2 α 2 1 α 1 β 1 q i t 1 β 2 α x β x 1 α 1 β 1 x i t u i t β 2 v i t 1 α 1 β 1 3 c i t θ 0 θ 1 c i t 1 θ 2 q i t 1 θ x x i t κ i t q i

include only pre determined endogenous variables in addition to the vector of exogenous control variables on the right hand side given that we control adequately for the dynamic relationships in practice include sufficient lags for the dependent variable we can estimate these equations using ols and obtain consistent estimators for notational simplicity the model we derived here includes only one lag a single lag is probably not enough to capture the dynamic relationship though for example it may take several years for a local government to make the necessary investments following a period with poor water quality hence it is possible that we do not observe an effect on costs after just one year consequently we will include up to four lags in the empirical models that we estimate compared to non linear techniques such as logit the linear probability estimator has the advantage that it is readily interpreted and the disadvantage that it could predict infeasible probability estimates however as we are merely interested in how expenditures affect the probability of contamination not to estimate the exact probability the linear estimator serves well for our purpose we have estimated the main results also using logit and the results are qualitatively similar note that since lagged dependent variables are correlated with the error term in previous years including such in the regression might bias our results see ref 28 for more hence one can argue that we should use gmm techniques such as those suggested by refs 29 30 however when using fixed effects the bias fades away as the length of the time series in the panel data grows and with a long series such as ours the bias will not be particularly severe moreover as it is not the coefficients of the lagged dependent variable that is of central interest the bias is only relevant if it spills over to the coefficients of main interest θ 2 and φ 1 as the correlation between treatment costs and contamination is not very strong see table 4 this should not be a major problem as we work with panel data and can control effectively for trends using time dummies we are not too concerned about stationarity of the variables however since we use techniques that are closely related to time series econometrics we find it worthwhile to comment briefly on the issue contamination is a dummy which cannot drift off but treatment costs can be non stationary even though we of course use fixed prices the same goes for some of the control variables in particular population size local government revenues and local government debt we have tested these variables for unit roots using an augmented dickey fuller test that has been adopted for non balanced panel data 31 and the conclusion is that all variables are stationary test results are provided in the online appendix see table oa1 3 results table 5 gives the results for the regressions with treatment costs per capita as the dependent variable a first observation is that there is very strong autocorrelation in the level of treatment costs as was also evident from the descriptive statistics we further see that there are some indications that past contamination can lead to increased treatment costs the link is relatively weak though and only significant in the ols analyses that make use of variation both between and within local governments the coefficients indicate that local governments that experience contamination in the year before is associated with about nok20 more in treatment costs per capita than those with no contamination the longer lags are far from being statistically significant on any conventional level of significance when we look at the fe results we see that with the exception of the simplest fe model in column b the coefficients are largely in the same ballpark as the ols results although not statistically significant regardless if we were to interpret these results as suggesting an effect of nok20 this is an effect that makes up only about 1 1 of the mean treatment costs per capita hence there is very little in our data that suggests contamination has an important effect on treatment costs a likely explanation is that actual water treatment represents a small share of the incurred costs and that the bulk of costs are related to water sources or the water supply system in the most general model reported in column i we see that indebted local governments have higher treatment costs the small effect notwithstanding a potential explanation is that investments in water treatment plants or the water supply system which would be included in our cost data are expensive and local governments with such recent investments are likely indebted we also observe that population size has a significant effect suggesting economies of scale in water supply systems 16 for robustness we reran the specification reported in column e for the separate contamination types results are reported in the online appendix table oa2 effect sizes are similar to the main results apart from contamination by intestinal enterococci where there is seemingly no effect most likely because there are few events for this type of contamination table oa4 reports a specification with a more detailed structure for the population variable but it seems the municipal fixed effects adequately captures population size effects if we estimate the model for treatment costs in oa4 without municipal fixed effects we get that treatment costs per capita is lower the larger the municipality similar to the main specification in table 5 we also reran the specification reported in column e after limiting the sample to the years 2003 2016 to see whether the change in contamination level in more recent years impacts our results see column a in table oa5 in the online appendix we conclude that time and municipal fixed effects appropriately accounts for the shift in level table 6 reports the results for the regressions with contamination as the dependent variable note that since contamination is a dummy the table reports a linear probability model we have also estimated the models using logit this does not qualitatively change the conclusions below see online appendix table oa6 for results we see that the autocorrelation in contamination is not nearly as strong as for treatment costs this suggests that although some local governments are consistently more exposed to contamination than others there is a substantial element of unpredictability and probably unfortunate coincidences involved when we turn the attention to the effect past expenditures have on present contamination we see in the two first columns that when we include only one lag the coefficient for this lag is significantly negative hence the results suggest that higher expenditures in the past reduces the risk of contamination in the present the fe coefficient in column b indicate that if treatment costs per capita at t 1 increase by nok250 the probability of contamination at t is reduced by almost 1 the interpretation of the coefficient is the effect per 1 nok this reduction in contamination probability translates to about 2 8 of the unconditional probability of contamination in our data that is the average of the contamination dummy if we let treatment costs increase by a full standard deviation nok704 the effect on the probability is about 2 7 or about 7 5 of the mean unconditional probability when we include more lags the coefficient for the first lag turns positive sometimes even significantly so while the second lag is significantly negative throughout this likely as a straightforward explanation in that it takes time from measures are taken and thus costs are increased until these have an effect on the water quality hence the negative coefficient in the one lag specification is probably an omitted variable bias where the negative effect from the second lag is partly captured by the coefficient for the first lag the negative coefficient for the second lag is also substantially larger than the one for the first lag in the one lag specification which we would expect since it is only partially captured in the simplest model the model does not suggest that the effects take very long time though since the third and fourth lag are never close to being significant on any conventional significance level if we look at the most general model in column i which includes four lags and the set of control variables the coefficient is about twice of the first lag coefficient discussed above hence an increase in treatment costs per capita by nok250 at t 2 would imply a reduced probability of contamination by about 2 or roughly 5 6 of the unconditional probability an increase in treatment costs by a full standard deviation would imply a reduction in the probability of contamination by about 5 6 or 15 5 of the unconditional probability our data thus suggest that variation in treatment costs can be an important determinant for contamination risk it is also worth noting that the coefficient remains relatively stable across specifications also when changing between ols and fe it thus seems that characteristics of the municipalities do not affect our coefficients of interest much we also reran the specification reported in column e after limiting the sample to the years 2003 2016 to see whether the change in contamination level in more recent years impacts our results see column b in table oa5 in the online appendix we conclude that time and municipal fixed effects appropriately accounts for the shift in level 4 concluding remarks water treatment is costly for example expenditures on water pollution control in the u s hovered around half a percent of gdp after relevant
