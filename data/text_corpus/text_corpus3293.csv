16465,nanoplastics nps pollution of aquatic systems is becoming an emerging environmental issue due to their stable structure high mobility and easy interactions with ambient contaminants effective removal technologies are urgently needed to mitigate their toxic effects in this study we systematically investigated the removal effectiveness and mechanisms of a commonly detected nanoplastics carboxyl modified polystyrene ps cooh via coagulation and sedimentation processes using aluminum chloride alcl3 as a coagulant ps cooh appeared as clearly defined and discrete spherical nanoparticles in water with a hydrodynamic diameter of 50 nm the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 compressed and even destroyed the negatively charged ps cooh surface layer decreased the energy barrier and efficiently removed 96 6 of 50 mg l ps cooh the dominant removal mechanisms included electrostatic adsorption and intermolecular interactions increasing the ph from 3 5 to 8 5 sharply enhanced the ps cooh removal whereas significant loss was observed at ph 10 0 high temperature 23 c favored the removal of ps cooh compared to lower temperature 4 c high ps cooh removal efficiency was observed over the salinity range of 0 35 the presence of positively charged al2o3 did not affect the ps cooh removal while negatively charged sio2 reduced the ps cooh removal from 96 6 to 93 2 moreover the coagulation and sedimentation process efficiently removed 90 2 of 50 mg l ps cooh in real surface water even though it was rich in inorganic ions and total organic carbon the fast and efficient capture of ps cooh by alcl3 via a simple coagulation and sedimentation process provides a new insight for the treatment of nps from aqueous environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics coagulation sedimentation aluminum chloride removal 1 introduction plastic products are being widely applied in a variety of industries such as packaging ivleva et al 2017 construction materials hernandez et al 2017 daily personal care products vehicles clothing and electronics song et al 2017 due to their excellent physicochemical properties of ease of production durability light weight and low cost saliu et al 2018 the major routes of plastics to the environment concern wastewaters and urban runoffs besseling et al 2017 carr et al 2016 after entering into water bodies some larger size plastics fragmentize into smaller nanoplastics nps with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm through weathering biodegradation andrady 2011 photodegradation thermal degradation da costa et al 2016 and the movement of water flow auta et al 2017 while the concentrations of nps in natural water bodies are estimated to be lower than 1 mg l lenz et al 2016 nps have become a growing environmental concern since they can be easily swallowed and ingested by organisms and accumulated along the food chain chae and an 2017 yang et al 2015 moreover due to their hydrophobicity and large surface to volume ratio nps often show high adsorption capacities for an array of toxic chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants e g polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and heavy metals e g zn pb and cu do sul and costa 2014 and thus play important roles in the fate and transport of the pollutants in the environment the adsorbed pollutants on nps can then desorb and affect the metabolic and physiological processes as well as human and ecological health thus efficient and feasible approaches for removal of nps from natural water bodies are urgently needed several advanced treatment technologies have been proposed and employed for removing microplastics mps including membrane bio reactor rapid sand filtration and dissolved air flotation talvitie et al 2017 however these technologies bear with some serious drawbacks such as inefficiency due to the degradation resistance of plastics the large occupation of space and potential point pollution source of microplastics and nps carr et al 2016 lu et al 2018 more importantly these methods were designed for the removal of mps and were less effective for the removal of nps due to the smaller particle size da costa et al 2016 coagulation has attracted particular attention due to its low cost and high removal performance you et al 2019 various inorganic coagulants such as polyaluminum chloride aluminum based salts and iron based salts he et al 2019 have been extensively applied in the process of coagulation the simple introduction of these inorganic coagulants can compress the electric double layer and settle unstable particles in water by forming larger flocs ma et al 2019 for example skaf et al 2020 found that coagulation using alum at 5 and 10 mg l reduced the turbidity of 5 mg l microspheres 1 5 µm diameter from initial 16 ntu to less than 1 0 ntu zhou et al 2021 reported that 90 mg l of the polyaluminium chloride pac was able to remove 77 8 and 29 7 of 500 mg l polystyrene and polyethylene with sizes smaller than 5 mm respectively charge neutralization occurred in the coagulation of both ps and pe and agglomeration adsorption was observed in the ps system the hydrolysis products of coagulants played a predominant role rather than the hydrolysis process although nps may share some of the properties of mps their size dependent properties distinguish them from mps with respect to the transport properties and interactions with natural colloids gigault et al 2021 yet to the best of our knowledge few studies have been reported about the remediation of nps contaminated water by coagulation the removal effectiveness and underlying mechanisms are not clear moreover as complex water chemistry conditions such as ph liu et al 2018 temperature qiu et al 2019 salinity wu et al 2019 and inorganic colloids oriekhova and stoll 2018 are known to affect the aggregation of nps the influences and affecting mechanisms of these factors on nps removal by coagulation have not yet been systematically investigated to fill in the abovementioned knowledge gaps the overall goal of this study was to determine the governing removal mechanisms of nps in natural waters by coagulation and sedimentation and explore the effects of environmental chemistry carboxyl modified polystyrene ps cooh is one of the most commonly detected plastics in the environment casado et al 2013 and was applied as representative nps in this study the specific objectives were to 1 compare the removal efficiencies of ps cooh via commonly used coagulants at various dosages 2 examine the effects of ph temperature salinity and inorganic colloids on the removal effectiveness 3 study the removal of ps cooh in real surface waters and 4 explore

there are small amounts of surfactants in the stock solution and the concentration of ps cooh in the stock solution is 50 g l as ps cooh or 49 6 g l as total organic carbon toc the ps cooh nps stock solution was diluted in deionized water to achieve the desired target concentrations aluminum chloride hexahydrate alcl3 6h2o sodium hydroxide naoh and ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o were purchased from macklin biochemical technology shanghai china polyaluminum chloride pacl was obtained from damao chemical reagent technology tianjin china sodium chloride nacl was obtained from jinhuada chemical reagent technology guangzhou china silicon dioxide sio2 with a particle size of 50 nm was purchased from shunping biochemical technology guangzhou china alumina al2o3 with a particle size of 20 nm was purchased from aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china as a proxy for inorganic colloids suspensions of sio2 and al2o3 500 mg l were prepared in ultrapure water and sonicated for 15 min with a cnc ultrasonic cleaner kq 500de kunshan china respectively all samples in this study were prepared using deionized water unless stated otherwise 2 2 characterization of ps cooh nps

characterized using a malvern zetasizer nano zs instrument nano zse malvern instruments worcestershire u k the polydispersivity index pdi value was derived according to the size distributions of ps cooh 1 p d i σ 2 z d 2 where σ is the standard deviation and zd is the average hydrodynamic diameter the surface functional groups of ps cooh nps before and after reaction were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is5 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma u s a the collected flocs were vacuum dried in a freeze drier scientz 10 n ningbo china at 40 c for ftir analysis 2 3 coagulation and precipitation experiments standard jar tests for testing the removal effectiveness of ps cooh nps from water were carried out via coagulation flocculation and sedimentation jar testers meiyu my3000 6b wuhan china consisting of six paddle stirrers jars and 500 ml glass beakers were applied each beaker was loaded with 300 ml of ps cooh nps suspension with an initial concentration of 50 mg l and an initial ph of 6 5 0 1 batch experiments were carried out following previously reported mixing and settling procedures qiu et al 2019 sequential mixing at 70 rpm for 1 min 180 rpm for 30 s 40 rpm for 15 min 30 rpm for 15 min 20 rpm for 15 min and final 15 rpm for 25 min and then settling for 30 min under gravity a small amount of the mixture after 1 min mixing at 70 rpm was taken immediately for time resolved dls measurement to monitor the change of average hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh as a function of time the size of ps cooh was recorded every 20 s and lasted for 10 min with the first record at 20 s after the beginning of the dls measurement at the end of settling 20 ml of the supernatant was sampled submerged at 1 3 depth of the liquid surface for residual turbidity and ps cooh nps concentration analysis the nps removal efficiency was calculated based on the differences between the initial and final concentrations of aqueous ps cooh nps to determine the effects of alternative coagulants and coagulant dosage the jar tests were conducted with various concentrations of alcl3 fecl3 and pacl 2 5 5 10 20 and 40 mg l respectively for all the following experiments the initial concentrations of ps cooh and alcl3 were set at 50 mg l and 10 mg l respectively to explore the effects of ph the initial ph of the mixture of was adjusted to 3 0 4 5 6 5 8 5 and 10 0 with naoh or hcl solutions and the final ph was recorded in respective figure captions to investigate the effects of reaction temperature the temperature was set at 4 and 23 c which represent the average temperature of seawater in winter and room temperature respectively the low temperature was maintained by placing the beaker in cold ice water bath with ice bags to study the effects of salinity known amounts of nacl were dissolved into the suspensions to obtain various salinities ranging from 5 to 35 to simulate real environmental conditions in a representative estuary wu et al 2019 to probe the effects of inorganic colloids 30 mg l of al2o3 and 50 mg l of sio2 were mixed with 50 mg l of ps cooh suspension respectively before reaction all experiments were conducted in duplicate and the average results were reported with errors indicating the standard deviations 2 4 removal of ps cooh in real surface water surface water samples were collected from the top 5 cm of the water column from xinzao town panyu district guangzhou china the latitude longitude of the sampling site was 113 41 23 03 the collected sample was first filtrated through a 0 45 µm membrane filter mixed cellulose esters to remove suspended solids to facilitate the following ps cooh removal experiments the surface water was pre spiked with ps cooh solution to obtain a ps cooh concentration of 50 mg l coagulation and precipitation experiments were then conducted following the same manner as described in section 2 3 control tests were performed in the absence of alcl3 under otherwise identical conditions 2 5 interaction energy calculation by dlvo theory the derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek dlvo theory states that particles are subject to van der waals interaction forces and electrostatic repulsion forces and is widely used to calculate the surface interaction energy of particles as a function of separation distance and to predict the aggregation behavior of particles derjaguin and landau 1993 the interaction force of the ps cooh nps was determined treating the particle particle as a sphere sphere geometry detailed information on the calculations is provided in the supporting information section s1 2 6 analytical methods ph was measured using a pb 10 ph meter sartorius gottingen germany the ps cooh concentration was determined via a total organic carbon analyzer toc lcph shimadzu corporation japan with a ps cooh detection limit of 1 0 mg l turbidity was determined using a turbidity meter tn 100 shanghai china and the detection limit was 0 27 ntu the concentrations of k ca na and mg in aqueous solutions were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms nexion 350x perkinelmer shelton ct u s a and the detection limits were 4 50 6 61 6 36 and 1 94 μg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ps cooh ps cooh nps appeared as clearly defined and discrete spherical nanoparticles and were stable and well dispersed in water fig 1 a after coagulation due to the bridges formed between aluminum salt and ps cooh wu et al 2020 flocs shaped as open structures were observed as presented in fig 1b due to the presence of negatively charged carboxyl functional groups and surfactant the zeta potential of ps cooh nps varied from 27 8 3 5 mv at ph 3 to 49 6 3 6 mv at ph 10 fig 1c ps cooh nps demonstrated a relatively uniform size distribution and the mean hydrodynamic diameter was equal to 50 2 nm as shown in the size distribution histograms fig 1d the polydispersivity index value 0 025 for the suspensions of ps cooh nps was less than 0 2 which indicated that ps cooh nps were stable and well dispersed in water without significant aggregation izquierdo et al 2005 3 2 effects of different coagulant and coagulant dosage on the removal of ps cooh the removal efficiencies of ps cooh and the turbidity removal via three commonly used coagulants namely alcl3 fecl3 and pacl at different dosages ranging from 2 5 to 40 mg l were compared in figs 2 a and b the coagulants effectively reduced the ps cooh in the aqueous phase generally increasing the coagulant dosage 0 10 mg l for alcl3 and fecl3 0 5 mg l for pacl enhanced the ps cooh removal for instance increasing the fecl3 dosage from 2 5 to 5 and further to 10 mg l enhanced the ps cooh removal efficiency from 8 7 to 89 6 and further to 95 8 as shown in fig 2c after coagulation with 2 5 10 mg l fecl3 or alcl3 the ph values in the systems were in the range of 4 0 5 0 where fe mainly presented as positively charged fe oh 2 arenas et al 2020 and al as positive hydrolyzates such as al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 zhang et al 2008 the enhancement in the ps cooh removal was due to the charge neutralization fig 2d and compression of electrostatic double layer li et al 2019 yet no advantage was observed at a higher dosage for instance further increasing the fecl3 dosage from 10 to 40 mg l led to a statistically significant decline in the ps cooh removal efficiency 4 5 p value 0 002 similarly increasing the pacl dosage from 5 to 40 mg l led to a statistically significant decline in the ps cooh removal efficiency 2 8 p value 0 016 increasing the fecl3 dosage from 10 to 40 mg l significantly decreased the system ph from 4 1 to 3 1 where fe mainly presented as fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 arenas et al 2020 the decline in ps cooh was due to the charge reversal effect fig 2d leading to the restabilization of the particles meanwhile further increasing the alcl3 dosage from 10 to 40 mg l resulted in statistically insignificant changes in the removal efficiency p value 0 71 it can be seen that the zeta potential of ps cooh remained constant at 2 9 mv at alcl3 dosage ranging from 10 to 40 mg l fig 2d correspondingly the residual turbidity was also compared in fig 2b in general the results concurred with the classical coagulation curve the initial turbidity of 50 mg l of ps cooh nps was determined to be 4 83 ntu exceeding the quality standard of 1 ntu in drinking water gb 5749 2006 china when the concentration of alcl3 fecl3 and pacl increased from 0 to 5 5 and 2 5 mg l the turbidity increased to 18 60 8 04 and 18 00 ntu respectively further increasing the coagulant dosage to 20 0 10 0 and 5 mg l decreased the turbidity to 0 99 1 09 and 0 68 ntu respectively yet the turbidity was raised up to 11 60 9 06 and 16 70 ntu respectively with a coagulant dosage of 40 mg l the increase of the residual turbidity was probably due to 1 the formation of new disturbing particles e g hydroxides which are not settled rajala et al 2020 and 2 the formed loose and easily broken flocs with excessive coagulant wu et al 2007 considering the ps cooh removal efficiency the residual turbidity and the availability of coagulants 10 mg l of alcl3 was selected in the following experiments 3 3 interactions between ps cooh and alcl3 the introduction of inorganic ions can alter the surface charge of nanoparticles controlling their aggregation behavior wong et al 2012 our results showed that the zeta potentials of ps cooh were negative with the addition of 0 40 mg l alcl3 the zeta potential became less negative as alcl3 concentration increased fig 2d the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged ps cooh and positively charged aluminum ions led to charge neutralization and obvious aggregation of ps cooh was observed fig s1 the change of hydrodynamic size over time for ps cooh after mixing with alcl3 at different concentrations was shown in fig 3 a the ps cooh dispersed well in water with a hydrodynamic size of 50 nm similarly the hydrodynamic size remained constant at about 50 nm at a alcl3 concentration of 2 5 mg l with an increase of alcl3 concentration to 5 10 20 and 40 mg l the hydrodynamic size increased readily to 248 1315 2462 and 4544 nm respectively after 10 min and an obvious aggregation of ps cooh was observed fig s1 to obtain a better understanding of the stability of ps cooh at different alcl3 concentrations the attachment efficiency α and aggregation rate nm s of ps cooh nps were determined when the alcl3 concentration increased from 2 5 to 40 mg l the positively charged aluminum ions can compress and even destroy the stable negatively charged ps cooh surface layer or electron double layer vangara et al 2017 and the stabilizing coulomb forces between two particles decreased petosa et al 2010 resulting in higher attachment efficiency as shown in fig 3b the α value increased from 0 001 to 0 319 as alcl3 concentration increased from 2 5 to 20 mg l this stage is known as reaction limited aggregation regime α 1 lin et al 2016 in this regime the increase in alcl3 elevated the degree of charge screening and led to an increase in aggregation kinetics as reflected by the rise in the α value when the concentration of alcl3 increased to 40 mg l the α value reached 1 and this stage is defined as diffusion limited aggregation regime lin et al 2016 where the aggregation kinetics approached the theoretical maximum in this regime the aggregation kinetics was independent on the alcl3 concentration the distinct regimes indicated that electrostatic interactions occurred between ps cooh and alcl3 wang et al 2020 correspondingly the aggregation rate of ps cooh was enhanced from 0 005 nm s to 4 163 nm s with the increase of alcl3 concentration from 2 5 to 40 mg l table s1 the colloidal stability of ps cooh in the absence and presence of alcl3 in aqueous phase is supported by the dlvo analysis as shown in fig s2 in the absence of alcl3 the energy barrier between ps cooh was substantially high 29 kt fig s2a which resulted in the well dispersion of ps cooh in the solution the energy barrier decreased to 2 5 4 8 kt and finally dropped below 0 kt with the addition of 2 5 to 40 mg l alcl3 fig s2b the interaction between ps cooh and aluminum ions changed the surface chemistry of ps cooh and inhibited the negative zeta potential of ps cooh thus the addition of alcl3 promoted the homoaggregation of ps cooh it is noteworthy that the dlvo interaction energy calculation predicts a repulsive force among ps cooh in 5 and 10 mg l of alcl3 fig s2b however obvious aggregation of ps cooh was observed in both conditions fig s1 the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the introduced aluminum ions adsorbed onto the surface of ps cooh rendering the ps cooh surface electrostatically heterogeneous sennato et al 2009 yet the dlvo interaction energy prediction only uses the mean value of surface charge which neglects the effects of the heterogeneity on the interacting surfaces cai et al 2018 to further investigate the possible interaction between alcl3 and ps cooh during the coagulation process the stretching frequencies of alcl3 6h2o and ps cooh before and after coagulation were measured figs 4 and s3 for alcl3 6h2o fig 4a four major peaks were evident including bound and isolated hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water molecules group at 3356 cm 1 costa et al 1999 the bending of water molecules at 1630 cm 1 costa et al 1999 and the al o group at 595 cm 1 and 855 cm 1 beran et al 2001 for ps cooh flocs after interaction with alcl3 fig 4b the characteristic band at 3400 cm 1 was ascribed to the h o h vibrations of adsorbed water li et al 2004 the absorption peaks observed at 3091 cm 1 and 3023 cm 1 were ascribed to the c h stretching vibrations in benzene rings yuan et al 2019 the peaks appearing at 2926 cm 1 and 2849 cm 1 corresponded to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of c h the absorption peak at 1705 cm 1 represented the existence of cooh groups hu et al 2019 the absorption bands located at 1490 cm 1 and 1453 cm 1 was assigned to the vibration of monosubstituted benzenes han et al 2017 the absorption peaks at 757 cm 1 and 701 cm 1 were related to the bending vibrations of hydrogen atoms on monosubstituted benzene rings ding et al 2015 these characteristic peaks representing ps cooh were consistent with previously reported studies fig s3 chen et al 2016 han et al 2020 after reaction with alcl3 a new peak at 1600 cm 1 representing the coo al group lee et al 2000 was observed which might be due to the formation of bridges between the surface functional groups of ps cooh and aluminum wu et al 2020 furthermore the peak at 550 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 corresponded to al oh djebaili et al 2015 perkins and palmer 2000 the ph of the system after reaction with different concentrations of alcl3 was shown in fig s3 as expected increasing the alcl3 concentration progressively decreased the ph values due to the oh consumption by the alcl3 hydrolysis these results suggest that the dominant reaction mechanisms between ps cooh nps and alcl3 include electrostatic adsorption and intermolecular forces 3 4 effects of ph on ps cooh removal effects of ph on ps cooh removal by alcl3 was investigated over the initial ph range of 3 0 10 0 the ps cooh removal efficiency increased sharply from 12 0 at ph 3 0 to 96 4 at ph 8 5 and then decreased to 83 7 when ph reached 10 0 fig 5 a solution ph can affect both the surface potential of ps cooh and speciation of aluminum the surface of ps cooh maintained negatively charged 27 8 49 6 mv fig 5b and the hydrodynamic diameter remained constant at 50 nm fig 5c over the ph range at ph 3 0 al mainly presented as hydrated monomer aluminum al h2o 6 3 hu et al 2006 when ph increased to 4 5 the main species are positive hydrolyzates such as al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 zhang et al 2008 when the ph reached 8 5 highly polymeric positive hydrolyzates such as alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 al13 which was reported to be the most effective coagulation species in aluminum based coagulants due to its strong charge neutralization capability and high structure stability bottero et al 1982 gregory and dupont 2001 was formed these positive hydrolyzates possessed strong ability of neutralizing the negative charges of ps cooh and formed flocs with ps cooh through adsorption and bridging resulted in the destabilization of nanoplastics therefore as the ph increased from 3 0 to 8 5 the zeta potential of ps cooh in the presence of alcl3 changed from 11 7 mv to 3 0 mv fig 5b and the hydrodynamic diameters increased sharply from 55 to 4755 nm after 10 min fig 5c leading to an improved ps cooh aggregation rate from 0 at ph 3 0 to 2 63 nm s at ph 8 5 table s1 and an enhanced ps cooh removal efficiency when ph reached 10 0 the dominate hydrolyzate was transformed to negatively charged al oh 4 yang et al 2010 the zeta potential was reduced to 16 3 mv and the corresponding hydrodynamic diameter remained at 67 nm resulting in an aggregation rate of 0 and a declined ps cooh removal efficiency of 83 7 increasing the ph from 8 5 to 10 0 enhanced the repulsive energy barrier between ps cooh from 0 to 5 0 kt as shown in fig s4 3 5 effects of temperature on ps cooh removal effects of temperature on ps cooh removal efficiency by alcl3 was investigated at ph 6 5 fig 6 a shows that increasing the temperature from 4 to 23 c significantly enhanced the ps cooh removal efficiency from 92 1 to 96 6 p value of 0 001 at the 0 05 level of significance it is reported that the nps were more stable at the lower temperature compared to those at the higher temperature singh et al 2019 the hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh without the addition of alcl3 at 4 and 23 c remained constant at 50 nm and the aggregation rates were both 0 table s1 high temperature increases the solubility of alcl3 decreases the viscosity of water enhances the brownian motion and the molecular collision rate and increases the reaction rate constant which is conducive to the formation of larger flocs of ps cooh qiu et al 2019 as shown in fig 6b with the addition of alcl3 when the temperature was increased from 4 c to 23 c the hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh was increased from 800 nm to 1400 nm after 10 min and the aggregation rate of ps cooh was enhanced from 0 888 to 1 138 nm s table s1 3 6 effects of salinity on ps cooh removal the aggregation kinetics and removal efficiency of ps cooh with or without the addition of alcl3 were studied over a range of salinities from 0 to 35 in the absence of alcl3 the zeta potential of ps cooh changed from 43 6 mv to 36 5 and 34 2 mv respectively as the salinity increased from 0 to 5 and 10 and then more sharply to 25 8 mv as the salinity reached 35 fig 7 a accordingly the hydrodynamic size of ps cooh with salinities of 5 and 10 remained constant at 50 nm fig 7b with an aggregation rate of 0 table s1 yet when the salinity increased to 20 and 35 the hydrodynamic size of ps cooh sharply increased to 87 nm and 654 nm after 10 min fig 7b and the aggregation rate increased to 0 041 and 0 948 nm s table s1 respectively accordingly to the dlvo analysis fig s5a the energy barrier between ps cooh was decreased from 29 kt for zero salinity to 15 3 11 3 9 0 kt when the salinity was increased to 5 10 and 20 respectively the energy barrier dropped below 0 kt when the salinity increased to 35 the surface potential of ps cooh became less negative as the salinity increased due to the charge neutralization and the compression of electrostatic double layer li et al 2020 resulting in weaker electrostatic repulsive forces and faster homoaggregation rates as a result the ps cooh removal efficiency increased from 0 to 3 2 as the salinity increased from 0 to 20 and then sharply increased to 84 3 as the salinity increased to 35 fig 7c this observation is consistent with previously reported studies cai et al 2018 found that the polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps dispersed well in milli q water with hydrodynamic diameters of 100 nm at nacl concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mmol l whereas a slight aggregation was observed with 100 mmol l nacl li et al 2019 investigated the effects of nacl on the settling ratios of ps nps and they found that increasing the nacl concentration enhanced the settling ratios of ps nps due to the formation of ps nps homoaggregates with the addition of alcl3 the zeta potential of ps cooh changed slowly from 5 3 mv to 8 7 9 8 8 6 and 9 9 mv respectively as the salinity increased from 0 to 5 10 20 and 35 fig 7d correspondingly the hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh changed readily from 1426 nm to 1306 1394 1475 and 1577 nm respectively after 10 min fig 7e and the aggregation rates were enhanced from 0 723 to 0 897 0 803 0 988 and 1 158 nm s respectively table s1 as described in the dlvo analysis fig s5b the energy barrier between ps cooh after reaction with alcl3 with a salinity of 0 was 4 7 kt increasing the salinity to 5 35 decreased the energy barrier to below 0 kt the increase in salinity resulted in weaker electrostatic repulsive forces decreased stability and faster aggregation rates drechsler and grundke 2005 the ps cooh removal efficiencies with the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 at different salinities remained as high as 96 p value of 0 82 at the 0 05 level of significance 3 7 effects of inorganic colloids on ps cooh removal nanoscale al2o3 with a particle size of 20 nm and sio2 with a particle size of 50 nm was applied as inorganic colloids in this study al2o3 was positively charged and sio2 was negatively charged in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 fig s6 in the absence of alcl3 the addition of al2o3 led to a sharp increase of zeta potential from 43 6 mv to 5 4 mv due to the charge neutralization fig 8 a correspondingly the hydrodynamic diameter of ps cooh was increased to about 250 nm after 10 min fig 8b and the aggregation rate was enhanced to 0 323 nm s table s1 the increase of hydrodynamic size was caused by the heteroaggregation between positive charged al2o3 and negative charged ps cooh oriekhova and stoll 2018 the addition of sio2 slightly changed the zeta potential of ps cooh from 43 6 mv to 46 1 mv fig 8a and the hydrodynamic diameter of ps cooh remained constant at 50 nm fig 8b without aggregation table s1 as a result the removal efficiency of ps cooh was increased to 43 3 in the presence of al2o3 and remained at 0 in the presence of sio2 fig 8c with the addition of alcl3 the zeta potential of ps cooh changed from 3 0 mv to 10 3 mv in the presence of sio2 while the zeta potential remained constant at 3 61 mv in the presence of al2o3 p value of 0 97 at the 0 05 level of significance fig 8d correspondingly the hydrodynamic diameter of ps cooh increased to about 1037 and 1653 nm fig 8e and the aggregation rates were 1 114 and 1 308 nm s respectively table s1 the removal efficiencies of ps cooh after addition of 10 mg l alcl3 in the presence and absence of al2o3 and sio2 were shown in fig 8f in the absence of inorganic colloids the ps cooh nps removal efficiency was 96 6 the presence of 50 mg l of sio2 decreased the removal efficiency to 93 2 probably due to the fact that the negatively charged sio2 can compete with ps cooh for reacting with alcl3 meanwhile with the addition of alcl3 the ps cooh removal efficiency did not show significant difference in the absence and presence of negatively charged al2o3 p value of 1 03 at the 0 05 level of significance 3 8 ps cooh removal in real surface water the ps cooh spiked surface water ps cooh 50 mg l contained 15 0 mg l cl 6 3 mg l no3 30 9 mg l so4 2 7 8 mg l k 23 3 mg l ca2 16 7 mg l na 3 4 mg l mg2 and 8 0 mg l toc ph value was measured to be 6 8 and the zeta potential was determined to be 14 9 mv with the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 90 2 of the ps cooh was removed while the removal efficiency of the ps cooh in deionized water was 96 6 p value of 0 016 at the 0 05 level of significance the decrease in ps cooh removal efficiency was probably due to the presence of toc in the surface water toc links to the ps cooh via adsorption or hydrophobic interaction hotze et al 2010 increasing the steric and electrostatic repulsion between the ps cooh and thus providing the stabilizing effect in addition toc may compete with ps cooh for al resulting in reduced ps cooh removal efficiency after reaction with 10 mg l alcl3 toc in aqueous phase was reduced from 8 0 mg l to 3 2 mg l 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the removal of nanoplastics from water via coagulation and sedimentation using alcl3 as a coagulant ps cooh nps appeared as clearly defined and discrete spherical nanoparticles and were well dispersed in water 10 mg l alcl3 effectively removed 96 6 of 50 mg l of ps cooh after reaction the added positively charged aluminum ions can compress and even destroy the stable negatively charged ps cooh surface layer or electron double layer decreased the stabilizing coulomb forces between the particles and the energy barrier and led to higher attachment efficiency and enhanced aggregation rate of ps cooh the dominant removal mechanisms include electrostatic adsorption and intermolecular interactions the ps cooh removal efficiency increased sharply from 12 0 at ph 3 0 to 96 4 at ph 8 5 and then decreased to 83 7 when ph reached 10 0 increasing the temperature from 4 to 23 c significantly enhanced the ps cooh removal efficiency from 92 1 to 96 6 salinity affects the colloidal stability of the ps cooh in the absence of alcl3 the ps cooh removal efficiency increased from 0 to 3 2 as the salinity increased from 0 to 20 and then sharply increased to 84 3 as the salinity increased to 35 with the addition of alcl3 the ps cooh removal efficiency remained constant at 96 with the increase of salinity the addition of negatively charged sio2 did not affect the stability of ps cooh whereas the addition of positively charged al2o3 enhanced the formation of heteroaggregates and sharply increased the ps cooh removal efficiency from 0 to 43 3 after the addition of alcl3 the ps cooh nps removal efficiency was 96 6 in the absence and presence of al2o3 yet the presence of sio2 decreased the removal efficiency to 93 2 the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 efficiently removed 90 2 of 50 mg l ps cooh from real surface water rich in inorganic ions and toc this study demonstrated the promise of coagulation and sedimentation using alcl3 for fast and efficient removal of nps from natural water bodies this approach provides an innovative and practical alternative to remove nps from contaminated aquatic systems declaration of

16465,nanoplastics nps pollution of aquatic systems is becoming an emerging environmental issue due to their stable structure high mobility and easy interactions with ambient contaminants effective removal technologies are urgently needed to mitigate their toxic effects in this study we systematically investigated the removal effectiveness and mechanisms of a commonly detected nanoplastics carboxyl modified polystyrene ps cooh via coagulation and sedimentation processes using aluminum chloride alcl3 as a coagulant ps cooh appeared as clearly defined and discrete spherical nanoparticles in water with a hydrodynamic diameter of 50 nm the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 compressed and even destroyed the negatively charged ps cooh surface layer decreased the energy barrier and efficiently removed 96 6 of 50 mg l ps cooh the dominant removal mechanisms included electrostatic adsorption and intermolecular interactions increasing the ph from 3 5 to 8 5 sharply enhanced the ps cooh removal whereas significant loss was observed at ph 10 0 high temperature 23 c favored the removal of ps cooh compared to lower temperature 4 c high ps cooh removal efficiency was observed over the salinity range of 0 35 the presence of positively charged al2o3 did not affect the ps cooh removal while negatively charged sio2 reduced the ps cooh removal from 96 6 to 93 2 moreover the coagulation and sedimentation process efficiently removed 90 2 of 50 mg l ps cooh in real surface water even though it was rich in inorganic ions and total organic carbon the fast and efficient capture of ps cooh by alcl3 via a simple coagulation and sedimentation process provides a new insight for the treatment of nps from aqueous environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics coagulation sedimentation aluminum chloride removal 1 introduction plastic products are being widely applied in a variety of industries such as packaging ivleva et al 2017 construction materials hernandez et al 2017 daily personal care products vehicles clothing and electronics song et al 2017 due to their excellent physicochemical properties of ease of production durability light weight and low cost saliu et al 2018 the major routes of plastics to the environment concern wastewaters and urban runoffs besseling et al 2017 carr et al 2016 after entering into water bodies some larger size plastics fragmentize into smaller nanoplastics nps with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm through weathering biodegradation andrady 2011 photodegradation thermal degradation da costa et al 2016 and the movement of water flow auta et al 2017 while the concentrations of nps in natural water bodies are estimated to be lower than 1 mg l lenz et al 2016 nps have become a growing environmental concern since they can be easily swallowed and ingested by organisms and accumulated along the food chain chae and an 2017 yang et al 2015 moreover due to their hydrophobicity and large surface to volume ratio nps often show high adsorption capacities for an array of toxic chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants e g polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and heavy metals e g zn pb and cu do sul and costa 2014 and thus play important roles in the fate and transport of the pollutants in the environment the adsorbed pollutants on nps can then desorb and affect the metabolic and physiological processes as well as human and ecological health thus efficient and feasible approaches for removal of nps from natural water bodies are urgently needed several advanced treatment technologies have been proposed and employed for removing microplastics mps including membrane bio reactor rapid sand filtration and dissolved air flotation talvitie et al 2017 however these technologies bear with some serious drawbacks such as inefficiency due to the degradation resistance of plastics the large occupation of space and potential point pollution source of microplastics and nps carr et al 2016 lu et al 2018 more importantly these methods were designed for the removal of mps and were less effective for the removal of nps due to the smaller particle size da costa et al 2016 coagulation has attracted particular attention due to its low cost and high removal performance you et al 2019 various inorganic coagulants such as polyaluminum chloride aluminum based salts and iron based salts he et al 2019 have been extensively applied in the process of coagulation the simple introduction of these inorganic coagulants can compress the electric double layer and settle unstable particles in water by forming larger flocs ma et al 2019 for example skaf et al 2020 found that coagulation using alum at 5 and 10 mg l reduced the turbidity of 5 mg l microspheres 1 5 µm diameter from initial 16 ntu to less than 1 0 ntu zhou et al 2021 reported that 90 mg l of the polyaluminium chloride pac was able to remove 77 8 and 29 7 of 500 mg l polystyrene and polyethylene with sizes smaller than 5 mm respectively charge neutralization occurred in the coagulation of both ps and pe and agglomeration adsorption was observed in the ps system the hydrolysis products of coagulants played a predominant role rather than the hydrolysis process although nps may share some of the properties of mps their size dependent properties distinguish them from mps with respect to the transport properties and interactions with natural colloids gigault et al 2021 yet to the best of our knowledge few studies have been reported about the remediation of nps contaminated water by coagulation the removal effectiveness and underlying mechanisms are not clear moreover as complex water chemistry conditions such as ph liu et al 2018 temperature qiu et al 2019 salinity wu et al 2019 and inorganic colloids oriekhova and stoll 2018 are known to affect the aggregation of nps the influences and affecting mechanisms of these factors on nps removal by coagulation have not yet been systematically investigated to fill in the abovementioned knowledge gaps the overall goal of this study was to determine the governing removal mechanisms of nps in natural waters by coagulation and sedimentation and explore the effects of environmental chemistry carboxyl modified polystyrene ps cooh is one of the most commonly detected plastics in the environment casado et al 2013 and was applied as representative nps in this study the specific objectives were to 1 compare the removal efficiencies of ps cooh via commonly used coagulants at various dosages 2 examine the effects of ph temperature salinity and inorganic colloids on the removal effectiveness 3 study the removal of ps cooh in real surface waters and 4 explore the underlying mechanisms affecting nps aggregation via theoretical calculation and physical characterizations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were in analytical

there are small amounts of surfactants in the stock solution and the concentration of ps cooh in the stock solution is 50 g l as ps cooh or 49 6 g l as total organic carbon toc the ps cooh nps stock solution was diluted in deionized water to achieve the desired target concentrations aluminum chloride hexahydrate alcl3 6h2o sodium hydroxide naoh and ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o were purchased from macklin biochemical technology shanghai china polyaluminum chloride pacl was obtained from damao chemical reagent technology tianjin china sodium chloride nacl was obtained from jinhuada chemical reagent technology guangzhou china silicon dioxide sio2 with a particle size of 50 nm was purchased from shunping biochemical technology guangzhou china alumina al2o3 with a particle size of 20 nm was purchased from aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china as a proxy for inorganic colloids suspensions of sio2 and al2o3 500 mg l were prepared in ultrapure water and sonicated for 15 min with a cnc ultrasonic cleaner kq 500de kunshan china respectively all samples in this study were prepared using deionized water unless stated otherwise 2 2 characterization of ps cooh nps

characterized using a malvern zetasizer nano zs instrument nano zse malvern instruments worcestershire u k the polydispersivity index pdi value was derived according to the size distributions of ps cooh 1 p d i σ 2 z d 2 where σ is the standard deviation and zd is the average hydrodynamic diameter the surface functional groups of ps cooh nps before and after reaction were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is5 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma u s a the collected flocs were vacuum dried in a freeze drier scientz 10 n ningbo china at 40 c for ftir analysis 2 3 coagulation and precipitation experiments standard jar tests for testing the removal effectiveness of ps cooh nps from water were carried out via coagulation flocculation and sedimentation jar testers meiyu my3000 6b wuhan china consisting of six paddle stirrers jars and 500 ml glass beakers were applied each beaker was loaded with 300 ml of ps cooh nps suspension with an initial concentration of 50 mg l and an initial ph of 6 5 0 1 batch experiments were carried out following previously reported mixing and settling procedures qiu et al 2019 sequential mixing at 70 rpm for 1 min 180 rpm for 30 s 40 rpm for 15 min 30 rpm for 15 min 20 rpm for 15 min and final 15 rpm for 25 min and then settling for 30 min under gravity a small amount of the mixture after 1 min mixing at 70 rpm was taken immediately for time resolved dls measurement to monitor the change of average hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh as a function of time the size of ps cooh was recorded every 20 s and lasted for 10 min with the first record at 20 s after the beginning of the dls measurement at the end of settling 20 ml of the supernatant was sampled submerged at 1 3 depth of the liquid surface for residual turbidity and ps cooh nps concentration analysis the nps removal efficiency was calculated based on the differences between the initial and final concentrations of aqueous ps cooh nps to determine the effects of alternative coagulants and coagulant dosage the jar tests were conducted with various concentrations of alcl3 fecl3 and pacl 2 5 5 10 20 and 40 mg l respectively for all the following experiments the initial concentrations of ps cooh and alcl3 were set at 50 mg l and 10 mg l respectively to explore the effects of ph the initial ph of the mixture of was adjusted to 3 0 4 5 6 5 8 5 and 10 0 with naoh or hcl solutions and the final ph was recorded in respective figure captions to investigate the effects of reaction temperature the temperature was set at 4 and 23 c which represent the average temperature of seawater in winter and room temperature respectively the low temperature was maintained by placing the beaker in cold ice water bath with ice bags to study the effects of salinity known amounts of nacl were dissolved into the suspensions to obtain various salinities ranging from 5 to 35 to simulate real environmental conditions in a representative estuary wu et al 2019 to probe the effects of inorganic colloids 30 mg l of al2o3 and 50 mg l of sio2 were mixed with 50 mg l of ps cooh suspension respectively before reaction all experiments were conducted in duplicate and the average results were reported with errors indicating the standard deviations 2 4 removal of ps cooh in real surface water surface water samples were collected from the top 5 cm of the water column from xinzao town panyu district guangzhou china the latitude longitude of the sampling site was 113 41 23 03 the collected sample was first filtrated through a 0 45 µm membrane filter mixed cellulose esters to remove suspended solids to facilitate the following ps cooh removal experiments the surface water was pre spiked with ps cooh solution to obtain a ps cooh concentration of 50 mg l coagulation and precipitation experiments were then conducted following the same manner as described in section 2 3 control tests were performed in the absence of alcl3 under otherwise identical conditions 2 5 interaction energy calculation by dlvo theory the derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek dlvo theory states that particles are subject to van der waals interaction forces and electrostatic repulsion forces and is widely used to calculate the surface interaction energy of particles as a function of separation distance and to predict the aggregation behavior of particles derjaguin and landau 1993 the interaction force of the ps cooh nps was determined treating the particle particle as a sphere sphere geometry detailed information on the calculations is provided in the supporting information section s1 2 6 analytical methods ph was measured using a pb 10 ph meter sartorius gottingen germany the ps cooh concentration was determined via a total organic carbon analyzer toc lcph shimadzu corporation japan with a ps cooh detection limit of 1 0 mg l turbidity was determined using a turbidity meter tn 100 shanghai china and the detection limit was 0 27 ntu the concentrations of k ca na and mg in aqueous solutions were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms nexion 350x perkinelmer shelton ct u s a and the detection limits were 4 50 6 61 6 36 and 1 94 μg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ps cooh ps cooh nps appeared as clearly defined and discrete spherical nanoparticles and were stable and well dispersed in water fig 1 a after coagulation due to the bridges formed between aluminum salt and ps cooh wu et al 2020 flocs shaped as open structures were observed as presented in fig 1b due to the presence of negatively charged carboxyl functional groups and surfactant the zeta potential of ps cooh nps varied from 27 8 3 5 mv at ph 3 to 49 6 3 6 mv at ph 10 fig 1c ps cooh nps demonstrated a relatively uniform size distribution and the mean hydrodynamic diameter was equal to 50 2 nm as shown in the size distribution histograms fig 1d the polydispersivity index value 0 025 for the suspensions of ps cooh nps was less than 0 2 which indicated that ps cooh nps were stable and well dispersed in water without significant aggregation izquierdo et al 2005 3 2 effects of different coagulant and coagulant dosage on the removal of ps cooh the removal efficiencies of ps cooh and the turbidity removal via three commonly used coagulants namely alcl3 fecl3 and pacl at different dosages ranging from 2 5 to 40 mg l were compared in figs 2 a and b the coagulants effectively reduced the ps cooh in the aqueous phase generally increasing the coagulant dosage 0 10 mg l for alcl3 and fecl3 0 5 mg l for pacl enhanced the ps cooh removal for instance increasing the fecl3 dosage from 2 5 to 5 and further to 10 mg l enhanced the ps cooh removal efficiency from 8 7 to 89 6 and further to 95 8 as shown in fig 2c after coagulation with 2 5 10 mg l fecl3 or alcl3 the ph values in the systems were in the range of 4 0 5 0 where fe mainly presented as positively charged fe oh 2 arenas et al 2020 and al as positive hydrolyzates such as al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 zhang et al 2008 the enhancement in the ps cooh removal was due to the charge neutralization fig 2d and compression of electrostatic double layer li et al 2019 yet no advantage was observed at a higher dosage for instance further increasing the fecl3 dosage from 10 to 40 mg l led to a statistically significant decline in the ps cooh removal efficiency 4 5 p value 0 002 similarly increasing the pacl dosage from 5 to 40 mg l led to a statistically significant decline in the ps cooh removal efficiency 2 8 p value 0 016 increasing the fecl3 dosage from 10 to 40 mg l significantly decreased the system ph from 4 1 to 3 1 where fe mainly presented as fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 arenas et al 2020 the decline in ps cooh was due to the charge reversal effect fig 2d leading to the restabilization of the particles meanwhile further increasing the alcl3 dosage from 10 to 40 mg l resulted in statistically insignificant changes in the removal efficiency p value 0 71 it can be seen that the zeta potential of ps cooh remained constant at 2 9 mv at alcl3 dosage ranging from 10 to 40 mg l fig 2d correspondingly the residual turbidity was also compared in fig 2b in general the results concurred with the classical coagulation curve the initial turbidity of 50 mg l of ps cooh nps was determined to be 4 83 ntu exceeding the quality standard of 1 ntu in drinking water gb 5749 2006 china when the concentration of alcl3 fecl3 and pacl increased from 0 to 5 5 and 2 5 mg l the turbidity increased to 18 60 8 04 and 18 00 ntu respectively further increasing the coagulant dosage to 20 0 10 0 and 5 mg l decreased the turbidity to 0 99 1 09 and 0 68 ntu respectively yet the turbidity was raised up to 11 60 9 06 and 16 70 ntu respectively with a coagulant dosage of 40 mg l the increase of the residual turbidity was probably due to 1 the formation of new disturbing particles e g hydroxides which are not settled rajala et al 2020 and 2 the formed loose and easily broken flocs with excessive coagulant wu et al 2007 considering the ps cooh removal efficiency the residual turbidity and the availability of coagulants 10 mg l of alcl3 was selected in the following experiments 3 3 interactions between ps cooh and alcl3 the introduction of inorganic ions can alter the surface charge of nanoparticles controlling their aggregation behavior wong et al 2012 our results showed that the zeta potentials of ps cooh were negative with the addition of 0 40 mg l alcl3 the zeta potential became less negative as alcl3 concentration increased fig 2d the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged ps cooh and positively charged aluminum ions led to charge neutralization and obvious aggregation of ps cooh was observed fig s1 the change of hydrodynamic size over time for ps cooh after mixing with alcl3 at different concentrations was shown in fig 3 a the ps cooh dispersed well in water with a hydrodynamic size of 50 nm similarly the hydrodynamic size remained constant at about 50 nm at a alcl3 concentration of 2 5 mg l with an increase of alcl3 concentration to 5 10 20 and 40 mg l the hydrodynamic size increased readily to 248 1315 2462 and 4544 nm respectively after 10 min and an obvious aggregation of ps cooh was observed fig s1 to obtain a better understanding of the stability of ps cooh at different alcl3 concentrations the attachment efficiency α and aggregation rate nm s of ps cooh nps were determined when the alcl3 concentration increased from 2 5 to 40 mg l the positively charged aluminum ions can compress and even destroy the stable negatively charged ps cooh surface layer or electron double layer vangara et al 2017 and the stabilizing coulomb forces between two particles decreased petosa et al 2010 resulting in higher attachment efficiency as shown in fig 3b the α value increased from 0 001 to 0 319 as alcl3 concentration increased from 2 5 to 20 mg l this stage is known as reaction limited aggregation regime α 1 lin et al 2016 in this regime the increase in alcl3 elevated the degree of charge screening and led to an increase in aggregation kinetics as reflected by the rise in the α value when the concentration of alcl3 increased to 40 mg l the α value reached 1 and this stage is defined as diffusion limited aggregation regime lin et al 2016 where the aggregation kinetics approached the theoretical maximum in this regime the aggregation kinetics was independent on the alcl3 concentration the distinct regimes indicated that electrostatic interactions occurred between ps cooh and alcl3 wang et al 2020 correspondingly the aggregation rate of ps cooh was enhanced from 0 005 nm s to 4 163 nm s with the increase of alcl3 concentration from 2 5 to 40 mg l table s1 the colloidal stability of ps cooh in the absence and presence of alcl3 in aqueous phase is supported by the dlvo analysis as shown in fig s2 in the absence of alcl3 the energy barrier between ps cooh was substantially high 29 kt fig s2a which resulted in the well dispersion of ps cooh in the solution the energy barrier decreased to 2 5 4 8 kt and finally dropped below 0 kt with the addition of 2 5 to 40 mg l alcl3 fig s2b the interaction between ps cooh and aluminum ions changed the surface chemistry of ps cooh and inhibited the negative zeta potential of ps cooh thus the addition of alcl3 promoted the homoaggregation of ps cooh it is noteworthy that the dlvo interaction energy calculation predicts a repulsive force among ps cooh in 5 and 10 mg l of alcl3 fig s2b however obvious aggregation of ps cooh was observed in both conditions fig s1 the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the introduced aluminum ions adsorbed onto the surface of ps cooh rendering the ps cooh surface electrostatically heterogeneous sennato et al 2009 yet the dlvo interaction energy prediction only uses the mean value of surface charge which neglects the effects of the heterogeneity on the interacting surfaces cai et al 2018 to further investigate the possible interaction between alcl3 and ps cooh during the coagulation process the stretching frequencies of alcl3 6h2o and ps cooh before and after coagulation were measured figs 4 and s3 for alcl3 6h2o fig 4a four major peaks were evident including bound and isolated hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water molecules group at 3356 cm 1 costa et al 1999 the bending of water molecules at 1630 cm 1 costa et al 1999 and the al o group at 595 cm 1 and 855 cm 1 beran et al 2001 for ps cooh flocs after interaction with alcl3 fig 4b the characteristic band at 3400 cm 1 was ascribed to the h o h vibrations of adsorbed water li et al 2004 the absorption peaks observed at 3091 cm 1 and 3023 cm 1 were ascribed to the c h stretching vibrations in benzene rings yuan et al 2019 the peaks appearing at 2926 cm 1 and 2849 cm 1 corresponded to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of c h the absorption peak at 1705 cm 1 represented the existence of cooh groups hu et al 2019 the absorption bands located at 1490 cm 1 and 1453 cm 1 was assigned to the vibration of monosubstituted benzenes han et al 2017 the absorption peaks at 757 cm 1 and 701 cm 1 were related to the bending vibrations of hydrogen atoms on monosubstituted benzene rings ding et al 2015 these characteristic peaks representing ps cooh were consistent with previously reported studies fig s3 chen et al 2016 han et al 2020 after reaction with alcl3 a new peak at 1600 cm 1 representing the coo al group lee et al 2000 was observed which might be due to the formation of bridges between the surface functional groups of ps cooh and aluminum wu et al 2020 furthermore the peak at 550 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 corresponded to al oh djebaili et al 2015 perkins and palmer 2000 the ph of the system after reaction with different concentrations of alcl3 was shown in fig s3 as expected increasing the alcl3 concentration progressively decreased the ph values due to the oh consumption by the alcl3 hydrolysis these results suggest that the dominant reaction mechanisms between ps cooh nps and alcl3 include electrostatic adsorption and intermolecular forces 3 4 effects of ph on ps cooh removal effects of ph on ps cooh removal by alcl3 was investigated over the initial ph range of 3 0 10 0 the ps cooh removal efficiency increased sharply from 12 0 at ph 3 0 to 96 4 at ph 8 5 and then decreased to 83 7 when ph reached 10 0 fig 5 a solution ph can affect both the surface potential of ps cooh and speciation of aluminum the surface of ps cooh maintained negatively charged 27 8 49 6 mv fig 5b and the hydrodynamic diameter remained constant at 50 nm fig 5c over the ph range at ph 3 0 al mainly presented as hydrated monomer aluminum al h2o 6 3 hu et al 2006 when ph increased to 4 5 the main species are positive hydrolyzates such as al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 and al3 oh 4 5 zhang et al 2008 when the ph reached 8 5 highly polymeric positive hydrolyzates such as alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 al13 which was reported to be the most effective coagulation species in aluminum based coagulants due to its strong charge neutralization capability and high structure stability bottero et al 1982 gregory and dupont 2001 was formed these positive hydrolyzates possessed strong ability of neutralizing the negative charges of ps cooh and formed flocs with ps cooh through adsorption and bridging resulted in the destabilization of nanoplastics therefore as the ph increased from 3 0 to 8 5 the zeta potential of ps cooh in the presence of alcl3 changed from 11 7 mv to 3 0 mv fig 5b and the hydrodynamic diameters increased sharply from 55 to 4755 nm after 10 min fig 5c leading to an improved ps cooh aggregation rate from 0 at ph 3 0 to 2 63 nm s at ph 8 5 table s1 and an enhanced ps cooh removal efficiency when ph reached 10 0 the dominate hydrolyzate was transformed to negatively charged al oh 4 yang et al 2010 the zeta potential was reduced to 16 3 mv and the corresponding hydrodynamic diameter remained at 67 nm resulting in an aggregation rate of 0 and a declined ps cooh removal efficiency of 83 7 increasing the ph from 8 5 to 10 0 enhanced the repulsive energy barrier between ps cooh from 0 to 5 0 kt as shown in fig s4 3 5 effects of temperature on ps cooh removal effects of temperature on ps cooh removal efficiency by alcl3 was investigated at ph 6 5 fig 6 a shows that increasing the temperature from 4 to 23 c significantly enhanced the ps cooh removal efficiency from 92 1 to 96 6 p value of 0 001 at the 0 05 level of significance it is reported that the nps were more stable at the lower temperature compared to those at the higher temperature singh et al 2019 the hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh without the addition of alcl3 at 4 and 23 c remained constant at 50 nm and the aggregation rates were both 0 table s1 high temperature increases the solubility of alcl3 decreases the viscosity of water enhances the brownian motion and the molecular collision rate and increases the reaction rate constant which is conducive to the formation of larger flocs of ps cooh qiu et al 2019 as shown in fig 6b with the addition of alcl3 when the temperature was increased from 4 c to 23 c the hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh was increased from 800 nm to 1400 nm after 10 min and the aggregation rate of ps cooh was enhanced from 0 888 to 1 138 nm s table s1 3 6 effects of salinity on ps cooh removal the aggregation kinetics and removal efficiency of ps cooh with or without the addition of alcl3 were studied over a range of salinities from 0 to 35 in the absence of alcl3 the zeta potential of ps cooh changed from 43 6 mv to 36 5 and 34 2 mv respectively as the salinity increased from 0 to 5 and 10 and then more sharply to 25 8 mv as the salinity reached 35 fig 7 a accordingly the hydrodynamic size of ps cooh with salinities of 5 and 10 remained constant at 50 nm fig 7b with an aggregation rate of 0 table s1 yet when the salinity increased to 20 and 35 the hydrodynamic size of ps cooh sharply increased to 87 nm and 654 nm after 10 min fig 7b and the aggregation rate increased to 0 041 and 0 948 nm s table s1 respectively accordingly to the dlvo analysis fig s5a the energy barrier between ps cooh was decreased from 29 kt for zero salinity to 15 3 11 3 9 0 kt when the salinity was increased to 5 10 and 20 respectively the energy barrier dropped below 0 kt when the salinity increased to 35 the surface potential of ps cooh became less negative as the salinity increased due to the charge neutralization and the compression of electrostatic double layer li et al 2020 resulting in weaker electrostatic repulsive forces and faster homoaggregation rates as a result the ps cooh removal efficiency increased from 0 to 3 2 as the salinity increased from 0 to 20 and then sharply increased to 84 3 as the salinity increased to 35 fig 7c this observation is consistent with previously reported studies cai et al 2018 found that the polystyrene nanoparticles ps nps dispersed well in milli q water with hydrodynamic diameters of 100 nm at nacl concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mmol l whereas a slight aggregation was observed with 100 mmol l nacl li et al 2019 investigated the effects of nacl on the settling ratios of ps nps and they found that increasing the nacl concentration enhanced the settling ratios of ps nps due to the formation of ps nps homoaggregates with the addition of alcl3 the zeta potential of ps cooh changed slowly from 5 3 mv to 8 7 9 8 8 6 and 9 9 mv respectively as the salinity increased from 0 to 5 10 20 and 35 fig 7d correspondingly the hydrodynamic diameters of ps cooh changed readily from 1426 nm to 1306 1394 1475 and 1577 nm respectively after 10 min fig 7e and the aggregation rates were enhanced from 0 723 to 0 897 0 803 0 988 and 1 158 nm s respectively table s1 as described in the dlvo analysis fig s5b the energy barrier between ps cooh after reaction with alcl3 with a salinity of 0 was 4 7 kt increasing the salinity to 5 35 decreased the energy barrier to below 0 kt the increase in salinity resulted in weaker electrostatic repulsive forces decreased stability and faster aggregation rates drechsler and grundke 2005 the ps cooh removal efficiencies with the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 at different salinities remained as high as 96 p value of 0 82 at the 0 05 level of significance 3 7 effects of inorganic colloids on ps cooh removal nanoscale al2o3 with a particle size of 20 nm and sio2 with a particle size of 50 nm was applied as inorganic colloids in this study al2o3 was positively charged and sio2 was negatively charged in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 fig s6 in the absence of alcl3 the addition of al2o3 led to a sharp increase of zeta potential from 43 6 mv to 5 4 mv due to the charge neutralization fig 8 a correspondingly the hydrodynamic diameter of ps cooh was increased to about 250 nm after 10 min fig 8b and the aggregation rate was enhanced to 0 323 nm s table s1 the increase of hydrodynamic size was caused by the heteroaggregation between positive charged al2o3 and negative charged ps cooh oriekhova and stoll 2018 the addition of sio2 slightly changed the zeta potential of ps cooh from 43 6 mv to 46 1 mv fig 8a and the hydrodynamic diameter of ps cooh remained constant at 50 nm fig 8b without aggregation table s1 as a result the removal efficiency of ps cooh was increased to 43 3 in the presence of al2o3 and remained at 0 in the presence of sio2 fig 8c with the addition of alcl3 the zeta potential of ps cooh changed from 3 0 mv to 10 3 mv in the presence of sio2 while the zeta potential remained constant at 3 61 mv in the presence of al2o3 p value of 0 97 at the 0 05 level of significance fig 8d correspondingly the hydrodynamic diameter of ps cooh increased to about 1037 and 1653 nm fig 8e and the aggregation rates were 1 114 and 1 308 nm s respectively table s1 the removal efficiencies of ps cooh after addition of 10 mg l alcl3 in the presence and absence of al2o3 and sio2 were shown in fig 8f in the absence of inorganic colloids the ps cooh nps removal efficiency was 96 6 the presence of 50 mg l of sio2 decreased the removal efficiency to 93 2 probably due to the fact that the negatively charged sio2 can compete with ps cooh for reacting with alcl3 meanwhile with the addition of alcl3 the ps cooh removal efficiency did not show significant difference in the absence and presence of negatively charged al2o3 p value of 1 03 at the 0 05 level of significance 3 8 ps cooh removal in real surface water the ps cooh spiked surface water ps cooh 50 mg l contained 15 0 mg l cl 6 3 mg l no3 30 9 mg l so4 2 7 8 mg l k 23 3 mg l ca2 16 7 mg l na 3 4 mg l mg2 and 8 0 mg l toc ph value was measured to be 6 8 and the zeta potential was determined to be 14 9 mv with the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 90 2 of the ps cooh was removed while the removal efficiency of the ps cooh in deionized water was 96 6 p value of 0 016 at the 0 05 level of significance the decrease in ps cooh removal efficiency was probably due to the presence of toc in the surface water toc links to the ps cooh via adsorption or hydrophobic interaction hotze et al 2010 increasing the steric and electrostatic repulsion between the ps cooh and thus providing the stabilizing effect in addition toc may compete with ps cooh for al resulting in reduced ps cooh removal efficiency after reaction with 10 mg l alcl3 toc in aqueous phase was reduced from 8 0 mg l to 3 2 mg l 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the removal of nanoplastics from water via coagulation and sedimentation using alcl3 as a coagulant ps cooh nps appeared as clearly defined and discrete spherical nanoparticles and were well dispersed in water 10 mg l alcl3 effectively removed 96 6 of 50 mg l of ps cooh after reaction the added positively charged aluminum ions can compress and even destroy the stable negatively charged ps cooh surface layer or electron double layer decreased the stabilizing coulomb forces between the particles and the energy barrier and led to higher attachment efficiency and enhanced aggregation rate of ps cooh the dominant removal mechanisms include electrostatic adsorption and intermolecular interactions the ps cooh removal efficiency increased sharply from 12 0 at ph 3 0 to 96 4 at ph 8 5 and then decreased to 83 7 when ph reached 10 0 increasing the temperature from 4 to 23 c significantly enhanced the ps cooh removal efficiency from 92 1 to 96 6 salinity affects the colloidal stability of the ps cooh in the absence of alcl3 the ps cooh removal efficiency increased from 0 to 3 2 as the salinity increased from 0 to 20 and then sharply increased to 84 3 as the salinity increased to 35 with the addition of alcl3 the ps cooh removal efficiency remained constant at 96 with the increase of salinity the addition of negatively charged sio2 did not affect the stability of ps cooh whereas the addition of positively charged al2o3 enhanced the formation of heteroaggregates and sharply increased the ps cooh removal efficiency from 0 to 43 3 after the addition of alcl3 the ps cooh nps removal efficiency was 96 6 in the absence and presence of al2o3 yet the presence of sio2 decreased the removal efficiency to 93 2 the addition of 10 mg l alcl3 efficiently removed 90 2 of 50 mg l ps cooh from real surface water rich in inorganic ions and toc this study demonstrated the promise of coagulation and sedimentation using alcl3 for fast and efficient removal of nps from natural water bodies this approach provides an innovative and practical alternative to remove nps from contaminated aquatic systems declaration of

16466,submerged membrane hybrid systems smhss that combine membrane filtration with powdered activated carbon pac take advantage of pac s ability to adsorb and remove contaminants dissolved in water however the risk of contaminant desorption due to temporal changes in the influent concentration of the contaminant has not been thoroughly explored in this study we used a smhs with conventionally sized pac or superfine pac spac to remove 2 methylisoborneol mib a representative micropollutant from water containing natural organic matter nom with the goal of elucidating adsorption desorption phenomena in the smhs we found that 20 40 of the mib that adsorbed on pac and spac while the influent was contaminated with mib 6 h contamination period desorbed to the liquid phase within 6 h from the time that the mib containing influent was replaced by mib free influent no contamination period the percentage of desorption during the no contamination period increased with increasing mib breakthrough concentration during the contamination period these findings indicate that the pac spac in the smhs should be replaced while the breakthrough concentration is low not only to keep a high removal rate but also to decrease the desorption risk spac is fast in removal by adsorption but it is also fast in release by desorption spac median diameter 0 94 µm showed almost the same adsorption desorption kinetics as pac 12 1 µm of a double dose a two component branched pore diffusion model combined with an iast ideal adsorbed solution theory freundlich isotherm was used to describe and analyze the adsorption desorption of mib the diffusivity of mib molecules in the pores of the activated carbon particles decreased markedly in a short period of time this decrease which was attributed to fouling of the activated carbon in the smhs by coagulant treated water containing nom not only reduced the rate of mib removal during the contamination period but also hindered the rate of mib desorption during the no contamination period and thus prevented the effluent mib concentration from becoming high on the other hand coagulation did not change the concentration of nom that competes

mean squared deviation 1 introduction hybrid membrane systems for water treatment combine membrane filtration with another treatment process such as photocatalysis biodegradation or adsorption to remove dissolved micropollutants including pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products taste odor compounds and natural organic matter nom systems that couple a low pressure membrane with powdered activated carbon pac thus combining the benefits of adsorptive removal by pac and membrane separation of suspended particles including the pac are used for water purification löwenberg et al 2014 shanmuganathan et al 2017 singh 2005 stoquart et al 2012 in addition the use of pac prior to membrane filtration is also beneficial for urgent treatment of occasional pollution or treatment of emergency water supplies loo et al 2012 pac and superfine pac spac not only adsorptively remove micropollutants but also reduce membrane fouling thus enabling the attenuation of trans membrane pressure rise and consequently reduction of the operational energy required for filtration amaral et al 2016 matsui et al 2007 2009b tansakul et al 2011 xing et al 2019 in hybrid membrane systems two methods for pac application have been studied continuous dose and pulse dose at the beginning of each filtration cycle campos et al 2000a matsui et al 2001 schideman et al 2002 although the continuous dose method is operationally simple it is inefficient because the pac added late in the filtration cycle has a short residence time in the reactor before being discarded so it might not achieve as high an adsorption density as it would if it had been added earlier several researchers have compared the adsorption efficiencies of the pulse dose and continuous dose methods and reported the superiority of the pulse dose campos et al 2000a 2000b matsui et al 2001 in submerged membrane filtration systems a high dose pulse of pac is sometimes added to the membrane tank and retained there for at least several days to fully utilize the adsorption capacity of the pac kim et al 2007 stoquart et al 2012 in most of previous studies of membrane hybrid systems the influent concentrations of the compounds targeted for removal were constant that is the studies did not account for temporal changes in the influent concentration of the target compounds which can occur with occasional pollutants meanwhile the study of löwenberg et al 2014 should be noteworthy in that it is probably the only one observing the effect of influent concentration variation in hybrid membrane systems they report that micropollutant removal rate was decreased after a peak load attributing this decrease to desorption effect in other words as the influent concentration of a pollutant decreases the pollutant adsorbed on the pac held in the membrane tank can desorb owing to the reversibility of adsorption in addition the presence of competitive adsorbates such as nom may accelerate desorption of pollutants aschermann et al 2018 to et al 2008a 2008b the desorption of high concentration adsorbates has been well studied banat et al 2000 chern and wu 2001 martin et al 2018 there have been several studies of micropollutant desorption from granular activated carbon corwin and summers 2011 yuan et al 2020 but the only study of desorption from pac in hybrid membrane systems is that of kim et al 1996 who tested a single high concentration higher than milligrams per liter solution of dichlorobenzene in water very recent studies revealed that when the nom concentration is low when the activated carbon ac dosage is high when ac is microporous with larger pore diameters or when spac is used instead of pac all of which are conditions that minimize blockage of ac pores the adsorption of micropollutants becomes more reversible aschermann et al 2019a 2019b 2018 nakayama et al 2020 therefore 100 desorption may occur at equilibrium when the liquid phase concentration of the adsorbate is zero however studies of the kinetics of micropollutant desorption in the presence of nom are rarely conducted because a complex analysis that goes beyond the application of the pore surface diffusion model for a single adsorbate is required newcombe et al 2002 to et al 2008a 2008b compared with pressurized membrane filtration systems submerged membrane filtration systems retain pac in the membrane tank at high concentrations for a relatively long time the goal being to achieve sufficient utilization of pac s adsorption capacity and or to take advantage of pac as a biological carrier stoquart et al 2014 2012 however long retention of pac entails the risk that even if the influent concentration sufficiently decrease the effluent concentration will remain high due to desorption as löwenberg et al 2014 report given these considerations our objectives in this study were to analyze the desorption of a micropollutant in a submerged membrane hybrid system smhs with a pulse ac dose not only experimentally but also theoretically by means of a two component branched pore kinetic model bpkm which enabled us to describe competitive adsorption of two compounds the micropollutant and nom on acs with different particle sizes as adsorbents we used spac with a median diameter of 0 94 µm and conventionally sized pac with a median diameter of 12 1 µm and we used 2 methylisoborneol mib a representative micropollutant as the target micropollutant 2 materials and methods 2 1 ac and coagulant commercially available wood based pac median diameter 12 1 μm taikou w futamura chemical

al l in the coagulant tank before use the characteristics of the carbon are presented elsewhere matsui et al 2015 and in table 1s and fig 1s supplementary information si 2 2 raw water samples water collected from the chibaberi river hokkaido japan was filtered through a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane to remove any undissolved substances stock solutions of mib were prepared by dissolving reagent grade mib wako pure chemical industries osaka japan in ultrapure water and filtering the resulting solution through a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane filter we prepared the seven types of water samples for the experiments table 1 and supplementary table 2s nom free water was prepared by adding inorganic salts to ultrapure water and adjusting the ph to 7 0 nom water was prepared by adjusting the ph of the filtered chibaberi river water to ph 7 0 mib spiked nom free water and mib spiked nom water were prepared by diluting the mib stock solution with nom free water and nom water respectively at around 1 or 0 1 μg l coagulated nom free water coagulated nom water and coagulated mib spiked nom water were obtained after nom free water nom water and mib spiked nom water respectively were subjected to inline coagulation by means of a subsystem of the smhs as described in section 2 4 the mib concentrations 1 or 0 1 μg l are higher than the concentrations commonly observed in water sources but such high concentrations of mibs do occur in rare cases li et al 2019 liu et al 2016 masakazu 1988 takahashi et al 2016 in addition the results of the evaluation in terms of relative concentration can apply to normal low concentration phenomena because the adsorption removal percentages of trace contaminants such as mib is independent from the influent concentration gillogly et al 1999 graham et al 2000 knappe et al 1998 matsui et al 2003 furthermore the concentrations were set with the intention that low concentrations during desorption would be measurable 2 3 determination of mib concentrations mib concentrations were determined by monitoring for mib m z 95 with a headspace solid phase microextraction system pal rsi 85 agilent technologies japan tokyo japan coupled to a gas chromatograph mass

spac the small scale smhs shown in fig 1 was used for the experiments in this study the system consists of a raw water tank a coagulant tank a submerged membrane tank a feed line consisting of tubes and pumps and an effluent collector in addition a subsystem without a submerged membrane tank was also set up in parallel to produce and collect blank water samples the details of the smhs configuration are listed in supplementary table 3s raw water containing mib was supplemented with pacl 2 mg al l and mixed in a static mixer and the resulting coagulated water was fed to the submerged membrane tank immediately after the tank was filled with the coagulated water it was spiked with a pulse dose of pac or spac and membrane filtration was allowed to proceed for 6 h referred to hereafter as the contamination period the filtration flux was 0 069 m h and the hydraulic retention time of the submerged membrane tank was 46 min after 6 h of membrane filtration the mib containing raw water was replaced by mib free raw water and membrane filtration was continued for another 18 19 h referred to hereafter as the no contamination period total filtration time 24 25 h for the first 3 min after the membrane filtration started the effluent was discarded because of the effect of water replacement in the tubing the effluent fractions were collected consecutively one 57 min fraction taken from 3 to 60 min eleven 1 h fractions taken from 1 to 2 h 2 to 3 h etc one 5 h fraction and one 7 h fraction in some runs a 5 h fraction planned became a 10 h fraction and then a 7 h fraction became a 2 h fraction or a 3 h fraction fig 2s concurrently blank samples were collected every hour for the first 6 h the collected samples were filtered through a 0 2 µm ptfe membrane dismic 25hp toyo roshi kaisha tokyo japan for mib analysis to compensate for the lack of multiple measurements for each sample due to the limited sample volumes we collected many samples in succession and observed the time course of the mib concentration to confirm that there were no outliers in addition smhs experiments were conducted at two different dosages for each ac the two dosages were 10 and 20 mg l for pac and 5 and 10 mg l for spac for each condition except 20 mg l dosage two experiments were performed to confirm the reproducibility of the results the ac dosage was defined as the mass of ac divided by the volume of the water treated during the contamination period all experiments including analyses of water quality were conducted in a room with a constant temperature of 20 c 2 5 batch adsorption equilibrium tests for batch adsorption equilibrium tests vials containing raw water supplementary table 2s were spiked with specified amounts of ac 0 5 16 mg l sealed manually shaken and then agitated on a mechanical shaker at a constant temperature of 20 c in the dark for 2 weeks which was sufficient for achieving adsorption equilibrium nakayama et al 2020 in single solute mib adsorption equilibrium tests 110 ml aliquots of mib spiked nom free water in 115 ml vials were used in the mib adsorption equilibrium tests in the presence of nom 65 ml aliquots of mib spiked nom water and coagulated mib spiked nom water in 68 ml vials were used all the vials were cleaned and dried at 550 c before use after 2 weeks the contents of the vials were filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filters and mib concentrations in the aqueous phase were measured solid phase mib concentrations were calculated based on mass balance 2 6 adsorption desorption model for the smhs pac spac 2 6 1 development of a model for multicomponent adsorption desorption kinetics in the submerged membrane tank we constructed a multicomponent model for the kinetics of adsorption desorption of mib molecules on the pac spac in the smhs by using the bpkm of peel et al 1981 the bpkm divides carbon particle into two regions of different diffusion rates which are loosely termed macropores and micropores note these terms should not be confused with their conventional uses to define certain pore size ranges the bpkm consisted of three mass transfer resistances in series fig 3s passage of adsorbates across the external surface of an ac particle intraparticle diffusion of the adsorbates in the macropores and mass transfer from the macropore to the micropores the model equations are briefly described as follows details are in si since the parts of the total adsorptive capacity which are utilized in macropores and micropores are and 1 respectively the adsorbate loading per gram of ac solid phase concentration is given by 1 q i t r q m i t r 1 q b i t r here it was assumed that the macropores and micropores are uniformly distributed throughout the particles peel et al 1981 therefore is not a function of the radial direction but is treated as a constant value the mass balance in micropore is as follows 2 q b i t r t k s i 1 q m i t r q b i t r the mass balance in macropores is as follows 3 q m i t r t ε d p i ρ r 2 r r 2 c m i t r r k s i q m i t r q b i t r a cstr continuous stirred tank reactor model is applied to describe the mass balance equation for an adsorbate in a membrane tank 4 d c i t d t 3 c c k f i ρ r c i t c m i t r c in i q v c i t q v k la i c i t local adsorption equilibrium in the macropores of an ac particle is expressed by the iast ideal adsorption solution theory freundlich isotherm equation crittenden et al 1985 hand et al 1985 it should be noted that the use of the adsorption equilibrium equation implicitly assumes that adsorption is reversible that is that 100 desorption occurs when the liquid phase concentration goes to zero 2 6 2 isotherm parameter estimation method to describe competitive adsorption of background nom and mib we used an equivalent background compound ebc method graham et al 2000 najm et al 1991 newcombe et al 2002 where the ebc is a hypothetical compound that represents the nom that competes with the target compound mib in this research for adsorption sites the mass balance in a vial used for batch adsorption experiments was as follows 5 c 0 mib q e mib c c q e mib q e mib q e ebc q e mib n f mib q e ebc n f ebc k f mib n f mib n f mib 6 c 0 ebc q e ebc c c q e ebc q e mib q e ebc q e mib n f mib q e ebc n f ebc k f ebc n f ebc n f ebc in the ebc method the equations are repeatedly solved by assuming those for ebc c 0 ebc k f ebc and n f ebc to search for the best fit of the calculated mib concentrations to the experimentally observed concentrations we conducted searches to minimize the msd which corresponds to the average of relative squared errors between the observed and calculated concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption desorption kinetics in the smhs pac spac when the smhs pac spac was operated for 24 h with a pulse ac dose the mib concentration in the effluent increased with time for the first 6 h the contamination period during which the influent water contained mib coagulated mib spiked nom water even after the influent mib concentration dropped to zero that is during the no contamination period after the coagulated mib spiked nom water was replaced by coagulated nom water or coagulated nom free water the mib concentration in the effluent remained high for a time and continued to be detectable throughout all the runs figs 2 and 3 the effluent concentration dropped faster in the smhs without ac fig 5s this difference indicates that the high mib concentrations observed in the effluents during the no contamination period in the presence of ac were due to desorption of mib that had been adsorbed on the ac during the contamination period that is the mib was supplied to the liquid phase from the solid phase two different dosages were tested for each ac 10 and 20 mg l for pac 5 and 10 mg l for spac the effluent mib concentration during the contamination period was lower at the higher ac dosages than at the lower ac dosages and the concentration continued to be lower for some time after the influent mib concentration dropped to zero compare the orange and blue curves in fig 2 for spac the effluent mib concentrations late in the no contamination period became higher at the high ac dosage than that at the low ac dosage the reason for this is that at the higher ac dosages more mib was removed from the water during the contamination period and therefore more was desorbed during the no contamination period in particular for spac which adsorbs and desorbs mib at a faster rate than pac desorption including observed desorption percentage around 50 or less and ultimate desorption percentage is more discussed in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 which deal with the model fitting and simulation when coagulated nom free water which contained neither mib nor nom was used to replace coagulated mib spiked nom water as the influent after the initial 6 h of the test the mib concentrations in the effluents decreased fig 6s c and f however the concentrations were lower than the concentrations when coagulated nom water was used fig 3 these results indicate that not only the decrease of the mib influent concentration but also the presence of nom caused desorption of mib previously adsorbed on the ac notably in the blank tests of the smhs without ac the mib concentration in the effluent was 15 6 lower than in the influent fig 5s a result that we attributed to loss due to volatilization of mib from the submerged membrane tank of the smhs during the contamination period a given dose of spac removed a similar amount of mib as a pac dose that was twice as high figs 2 and 7s compare pac at 10 mg l to spac at 5 mg l and compare pac at 20 mg l to spac at 10 mg l in a previous study of a pressurized membrane filtration adsorption system matsui et al 2007 we found that 4 times as much pac as spac was necessary to remove the same amount of geosmin a typical micropollutant with a molecular weight and hydrophobicity similar to those of mib the smaller difference between the required pac and spac dosages in the current study can be attributed not only to the faster intraparticle diffusivity of mib compared with that of geosmin but also to the relatively longer ac water contact time 46 min supplementary table 3s in the smhs which attenuated the effect of the faster adsorption kinetics of spac than that in a pressurized membrane filtration adsorption system 4 9 min as the effect of contact time on pac spac is discussed by matsui et al 2013 from the mass balance of mib in the smhs pac spac supplementary table 4s we calculated the concentration of mib adsorbed on ac solid phase mib concentration and plotted it as a function of time fig 4 the solid phase concentration increased during the contamination period 6 h and then decreased after the mib containing influent water was replaced with mib free nom water no contamination period approximately 20 40 of the mib adsorbed during the contamination period desorbed during the first 6 h of the no contamination period figs 4 and 8s the percentage of desorbed mib increased with time reaching 40 55 after 24 h 18 h after the influent switch however mib desorption had slowed with time and it seemed that it might take many days before all the mib released or a substantial fraction of the mib might adsorb irreversibly notably aschermann et al 2018 aschermann et al 2019b and nakayama et al 2020 reported nearly 100 reversibility of micropollutant adsorption specifically they found that adsorption of micropollutants is almost completely reversible under equilibrium conditions with a low background nom concentration a high ac dosage or ac with large pores considering the low nom concentration and high ac dosage in our experiments it is possible that all of the mib preadsorbed on the ac might be desorbed after mib free water had been fed to the smhs pac spac for 24 h the mib desorption percentages were higher with nom water than with nom free water fig 8s because of competitive adsorption of the nom that is displacement of mib molecules by nom molecules aschermann et al 2018 nakayama et al 2020 the desorption percentages were higher at the lower ac dosages figs 4 and 8s low ac dosages resulted in high solid phase mib concentrations high mib loading on ac which could have accelerated desorption 3 2 model simulation of adsorption desorption of mib on pac spac in the smhs 3 2 1 adsorption equilibrium of mib in the presence of nom the single solute isotherms for mib adsorption on pac and spac were nearly identical fig 5 because the isotherms were similar we applied the same mib adsorption isotherm parameter values for pac and spac which resulted in a freundlich constant k f mib of 0 114 μ mol mg μ mol l 1 n f ebc and a freundlich exponent 1 n f mib of 0 472 the isotherms for the mib spiked nom water and the coagulated mib spiked nom water were nearly identical fig 5 indicating that addition of the coagulant pacl did not affect the mib adsorption capacity of either pac or spac and did not change the concentration of nom that competes with mib for adsorption sites this finding is in agreement with that reported by altmann et al 2015 for pac and is reasonable in light of previous reports that 1 treatment with aluminum coagulants including pacl does not work with low molecular weight nom fig 4s sillanpää 2014 yan et al 2008 and 2 low molecular weight nom has the strong inhibitory effect among other noms on mib adsorption and natural organic matter that competes with mib for adsorption sites is such nom ho and newcombe 2005 matsui et al 2003 newcombe et al 2002 moreover the influences of nom on mib adsorption by pac and spac were similar and therefore the mib isotherms for the two nom waters were almost the same for pac and spac as was the case for the single solute isotherms 3 2 2 parameter value evaluation for adsorption isotherm the ebc method for fitting the isotherm of a micropollutant in the presence of nom typically involves a search for three parameter values the initial liquid phase concentration c 0 ebc the freundlich constant k f ebc and the freundlich exponent n f ebc of the ebc nom najm et al 1991 since determining unique values for k f ebc and n f ebc is often difficult graham et al 2000 knappe et al 1998 qi et al 2007 we used the ebc method under three conditions a c table 2 the aic akaike s information criterion and bic bayesian information criterion akaike 1974 burnham and anderson 2002 schwarz 1978 values indicated that the most reasonable isotherm fitting was achieved under condition c details are in si the isotherm fits were also visually confirmed supplementary fig 9s the assumption of condition c that k f ebc and n f ebc were the same as k f mib and n f mib respectively was appropriate because the values obtained for ebc under conditions a and b were similar to the mib values the estimated ebc concentration 0 223 µmol l was much higher than the mib concentration 0 006 µmol l and was lower than the total nom concentration 3 2 mg l supplementary table 2s these results are consistent with the fact that the ebc concentration is generally much higher than the target micropollutant mib concentration and that the ebc constitutes only a portion of nom edzwald 2010 knappe et al 1998 matsui et al 2003 ebc concentration was almost the same between mib spiked nom water and coagulated mib spiked nom water which clearly indicates that little ebc was removed by coagulation as inferred from section 3 2 1 3 2 3 model simulation of the kinetics of adsorption desorption in the smhs pac spac some of the parameters required for the bpkm simulation were predetermined from experiments independent of the smhs experiments or from literatures these parameters and the methods by which they were determined are presented in supplementary table 5s as mentioned in section 3 2 2 we assumed that the ebc molecule was similar in size to mib and thus that the external mass transfer coefficients pore diffusion coefficients and micropore mass transfer coefficients were the same for mib and ebc finally five unknown parameters remained for these five parameters we evaluated seven different search settings and the parameter values were optimized for each setting the simulation results of the parameter search settings are summarized in table 3 the details of the simulation results are described in si but the main points are as follows the simulation results obtained with settings a to e and g did not fit the experimental data supplementary fig 10s 15s the discrepancies suggested the change in intraparticle diffusivity due to the adsorption of nom by the ac or to the effects of coagulant such as ac flocculation and hindrance of mass transfer diffusivity by the aluminum precipitate ho and newcombe 2005 sidney seckler et al 2013 to et al 2008a 2008b after all setting f which takes into account the effects of nom loading and or coagulation in such a way that the pore diffusion coefficient in an ac particle is assumed to decrease with the residence time of the ac in the smhs gave the best fit to the experimental data with the smallest msd value compared with the other settings setting f has more parameters so the better fit may not be particularly surprising however despite the larger number of parameters preference should be given to setting f because it yielded the minimum values of both aic and bic values these results suggest that the decrease in uptake rate of mib is related to the change in internal diffusion d p not to the external mass transfer k f and that the decrease in internal diffusion is not related to the amount of ebc adsorbed the latter is consistent with previous findings that pore blockage is caused by large nom molecules rather than small nom molecules to et al 2008a 2008b the d p values estimated using setting f are shown in fig 7 the initial d p value was 3 5 10 6 cm2 s and the tortuosity τ estimated from this value was 1 9 supplementary table 6s this tortuosity is essentially consistent with previously reported values for virgin ac 2 4 ocampo pérez et al 2012 3 corwin and summers 2011 3 5 pan et al 2016 2 6 suzuki 1990 and other values sontheimer et al 1988 the d p value decreased markedly with time for the first 2 h after which the decrease continued but at a slower rate the decrease in d p indicates that ac fouling which led to constriction and blocking of the pores occurred mostly in the first few hours the total nom loadings on the acs at the first 2 h ranged between 20 and 90 mg c g supplementary fig 16s according to previous research pore constriction and blocking occur at nom loadings 50 mg c g which reduces the internal diffusivity by a factor of 10 or less li et al 2003 to et al 2008a therefore the ac fouling observed in our study could be related to the nom loading in addition considering the results of previous studies that reported that coagulation treatment ho and newcombe 2005 and coating the outer surface of pac with coagulant sidney seckler et al 2013 slowed the rate of external mass transfer of trace contaminants to the pac surface and that incorporation of pac into floc particles did not inhibit external mass transfer altmann et al 2015 this may also be related to the addition of coagulant pacl which was used to remove nom and attenuate membrane fouling chen et al 2020 matsui et al 2009b furthermore the better model fit obtained with setting f changing d p over setting g changing k f in our study suggests that the intraparticle pore diffusion has been retarded more severely than external mass transfer in this way the ac fouling led to a decrease in the rate of mib removal in the smhs pac spac although the fouling prevented and delayed desorption of previously adsorbed mib when the influent mib concentration decreased 3 2 4 analysis by the model simulation the removal rate depends on the ac dosage but in order to investigate how the desorption rate changes with the ac dosage the experimental and simulation results are summarized in fig 8 both the mib desorption ratio and the mib remaining proportion effluent influent concentration decreased as the ac dosage was increased these results can be interpreted as indicating that the lower the mib removal rate was during the contamination period and the more breakthrough that was detected in the effluent during that period the higher the mib desorption ratio was during the no contamination period because desorption is caused by an inverse concentration gradient it seems reasonable to expect that the absolute amount of desorption became high when the effluent concentration was high however the important point is that the ratio of the amounts of desorbed and adsorbed mib becomes higher with higher effluent concentration therefore when the influent concentration dropped and remained at low levels the smhs ac with a low mib removal rate had the disadvantages of having not only a high effluent concentration but also a high desorption ratio in such a case the ac in the smhs should be drained in particular when the remaining adsorption capacity of the ac is low which leads to low adsorptive removal of micropollutants this operational strategy is also important when ac is used for sporadic contaminant episodes such as algae blooms and industrial spills 4 conclusions in a hybrid system that combines ac adsorption with a submerged membrane filtration we found that the micropollutant mib desorbed from the ac when the influent mib concentration decreased and desorption was accelerated by the presence of nom in the influent approximately 20 40 of the mib that adsorbed on the ac during the first 6 h of the test was released over the course of the first 6 h after the mib containing water was replaced with natural water when the effluent mib concentration was high and the mib removal rate just prior to the no contamination period was low the desorbed adsorbed mib ratio and the absolute amount of mib desorption were high these results indicate that the ac in the submerged membrane tank should be replaced while the breakthrough concentration is low the mib adsorption desorption performances of pac and spac in the smhs were well described by a two component mib and ebc bpkm with the implicit assumption of 100 adsorption desorption reversibility the model fitting indicated that intraparticle diffusivity decreased largely over the course of a few hours of smhs operation this decrease in intraparticle diffusivity was expected to lead to earlier mib breakthrough by decreasing the adsorption rate and it also reduced the desorption rate of preadsorbed mib and suppressed the effluent concentration when the influent mib concentration decreased a given dose of spac showed almost the same adsorption desorption kinetics as a pac dose that was twice as high reduction in the ac particle size contributed to faster mib adsorption and desorption even though the adsorption capacities of the two different acs were the same the 2 fold difference between spac and pac was smaller than the previously reported 4 fold difference observed for a pressurized membrane filtration system a result that we attributed to the relatively longer ac detention time in the submerged membrane tank of the smhs coagulation pretreatment removed most of the nom but it did not influence competitive adsorption of mib and nom consequently the concentration of the ebc was almost the same before and after coagulation pretreatment which indicates that the ebc was not removed by coagulation however the intraparticle diffusivity of mib in ac decreased significantly with time in

16466,submerged membrane hybrid systems smhss that combine membrane filtration with powdered activated carbon pac take advantage of pac s ability to adsorb and remove contaminants dissolved in water however the risk of contaminant desorption due to temporal changes in the influent concentration of the contaminant has not been thoroughly explored in this study we used a smhs with conventionally sized pac or superfine pac spac to remove 2 methylisoborneol mib a representative micropollutant from water containing natural organic matter nom with the goal of elucidating adsorption desorption phenomena in the smhs we found that 20 40 of the mib that adsorbed on pac and spac while the influent was contaminated with mib 6 h contamination period desorbed to the liquid phase within 6 h from the time that the mib containing influent was replaced by mib free influent no contamination period the percentage of desorption during the no contamination period increased with increasing mib breakthrough concentration during the contamination period these findings indicate that the pac spac in the smhs should be replaced while the breakthrough concentration is low not only to keep a high removal rate but also to decrease the desorption risk spac is fast in removal by adsorption but it is also fast in release by desorption spac median diameter 0 94 µm showed almost the same adsorption desorption kinetics as pac 12 1 µm of a double dose a two component branched pore diffusion model combined with an iast ideal adsorbed solution theory freundlich isotherm was used to describe and analyze the adsorption desorption of mib the diffusivity of mib molecules in the pores of the activated carbon particles decreased markedly in a short period of time this decrease which was attributed to fouling of the activated carbon in the smhs by coagulant treated water containing nom not only reduced the rate of mib removal during the contamination period but also hindered the rate of mib desorption during the no contamination period and thus prevented the effluent mib concentration from becoming high on the other hand coagulation did not change the concentration of nom that competes

mean squared deviation 1 introduction hybrid membrane systems for water treatment combine membrane filtration with another treatment process such as photocatalysis biodegradation or adsorption to remove dissolved micropollutants including pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products taste odor compounds and natural organic matter nom systems that couple a low pressure membrane with powdered activated carbon pac thus combining the benefits of adsorptive removal by pac and membrane separation of suspended particles including the pac are used for water purification löwenberg et al 2014 shanmuganathan et al 2017 singh 2005 stoquart et al 2012 in addition the use of pac prior to membrane filtration is also beneficial for urgent treatment of occasional pollution or treatment of emergency water supplies loo et al 2012 pac and superfine pac spac not only adsorptively remove micropollutants but also reduce membrane fouling thus enabling the attenuation of trans membrane pressure rise and consequently reduction of the operational energy required for filtration amaral et al 2016 matsui et al 2007 2009b tansakul et al 2011 xing et al 2019 in hybrid membrane systems two methods for pac application have been studied continuous dose and pulse dose at the beginning of each filtration cycle campos et al 2000a matsui et al 2001 schideman et al 2002 although the continuous dose method is operationally simple it is inefficient because the pac added late in the filtration cycle has a short residence time in the reactor before being discarded so it might not achieve as high an adsorption density as it would if it had been added earlier several researchers have compared the adsorption efficiencies of the pulse dose and continuous dose methods and reported the superiority of the pulse dose campos et al 2000a 2000b matsui et al 2001 in submerged membrane filtration systems a high dose pulse of pac is sometimes added to the membrane tank and retained there for at least several days to fully utilize the adsorption capacity of the pac kim et al 2007 stoquart et al 2012 in most of previous studies of membrane hybrid systems the influent concentrations of the compounds targeted for removal were constant that is the studies did not account for temporal changes in the influent concentration of the target compounds which can occur with occasional pollutants meanwhile the study of löwenberg et al 2014 should be noteworthy in that it is probably the only one observing the effect of influent concentration variation in hybrid membrane systems they report that micropollutant removal rate was decreased after a peak load attributing this decrease to desorption effect in other words as the influent concentration of a pollutant decreases the pollutant adsorbed on the pac held in the membrane tank can desorb owing to the reversibility of adsorption in addition the presence of competitive adsorbates such as nom may accelerate desorption of pollutants aschermann et al 2018 to et al 2008a 2008b the desorption of high concentration adsorbates has been well studied banat et al 2000 chern and wu 2001 martin et al 2018 there have been several studies of micropollutant desorption from granular activated carbon corwin and summers 2011 yuan et al 2020 but the only study of desorption from pac in hybrid membrane systems is that of kim et al 1996 who tested a single high concentration higher than milligrams per liter solution of dichlorobenzene in water very recent studies revealed that when the nom concentration is low when the activated carbon ac dosage is high when ac is microporous with larger pore diameters or when spac is used instead of pac all of which are conditions that minimize blockage of ac pores the adsorption of micropollutants becomes more reversible aschermann et al 2019a 2019b 2018 nakayama et al 2020 therefore 100 desorption may occur at equilibrium when the liquid phase concentration of the adsorbate is zero however studies of the kinetics of micropollutant desorption in the presence of nom are rarely conducted because a complex analysis that goes beyond the application of the pore surface diffusion model for a single adsorbate is required newcombe et al 2002 to et al 2008a 2008b compared with pressurized membrane filtration systems submerged membrane filtration systems retain pac in the membrane tank at high concentrations for a relatively long time the goal being to achieve sufficient utilization of pac s adsorption capacity and or to take advantage of pac as a biological carrier stoquart et al 2014 2012 however long retention of pac entails the risk that even if the influent concentration sufficiently decrease the effluent concentration will remain high due to desorption as löwenberg et al 2014 report given these considerations our objectives in this study were to analyze the desorption of a micropollutant in a submerged membrane hybrid system smhs with a pulse ac dose not only experimentally but also theoretically by means of a two component branched pore kinetic model bpkm which enabled us to describe competitive adsorption of two compounds the micropollutant and nom on acs with different particle sizes as adsorbents we used spac with a median diameter of 0 94 µm and conventionally sized pac with a median diameter of 12 1 µm and we used 2 methylisoborneol mib a representative micropollutant as the target micropollutant 2 materials and methods 2 1 ac and coagulant commercially available wood based pac median diameter 12 1 μm taikou w futamura chemical

collected from the chibaberi river hokkaido japan was filtered through a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane to remove any undissolved substances stock solutions of mib were prepared by dissolving reagent grade mib wako pure chemical industries osaka japan in ultrapure water and filtering the resulting solution through a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane filter we prepared the seven types of water samples for the experiments table 1 and supplementary table 2s nom free water was prepared by adding inorganic salts to ultrapure water and adjusting the ph to 7 0 nom water was prepared by adjusting the ph of the filtered chibaberi river water to ph 7 0 mib spiked nom free water and mib spiked nom water were prepared by diluting the mib stock solution with nom free water and nom water respectively at around 1 or 0 1 μg l coagulated nom free water coagulated nom water and coagulated mib spiked nom water were obtained after nom free water nom water and mib spiked nom water respectively were subjected to inline coagulation by means of a subsystem of the smhs as described in section 2 4 the mib concentrations 1 or 0 1 μg l are higher than the concentrations commonly observed in water sources but such high concentrations of mibs do occur in rare cases li et al 2019 liu et al 2016 masakazu 1988 takahashi et al 2016 in addition the results of the evaluation in terms of relative concentration can apply to normal low concentration phenomena because the adsorption removal percentages of trace contaminants such as mib is independent from the influent concentration gillogly et al 1999 graham et al 2000 knappe et al 1998 matsui et al 2003 furthermore the concentrations were set with the intention that low concentrations during desorption would be measurable 2 3 determination of mib concentrations mib concentrations were determined by monitoring for mib m z 95 with a headspace solid phase microextraction system pal rsi 85 agilent technologies japan tokyo japan coupled to a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer 7820a 5977 e msd agilent 2 4 6 trichloroanisole d 3 m z 195 wako pure chemical industries osaka japan was used as an internal standard details are presented in the si 2 4 smhs with pac spac the small scale smhs shown in fig 1 was used for the experiments in this study the system consists of a raw water tank a coagulant tank a submerged membrane tank a feed line consisting of tubes and pumps and an effluent collector in addition a subsystem without a submerged membrane tank was also set up in parallel to produce and collect blank water samples the details of the smhs configuration are listed in supplementary table 3s raw water containing mib was supplemented with pacl 2 mg al l and mixed in a static mixer and the resulting coagulated water was fed to the submerged membrane tank immediately after the tank was filled with the coagulated water it was spiked with a pulse dose of pac or spac and membrane filtration was allowed to proceed for 6 h referred to hereafter as the contamination period the filtration flux was 0 069 m h and the hydraulic retention time of the submerged membrane tank was 46 min after 6 h of membrane filtration the mib containing raw water was replaced by mib free raw water and membrane filtration was continued for another 18 19 h referred to hereafter as the no contamination period total filtration time 24 25 h for the first 3 min after the membrane filtration started the effluent was discarded because of the effect of water replacement in the tubing the effluent fractions were collected consecutively one 57 min fraction taken from 3 to 60 min eleven 1 h fractions taken from 1 to 2 h 2 to 3 h etc one 5 h fraction and one 7 h fraction in some runs a 5 h fraction planned became a 10 h fraction and then a 7 h fraction became a 2 h fraction or a 3 h fraction fig 2s concurrently blank samples were collected every hour for the first 6 h the collected samples were filtered through a 0 2 µm ptfe membrane dismic 25hp toyo roshi kaisha tokyo japan for mib analysis to compensate for the lack of multiple measurements for each sample due to the limited sample volumes we collected many samples in succession and observed the time course of the mib concentration to confirm that there were no outliers in addition smhs experiments were conducted at two different dosages for each ac the two dosages were 10 and 20 mg l for pac and 5 and 10 mg l for spac for each condition except 20 mg l dosage two experiments were performed to confirm the reproducibility of the results the ac dosage was defined as the mass of ac divided by the volume of the water treated during the contamination period all experiments including analyses of water quality were conducted in a room with a constant temperature of 20 c 2 5 batch adsorption equilibrium tests for batch adsorption equilibrium tests vials containing raw water supplementary table 2s were spiked with specified amounts of ac 0 5 16 mg l sealed manually shaken and then agitated on a mechanical shaker at a constant temperature of 20 c in the dark for 2 weeks which was sufficient for achieving adsorption equilibrium nakayama et al 2020 in single solute mib adsorption equilibrium tests 110 ml aliquots of mib spiked nom free water in 115 ml vials were used in the mib adsorption equilibrium tests in the presence of nom 65 ml aliquots of mib spiked nom water and coagulated mib spiked nom water in 68 ml vials were used all the vials were cleaned and dried at 550 c before use after 2 weeks the contents of the vials were filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filters and mib concentrations in the aqueous phase were measured solid phase mib concentrations were calculated based on mass balance 2 6 adsorption desorption model for the smhs pac spac 2 6 1 development of a model for multicomponent adsorption desorption kinetics in the submerged membrane tank we constructed a multicomponent model for the kinetics of adsorption desorption of mib molecules on the pac spac in the smhs by using the bpkm of peel et al 1981 the bpkm divides carbon particle into two regions of different diffusion rates which are loosely termed macropores and micropores note these terms should not be confused with their conventional uses to define certain pore size ranges the bpkm consisted of three mass transfer resistances in series fig 3s passage of adsorbates across the external surface of an ac particle intraparticle diffusion of the adsorbates in the macropores and mass transfer from the macropore to the micropores the model equations are briefly described as follows details are in si since the parts of the total adsorptive capacity which are utilized in macropores and micropores are and 1 respectively the adsorbate loading per gram of ac solid phase concentration is given by 1 q i t r q m i t r 1 q b i t r here it was assumed that the macropores and micropores are uniformly distributed throughout the particles peel et al 1981 therefore is not a function of the radial direction but is treated as a constant value the mass balance in micropore is as follows 2 q b i t r t k s i 1 q m i t r q b i t r the mass balance in macropores is as follows 3 q m i t r t ε d p i ρ r 2 r r 2 c m i t r r k s i q m i t r q b i t r a cstr continuous stirred tank reactor model is applied to describe the mass balance equation for an adsorbate in a membrane tank 4 d c i t d t 3 c c k f i ρ r c i t c m i t r c in i q v c i t q v k la i c i t local adsorption equilibrium in the macropores of an ac particle is expressed by the iast ideal adsorption solution theory freundlich isotherm equation crittenden et al 1985 hand et al 1985 it should be noted that the use of the adsorption equilibrium equation implicitly assumes that adsorption is reversible that is that 100 desorption occurs when the liquid phase concentration goes to zero 2 6 2 isotherm parameter estimation method to describe competitive adsorption of background nom and mib we used an equivalent background compound ebc method graham et al 2000 najm et al 1991 newcombe et al 2002 where the ebc is a hypothetical compound that represents the nom that competes with the target compound mib in this research for adsorption sites the mass balance in a vial used for batch adsorption experiments was as follows 5 c 0 mib q e mib c c q e mib q e mib q e ebc q e mib n f mib q e ebc n f ebc k f mib n f mib n f mib 6 c 0 ebc q e ebc c c q e ebc q e mib q e ebc q e mib n f mib q e ebc n f ebc k f ebc n f ebc n f ebc in the ebc method the equations are repeatedly solved by assuming those for ebc c 0 ebc k f ebc and n f ebc to search for the best fit of the calculated mib concentrations to the experimentally observed concentrations we conducted searches to minimize the msd which corresponds to the average of relative squared errors between the observed and calculated concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption desorption kinetics in the smhs pac spac when the smhs pac spac was operated for 24 h with a pulse ac dose the mib concentration in the effluent increased with time for the first 6 h the contamination period during which the influent water contained mib coagulated mib spiked nom water even after the influent mib concentration dropped to zero that is during the no contamination period after the coagulated mib spiked nom water was replaced by coagulated nom water or coagulated nom free water the mib concentration in the effluent remained high for a time and continued to be detectable throughout all the runs figs 2 and 3 the effluent concentration dropped faster in the smhs without ac fig 5s this difference indicates that the high mib concentrations observed in the effluents during the no contamination period in the presence of ac were due to desorption of mib that had been adsorbed on the ac during the contamination period that is the mib was supplied to the liquid phase from the solid phase two different dosages were tested for each ac 10 and 20 mg l for pac 5 and 10 mg l for spac the effluent mib concentration during the contamination period was lower at the higher ac dosages than at the lower ac dosages and the concentration continued to be lower for some time after the influent mib concentration dropped to zero compare the orange and blue curves in fig 2 for spac the effluent mib concentrations late in the no contamination period became higher at the high ac dosage than that at the low ac dosage the reason for this is that at the higher ac dosages more mib was removed from the water during the contamination period and therefore more was desorbed during the no contamination period in particular for spac which adsorbs and desorbs mib at a faster rate than pac desorption including observed desorption percentage around 50 or less and ultimate desorption percentage is more discussed in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 which deal with the model fitting and simulation when coagulated nom free water which contained neither mib nor nom was used to replace coagulated mib spiked nom water as the influent after the initial 6 h of the test the mib concentrations in the effluents decreased fig 6s c and f however the concentrations were lower than the concentrations when coagulated nom water was used fig 3 these results indicate that not only the decrease of the mib influent concentration but also the presence of nom caused desorption of mib previously adsorbed on the ac notably in the blank tests of the smhs without ac the mib concentration in the effluent was 15 6 lower than in the influent fig 5s a result that we attributed to loss due to volatilization of mib from the submerged membrane tank of the smhs during the contamination period a given dose of spac removed a similar amount of mib as a pac dose that was twice as high figs 2 and 7s compare pac at 10 mg l to spac at 5 mg l and compare pac at 20 mg l to spac at 10 mg l in a previous study of a pressurized membrane filtration adsorption system matsui et al 2007 we found that 4 times as much pac as spac was necessary to remove the same amount of geosmin a typical micropollutant with a molecular weight and hydrophobicity similar to those of mib the smaller difference between the required pac and spac dosages in the current study can be attributed not only to the faster intraparticle diffusivity of mib compared with that of geosmin but also to the relatively longer ac water contact time 46 min supplementary table 3s in the smhs which attenuated the effect of the faster adsorption kinetics of spac than that in a pressurized membrane filtration adsorption system 4 9 min as the effect of contact time on pac spac is discussed by matsui et al 2013 from the mass balance of mib in the smhs pac spac supplementary table 4s we calculated the concentration of mib adsorbed on ac solid phase mib concentration and plotted it as a function of time fig 4 the solid phase concentration increased during the contamination period 6 h and then decreased after the mib containing influent water was replaced with mib free nom water no contamination period approximately 20 40 of the mib adsorbed during the contamination period desorbed during the first 6 h of the no contamination period figs 4 and 8s the percentage of desorbed mib increased with time reaching 40 55 after 24 h 18 h after the influent switch however mib desorption had slowed with time and it seemed that it might take many days before all the mib released or a substantial fraction of the mib might adsorb irreversibly notably aschermann et al 2018 aschermann et al 2019b and nakayama et al 2020 reported nearly 100 reversibility of micropollutant adsorption specifically they found that adsorption of micropollutants is almost completely reversible under equilibrium conditions with a low background nom concentration a high ac dosage or ac with large pores considering the low nom concentration and high ac dosage in our experiments it is possible that all of the mib preadsorbed on the ac might be desorbed after mib free water had been fed to the smhs pac spac for 24 h the mib desorption percentages were higher with nom water than with nom free water fig 8s because of competitive adsorption of the nom that is displacement of mib molecules by nom molecules aschermann et al 2018 nakayama et al 2020 the desorption percentages were higher at the lower ac dosages figs 4 and 8s low ac dosages resulted in high solid phase mib concentrations high mib loading on ac which could have accelerated desorption 3 2 model simulation of adsorption desorption of mib on pac spac in the smhs 3 2 1 adsorption equilibrium of mib in the presence of nom the single solute isotherms for mib adsorption on pac and spac were nearly identical fig 5 because the isotherms were similar we applied the same mib adsorption isotherm parameter values for pac and spac which resulted in a freundlich constant k f mib of 0 114 μ mol mg μ mol l 1 n f ebc and a freundlich exponent 1 n f mib of 0 472 the isotherms for the mib spiked nom water and the coagulated mib spiked nom water were nearly identical fig 5 indicating that addition of the coagulant pacl did not affect the mib adsorption capacity of either pac or spac and did not change the concentration of nom that competes with mib for adsorption sites this finding is in agreement with that reported by altmann et al 2015 for pac and is reasonable in light of previous reports that 1 treatment with aluminum coagulants including pacl does not work with low molecular weight nom fig 4s sillanpää 2014 yan et al 2008 and 2 low molecular weight nom has the strong inhibitory effect among other noms on mib adsorption and natural organic matter that competes with mib for adsorption sites is such nom ho and newcombe 2005 matsui et al 2003 newcombe et al 2002 moreover the influences of nom on mib adsorption by pac and spac were similar and therefore the mib isotherms for the two nom waters were almost the same for pac and spac as was the case for the single solute isotherms 3 2 2 parameter value evaluation for adsorption isotherm the ebc method for fitting the isotherm of a micropollutant in the presence of nom typically involves a search for three parameter values the initial liquid phase concentration c 0 ebc the freundlich constant k f ebc and the freundlich exponent n f ebc of the ebc nom najm et al 1991 since determining unique values for k f ebc and n f ebc is often difficult graham et al 2000 knappe et al 1998 qi et al 2007 we used the ebc method under three conditions a c table 2 the aic akaike s information criterion and bic bayesian information criterion akaike 1974 burnham and anderson 2002 schwarz 1978 values indicated that the most reasonable isotherm fitting was achieved under condition c details are in si the isotherm fits were also visually confirmed supplementary fig 9s the assumption of condition c that k f ebc and n f ebc were the same as k f mib and n f mib respectively was appropriate because the values obtained for ebc under conditions a and b were similar to the mib values the estimated ebc concentration 0 223 µmol l was much higher than the mib concentration 0 006 µmol l and was lower than the total nom concentration 3 2 mg l supplementary table 2s these results are consistent with the fact that the ebc concentration is generally much higher than the target micropollutant mib concentration and that the ebc constitutes only a portion of nom edzwald 2010 knappe et al 1998 matsui et al 2003 ebc concentration was almost the same between mib spiked nom water and coagulated mib spiked nom water which clearly indicates that little ebc was removed by coagulation as inferred from section 3 2 1 3 2 3 model simulation of the kinetics of adsorption desorption in the smhs pac spac some of the parameters required for the bpkm simulation were predetermined from experiments independent of the smhs experiments or from literatures these parameters and the methods by which they were determined are presented in supplementary table 5s as mentioned in section 3 2 2 we assumed that the ebc molecule was similar in size to mib and thus that the external mass transfer coefficients pore diffusion coefficients and micropore mass transfer coefficients were the same for mib and ebc finally five unknown parameters remained for these five parameters we evaluated seven different search settings and the parameter values were optimized for each setting the simulation results of the parameter search settings are summarized in table 3 the details of the simulation results are described in si but the main points are as follows the simulation results obtained with settings a to e and g did not fit the experimental data supplementary fig 10s 15s the discrepancies suggested the change in intraparticle diffusivity due to the adsorption of nom by the ac or to the effects of coagulant such as ac flocculation and hindrance of mass transfer diffusivity by the aluminum precipitate ho and newcombe 2005 sidney seckler et al 2013 to et al 2008a 2008b after all setting f which takes into account the effects of nom loading and or coagulation in such a way that the pore diffusion coefficient in an ac particle is assumed to decrease with the residence time of the ac in the smhs gave the best fit to the experimental data with the smallest msd value compared with the other settings setting f has more parameters so the better fit may not be particularly surprising however despite the larger number of parameters preference should be given to setting f because it yielded the minimum values of both aic and bic values these results suggest that the decrease in uptake rate of mib is related to the change in internal diffusion d p not to the external mass transfer k f and that the decrease in internal diffusion is not related to the amount of ebc adsorbed the latter is consistent with previous findings that pore blockage is caused by large nom molecules rather than small nom molecules to et al 2008a 2008b the d p values estimated using setting f are shown in fig 7 the initial d p value was 3 5 10 6 cm2 s and the tortuosity τ estimated from this value was 1 9 supplementary table 6s this tortuosity is essentially consistent with previously reported values for virgin ac 2 4 ocampo pérez et al 2012 3 corwin and summers 2011 3 5 pan et al 2016 2 6 suzuki 1990 and other values sontheimer et al 1988 the d p value decreased markedly with time for the first 2 h after which the decrease continued but at a slower rate the decrease in d p indicates that ac fouling which led to constriction and blocking of the pores occurred mostly in the first few hours the total nom loadings on the acs at the first 2 h ranged between 20 and 90 mg c g supplementary fig 16s according to previous research pore constriction and blocking occur at nom loadings 50 mg c g which reduces the internal diffusivity by a factor of 10 or less li et al 2003 to et al 2008a therefore the ac fouling observed in our study could be related to the nom loading in addition considering the results of previous studies that reported that coagulation treatment ho and newcombe 2005 and coating the outer surface of pac with coagulant sidney seckler et al 2013 slowed the rate of external mass transfer of trace contaminants to the pac surface and that incorporation of pac into floc particles did not inhibit external mass transfer altmann et al 2015 this may also be related to the addition of coagulant pacl which was used to remove nom and attenuate membrane fouling chen et al 2020 matsui et al 2009b furthermore the better model fit obtained with setting f changing d p over setting g changing k f in our study suggests that the intraparticle pore diffusion has been retarded more severely than external mass transfer in this way the ac fouling led to a decrease in the rate of mib removal in the smhs pac spac although the fouling prevented and delayed desorption of previously adsorbed mib when the influent mib concentration decreased 3 2 4 analysis by the model simulation the removal rate depends on the ac dosage but in order to investigate how the desorption rate changes with the ac dosage the experimental and simulation results are summarized in fig 8 both the mib desorption ratio and the mib remaining proportion effluent influent concentration decreased as the ac dosage was increased these results can be interpreted as indicating that the lower the mib removal rate was during the contamination period and the more breakthrough that was detected in the effluent during that period the higher the mib desorption ratio was during the no contamination period because desorption is caused by an inverse concentration gradient it seems reasonable to expect that the absolute amount of desorption became high when the effluent concentration was high however the important point is that the ratio of the amounts of desorbed and adsorbed mib becomes higher with higher effluent concentration therefore when the influent concentration dropped and remained at low levels the smhs ac with a low mib removal rate had the disadvantages of having not only a high effluent concentration but also a high desorption ratio in such a case the ac in the smhs should be drained in particular when the remaining adsorption capacity of the ac is low which leads to low adsorptive removal of micropollutants this operational strategy is also important when ac is used for sporadic contaminant episodes such as algae blooms and industrial spills 4 conclusions in a hybrid system that combines ac adsorption with a submerged membrane filtration we found that the micropollutant mib desorbed from the ac when the influent mib concentration decreased and desorption was accelerated by the presence of nom in the influent approximately 20 40 of the mib that adsorbed on the ac during the first 6 h of the test was released over the course of the first 6 h after the mib containing water was replaced with natural water when the effluent mib concentration was high and the mib removal rate just prior to the no contamination period was low the desorbed adsorbed mib ratio and the absolute amount of mib desorption were high these results indicate that the ac in the submerged membrane tank should be replaced while the breakthrough concentration is low the mib adsorption desorption performances of pac and spac in the smhs were well described by a two component mib and ebc bpkm with the implicit assumption of 100 adsorption desorption reversibility the model fitting indicated that intraparticle diffusivity decreased largely over the course of a few hours of smhs operation this decrease in intraparticle diffusivity was expected to lead to earlier mib breakthrough by decreasing the adsorption rate and it also reduced the desorption rate of preadsorbed mib and suppressed the effluent concentration when the influent mib concentration decreased a given dose of spac showed almost the same adsorption desorption kinetics as a pac dose that was twice as high reduction in the ac particle size contributed to faster mib adsorption and desorption even though the adsorption capacities of the two different acs were the same the 2 fold difference between spac and pac was smaller than the previously reported 4 fold difference observed for a pressurized membrane filtration system a result that we attributed to the relatively longer ac detention time in the submerged membrane tank of the smhs coagulation pretreatment removed most of the nom but it did not influence competitive adsorption of mib and nom consequently the concentration of the ebc was almost the same before and after coagulation pretreatment which indicates that the ebc was not removed by coagulation however the intraparticle diffusivity of mib in ac decreased significantly with time in coagulant treated nom water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

16467,solar energy enabled photocatalysis is promising for wastewater treatment however due to the changes in the solar position and variable weather conditions providing optimized light and temperature for photocatalysis under actual weather remains to be a technical difficulty in this study a novel linear fresnel photoreactor lfp was firstly developed for wastewater treatment lfp could achieve effective adjustment of sunlight by flexibly controlling 6 mirrors according to solar position and weather conditions on sunny condition lfp could maintain the optimal light irradiance and temperature while on overcast condition it could provide the highest possible light irradiance and temperature in the comparative experiments between lfp and inclined plate collector ipc as control reactor which passively receive sunlight the rhodamine b degradation efficiencies in lfp were 2 19 folds 1 5 folds and 2 28 folds higher than control under the temporarily overcast totally to slightly overcast and sunny conditions respectively in addition the efficiencies of amoxicillin degradation and escherichia coli disinfection in lfp were also 2 folds and 1 37 folds higher than control in sunny conditions respectively furthermore whole year estimation indicated that lfp is effective to optimize light irradiance and temperature in typical densely populated areas of the world to achieve high efficiency wastewater treatment these results proved that lfp as an effective solar energy controllable reactor has great potential in promoting the development of green wastewater treatment

wastewater treatment actual weather whole year estimation 1 introduction with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization the wastewater containing refractory organic pollutants such as dyes and antibiotics and the pathogenic microorganisms has increasingly become a worldwide problem which posing a great threat to public health bergamonti et al 2019 skjolding et al 2021 white et al 2021 under such circumstances united nations have proposed the sustainable development goal sdg 6 which aims to obtain safe and affordable drinking water improve water quality and strengthen the wastewater treatment infrastructure mraz et al 2021 the appeal of united nations has compelled the researchers to identify the advanced wastewater treatment technologies with high efficiency economic feasibility and environmental friendliness to improve global public health and achieve sustainable development in the past few decades photocatalytic technology has shown the application potential in wastewater treatment under the illumination of light source da costa filho et al 2019 solar energy as an infinite and widely distributed energy could provide light and heat for photocatalysis therefore solar is considered to be an ideal light source for photocatalysis carbajo et al 2016 for improving the photocatalytic efficiency under sunlight previous studies have explored the optimal light and temperature conditions reuterg ardh et al 1997 stated that the temperature between 30 and 60 desired photocatalysis and the reaction rate increased with the light irradiance reuterg ardh and iangphasuk 1997 herrmann 2005 reported that the temperature within 20 80 would desire the photocatalytic efficiency and too high light irradiance may lead to the decreased reaction rate due to the fast electron hole recombination therefore for achieving high efficiency photocatalysis under the optimal light and temperature optimal solar energy controlling is indispensable spasiano et al 2015 however under actual conditions due to the change of the solar position and the blocking of solar radiation reaching the ground by different cloud amounts providing optimized light and temperature for realizing high efficiency photocatalytic reaction under real sunlight is still a challenge pichat 2019 so far some researchers have attempted to provide photocatalysis with solar energy by manufacturing photoreactors wang et al 2021 due to the successful application of parabolic reflectors in solar thermal engineering it is not surprising that parabolic reflectors were the basis of the oldest photocatalytic reactor designs namely parabolic trough reflector ptr braham and harris 2009 the main components of ptr include a parabolic mirror installed on a rotating platform to concentrate sunlight macedo valencia et al 2014 malato et al 2002 however photocatalytic tests revealed many insurmountable shortcomings of ptr in the photocatalytic field braham and harris 2009 foremost is that ptr converges excessively high light irradiance and temperature on sunny days thereby reducing the photocatalytic efficiency macedo valencia et al 2014 malato et al 2002 in addition ptr lacks the ability to use diffused light which limits the photocatalytic activity in cloudy days braham and harris 2009 therefore ptr cannot optimize light irradiance and temperature for photocatalysis under actual weather moreover the complicated control system and the parabolic mirror of ptr led to the high cost thereby causing difficulties in the photocatalytic application braham and harris 2009 due to the above shortcomings ptr were widely judged as intrinsically flawed design braham and harris 2009 wang et al 2021 following these early studies of ptr simple and low cost photocatalytic reactors have been developed such as inclined plate collector ipc ipc adopts an inclined plate for receiving solar radiation on which the photocatalyst is immobilized or flows down with wastewater in powder form chan et al 2003 gernjak et al 2004 liu et al 2013 this simple and low cost design has seen ipc enjoy widespread use in research installations in addition some ipc based wastewater treatment plants have been actually established braham and harris 2009 wang et al 2021 and ipc may be the only type that has entered the practical stage so far for example ipc was reported to treat the wastewater from a textile plant bousselmi et al 2004 pichat et al 2004 also reported a corrugated ipc for treating pesticides found in tractor cisterns at vineyards the above examples proved that ipc is indeed a configuration entering the practical stage however ipc also has shortcomings in practical applications since ipc is fixedly installed on the ground it can only passively receive sunlight when facing the solar motion and different weather ipc provides the photocatalysis with variable and non optimized light and temperature which limits the performance to improve the photocatalytic activity the shortcomings of ipc s passive receiving of solar energy need to be overcome therefore the active solar energy controllable photoreactor is needed to optimize the light irradiance and temperature the linear fresnel lf is traditionally applied in the field of solar thermal engineering for heating and power generation beltagy et al 2017 sebastián et al 2018 the structure mainly includes the segmented flat mirrors and the light receiver located above the mirrors the mirrors are closely aligned with each other in the north south orientation mirrors rotate under the computer control system according to the solar position thereby solar rays could be reflected and accurately converged onto the light receiver due to the low cost of flat mirror and single axis control system lf is generally considered to have superior economic efficiency for solar energy collection kumar et al 2017 roostaee and ameri 2019 therefore lf could also have great potential in providing solar energy for photocatalysis however for the utilization of lf in the traditional solar energy collection all of its mirrors concentrating the solar light to achieve extremely high light irradiance and hundreds of degrees celsius bellos et al 2018 at such a high light irradiance fast electron hole recombination rate would lead to the reduced reaction rate herrmann 2005 in addition high temperature would lead to the vigorous boiling of wastewater and cause influence on pipeline structure bucur and isbǎşoiu 2008 hence providing optimized solar energy for photocatalysis remains a challenge in designing lf based photoreactors it is worth noting that the number and operation of the mirrors determine the amount of solar energy collected in lf barbón et al 2019 bellos 2019 if lf has suitable number of mirrors that can be flexibly controlled according to solar motion and weather it is possible to effectively optimize the light irradiance and temperature by controlling solar energy under actual sunlight according to our best knowledge until now no lf has been modified and applied in photocatalysis yet therefore in this research a novel linear fresnel photoreactor lfp capable of controlling solar energy was developed for the first time the wastewater treatment performances of lfp were investigated against the ipc as the control reactor under real sunlight the organic dye of rhodamine b rh b the antibiotic of amoxicillin amx and the pathogenic bacteria of escherichia coli e coli were used as the wastewater models furthermore the whole year light and temperature conditions of lfp and ipc were estimated according to the real meteorological data in 2019 of tsukuba area 2 materials and methods 2 1 identification of the optimal solar light irradiance and reaction temperature as aforementioned in the introduction for solar light driven photocatalytic technology light irradiance and temperature are two key factors affecting its efficiency da costa filho et al 2019 as such in this study the optimal light irradiance and temperature for achieving high photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency was identified the tio2 coated silica gel beads hqc 21 obtained from sinto v ceracs japan were adopted as photocatalyst table s1 which could only be excited by uv light hence the optimal uv irradiance and temperature were identified using a simulated solar lamp and the details were shown in supplementary 1 1 2 2 determination of lfp mirror number since the linear fresnel structure adjusts the light irradiance and temperature through the reflection of sunlight by mirrors barbón et al 2019 bellos 2019 the number of mirrors determines the lfp s ability to control solar energy the increased mirror number would enhance the time length which ensure that the uv irradiance was stabilized at the optimal range while increased mirror number would also lead to a surge in the mirror cost therefore it is necessary to balance the relationship between the mirror number and the mirror cost the lfp models with different mirror number ranging from 2 to 10 were made by freecad software li et al 2018 since the daily solar conditions are different throughout the year the winter solstice as the day with the worst solar irradiation conditions of the year was chosen as the day for studying the mirror number if lfp could effectively optimize the uv irradiance on the winter solstice it could theoretically optimize the uv irradiance throughout the year the solar conditions in tsukuba area on the winter solstice was simulated by using otsun software cardona and pujol nadal 2020 to simulate the sunlight conditions the solar light irradiance and position on the sky were calculated according to a solar earth illumination model fig s2 considering the complexity of the sun earth revolution system and different weather conditions several simplifications was adopted 1 regarding the sunlight that reaches the earth is parallel light 2 ignoring the precession of the earth dehant et al 2017 3 considering the earth as a standard sphere 4 ignoring the shielding effect of the earth s atmosphere on solar radiation based on the above settings solar conditions on the winter solstice were determined shown in supplementary 1 2 2 3 manufacturing of lfp and control reactor ipc the manufacturing of lfp was based on the determined mirror number to meet the goal of laboratory scale maximum treatment of 1 l solution all parts of lfp were purchased from the internet or local supermarkets and assembled in the laboratory according to the blueprint the program operation of lfp to control solar energy was based on mature arduino system arduino uno rev3 and arduino cnc shield v3 mainboard to control stepper motors bipolar nema 17 kondaveeti et al 2021 arduino is an open source code c language compilation software for obtaining high control accuracy inclined plate collector ipc a typical photoreactor passively receiving solar light was used as the control reactor chan et al 2003 2 4 light and temperature measurement the uv meter custom uv 340 detection range 290 nm to 390 nm and the pyranometer li 200r detection range 400 nm to 1100 nm were used as the light sensors in lfp and ipc to detect uv energy and visible light energy respectively three thermocouples tandd tr 71wf were used as the temperature sensors for detecting and recording the ambient temperature and the reaction temperature in lfp and ipc respectively the details of the layout information and data processing methods of the light sensor and temperature sensor during the experiment were shown in the supplementary 1 3 2 5 water heating experiment the water heating experiment was conducted to investigate the capability of lfp and ipc to control solar light irradiance and reaction temperature and to verify the correctness of the lfp structural design and program system this experiment was carried out on a typical sunny day 2020 01 10 1000 ml water was used to flow in the circulation loop in lfp and ipc respectively the uv light irradiance visible light irradiance and water temperature were measured every 30 min and recorded 2 6 photocatalytic degradation and disinfection experiments rh b was used as the model of organic dye and ordered from wako pure chemical industries ltd osaka japan amx were used as the model of antibiotic and ordered from sigma aldrich co ltd louisiana usa the e coli was isolated from matsumi lake of university of tsukuba tsukuba japan using xm g agar medium and chosen as the microorganism model in the disinfection experiments the degradation experiments of rh b 1000 ml 2 mg l 1 were carried out under different weather conditions in the winter of 2020 and the autumn of 2021 respectively rh b concentration was measured by the spectrophotometer uv 1600 shimadzu japan at the wavelength of 554 nm the toc variation of rh b was analyzed by total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the degradation of amx 300 ml 10 mg l 1 and disinfection of e coli 300 ml 3 5 104 cfu ml 1 were carried out under sunny condition in the winter of 2020 respectively the concentration of amx was determined by a hplc jasco his 1500 equipped with a c18 reverse phase column cosmosil 5c18 ar ii 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm at 60 the mobile phase was a hybrid solution of 60 kh2po4 0 025 m in ultrapure water and 40 acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 50 ml min 1 detection was performed at 228 nm with an uv vis detector jasco uv 1570 the preparation of e coli solution refers to previous investigation liu et al 2019 the concentration of e coli was calculated by the standard plate count method 2 7 whole year estimation of light and temperature conditions in tsukuba area lfp and ipc were assumed to treat 1000 ml of wastewater to estimate the 2019 whole year uv irradiance and reaction temperature for the estimation of light irradiance in photoreactors the optical models of lfp and ipc were created by freecad software with high accuracy and imported into otsun software to study the daily solar energy provided by the photoreactors in 2019 the data used to establish the daily sunlight conditions in the otsun software were collected from the japan meteorological agency jma 2021 after that the reaction temperature in lfp and ipc was calculated the reaction temperature was determined by the received light irradiance the ambient temperature and the conversion ratio of solar energy to internal energy η the solar energy received by lfp and ipc was obtained from the above estimation of lighting condition the ambient temperature in tsukuba area in 2019 was also summarized from the japan meteorological agency jma 2021 the conversion ratio of solar energy to internal energy η for two reactors were used to calculate the energy used for increasing the reaction temperature it was calculated based on the conversion process of solar energy and internal energy in lfp and ipc as shown in the supplementary 1 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal uv light irradiance and temperature fig 1 a showed the effect of uv irradiance on photocatalytic reaction when the uv irradiance increased from 0 to 24 w m 2 the degradation rate dramatically increased from 41 to 89 however after uv irradiance increased from 24 to 40 w m 2 almost no further improvement was observed hence the solar uv irradiance at the range of 24 40 w m 2 was found to be the optimal uv condition for photocatalysis fig 1b showed the effect of reaction temperature on photocatalytic reaction the degradation rate increased when the reaction temperature increased from 5 to 55 then almost the same highest degradation rate was achieved at 55 65 although the degradation rate decreased slightly when the temperature further increased to 75 95 it was still much higher than that at low temperature of 5 25 therefore in general the increase in reaction temperature was beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction however when the reaction temperature reached and exceeded 65 the number of bubbles increased dramatically and the bubbles began to merge with each other to form the gas column fig s7 in the actual engineering the large amount of air in the liquid circulation loop will accelerate the corrosion and aging of pipeline and water pump bucur and isbǎşoiu 2008 therefore for improving the photocatalytic efficiency while reduce the negative effects of bubbles on the system operation the photocatalytic reaction temperature should be increased but below 65 based on the above results to achieve high efficiency photocatalytic wastewater treatment process lfp was required to provide uv irradiance of 24 40 w m 2 and increase the reaction temperature while ensuring that it is below 65 as such the following lfp structural design and control program compilation were based on the above requirements and the geographic location of tsukuba area fig s3 3 2 optimal mirror number of lfp fig 2 a showed the relationship between the mirror number and the optimal uv duration 2 mirrors could only achieve the optimal uv irradiance from 11 12 to 12 01 4 mirrors further increased the optimal uv duration from 9 21 to 13 51 compared with 2 and 4 mirrors 6 mirrors significantly extended the duration from 7 59 to 15 12 further increasing the mirror number from 6 to 10 only slightly increased the optimal uv duration other research reported that as the number of mirrors in the linear fresnel increases the light occlusion between the mirrors would become serious thus limiting the promotion of light concentration capacity moghimi et al 2017 to determine the optimal mirror number in lfp the mirrors cost and the optimal uv duration were comprehensively considered the relationship between the optimal uv duration and mirror cost were shown in fig 2b the mirror cost increased proportionally with the increase in the mirror number assuming the price of one mirror is 1 when the mirror number increased from 2 to 6 optimal uv duration and mirror cost increased at the similar rate when the mirror number increased from 6 to 10 the increase rate of mirror cost was much higher than that of optimal uv duration therefore from the perspective of the mirror cost and light gathering performance 6 was found to be the optimal mirror number for lfp 3 3 structure and control system of lfp the structure of lfp was shown in fig 2c in the lfp 6 mirrors were compactly mounted on the pedestal of the reactor and could be individually driven by 6 stepper motors the reaction tubes were filled with tio2 coated beads and located above the mirrors to receive the reflected solar light wastewater flowed in the reaction tubes and was driven by the peristaltic pump the specifications and layout of lfp during the experiments was shown in the supplementary 1 5 for achieving effective optimization of uv energy and temperature under real weather conditions the control system of lfp were designed fig 3 described the flow chart of lfp control system the sunny working mode would be executed under sunny condition to maintain the optimal uv irradiance of 24 40 w m 2 while control the temperature below 65 as expressed in the timing chart fig s12 under the sunny working mode more mirrors will be driven to track and reflect sunlight in the morning and afternoon while fewer mirrors will be driven at noon the and in this chart represent six mirrors of lfp with different working status the means this mirror is tracking and reflecting the sunlight to the reaction tubes while represent this mirror is idle under such control lfp could provide the optimal uv and temperature in sunny weather on cloudy days when the sun is severely blocked the cloudy working mode will be executed that is all mirrors will work to achieve as high light irradiance and temperature as possible the above two working modes ensure that the 6 mirrors of lfp could provide optimized uv light and reaction temperature for the photocatalyst under various weather conditions thereby laying the foundation for the efficient wastewater treatment process after completing the design of the lfp the ipc as the control was also designed the layout of the ipc was shown in the supplementary 1 5 3 4 verification of the correctness of lfp design the correctness of the lfp structural design and the program system was verified through the water heating experiment from 8 00 to 14 00 on a sunny day 2020 01 10 the variation of uv irradiance was shown in fig 4 a at 8 00 in the morning the sunlight was almost parallel to the ground resulting in a very low environmental uv irradiance of 2 w m 2 on the ground due to the oblique incidence of the sunlight in the winter season the environmental uv irradiance was only 13 w m 2 at noon and gradually weakened at afternoon for lfp since its 6 mirrors could change the light direction the uv irradiance in lfp reached the optimal uv range around 25 w m 2 even at the early time of 8 00 in the morning therefore 6 mirrors in lfp are effective to provide optimal uv light in the early morning when the solar altitude is low from 8 00 to 12 00 when the solar altitude increased the number of mirrors that track and reflect the sunlight was reduced to maintain the optimal uv irradiance 25 29 w m 2 it is worth noting that lfp maintained the optimal uv level by increasing the number of mirrors that track and reflect sunlight when the sun s altitude dropped in the afternoon hence the control system of lfp could drive mirrors to effectively control the solar energy for maintaining the optimal uv irradiance while for the ipc it only received 5 w m 2 uv irradiance at 8 00 and 22 w m 2 at noon which was not only far below the optimal uv range but also changed drastically the variation of visible light irradiance and temperature were shown in fig 4b on this day from 8 00 to 14 00 the environmental visible light irradiance varied from 120 to 480 w m 2 and the ambient temperature changed between 12 and 22 under the active control of solar energy by lfp the visible light irradiance was stabilized at about 1000 w m 2 while the visible light in ipc varied dramatically over time and the highest irradiance was only about 800 w m 2 therefore lfp was much more effective than ipc in providing solar energy the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar was used for comparing the solar energy control capability of lfp and ipc δesolar could be calculated as eq 1 1 δ e solar e solar t operation where the solar energy esolar provided by photoreactor could be calculated by integrating the solar light irradiance i that reached the reaction tube areaction tube as eq 2 2 e solar i t a reac tion tube dt after calculation the δesolar of lfp was 0 585 kj min 1 and much higher than the 0 372 kj min 1 of ipc which led to the higher reaction temperature of lfp 33 than ipc 27 for more effectively promoting photocatalytic activity fig 4b therefore the lfp design was proven to be effective in controlling solar energy for optimizing uv irradiance and reaction temperature and the higher photocatalytic efficiency in lfp compared to ipc could be expected 3 5 degradation of rh b under different weather conditions 3 5 1 temporarily overcast condition the organic pollutant degradation experiment for treating rh b was firstly carried out from 11 50 to 13 20 on a temporarily overcast day 2020 01 21 fig 5 a showed the variation of uv irradiance during this time the environmental uv irradiance gradually varied from 15 to 13 w m 2 when the sunlight was blocked by clouds at 12 10 and 12 30 the environmental uv irradiance dropped to only 3 w m 2 and 7 w m 2 respectively as for the lfp when the sun was not blocked by clouds it operated the sunny working mode to maintain the optimal uv irradiance 24 29 w m 2 when the sunlight was blocked lfp switched to the cloudy working mode and all of 6 mirrors were driven to reflect sunlight under such control although cloud blocked a lot of direct sunlight at the 12 10 the uv irradiance provided by lfp still reached 10 w m 2 which was much optimized than the environmental uv irradiance 3 w m 2 at around 12 30 since the clouds were thinner and more direct solar light could penetrate the cloud the uv irradiance in lfp reached 20 w m 2 which was close to the optimal uv range 24 40 w m 2 while the highest uv irradiance in ipc was only 21 w m 2 when it was sunny and 7 11 w m 2 when the sunlight was blocked hence through the flexible switch between the sunny and cloudy working modes lfp could effectively optimize uv irradiance under the temporarily overcast condition through the adjustment of sunlight the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar in lfp reached 0 513 kj min 1 much higher than the 0 355 kj min 1 in ipc table 1 therefore the increase in reaction temperature in lfp from 19 to 30 was not affected by the temporary obscuration of sunlight by clouds fig 5b while the temperature increase in ipc was significantly affected by weather changes its reaction temperature even dropped during the overcast period from 12 20 to 12 30 above results indicated that lfp could not only optimize the uv irradiance and temperature for the photocatalysis on sunny condition but also promote the reaction process under overcast period the rh b degradation results were shown in fig 5c the k value of rh b degradation was calculated according to the first order reaction model eq 3 and summarized in table 1 3 ln c t c 0 kt the k value of rh b degradation in lfp reached 0 059 min 1 which was 2 19 folds higher than ipc 0 027 min 1 the rapid degradation could be due to the favorable uv and temperature in lfp reuterg ardh et al 1997 and sharma et al 2020 also reported the appropriate increase in light irradiance and temperature could be beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction therefore through the active control of solar energy the high efficiency wastewater treatment process in lfp would be less susceptible to the fluctuations of natural sunlight in the temporarily cloudy weather 3 5 2 totally overcast to slightly overcast condition the effect of lfp s solar energy track and control on the enhancement of photocatalytic reaction efficiency under the extreme weather conditions was also studied the rh b degradation experiment in lfp and ipc was carried out on a day 2020 02 13 from 10 10 to 11 40 with the weather changed from totally overcast to slightly overcast from fig 6 a even the sunlight was severely blocked by dark clouds 10 10 10 20 through all mirrors working the uv irradiance in lfp 1 4 w m 2 was also higher than ipc 1 0 w m 2 thereby promoting the photocatalytic activity more effectively when the weather was turning to clear from 10 20 to 11 10 as the cloud gradually thinned and dissipated more and more sunlight arrived the reactors making the uv irradiance in lfp rose rapidly lfp achieved the uv irradiance over 24 w m 2 from 10 37 when the sunlight was still partially blocked by cloud however ipc only received 8 w m 2 of uv irradiance at 10 37 and its highest uv irradiance was only 23 w m 2 even after the weather turned to clear under such process the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar of 0 409 kj min 1 was achieved by lfp which was higher than the 0 329 kj min 1 in ipc table 1 the change of reaction temperature in lfp and ipc was shown in fig 6b due to the more solar energy was provided in lfp even during the totally overcast period from 10 10 to 10 20 the reaction temperature in lfp was still 0 2 higher than ipc when the sky was gradually becoming clear from 10 20 to 11 40 the reaction temperature of lfp increased rapidly to 32 c which was much faster than ipc thereby effectively promoting the photocatalytic efficiency fig 6c showed the degradation results of rh b it is worth noting that even when the sunlight was almost completely blocked 10 10 10 20 the optimized uv irradiance and temperature in lfp also led to the more efficient rh b degradation process than ipc the k value of rh b degradation in lfp reached 0 027 min 1 which was 1 5 folds higher than that of 0 018 min 1 in ipc table 1 higher photocatalytic degradation of rh b in lfp might be ascribed to effectively extended the time length with the optimal uv conditions besides more desirable temperature in lfp should also be benefit to photocatalytic process under the erratic weather condition therefore lfp could effectively improve the wastewater treatment efficiency even with severely overcast condition 3 5 3 sunny condition then the rh b degradation performance of lfp and ipc were studied on a typical sunny day 2020 03 01 to prove that lfp could maintain the optimal uv conditions and suitable temperature throughout the sunny days experiments were sequentially carried out in three typical time periods sunrise 7 30 9 00 morning 10 00 11 30 and noon 12 00 13 30 as shown in fig 7 a from 7 30 to 13 30 lfp could always provide the optimal uv irradiance 24 31 w m 2 which was much optimized than ipc 10 24 w m 2 during each experimental period the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar of lfp could be maintained in the range of 0 535 0 579 kj min 1 which was much higher than the 0 253 0 416 kj min 1 in ipc table 1 therefore the reaction temperature in lfp during different time periods were 12 27 19 31 and 20 32 which could be more beneficial to photocatalysis than ipc 12 20 19 24 and 20 26 fig 7b fig 7c showed the rh b degradation results during sunrise morning and noon the k values of rh b degradation at sunrise morning and noon in lfp were 0 060 min 1 0 064 min 1 and 0 065 min 1 respectively which were 2 73 folds 2 13 folds and 1 97 folds higher than that of ipc table 1 it could be seen that the improvement of efficiency at sunrise 2 73 folds was higher than that at noon 1 97 folds hence lfp could more effectively improve the photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency when the natural light conditions are weak from above results the average promotion of rh b degradation efficiency in lfp was 2 28 folds higher than ipc under the sunny condition the above experiments basically covered all kinds of weather based on the results the organic degradation efficiencies of lfp and ipc could be evaluated and compared for the all weather conditions in the tsukuba area to achieve this goal weathers have been classified according to the hourly average solar light irradiance based on the data from the japan meteorological agency four types of weather were defined separately typical sunny condition average irradiance 700 w m 2 slightly overcast condition average irradiance 200 699 w m 2 temporarily overcast condition average irradiance 50 199 w m 2 and totally overcast condition average irradiance 0 49 w m 2 fig s13 showed the percentage of different weather durations in the tsukuba area from 2017 to 2019 it could be seen that in tsukuba area temporarily overcast weather accounts for 17 46 slightly and totally overcast condition together account for 56 08 and sunny weather accounts for 26 46 jma 2021 meanwhile the degradation efficiencies of lfp under different weather conditions were 2 19 folds temporarily overcast 1 5 folds slightly and totally overcast and 2 28 folds typical sunny higher than ipc therefore the all weather rh b degradation efficiency in lfp including temporarily overcast slightly and totally overcast and typical sunny was estimated averagely to be 1 83 folds higher than that of ipc hence lfp could significantly improve the photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency through solar energy control under all weather conditions 3 6 degradation of amx and disinfection of e coli to further verify the treatment capacity of the developed lfp for antibiotics and bacteria the treatment experiments of amx and e coli were also carried out the degradation of amx was conducted from 8 40 to 12 40 on a sunny day 2020 02 12 fig 8 a b showed that under the control of sunny working mode the uv irradiance 24 27 w m 2 and the temperature 35 in lfp were mush optimized than the uv irradiance 9 24 w m 2 and temperature 29 in ipc as seen in fig 8c the 40 reduction in amx concentration was achieved by lfp which was a great improvement compared to ipc 21 reduction the k value of amx degradation was calculated according to the first order reaction model eq 3 and the k value in lfp 0 002 min 1 was 2 folds higher than in ipc 0 001 min 1 table 1 in addition as watkinson et al 2009 reported the antibiotics concentration was only 64 μg l 1 in actual wastewater which was significantly lower than the 10 mg l 1 amx used in this study lfp should have high efficiency in the antibiotics treatment in actual wastewater subsequently the disinfection experiment of e coli was conducted from 8 00 to 13 00 on february 23 2020 although the weather was clear strong winds occurred from 11 00 to 11 10 fig 9 a showed lfp maintained the optimal uv irradiance around 24 w m 2 for the photocatalytic sterilization process from morning to afternoon while the uv irradiance of ipc varied dramatically 9 to 23 w m 2 fig 9b showed that from 10 40 to 11 10 the strong wind caused a significant drop in the ambient temperature although the lowering of the ambient temperature also caused a drop in the reaction temperature in lfp due to the effective solar energy control by lfp the reaction temperature quickly returned to 32 after the wind weakened at 11 10 for ipc due to passively received less solar energy the reaction temperature only recovered to 24 fig 9c showed the disinfection results of e coli the 2 6 log reduction of e coli was observed after 5 h in lfp which was much higher than that in ipc 1 9 log reduction according to the reports the disinfection process could be fitted with weibull deactivation function ouyang et al 2016 rodríguez chueca et al 2020 based on this the calculated k value of e coli disinfection in lfp 0 019 min 1 was 1 37 folds higher than ipc 0 014 min 1 table 1 this result may be due to the optimized uv irradiance and temperature in lfp sharma et al 2020 also reported that the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency increased with the appropriate increase of light irradiance and temperature in addition considering in real water bodies the bacterial concentration usually does not exceed 103 cfu ml 1 which is lower than the concentration in this study liu et al 2021 this indicates that lfp could be more efficient in the actual water treatment therefore lfp should be efficient in eliminating pathogenic bacteria in water bodies and improving the quality of drinking water through the active control of solar energy 3 7 estimation of the uv irradiance and reaction temperature at tsukuba area for one year the above results proved that lfp could optimize uv irradiance and reaction temperature for the photocatalyst through active tracking and control of sunlight thereby achieving high efficiency wastewater treatment efficiency furthermore based on the actual geographic location and weather data of the tsukuba area the uv irradiance and temperature in lfp throughout 2019 were estimated the uv irradiance and temperature conditions provided by two reactors from 5 00 to 19 00 daily in tsukuba area were estimated to further compare the performance of lfp and ipc in the whole year time 2019 fig 10 a showed the irradiance of natural uv light perpendicular to the ground it could be seen that the natural uv has been changing due to the daily movement of the solar position and different day in the year comparing with natural condition although the inclined mirror plate of ipc could slightly enhance the uv light irradiance it was still much lower than the optimal uv range of 24 40 w m 2 in most year time fig 10b as for lfp it was obvious that after the adjustment of sunlight the uv irradiance in lfp was significantly optimized compared to ipc fig 10c lfp could achieve the optimal uv irradiance over 24 w m 2 in the sunny periods even under the cloudy condition lfp could also provide the uv light irradiance as high as possible therefore lfp was expected to effectively optimize the uv irradiance throughout the year to effectively active the photocatalyst fig 10d showed that the environmental temperature in tsukuba area usually has its lowest value at sunrise time of the day and then gradually rose as the solar altitude increases the highest environmental temperature generally occurs around 14 00 and then decreased as the solar altitude dropped for the tsukuba area in 2019 the highest ambient temperature was 35 5 for ipc its reaction temperature was not much improved compared to the environmental temperature and the highest temperature in ipc was only 39 5 fig 10e while for lfp fig 10f through the solar energy control its reaction temperature rose much faster than ipc the highest reaction temperature for lfp appeared on august 2 at 52 which was lower than the 65 therefore while lfp raises the reaction temperature for promoting photocatalytic activity it also reduces system damage caused by excessively high temperature through the control of solar energy thereby ensuring the long term effectiveness of the system the above results illustrated that lfp could effectively optimize the light and temperature conditions in different weather conditions throughout the year at the tsukuba area therefore high efficiency photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency of lfp at tsukuba could be expected in addition not only at the tsukuba area but also in sapporo 43 0 n 141 4 e ishigakijima 24 6 n 124 3 e and some typical densely populated areas of the world latitude range 24 6 n 43 0 n lfp also demonstrated its global applicability and feasibility shown in the supplementary 1 6 meanwhile the long term applicability of lfp and its strong mineralization ability of organic pollutants have also been confirmed shown in the supplementary 1 7 moreover since linear fresnel lf was widely considered to be one of the most cost effective and easy operation structures in solar thermal engineering bellos et al 2018 roostaee and ameri 2019 lfp should also have an impressive affordability for photocatalysis the economic evaluation of lfp also confirmed that lfp has superior cost affordability in practical wastewater treatment applications shown in the supplementary 1 8 which is undoubtedly beneficial to the application of lfp in the future furthermore the low gravity center of lf endowed lfp with high resistance to windy weather el gharbi et al 2011 the results of this study suggest that lfp is an efficient solar energy controllable system with great application potential in photocatalytic wastewater treatment the novel lfp design could promote the development of green wastewater treatment infrastructure worldwide to improve global public health and achieve eco friendly society 4 conclusions in this research a novel lfp was firstly developed and applied to photocatalytic wastewater treatment under actual weather the optimal 6 column mirrors and program system of lfp ensured its effective tracking and controlling of real solar light for providing optimized light irradiance and temperature to photocatalyst compared with the control reactor ipc lfp exhibited much higher photocatalytic treatment efficiency for organic dye antibiotic and microorganism under actual weather conditions furthermore the results of whole year estimation indicated that lfp has the capability to optimize the uv irradiance and reaction temperature effectively throughout the year therefore as an extremely promising real sunlight track and control reactor lfp could have great potential in the practical photocatalytic wastewater treatment process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16467,solar energy enabled photocatalysis is promising for wastewater treatment however due to the changes in the solar position and variable weather conditions providing optimized light and temperature for photocatalysis under actual weather remains to be a technical difficulty in this study a novel linear fresnel photoreactor lfp was firstly developed for wastewater treatment lfp could achieve effective adjustment of sunlight by flexibly controlling 6 mirrors according to solar position and weather conditions on sunny condition lfp could maintain the optimal light irradiance and temperature while on overcast condition it could provide the highest possible light irradiance and temperature in the comparative experiments between lfp and inclined plate collector ipc as control reactor which passively receive sunlight the rhodamine b degradation efficiencies in lfp were 2 19 folds 1 5 folds and 2 28 folds higher than control under the temporarily overcast totally to slightly overcast and sunny conditions respectively in addition the efficiencies of amoxicillin degradation and escherichia coli disinfection in lfp were also 2 folds and 1 37 folds higher than control in sunny conditions respectively furthermore whole year estimation indicated that lfp is effective to optimize light irradiance and temperature in typical densely populated areas of the world to achieve high efficiency wastewater treatment these results proved that lfp as an effective solar energy controllable reactor has great potential in promoting the development of green wastewater treatment

wastewater treatment actual weather whole year estimation 1 introduction with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization the wastewater containing refractory organic pollutants such as dyes and antibiotics and the pathogenic microorganisms has increasingly become a worldwide problem which posing a great threat to public health bergamonti et al 2019 skjolding et al 2021 white et al 2021 under such circumstances united nations have proposed the sustainable development goal sdg 6 which aims to obtain safe and affordable drinking water improve water quality and strengthen the wastewater treatment infrastructure mraz et al 2021 the appeal of united nations has compelled the researchers to identify the advanced wastewater treatment technologies with high efficiency economic feasibility and environmental friendliness to improve global public health and achieve sustainable development in the past few decades photocatalytic technology has shown the application potential in wastewater treatment under the illumination of light source da costa filho et al 2019 solar energy as an infinite and widely distributed energy could provide light and heat for photocatalysis therefore solar is considered to be an ideal light source for photocatalysis carbajo et al 2016 for improving the photocatalytic efficiency under sunlight previous studies have explored the optimal light and temperature conditions reuterg ardh et al 1997 stated that the temperature between 30 and 60 desired photocatalysis and the reaction rate increased with the light irradiance reuterg ardh and iangphasuk 1997 herrmann 2005 reported that the temperature within 20 80 would desire the photocatalytic efficiency and too high light irradiance may lead to the decreased reaction rate due to the fast electron hole recombination therefore for achieving high efficiency photocatalysis under the optimal light and temperature optimal solar energy controlling is indispensable spasiano et al 2015 however under actual conditions due to the change of the solar position and the blocking of solar radiation reaching the ground by different cloud amounts providing optimized light and temperature for realizing high efficiency photocatalytic reaction under real sunlight is still a challenge pichat 2019 so far some researchers have attempted to provide photocatalysis with solar energy by manufacturing photoreactors wang et al 2021 due to the successful application of parabolic reflectors in solar thermal engineering it is not surprising that parabolic reflectors were the basis of the oldest photocatalytic reactor designs namely parabolic trough reflector ptr braham and harris 2009 the main components of ptr include a parabolic mirror installed on a rotating platform to concentrate sunlight macedo valencia et al 2014 malato et al 2002 however photocatalytic tests revealed many insurmountable shortcomings of ptr in the photocatalytic field braham and harris 2009 foremost is that ptr converges excessively high light irradiance and temperature on sunny days thereby reducing the photocatalytic efficiency macedo valencia et al 2014 malato et al 2002 in addition ptr lacks the ability to use diffused light which limits the photocatalytic activity in cloudy days braham and harris 2009 therefore ptr cannot optimize light irradiance and temperature for photocatalysis under actual weather moreover the complicated control system and the parabolic mirror of ptr led to the high cost thereby causing difficulties in the photocatalytic application braham and harris 2009 due to the above shortcomings ptr were widely judged as intrinsically flawed design braham and harris 2009 wang et al 2021 following these early studies of ptr simple and low cost photocatalytic reactors have been developed such as inclined plate collector ipc ipc adopts an inclined plate for receiving solar radiation on which the photocatalyst is immobilized or flows down with wastewater in powder form chan et al 2003 gernjak et al 2004 liu et al 2013 this simple and low cost design has seen ipc enjoy widespread use in research installations in addition some ipc based wastewater treatment plants have been actually established braham and harris 2009 wang et al 2021 and ipc may be the only type that has entered the practical stage so far for example ipc was reported to treat the wastewater from a textile plant bousselmi et al 2004 pichat et al 2004 also reported a corrugated ipc for treating pesticides found in tractor cisterns at vineyards the above examples proved that ipc is indeed a configuration entering the practical stage however ipc also has shortcomings in practical applications since ipc is fixedly installed on the ground it can only passively receive sunlight when facing the solar motion and different weather ipc provides the photocatalysis with variable and non optimized light and temperature which limits the performance to improve the photocatalytic activity the shortcomings of ipc s passive receiving of solar energy need to be overcome therefore the active solar energy controllable photoreactor is needed to optimize the light irradiance and temperature the linear fresnel lf is traditionally applied in the field of solar thermal engineering for heating and power generation beltagy et al 2017 sebastián et al 2018 the structure mainly includes the segmented flat mirrors and the light receiver located above the mirrors the mirrors are closely aligned with each other in the north south orientation mirrors rotate under the computer control system according to the solar position thereby solar rays could be reflected and accurately converged onto the light receiver due to the low cost of flat mirror and single axis control system lf is generally considered to have superior economic efficiency for solar energy collection kumar et al 2017 roostaee and ameri 2019 therefore lf could also have great potential in providing solar energy for photocatalysis however for the utilization of lf in the traditional solar energy collection all of its mirrors concentrating the solar light to achieve extremely high light irradiance and hundreds of degrees celsius bellos et al 2018 at such a high light irradiance fast electron hole recombination rate would lead to the reduced reaction rate herrmann 2005 in addition high temperature would lead to the vigorous boiling of wastewater and cause influence on pipeline structure bucur and isbǎşoiu 2008 hence providing optimized solar energy for photocatalysis remains a challenge in designing lf based photoreactors it is worth noting that the number and operation of the mirrors determine the amount of solar energy collected in lf barbón et al 2019 bellos 2019 if lf has suitable number of mirrors that can be flexibly controlled according to solar motion and weather it is possible to effectively optimize the light irradiance and temperature by controlling solar energy under actual sunlight according to our best knowledge until now no lf has been modified and applied in photocatalysis yet therefore in this research a novel linear fresnel photoreactor lfp capable of controlling solar energy was developed for the first time the wastewater treatment performances of lfp were investigated against the ipc as the control reactor under real sunlight the organic dye of rhodamine b rh b the antibiotic of amoxicillin amx and the pathogenic bacteria of escherichia coli e coli were used as the wastewater models furthermore the whole year light and temperature conditions of lfp and ipc were estimated according to the real meteorological data in 2019 of tsukuba area 2 materials and methods 2 1 identification of the optimal solar light irradiance and reaction temperature as aforementioned in the introduction for solar light driven photocatalytic technology light irradiance and temperature are two key factors affecting its efficiency da costa filho et al 2019 as such in this study the optimal light irradiance and temperature for achieving high photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency was identified the tio2 coated silica gel beads hqc 21 obtained from sinto v ceracs japan were adopted as photocatalyst table s1 which could only be excited by uv light hence the optimal uv irradiance and temperature were identified using a simulated solar lamp and the details were shown in supplementary 1 1 2 2 determination of lfp mirror number since the linear fresnel structure adjusts the light irradiance and temperature through the reflection of sunlight by mirrors barbón et al 2019 bellos 2019 the number of mirrors determines the lfp s ability to control solar energy the increased mirror number would enhance the time length which ensure that the uv irradiance was stabilized at the optimal range while increased mirror number would also lead to a surge in the mirror cost therefore it is necessary to balance the relationship between the mirror number and the mirror cost the lfp models with different mirror number ranging from 2 to 10 were made by freecad software li et al 2018 since the daily solar conditions are different throughout the year the winter solstice as the day with the worst solar irradiation conditions of the year was chosen as the day for studying the mirror number if lfp could effectively optimize the uv irradiance on the winter solstice it could theoretically optimize the uv irradiance throughout the year the solar conditions in tsukuba area on the winter solstice was simulated by using otsun software cardona and pujol nadal 2020 to simulate the sunlight conditions the solar light irradiance and position on the sky were calculated according to a solar earth illumination model fig s2 considering the complexity of the sun earth revolution system and different weather conditions several simplifications was adopted 1 regarding the sunlight that reaches the earth is parallel light 2 ignoring the precession of the earth dehant et al 2017 3 considering the earth as a standard sphere 4 ignoring the shielding effect of the earth s atmosphere on solar radiation based on the above settings solar conditions on the winter solstice were determined shown in supplementary 1 2 2 3 manufacturing of lfp and control reactor ipc the manufacturing of lfp was based on the determined mirror number to meet the goal of laboratory scale maximum treatment of 1 l solution all parts of lfp were purchased from the internet or local supermarkets and assembled in the laboratory according to the blueprint the program operation of lfp to control solar energy was based on mature arduino system arduino uno rev3 and arduino cnc shield v3 mainboard to control stepper motors bipolar nema 17 kondaveeti et al 2021 arduino is an open source code c language compilation software for obtaining high control accuracy inclined plate collector ipc a typical photoreactor passively receiving solar light was used as the control reactor chan et al 2003 2 4 light and temperature measurement the uv meter custom uv 340 detection range 290 nm to 390 nm and the pyranometer li 200r detection range 400 nm to 1100 nm were used as the light sensors in lfp and ipc to detect uv energy and visible light energy respectively three thermocouples tandd tr 71wf were used as the temperature sensors for detecting and recording the ambient temperature and the reaction temperature in lfp and ipc respectively the details of the layout information and data processing methods of the light sensor and temperature sensor during the experiment were shown in the supplementary 1 3 2 5 water heating experiment the water heating experiment was conducted to investigate the capability of lfp and ipc to control solar light irradiance and reaction temperature and to verify the correctness of the lfp structural design and program system this experiment was carried out on a typical sunny day 2020 01 10 1000 ml water was used to flow in the circulation loop in lfp and ipc respectively the uv light irradiance visible light irradiance and water temperature were measured every 30 min and recorded 2 6 photocatalytic degradation and disinfection experiments rh b was used as the model of organic dye and ordered from wako pure chemical industries ltd osaka japan amx were used as the model of antibiotic and ordered from sigma aldrich co ltd louisiana usa the e coli was isolated from matsumi lake of university of tsukuba tsukuba japan using xm g agar medium and chosen as the microorganism model in the disinfection experiments the degradation experiments of rh b 1000 ml 2 mg l 1 were carried out under different weather conditions in the winter of 2020 and the autumn of 2021 respectively rh b concentration was measured by the spectrophotometer uv 1600 shimadzu japan at the wavelength of 554 nm the toc variation of rh b was analyzed by total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the degradation of amx 300 ml 10 mg l 1 and disinfection of e coli 300 ml 3 5 104 cfu ml 1 were carried out under sunny condition in the winter of 2020 respectively the concentration of amx was determined by a hplc jasco his 1500 equipped with a c18 reverse phase column cosmosil 5c18 ar ii 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm at 60 the mobile phase was a hybrid solution of 60 kh2po4 0 025 m in ultrapure water and 40 acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 50 ml min 1 detection was performed at 228 nm with an uv vis detector jasco uv 1570 the preparation of e coli solution refers to previous investigation liu et al 2019 the concentration of e coli was calculated by the standard plate count method 2 7 whole year estimation of light and temperature conditions in tsukuba area lfp and ipc were assumed to treat 1000 ml of wastewater to estimate the 2019 whole year uv irradiance and reaction temperature for the estimation of light irradiance in photoreactors the optical models of lfp and ipc were created by freecad software with high accuracy and imported into otsun software to study the daily solar energy provided by the photoreactors in 2019 the data used to establish the daily sunlight conditions in the otsun software were collected from the japan meteorological agency jma 2021 after that the reaction temperature in lfp and ipc was calculated the reaction temperature was determined by the received light irradiance the ambient temperature and the conversion ratio of solar energy to internal energy η the solar energy received by lfp and ipc was obtained from the above estimation of lighting condition the ambient temperature in tsukuba area in 2019 was also summarized from the japan meteorological agency jma 2021 the conversion ratio of solar energy to internal energy η for two reactors were used to calculate the energy used for increasing the reaction temperature it was calculated based on the conversion process of solar energy and internal energy in lfp and ipc as shown in the supplementary 1 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal uv light irradiance and temperature fig 1 a showed the effect of uv irradiance on photocatalytic reaction when the uv irradiance increased from 0 to 24 w m 2 the degradation rate dramatically increased from 41 to 89 however after uv irradiance increased from 24 to 40 w m 2 almost no further improvement was observed hence the solar uv irradiance at the range of 24 40 w m 2 was found to be the optimal uv condition for photocatalysis fig 1b showed the effect of reaction temperature on photocatalytic reaction the degradation rate increased when the reaction temperature increased from 5 to 55 then almost the same highest degradation rate was achieved at 55 65 although the degradation rate decreased slightly when the temperature further increased to 75 95 it was still much higher than that at low temperature of 5 25 therefore in general the increase in reaction temperature was beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction however when the reaction temperature reached and exceeded 65 the number of bubbles increased dramatically and the bubbles began to merge with each other to form the gas column fig s7 in the actual engineering the large amount of air in the liquid circulation loop will accelerate the corrosion and aging of pipeline and water pump bucur and isbǎşoiu 2008 therefore for improving the photocatalytic efficiency while reduce the negative effects of bubbles on the system operation the photocatalytic reaction temperature should be increased but below 65 based on the above results to achieve high efficiency photocatalytic wastewater treatment process lfp was required to provide uv irradiance of 24 40 w m 2 and increase the reaction temperature while ensuring that it is below 65 as such the following lfp structural design and control program compilation were based on the above requirements and the geographic location of tsukuba area fig s3 3 2 optimal mirror number of lfp fig 2 a showed the relationship between the mirror number and the optimal uv duration 2 mirrors could only achieve the optimal uv irradiance from 11 12 to 12 01 4 mirrors further increased the optimal uv duration from 9 21 to 13 51 compared with 2 and 4 mirrors 6 mirrors significantly extended the duration from 7 59 to 15 12 further increasing the mirror number from 6 to 10 only slightly increased the optimal uv duration other research reported that as the number of mirrors in the linear fresnel increases the light occlusion between the mirrors would become serious thus limiting the promotion of light concentration capacity moghimi et al 2017 to determine the optimal mirror number in lfp the mirrors cost and the optimal uv duration were comprehensively considered the relationship between the optimal uv duration and mirror cost were shown in fig 2b the mirror cost increased proportionally with the increase in the mirror number assuming the price of one mirror is 1 when the mirror number increased from 2 to 6 optimal uv duration and mirror cost increased at the similar rate when the mirror number increased from 6 to 10 the increase rate of mirror cost was much higher than that of optimal uv duration therefore from the perspective of the mirror cost and light gathering performance 6 was found to be the optimal mirror number for lfp 3 3 structure and control system of lfp the structure of lfp was shown in fig 2c in the lfp 6 mirrors were compactly mounted on the pedestal of the reactor and could be individually driven by 6 stepper motors the reaction tubes were filled with tio2 coated beads and located above the mirrors to receive the reflected solar light wastewater flowed in the reaction tubes and was driven by the peristaltic pump the specifications and layout of lfp during the experiments was shown in the supplementary 1 5 for achieving effective optimization of uv energy and temperature under real weather conditions the control system of lfp were designed fig 3 described the flow chart of lfp control system the sunny working mode would be executed under sunny condition to maintain the optimal uv irradiance of 24 40 w m 2 while control the temperature below 65 as expressed in the timing chart fig s12 under the sunny working mode more mirrors will be driven to track and reflect sunlight in the morning and afternoon while fewer mirrors will be driven at noon the and in this chart represent six mirrors of lfp with different working status the means this mirror is tracking and reflecting the sunlight to the reaction tubes while represent this mirror is idle under such control lfp could provide the optimal uv and temperature in sunny weather on cloudy days when the sun is severely blocked the cloudy working mode will be executed that is all mirrors will work to achieve as high light irradiance and temperature as possible the above two working modes ensure that the 6 mirrors of lfp could provide optimized uv light and reaction temperature for the photocatalyst under various weather conditions thereby laying the foundation for the efficient wastewater treatment process after completing the design of the lfp the ipc as the control was also designed the layout of the ipc was shown in the supplementary 1 5 3 4 verification of the correctness of lfp design the correctness of the lfp structural design and the program system was verified through the water heating experiment from 8 00 to 14 00 on a sunny day 2020 01 10 the variation of uv irradiance was shown in fig 4 a at 8 00 in the morning the sunlight was almost parallel to the ground resulting in a very low environmental uv irradiance of 2 w m 2 on the ground due to the oblique incidence of the sunlight in the winter season the environmental uv irradiance was only 13 w m 2 at noon and gradually weakened at afternoon for lfp since its 6 mirrors could change the light direction the uv irradiance in lfp reached the optimal uv range around 25 w m 2 even at the early time of 8 00 in the morning therefore 6 mirrors in lfp are effective to provide optimal uv light in the early morning when the solar altitude is low from 8 00 to 12 00 when the solar altitude increased the number of mirrors that track and reflect the sunlight was reduced to maintain the optimal uv irradiance 25 29 w m 2 it is worth noting that lfp maintained the optimal uv level by increasing the number of mirrors that track and reflect sunlight when the sun s altitude dropped in the afternoon hence the control system of lfp could drive mirrors to effectively control the solar energy for maintaining the optimal uv irradiance while for the ipc it only received 5 w m 2 uv irradiance at 8 00 and 22 w m 2 at noon which was not only far below the optimal uv range but also changed drastically the variation of visible light irradiance and temperature were shown in fig 4b on this day from 8 00 to 14 00 the environmental visible light irradiance varied from 120 to 480 w m 2 and the ambient temperature changed between 12 and 22 under the active control of solar energy by lfp the visible light irradiance was stabilized at about 1000 w m 2 while the visible light in ipc varied dramatically over time and the highest irradiance was only about 800 w m 2 therefore lfp was much more effective than ipc in providing solar energy the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar was used for comparing the solar energy control capability of lfp and ipc δesolar could be calculated as eq 1 1 δ e solar e solar t operation where the solar energy esolar provided by photoreactor could be calculated by integrating the solar light irradiance i that reached the reaction tube areaction tube as eq 2 2 e solar i t a reac tion tube dt after calculation the δesolar of lfp was 0 585 kj min 1 and much higher than the 0 372 kj min 1 of ipc which led to the higher reaction temperature of lfp 33 than ipc 27 for more effectively promoting photocatalytic activity fig 4b therefore the lfp design was proven to be effective in controlling solar energy for optimizing uv irradiance and reaction temperature and the higher photocatalytic efficiency in lfp compared to ipc could be expected 3 5 degradation of rh b under different weather conditions 3 5 1 temporarily overcast condition the organic pollutant degradation experiment for treating rh b was firstly carried out from 11 50 to 13 20 on a temporarily overcast day 2020 01 21 fig 5 a showed the variation of uv irradiance during this time the environmental uv irradiance gradually varied from 15 to 13 w m 2 when the sunlight was blocked by clouds at 12 10 and 12 30 the environmental uv irradiance dropped to only 3 w m 2 and 7 w m 2 respectively as for the lfp when the sun was not blocked by clouds it operated the sunny working mode to maintain the optimal uv irradiance 24 29 w m 2 when the sunlight was blocked lfp switched to the cloudy working mode and all of 6 mirrors were driven to reflect sunlight under such control although cloud blocked a lot of direct sunlight at the 12 10 the uv irradiance provided by lfp still reached 10 w m 2 which was much optimized than the environmental uv irradiance 3 w m 2 at around 12 30 since the clouds were thinner and more direct solar light could penetrate the cloud the uv irradiance in lfp reached 20 w m 2 which was close to the optimal uv range 24 40 w m 2 while the highest uv irradiance in ipc was only 21 w m 2 when it was sunny and 7 11 w m 2 when the sunlight was blocked hence through the flexible switch between the sunny and cloudy working modes lfp could effectively optimize uv irradiance under the temporarily overcast condition through the adjustment of sunlight the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar in lfp reached 0 513 kj min 1 much higher than the 0 355 kj min 1 in ipc table 1 therefore the increase in reaction temperature in lfp from 19 to 30 was not affected by the temporary obscuration of sunlight by clouds fig 5b while the temperature increase in ipc was significantly affected by weather changes its reaction temperature even dropped during the overcast period from 12 20 to 12 30 above results indicated that lfp could not only optimize the uv irradiance and temperature for the photocatalysis on sunny condition but also promote the reaction process under overcast period the rh b degradation results were shown in fig 5c the k value of rh b degradation was calculated according to the first order reaction model eq 3 and summarized in table 1 3 ln c t c 0 kt the k value of rh b degradation in lfp reached 0 059 min 1 which was 2 19 folds higher than ipc 0 027 min 1 the rapid degradation could be due to the favorable uv and temperature in lfp reuterg ardh et al 1997 and sharma et al 2020 also reported the appropriate increase in light irradiance and temperature could be beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction therefore through the active control of solar energy the high efficiency wastewater treatment process in lfp would be less susceptible to the fluctuations of natural sunlight in the temporarily cloudy weather 3 5 2 totally overcast to slightly overcast condition the effect of lfp s solar energy track and control on the enhancement of photocatalytic reaction efficiency under the extreme weather conditions was also studied the rh b degradation experiment in lfp and ipc was carried out on a day 2020 02 13 from 10 10 to 11 40 with the weather changed from totally overcast to slightly overcast from fig 6 a even the sunlight was severely blocked by dark clouds 10 10 10 20 through all mirrors working the uv irradiance in lfp 1 4 w m 2 was also higher than ipc 1 0 w m 2 thereby promoting the photocatalytic activity more effectively when the weather was turning to clear from 10 20 to 11 10 as the cloud gradually thinned and dissipated more and more sunlight arrived the reactors making the uv irradiance in lfp rose rapidly lfp achieved the uv irradiance over 24 w m 2 from 10 37 when the sunlight was still partially blocked by cloud however ipc only received 8 w m 2 of uv irradiance at 10 37 and its highest uv irradiance was only 23 w m 2 even after the weather turned to clear under such process the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar of 0 409 kj min 1 was achieved by lfp which was higher than the 0 329 kj min 1 in ipc table 1 the change of reaction temperature in lfp and ipc was shown in fig 6b due to the more solar energy was provided in lfp even during the totally overcast period from 10 10 to 10 20 the reaction temperature in lfp was still 0 2 higher than ipc when the sky was gradually becoming clear from 10 20 to 11 40 the reaction temperature of lfp increased rapidly to 32 c which was much faster than ipc thereby effectively promoting the photocatalytic efficiency fig 6c showed the degradation results of rh b it is worth noting that even when the sunlight was almost completely blocked 10 10 10 20 the optimized uv irradiance and temperature in lfp also led to the more efficient rh b degradation process than ipc the k value of rh b degradation in lfp reached 0 027 min 1 which was 1 5 folds higher than that of 0 018 min 1 in ipc table 1 higher photocatalytic degradation of rh b in lfp might be ascribed to effectively extended the time length with the optimal uv conditions besides more desirable temperature in lfp should also be benefit to photocatalytic process under the erratic weather condition therefore lfp could effectively improve the wastewater treatment efficiency even with severely overcast condition 3 5 3 sunny condition then the rh b degradation performance of lfp and ipc were studied on a typical sunny day 2020 03 01 to prove that lfp could maintain the optimal uv conditions and suitable temperature throughout the sunny days experiments were sequentially carried out in three typical time periods sunrise 7 30 9 00 morning 10 00 11 30 and noon 12 00 13 30 as shown in fig 7 a from 7 30 to 13 30 lfp could always provide the optimal uv irradiance 24 31 w m 2 which was much optimized than ipc 10 24 w m 2 during each experimental period the solar energy accumulation rate δesolar of lfp could be maintained in the range of 0 535 0 579 kj min 1 which was much higher than the 0 253 0 416 kj min 1 in ipc table 1 therefore the reaction temperature in lfp during different time periods were 12 27 19 31 and 20 32 which could be more beneficial to photocatalysis than ipc 12 20 19 24 and 20 26 fig 7b fig 7c showed the rh b degradation results during sunrise morning and noon the k values of rh b degradation at sunrise morning and noon in lfp were 0 060 min 1 0 064 min 1 and 0 065 min 1 respectively which were 2 73 folds 2 13 folds and 1 97 folds higher than that of ipc table 1 it could be seen that the improvement of efficiency at sunrise 2 73 folds was higher than that at noon 1 97 folds hence lfp could more effectively improve the photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency when the natural light conditions are weak from above results the average promotion of rh b degradation efficiency in lfp was 2 28 folds higher than ipc under the sunny condition the above experiments basically covered all kinds of weather based on the results the organic degradation efficiencies of lfp and ipc could be evaluated and compared for the all weather conditions in the tsukuba area to achieve this goal weathers have been classified according to the hourly average solar light irradiance based on the data from the japan meteorological agency four types of weather were defined separately typical sunny condition average irradiance 700 w m 2 slightly overcast condition average irradiance 200 699 w m 2 temporarily overcast condition average irradiance 50 199 w m 2 and totally overcast condition average irradiance 0 49 w m 2 fig s13 showed the percentage of different weather durations in the tsukuba area from 2017 to 2019 it could be seen that in tsukuba area temporarily overcast weather accounts for 17 46 slightly and totally overcast condition together account for 56 08 and sunny weather accounts for 26 46 jma 2021 meanwhile the degradation efficiencies of lfp under different weather conditions were 2 19 folds temporarily overcast 1 5 folds slightly and totally overcast and 2 28 folds typical sunny higher than ipc therefore the all weather rh b degradation efficiency in lfp including temporarily overcast slightly and totally overcast and typical sunny was estimated averagely to be 1 83 folds higher than that of ipc hence lfp could significantly improve the photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency through solar energy control under all weather conditions 3 6 degradation of amx and disinfection of e coli to further verify the treatment capacity of the developed lfp for antibiotics and bacteria the treatment experiments of amx and e coli were also carried out the degradation of amx was conducted from 8 40 to 12 40 on a sunny day 2020 02 12 fig 8 a b showed that under the control of sunny working mode the uv irradiance 24 27 w m 2 and the temperature 35 in lfp were mush optimized than the uv irradiance 9 24 w m 2 and temperature 29 in ipc as seen in fig 8c the 40 reduction in amx concentration was achieved by lfp which was a great improvement compared to ipc 21 reduction the k value of amx degradation was calculated according to the first order reaction model eq 3 and the k value in lfp 0 002 min 1 was 2 folds higher than in ipc 0 001 min 1 table 1 in addition as watkinson et al 2009 reported the antibiotics concentration was only 64 μg l 1 in actual wastewater which was significantly lower than the 10 mg l 1 amx used in this study lfp should have high efficiency in the antibiotics treatment in actual wastewater subsequently the disinfection experiment of e coli was conducted from 8 00 to 13 00 on february 23 2020 although the weather was clear strong winds occurred from 11 00 to 11 10 fig 9 a showed lfp maintained the optimal uv irradiance around 24 w m 2 for the photocatalytic sterilization process from morning to afternoon while the uv irradiance of ipc varied dramatically 9 to 23 w m 2 fig 9b showed that from 10 40 to 11 10 the strong wind caused a significant drop in the ambient temperature although the lowering of the ambient temperature also caused a drop in the reaction temperature in lfp due to the effective solar energy control by lfp the reaction temperature quickly returned to 32 after the wind weakened at 11 10 for ipc due to passively received less solar energy the reaction temperature only recovered to 24 fig 9c showed the disinfection results of e coli the 2 6 log reduction of e coli was observed after 5 h in lfp which was much higher than that in ipc 1 9 log reduction according to the reports the disinfection process could be fitted with weibull deactivation function ouyang et al 2016 rodríguez chueca et al 2020 based on this the calculated k value of e coli disinfection in lfp 0 019 min 1 was 1 37 folds higher than ipc 0 014 min 1 table 1 this result may be due to the optimized uv irradiance and temperature in lfp sharma et al 2020 also reported that the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency increased with the appropriate increase of light irradiance and temperature in addition considering in real water bodies the bacterial concentration usually does not exceed 103 cfu ml 1 which is lower than the concentration in this study liu et al 2021 this indicates that lfp could be more efficient in the actual water treatment therefore lfp should be efficient in eliminating pathogenic bacteria in water bodies and improving the quality of drinking water through the active control of solar energy 3 7 estimation of the uv irradiance and reaction temperature at tsukuba area for one year the above results proved that lfp could optimize uv irradiance and reaction temperature for the photocatalyst through active tracking and control of sunlight thereby achieving high efficiency wastewater treatment efficiency furthermore based on the actual geographic location and weather data of the tsukuba area the uv irradiance and temperature in lfp throughout 2019 were estimated the uv irradiance and temperature conditions provided by two reactors from 5 00 to 19 00 daily in tsukuba area were estimated to further compare the performance of lfp and ipc in the whole year time 2019 fig 10 a showed the irradiance of natural uv light perpendicular to the ground it could be seen that the natural uv has been changing due to the daily movement of the solar position and different day in the year comparing with natural condition although the inclined mirror plate of ipc could slightly enhance the uv light irradiance it was still much lower than the optimal uv range of 24 40 w m 2 in most year time fig 10b as for lfp it was obvious that after the adjustment of sunlight the uv irradiance in lfp was significantly optimized compared to ipc fig 10c lfp could achieve the optimal uv irradiance over 24 w m 2 in the sunny periods even under the cloudy condition lfp could also provide the uv light irradiance as high as possible therefore lfp was expected to effectively optimize the uv irradiance throughout the year to effectively active the photocatalyst fig 10d showed that the environmental temperature in tsukuba area usually has its lowest value at sunrise time of the day and then gradually rose as the solar altitude increases the highest environmental temperature generally occurs around 14 00 and then decreased as the solar altitude dropped for the tsukuba area in 2019 the highest ambient temperature was 35 5 for ipc its reaction temperature was not much improved compared to the environmental temperature and the highest temperature in ipc was only 39 5 fig 10e while for lfp fig 10f through the solar energy control its reaction temperature rose much faster than ipc the highest reaction temperature for lfp appeared on august 2 at 52 which was lower than the 65 therefore while lfp raises the reaction temperature for promoting photocatalytic activity it also reduces system damage caused by excessively high temperature through the control of solar energy thereby ensuring the long term effectiveness of the system the above results illustrated that lfp could effectively optimize the light and temperature conditions in different weather conditions throughout the year at the tsukuba area therefore high efficiency photocatalytic wastewater treatment efficiency of lfp at tsukuba could be expected in addition not only at the tsukuba area but also in sapporo 43 0 n 141 4 e ishigakijima 24 6 n 124 3 e and some typical densely populated areas of the world latitude range 24 6 n 43 0 n lfp also demonstrated its global applicability and feasibility shown in the supplementary 1 6 meanwhile the long term applicability of lfp and its strong mineralization ability of organic pollutants have also been confirmed shown in the supplementary 1 7 moreover since linear fresnel lf was widely considered to be one of the most cost effective and easy operation structures in solar thermal engineering bellos et al 2018 roostaee and ameri 2019 lfp should also have an impressive affordability for photocatalysis the economic evaluation of lfp also confirmed that lfp has superior cost affordability in practical wastewater treatment applications shown in the supplementary 1 8 which is undoubtedly beneficial to the application of lfp in the future furthermore the low gravity center of lf endowed lfp with high resistance to windy weather el gharbi et al 2011 the results of this study suggest that lfp is an efficient solar energy controllable system with great application potential in photocatalytic wastewater treatment the novel lfp design could promote the development of green wastewater treatment infrastructure worldwide to improve global public health and achieve eco friendly society 4 conclusions in this research a novel lfp was firstly developed and applied to photocatalytic wastewater treatment under actual weather the optimal 6 column mirrors and program system of lfp ensured its effective tracking and controlling of real solar light for providing optimized light irradiance and temperature to photocatalyst compared with the control reactor ipc lfp exhibited much higher photocatalytic treatment efficiency for organic dye antibiotic and microorganism under actual weather conditions furthermore the results of whole year estimation indicated that lfp has the capability to optimize the uv irradiance and reaction temperature effectively throughout the year therefore as an extremely promising real sunlight track and control reactor lfp could have great potential in the practical photocatalytic wastewater treatment process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16468,hydraulic fracturing hf remains a current global energy policy issue and understanding risks to drinking water resources from hf chemicals is an important aspect of this topic the quantity and quality of disclosed hf chemical information are significant barriers for stakeholders attempting to perform systemic environmental and public health research a repeatable approach for processing hf chemical disclosure data is provided using united states fracfocus data as a case study we fill research gaps by examining hf chemical trends between 2014 and 2020 and comparing hf chemicals with a list of reference chemicals known or suspected to be in contact unrelated to hf with drinking water food or cosmetics in total 1 244 unique hf chemicals were identified compared with epa s 2016 hf chemical disclosure research 480 new chemicals are identified and 318 previously reported chemicals were not observed the annual unique chemical counts have dropped from 878 to 594 32 3 over the research period while data quality and transparency have increased approximately 69 7 of the identified hf ingredients were found in a list of reference chemicals known or suspected to be in contact unrelated to hf with drinking water food or cosmetics chemical differences between production types gas and oil and states are also reviewed our research reveals that the sociotechnical system surrounding hf is dynamic and moving toward fewer and in general safer chemicals for those that are disclosed this study highlights opportunities for new and updated systemic research regarding hf chemical hazard dynamics and associated risk to drinking water resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chemical disclosure data science fracfocus risk management unconventional oil and gas water contamination introduction the world has 442 1 billion tons of unconventional crude oil and 227 trillion cubic meters of unconventional natural gas reserves wang et al 2016 without hydraulic fracturing hf technology and chemicals most of these natural energy resources would be inaccessible and the associated economic implications could not be realized however the benefits associated with hf technology must be evaluated holistically in the context of risks including known hazards to drinking water resources maguire boyle and barron 2014 us epa 2016a vengosh et al 2013 the united states of america u s the scope of this case study was the first country to see broad commercialization and use of this disruptive technology which triggered public concerns and government action the u s congress identified shortcomings in available hf additive information in 2010 and subsequently conducted a preliminary investigation to identify chemicals used in the process waxman et al 2011 an immediate flurry of valuable hf chemical research and regulatory efforts followed this preliminary government inquiry but there is a need to reexamine the system s current state and dynamics to understand trends in systemic environmental and public health risks hill et al 2021a in addition this area of study provides a unique opportunity to further analyze the power of transparency as a system or regulatory control tool hill et al 2021b jobe 1999 us epa 1997 in 2016 based on urging from congress the u s environmental protection agency epa released its extensive study regarding the potential impacts of hf on drinking water resources us epa 2016a a key aspect of the study was determining the identity frequency scope and information availability of chemicals intentionally added to hf fluids for onshore unconventional oil and gas well stimulation the epa identified 1084 unique chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids by analyzing information and references available including disclosures from fracfocus 1 0 for over 38 000 production wells hydraulically fractured between january 2011 and february 2013 the valuable epa study along with list of unique hf chemicals has been and continues to be leveraged by many researchers chen et al 2021 elliott et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and remains the primary source of chemicals associated hf in epa s comptox database therefore we use the epa study and list of chemicals as a reference point throughout this paper konschnik and dayalu 2016 expanded the epa s list with 263 additional chemicals and wetherbee et al 2020 built a web based tool specifically for identifying hf chemical that targets certain hormonal pathways however an updated and accessible list of unique hf chemicals does not exist and systemic trends in chemical variety and selection have not been conducted advancements in fracfocus i e hf disclosure data data science tools contextual chemical research inventories and chemical information availability provided us with an opportunity and efficient means to address this research gap in doing so we hope to improve the accessibility of systemic hf chemical information and context for stakeholders and foster progress toward increased transparency and safer chemical selection in general broad u s regulatory requirements limiting the use of specific chemicals or associated chemical characteristics for hf in key hydrocarbon producing states do not exist beyond those imposed by existing federal chemicals laws e g toxic control substances act tsca disclosure has

hu et al 2018 hurley et al 2016 shen and somasundaran 2019 xu et al 2019 yost et al 2017 the use of these voluntary tools is perceived to help the ouogd systems reach a lower level of chemical risk to public health and the environment however a systemic evaluation of the hazard levels has been impeded by hf chemical information availability and quality our research takes the first step to remove these actual and perceived data related research barriers and open the door for valuable exploration in the area of systemic risk to drinking water resources building on our previous work which focused on measuring and trending hf chemical transparency hill et al 2021b the primary research objective for this paper is to identify hf chemicals currently as of 2020 in use and disclosed in the u s to determine how they have changed over time since 2014 secondary we investigate the impact of production type i e oil and gas and state jurisdiction on hf chemical variety lastly we compare hf chemicals identified in our research with chemical lists from other researchers including epa s 2016 hf study epa s safer chemical ingredient list scil and substances suspected in contact with unrelated to hf drinking water food and cosmetics published by other researchers and domestic and international environmental agencies addressing these objectives required significant effort to clean and process over 5 million rows of u s fracfocus ff data and synthesize other diverse data sources e g public chemical databases industry proprietary databases our work provides a repeatable ff data processing approach that synthesizes and improves fracfocus data processing best practices used in research to date in addition for those less interested in data processing our deliverables spare stakeholders these laborious efforts and provide useable resources to investigate impacts to drinking water resources potential caused by hf or pursue other research ventures related to hf chemicals material and methods data sources our research utilizes and synthesizes several diverse data sets from regulatory industry and academic sources the primary source of information used is the u s ff

funding from the u s department of energy doe oil and gas companies submit disclosure forms containing hf job information like company well identifiers well location job dates additives and chemical ingredients to the fracfocus database this information is accessible to the public in comma separated values csv structured query language sql and portable document formats pdf the dataset used in our research was accessed on april 4th 2021 and limited to hf jobs ending between 2014 and 2020 the fracfocus records for the entirety of 2020 were available as of the data acquisition date the temporal constraints used were influenced by epa s previous research which captured 2013 activity and the fracfocus 2 0 transition in 2013 in addition the 2014 boundary offers more comparable consistent and quality data we enriched the ff information by merging it with proprietary enverus data enverus 2021 specifically the american petroleum institute api number was used as a unique identifier to associate a production type i e oil or gas validated state names and hydrocarbon play basin to each disclosure in fracfocus in addition we leveraged an available open source ff python project developed by others allison 2020 to inform cleansing process and perform a quality check on our outputs the epa s 2016 hf study chemical inventory us epa 2016a toxic substances control act tsca chemical inventory us epa 2021a european chemical agency echa chemical inventory echa 2021 and pubchem database national library of medicine 2021 were used to match valid chemical abstract service

linguistics distance calculations were used to match fracfocus casn and ingredient names strings with valid casn found in the epa s hf study tsca or ec chemical inventories data processing and analysis workflow fracfocus data used in our analysis was filtered to disclosures between 2014 and 2020 and cleansed by removing duplicate rows system rows and duplicate forms the cleansing withheld row flagging and enverus merging steps are defined in detail by hill et al 2021b we concatenated the ff cas number and ingredient name fields and used this new field as a unique identifier for each unique cas number and ingredient name combination a cleansed cas number spaces and special characters removed was first compared with epa s 2016 hf chemical list casns using the fuzzywuzzy extractone method if an epa hf chemical match was not identified we compared the ff ingredient name with the epa s hf chemical ingredient names and ff cas number with a combined list of tsca and ec inventory casn a simple ratio match score of 95 out of 100 was our threshold for defining an automated resolved casn match all automated best match casn results were manually reviewed and curated where appropriate each unique cas number and ingredient name combination was classified as unresolved i e casn unidentifiable withheld i e proprietary and intentionally withheld or resolved i e best match casn identifiable ff open allison 2020 best guess casn were associated with the correct fracfocus rows using the concatenated cas number and ingredient name fields enverus well production type state and play basin were merged to fracfocus data using the api number as the unique identifier the resolved casn was used to query epa s comptox database for chemical information and compare hf and reference drinking water food and cosmetic chemical lists fig 1 summarizes our data processing and analysis workflow data quality limitations and research uncertainty as is common in all research data quality human error biases and estimations approaches have undoubtedly generated uncertainties in the analyses provided uncertainty and data quality was inherited from all data sources used primarily ff enverus and epa comptox however care was taken to utilize high quality peer reviewed governmental and proprietary datasets as described above all chemical data sets have limitations for example the fdafoodsubs list contains chemicals exempt from the u s food and drug administration approval and data requirements because they are categorized as generally regarded as safe under u s 21 cfr parts 182 and 184 throughout this paper independent research allison 2020 us epa 2016a yost et al 2017 2016b is used to ensure our analysis is comparable to previous work and critical assumptions and uncertainties are provided results and discussion data transparency quality and classification the primary focus of this section is to provide an overview of data transparency quality and classification from a ff chemical row perspective fig 2 summarizes the percent of total and resolved processed ff rows classified i e resolved withheld and unresolved and subclassified i e hf casn

ff rows a majority 83 52 of the ff ingredient rows were resolved with validated casns the automated matching of the ff cas number field with an epa s hf or tsca ec inventory chemical casn was effective in determining the best match for 96 6 of the processed ff rows manual curation including some overrides of automated matching encompassed 1 14 of the matched rows we compared our ff casn best match with the ff open project best guess and found 99 6 similarity in casn for overlapping non withheld ff rows approximately 15 23 of the processed ff rows were classified as withheld between 2014 and 2020 with an annual range of 14 13 to 16 12 these results are comparable with average disclosure ingredient withholding rates previously reported values ranging from 11 to 18 5 hill et al 2021b konschnik and dayalu 2016 trickey et al 2020 us department of energy 2014 us epa 2016a in addition the hf chemical withholding rates are similar to tsca 19 7 and global 14 2 confidential claim rates across all industries us epa 2016b wang et al 2020 hill et al 2021b observed the average percent of hf fluid mass withheld on chemical disclosure forms decreased 46 8 between 2013 and 2019 unresolved and withheld chemical rows contribute to uncertainty in research and present limitations for all stakeholders in their pursuit of systemic research the percent of unresolved ff rows is an indicator of data quality between 2014 and 2020 approximately 1 25 of the processed ff rows were classified as unresolved however we observed a significant reduction in this metric from a high of 1 94 in 2015 to 0 64 in 2020 reflecting on the step change in data quality in 2016 and 2017 we investigated ff system historical events to determine potential causes for this improvement since ff opened in april 2011 there have been two significant enhancements to the platform in 2013 and 2016 data accessibility and quality advancements were incorporated into the register fig 2b clearly shows that the 2016 upgrades positively impacted the stakeholder s ability to extract usable casn and chemicals names from the system the overall quality of our valid casn matching to ff ingredient rows is comparable with other research and adequate for systemic analysis of hf chemical trends our methodology and supporting materials enhance data accessibility for stakeholders and researchers addressing claims that more hf chemical data is needed to better understand risks to drinking water resources caused by hf avidan et al 2019 shrestha et al 2017 however there remains an opportunity to improve and automate processing steps and conduct additional research to increase casn source quality matching and enrich accuracy we believe that the best solution to enhance data quality would be for oil and gas operators and service companies to ensure accurate information on disclosure forms and ff to incorporate additional data validation steps into the register in our opinion increased transparency and quality would positively impact policy decision making and further enhancement in our ability to analyze the wealth of existing data can contribute to this objective unique hf chemical trends with the resolved casn ff rows discussed above we explored the current state and trends in unique hf chemicals disclosure the selection of hf chemicals used in ouogd is a product of complex multi variable decision making our research takes the first step necessary to understand the variety and changes in hf chemicals impacting system risk and behavior the unique hf chemicals identified are compared with those chemicals reported in epa s 2016 study in this section we contrast the hf chemicals with epa s scil to determine if there are indications that the ouogd system is trending toward fewer and in general safer chemicals we acknowledge that the epa scil comparison is preliminary limited and inconclusive however the approach is a helpful initial scoping step toward more sophisticated comprehensive and conclusive research based on our analysis summarized in fig 3 a total of 1244 unique hf chemicals were identified and disclosed between 2014 and 2020 including all chemicals reported in epa s 2016 study the total count of disclosed unique hf chemicals rises to 1325 approximately 62 4 776 of the 1244 hf chemicals identified in our research were reported by the epa approximately 37 6 468 were not however when evaluated on an annual average basis approximately 75 7 of the unique hf chemicals identified in our research were included in epa s 2016 hf chemical list seventy two of the 1244 chemicals were consistently observed in 10 or more of the u s ff disclosure forms which is greater than the 35 of 1084 chemicals identified by epa for this criterion the range of chemical differences could be associated with various targeted product types or plays or basins targeted see 3 2 1 gas and oil well analysis and 3 2 2 state analysis for each study period for reference early modern u s ouogd focused on natural gas however oil has recently become the predominant hydrocarbon targeted in development yergin 2020 a 32 3 878 to 594 reduction in the number of unique hf chemicals was observed between 2014 and 2020 the root cause of this significant reduction in hf chemical variety is unknown and requires additional investigation we speculate that knowledge economics and social pressure regarding risk and sustainability have been influencing factors an examination of the effect of production type regulatory jurisdiction and play basin variety on hf chemicals is provided in subsections 3 2 1 gas and oil well analysis and 3 2 2 state analysis below epa s safer chemical ingredients list is a valuable resource for all industries and businesses striving to select safer products for the environment and public health the epa categorizes chemicals as verified to be of low concern based on experimental and modeled data green circle expected to be of low concern based on experimental and modeled data green half circle best in class chemical and among the safest available for a particular function yellow triangle and not be acceptable for use in products that are candidates for the safer choice label gray square the unique hf chemicals identified between 2014 and 2020 contained no chemicals labeled gray square fig 3 illustrates the percentage of hf chemicals in the green circle green half circle or yellow triangle groups approximately 21 6 269 of the 1244 hf chemicals are within these favorable scil categories there is a slightly increasing trend from 24 1 in 2014 to 30 3 in 2020 indicating a potential transition toward safer chemicals or away from more hazardous chemicals which we believe is an opportunity for further investigation gas and oil well analysis we analyzed the data from a production type i e oil or gas perspective to determine if the factor was significantly influencing hf chemicals between 2014 and 2020 production type metadata is not included in ff however recall that the ff chemical data was merged with enverus proprietary information using api numbers which allowed the association of production type with chemical level information some ff disclosures and chemicals were not included in the following analysis because ff and enverus api numbers did not match or api number was associated with an enverus production type that was not oil or gas our production type analysis is summarized in fig 4 most of the chemicals identified were used in both oil and gas wells however specific ingredients are unique to each product type oil wells consistently use more unique chemicals for well stimulation than gas wells this finding is expected because oil hydrocarbon molecules are more complex relative to natural gas fracturing tight oil formations requires adding chemicals to address potential production and integrity issues e g paraffin specific to this production type both production types have seen a reduction in hf chemical variety between 2014 and 2020 oil related chemicals dropped approximately 37 1 804 to 506 gas related chemicals were reduced by 34 4 657 to 431 over the same period based on this analysis the system factors e g knowledge economics social pressure influencing the range of hf chemicals in use appear to be impacting both oil and gas product type wells similarly and targeted well production types are not the root cause of the reduction in chemicals state analysis differences in regulatory jurisdiction can influence system behavior since states have primacy over most ouogd activities we choose to explore the current condition and trends in hf chemical diversity among states the eight states with the most ff hf chemical disclosure activity between 2014 and 2020 were selected as representative for our analysis texas tx oklahoma ok colorado co north dakota nd new mexico nm pennsylvania pa wyoming wy and ohio oh we found that the inclusion of all states artificially suppressed descriptive statistics e g mean median because some less active states had limited hf activity and data points in general states realized a reduction in hf chemical diversity between 2014 and 2020 the average annual number of unique chemicals used within the eight key states dropped approximately 46 6 382 to 204 based on this analysis other system factors e g knowledge economics social pressure influencing the range of hf chemicals disclosed appear to be impacting all states similarly however the general analysis of the eight representative states highlighted the relatively higher level of chemicals used in the state of texas which defined the upper statistical boundary this observation led us to investigate the correlation of play basin activity with hf chemical variety as shown in fig 5 the annual state active play basin and unique hf chemical count correlation were fitted r2 0 7064 with linear regression as shown in fig 5a a relatively strong relationship between variables at the state level indicates the number of active plays basins influences the variety of chemicals used and disclosed this finding is important because it supports that the oil and gas industry selects hf chemicals based on reservoir properties we attempted to perform the same analysis for all annual development activities across the u s to determine if the number of basins targeted in a given year was the cause of the trend in reduced hf chemicals between 2014 and 2020 shown in fig 5b this analysis illustrates an active play basin count between 26 and 27 has been maintained at a national level over the period of interest and a correlation between the variables is not apparent therefore the diversity in basin activity impacts the annual quantity of unique hf chemicals used within a state but it does not describe the national trend toward fewer chemicals there are fewer available national data points limited variability in national play basin count between years and the annual unique chemical count is a combination of all states all of which contribute to the lack of an apparent national trend hf and reference chemical list comparative analysis establishing context is an initial and critical step in risk management international organization for standardization 2018 there has been a significant amount of valuable research regarding the environmental and public health risks associated with hf chemicals us epa 2016a yost et al 2017 2016b however we could not identify peer reviewed comparisons between reference chemicals with more direct environmental and public exposure pathways and hf chemicals for a preliminary comparison we selected 12 354 readily available reference chemicals categorized as known or suspected to be in contact unrelated to hf with drinking water food or cosmetics see table 1 for list details using epa s comptox database this section describes and fig 6 illustrates the highlights from comparing the 12 354 reference and 1244 hf chemicals we believe that our analysis reinforces the usefulness and importance of epa s comptox echa s register and other chemical database investments representation of occurrence toxicological and physicochemical data availability for risk assessment data similarity captures the number of chemicals found in both lists 867 and the total percent of said chemicals in a given list toxicity estimation software tool test rat oral ld50 and open structure activity relations app opera water solubility 95 confidence intervals are reported drinking water resources are not intentionally subjected to hf chemicals however the risk of drinking water contamination caused by accidental surface spills subsurface migration or well blowouts exists us epa 2016a prudent operators and service companies utilize robust operating management systems standard operating procedures engineering designs and best management practices to reduce the risk of accidental breaches in primary e g pipe tank and secondary e g lined berms around the tank containments american petroleum institute 2012 ogp and ipieca 2014 state and federal regulations are in place to ensure compliance with minimum risk management standards related to chemical release mitigation reduction containment and remediation state review of oil natural gas environmental regulations inc 2000 in contrast known water food and other consumer product chemical additives and contaminants like those found in the reference chemical list are more certain to reach environmental and human receptors in these cases researchers and regulators focus on understanding exposure levels dose and associated risk of adverse outcomes response national research council 2009 our hypothesis was that when compared with hf chemicals reference chemicals would have a low level of chemical similarity more available toxicity fate and transport information and lower toxicity and mobility in the environment however from a chemical or dataset similarity perspective excluding withheld chemicals we found that hf chemicals made up approximately 7 0 of the reference chemicals and 70 0 of the hf chemicals were in the reference chemical list fig 7 the percentage of unique chemicals that are found on each list are not inclusive of withheld chemicals unfortunately unique withheld chemical names or casn are unavailable on fracfocus and therefore these similarity percentages could not be calculated also considering withheld chemicals it is important to note that if the numbers of withheld chemicals were included the percentages would be lower the relatively high similarity in chemicals was not expected given the risk perception surrounding hf chemicals chittick and srebotnjak 2017 elliott et al 2017 stringfellow et al 2017a and more direct human health exposure pathways of the reference chemicals other researchers have thoroughly identified and investigated water food and cosmetic chemical hazards separately pizzurro et al 2018 groh et al 2020 li and suh 2019 and we direct readers to these references for further discussion regarding these topics stringfellow et al 2017b compared chemical use between hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations but did not explore how these chemicals differed from known water food and cosmetic additives and contaminants the significance of our research is discovering the previously unexplored similarity between hf and reference chemical lists and an opportunity to investigate risk perception between these chemical sources we are not claiming the similarity between hf and reference chemicals indicates all hf chemicals have a low toxicity value for example benzyl chloride is a high toxicity chemical on both lists in table 2 we compare the reference and recently 2014 2020 disclosed hf chemicals with those hf chemicals previously identified by epa for having high oral slope factors osf yost et al 2016a six of the ten high osf chemicals determined by the epa were reported in hf fluids between 2014 and 2020 chromium vi was the only high osf chemical not specified in the reference chemical list and all nine of the overlapping chemicals were associated with food contact groh et al 2020 quinoline and 1 3 butadiene were also associated with cosmetics and drinking water pipes respectively pizzurro et al 2018 us epa 2021b it is crucial to note that association does not conclusively indicate human exposure or health risk which is valid for reference and hf chemicals however these findings do highlight research opportunities regarding holistic chemical risk information availability knowledge perception and decision making for example physicians for social responsibility horwitt 2021 investigated the use of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances in oil and gas operations between 2012 and 2020 related chemicals were found in more than 1200 wells in texas arkansas louisana oklahoma new mexico and wyoming but most frequent use occurred prior to 2016 maguire boyle and barron 2014 reported the detection of the following fluorinated compounds used as flow tracers in produced waters from shale gas wells in texas 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 heptafluorobutyl undecylate 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 hepta fluoro butanoic acid undecylate ester c3f7c o oc11h24 cis 4 ethyl 5 octyl 2 2 bis tri fluoromethyl 1 3 dioxolane iii and tri fluoromethy tetradecylate trifluoroacetic acid tetradecyl ester cf3c o oc14h29 limitation in available hf chemical toxicological information has been claimed by many researchers stringfellow et al 2017a trickey et al 2020 us epa 2016a waxman et al 2011 yost et al 2016a based on our research we agree there are gaps in hf chemical toxicological data however we sought to understand if these limitations were unique to hf chemical or a more general systemic issue the toxval database aggregates toxicity values from 18 separate public databases and as of august 2018 contained 772 721 toxicity values from 29 sources of data 21 507 sub sources 4585 journals and 69 833 literature citations us epa 2021b toxval provides a binary indicator whether or not toxicity values are available in 18 separate public databases the epa s integrated risk information system iris is included in the toxval database but iris is governed by a more rigorous process than other toxval resources and therefore we reported iris values independently as well the toxval and iris databases consist of many different toxicity dose measures captured at study or chemical levels based on various methodologies including measures such as epa regional screening levels reference dose rfd reference concentrations rfc slope factors sf point of departure pod lowest observed adverse effect levels loael no observed adverse effect levels noael no effect levels nel low effect levels lel cancer related quantities e g cancer slope factors inhalation unit risk and other derived quantities both toxval and iris specific metadata have been incorporated into the epa s comptox system making comptox an efficient and effective resource for conducting a preliminary comparative analysis of different chemical lists our research did not explore or compare methodologies used to develop toxicity values nor evaluate the quality of toxicity data included in those database when exporting a list of chemicals from epa s comptox system the toxval and iris fields register a y with a hyperlink to the values when toxicity data is available we used these binary comptox features to determine the percent of chemicals with toxval and iris toxicological information approximately 92 4 and 90 3 of the hf and reference chemicals respectively were indicated as having toxval values in comptox regarding iris values we found approximately 5 4 and 1 8 of the hf and reference chemicals respectively were reported in comptox the toxval and iris comparisons suggest that there was no significant difference in the availability of toxicological information between hf and reference chemicals therefore hf toxicological data limitations are potentially a product of a systemic issue and not unique to the oil and gas industry this specific hypothesis requires additional investigation however other shortcomings in toxicological information across all sectors have been acknowledged by others silbergeld et al 2015 wang et al 2020 2019 in addition researchers and regulatory agencies worldwide are investing heavily to continuously improve chemical information systems and content evans et al 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2017 westphal et al 2017 williams et al 2017 chemical qsar modeling is one technology accelerating the availability of chemical property information that can be used in risk assessments and decision making lowe and williams 2021 qsar embodies various chemical property and activity prediction techniques based on their structural similarity to chemicals with established activities and properties based on qsar technology epa has developed test and opera test s primary purpose is predicting toxicological values opera focuses on calculating expected physicochemical properties and environmental fate both test and opera estimated values have been incorporated into the comptox dashboard it is worth noting that there are uncertainties and limitations of these estimation tools for example they cannot estimate properties for the inorganic chemicals or mixtures we selected the test rat oral lethal dose ld50 and opera water solubility parameters to conduct our preliminary comparison of the availability of osar toxicological and environmental fate property values for hf and reference chemicals the test rat oral ld50 toxicity parameter forecasts the amount of a chemical per body mass mol kg that will cause death in 50 of an animal test group the humane aspect of qsar is clearly another benefit of developing and using this technology the opera water solubility physicochemical property value calculates the maximum chemical quantity that can dissolve in water mol l reference chemicals were found to have a higher percentage of test rat oral ld50 and opera water solubility values in comptox a contributing factor to these results is the proportion of inorganic chemicals and chemical mixture in the hf chemical list however the research findings are clear reference chemicals have a higher percentage of available qsar toxicity and physicochemical property information an investigation of the test rat oral ld50 and opera water solubility value statistics provided additional insights worth noting for example assuming a normal distribution and using a 95 confidence interval there does not appear to be a significant difference between hf and reference chemical test rat oral ld50 values at 0 0215 0 0022 mol kg and 0 0193 0 0005 mol kg respectively a significant difference in opera water solubility values was observed as shown in fig 6 the u s epa generated qsar predicted oral toxicity values for 44 515 1173 of hf flowback and produced chemicals that they identified and investigated yost et al 2016b which is comparable to the proportions 30 2 found in our research fig 6 however we were unable to identify peer reviewed studies that contrasted the availability of hf chemical information with a list of non hf reference chemicals for reference existing research has focused primarily on the availability and characteristics of hf chemicals without the more holistic reference chemical perspective our investigation shows that there is value in expanding the scope of chemical evaluations to provide systemic context to stakeholders and understand sources of potential chemical contamination and exposures to drinking water resources conclusions risks to drinking water resources caused by ouogd are controlled by a complex and dynamic sociotechnical system comprised of interconnected functions it is critical that researchers policymakers and industry leaders investigate system dynamics to understand functional behaviors including current risk levels and trends our research explores the evolution of hf chemicals between 2014 and 2020 providing a temporal analysis of additives used and disclosed in fracfocus during ouogd in the u s it is important to note that there were data limitations including the withholding of 15 23 of hf chemical row data found in fracfocus however the provided updated list of hydraulic fracturing chemicals evaluation of influencing factors information availability assessment and comparison with known or suspected water food or cosmetic contaminants or ingredients have critical implications and enable the opportunity to explore the following recommended research topics identifying specific chemical variability between production types e g oil gas states years and other key factors performing and updating risk assessments fate and transport and toxicological studies related to hydraulic fracturing chemicals identifying greener and safer chemicals and supporting related product development and related decision support tools studying risk perception and management practices associated with hf and ouogd chemicals maturing and fostering the use of environmental social and governance key performance indicators related to industrial chemicals it should be noted that our results highlighted that the availability of information for reference chemicals with more direct human exposure pathways is similar to hf chemicals they do not imply that these chemicals are safe the safety of chemical is dependent on multiple factors especially concentration dose all chemical databases have limitations for example generally regarded as safe chemicals defined under u s 21 cfr parts 182 and 184 are not approved by the u s food and drug administration and are not publicly evaluated the availability of physicochemical and toxicological data on these chemicals is highly unlikely we believe that our foundational research indicates past progress and future opportunities for improvement related to hydraulic fracturing chemical stewardship we hope to see increased momentum toward safer chemicals and transparency across all industries in the future declaration of competing interest no funds were used to support the research of the manuscript the authors declare that they have personal and professional e g consulting relationships with oil and gas companies regulators and professionals that could be perceived to

16468,hydraulic fracturing hf remains a current global energy policy issue and understanding risks to drinking water resources from hf chemicals is an important aspect of this topic the quantity and quality of disclosed hf chemical information are significant barriers for stakeholders attempting to perform systemic environmental and public health research a repeatable approach for processing hf chemical disclosure data is provided using united states fracfocus data as a case study we fill research gaps by examining hf chemical trends between 2014 and 2020 and comparing hf chemicals with a list of reference chemicals known or suspected to be in contact unrelated to hf with drinking water food or cosmetics in total 1 244 unique hf chemicals were identified compared with epa s 2016 hf chemical disclosure research 480 new chemicals are identified and 318 previously reported chemicals were not observed the annual unique chemical counts have dropped from 878 to 594 32 3 over the research period while data quality and transparency have increased approximately 69 7 of the identified hf ingredients were found in a list of reference chemicals known or suspected to be in contact unrelated to hf with drinking water food or cosmetics chemical differences between production types gas and oil and states are also reviewed our research reveals that the sociotechnical system surrounding hf is dynamic and moving toward fewer and in general safer chemicals for those that are disclosed this study highlights opportunities for new and updated systemic research regarding hf chemical hazard dynamics and associated risk to drinking water resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chemical disclosure data science fracfocus risk management unconventional oil and gas water contamination introduction the world has 442 1 billion tons of unconventional crude oil and 227 trillion cubic meters of unconventional natural gas reserves wang et al 2016 without hydraulic fracturing hf technology and chemicals most of these natural energy resources would be inaccessible and the associated economic implications could not be realized however the benefits associated with hf technology must be evaluated holistically in the context of risks including known hazards to drinking water resources maguire boyle and barron 2014 us epa 2016a vengosh et al 2013 the united states of america u s the scope of this case study was the first country to see broad commercialization and use of this disruptive technology which triggered public concerns and government action the u s congress identified shortcomings in available hf additive information in 2010 and subsequently conducted a preliminary investigation to identify chemicals used in the process waxman et al 2011 an immediate flurry of valuable hf chemical research and regulatory efforts followed this preliminary government inquiry but there is a need to reexamine the system s current state and dynamics to understand trends in systemic environmental and public health risks hill et al 2021a in addition this area of study provides a unique opportunity to further analyze the power of transparency as a system or regulatory control tool hill et al 2021b jobe 1999 us epa 1997 in 2016 based on urging from congress the u s environmental protection agency epa released its extensive study regarding the potential impacts of hf on drinking water resources us epa 2016a a key aspect of the study was determining the identity frequency scope and information availability of chemicals intentionally added to hf fluids for onshore unconventional oil and gas well stimulation the epa identified 1084 unique chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids by analyzing information and references available including disclosures from fracfocus 1 0 for over 38 000 production wells hydraulically fractured between january 2011 and february 2013 the valuable epa study along with list of unique hf chemicals has been and continues to be leveraged by many researchers chen et al 2021 elliott et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and remains the primary source of chemicals associated hf in epa s comptox database therefore we use the epa study and list of chemicals as a reference point throughout this paper konschnik and dayalu 2016 expanded the epa s list with 263 additional chemicals and wetherbee et al 2020 built a web based tool specifically for identifying hf chemical that targets certain hormonal pathways however an updated and accessible list of unique hf chemicals does not exist and systemic trends in chemical variety and selection have not been conducted advancements in fracfocus i e hf disclosure data data science tools contextual chemical research inventories and chemical information availability provided us with an opportunity and efficient means to address this research gap in doing so we hope to improve the accessibility of systemic hf chemical information and context for stakeholders and foster progress toward increased transparency and safer chemical selection in general broad u s regulatory requirements limiting the use of specific chemicals or associated chemical characteristics for hf in key hydrocarbon producing states do not exist beyond those imposed by existing federal chemicals laws e g toxic control substances act tsca disclosure has

public health and the environment however a systemic evaluation of the hazard levels has been impeded by hf chemical information availability and quality our research takes the first step to remove these actual and perceived data related research barriers and open the door for valuable exploration in the area of systemic risk to drinking water resources building on our previous work which focused on measuring and trending hf chemical transparency hill et al 2021b the primary research objective for this paper is to identify hf chemicals currently as of 2020 in use and disclosed in the u s to determine how they have changed over time since 2014 secondary we investigate the impact of production type i e oil and gas and state jurisdiction on hf chemical variety lastly we compare hf chemicals identified in our research with chemical lists from other researchers including epa s 2016 hf study epa s safer chemical ingredient list scil and substances suspected in contact with unrelated to hf drinking water food and cosmetics published by other researchers and domestic and international environmental agencies addressing these objectives required significant effort to clean and process over 5 million rows of u s fracfocus ff data and synthesize other diverse data sources e g public chemical databases industry proprietary databases our work provides a repeatable ff data processing approach that synthesizes and improves fracfocus data processing best practices used in research to date in addition for those less interested in data processing our deliverables spare stakeholders these laborious efforts and provide useable resources to investigate impacts to drinking water resources potential caused by hf or pursue other research ventures related to hf chemicals material and methods data sources our research utilizes and synthesizes several diverse data sets from regulatory industry and academic sources the primary source of information used is the u s ff database groundwater protection council 2021 which is the main u s hf disclosure platform developed by the groundwater protection council gwpc and interstate oil and gas compact commission iogcc with funding from the u s department of energy doe oil and gas companies submit disclosure forms containing hf job information like company well identifiers well location job dates additives and chemical ingredients to the fracfocus database this information is accessible to the public in comma separated values csv structured query language sql and portable document formats pdf the dataset used in our research was accessed on april 4th 2021 and limited to hf jobs ending between 2014 and 2020 the fracfocus records for the entirety of 2020 were available as of the data acquisition date the temporal constraints used were influenced by epa s previous research which captured 2013 activity and the fracfocus 2 0 transition in 2013 in addition the 2014 boundary offers more comparable consistent and quality data we enriched the ff information by merging it with proprietary enverus data enverus 2021 specifically the american petroleum institute api number was used as a unique identifier to associate a production type i e oil or gas validated state names and hydrocarbon play basin to each disclosure in fracfocus in addition we leveraged an available open source ff python project developed by others allison 2020 to inform cleansing process and perform a quality check on our outputs the epa s 2016 hf study chemical inventory us epa 2016a toxic substances control act tsca chemical inventory us epa 2021a european chemical agency echa chemical inventory echa 2021 and pubchem database national library of medicine 2021 were used to match valid chemical abstract service

ff enverus and epa comptox however care was taken to utilize high quality peer reviewed governmental and proprietary datasets as described above all chemical data sets have limitations for example the fdafoodsubs list contains chemicals exempt from the u s food and drug administration approval and data requirements because they are categorized as generally regarded as safe under u s 21 cfr parts 182 and 184 throughout this paper independent research allison 2020 us epa 2016a yost et al 2017 2016b is used to ensure our analysis is comparable to previous work and critical assumptions and uncertainties are provided results and discussion data transparency quality and classification the primary focus of this section is to provide an overview of data transparency quality and classification from a ff chemical row perspective fig 2 summarizes the percent of total and resolved processed ff rows classified i e resolved withheld and unresolved and subclassified i e hf casn match hf name match inventory casn match curated match or curated match override respectively the term curated implies a manual process a manual override of automated matching occurred in 0 17 of the ff rows a majority 83 52 of the ff ingredient rows were resolved with validated casns the automated matching of the ff cas number field with an epa s hf or tsca ec inventory chemical casn was effective in determining the best match for 96 6 of the processed ff rows manual curation including some overrides of automated matching encompassed 1 14 of the matched rows we compared our ff casn best match with the ff open project best guess and found 99 6 similarity in casn for overlapping non withheld ff rows approximately 15 23 of the processed ff rows were classified as withheld between 2014 and 2020 with an annual range of 14 13 to 16 12 these results are comparable with average disclosure ingredient withholding rates previously reported values ranging from 11 to 18 5 hill et al 2021b konschnik and dayalu 2016 trickey et al 2020 us department of energy 2014 us epa 2016a in addition the hf chemical withholding rates are similar to tsca 19 7 and global 14 2 confidential claim rates across all industries us epa 2016b wang et al 2020 hill et al 2021b observed the average percent of hf fluid mass withheld on chemical disclosure forms decreased 46 8 between 2013 and 2019 unresolved and withheld chemical rows contribute to uncertainty in research and present limitations for all stakeholders in their pursuit of systemic research the percent of unresolved ff rows is an indicator of data quality between 2014 and 2020 approximately 1 25 of the processed ff rows were classified as unresolved however we observed a significant reduction in this metric from a high of 1 94 in 2015 to 0 64 in 2020 reflecting on the step change in data quality in 2016 and 2017 we investigated ff system historical events to determine potential causes for this improvement since ff opened in april 2011 there have been two significant enhancements to the platform in 2013 and 2016 data accessibility and quality advancements were incorporated into the register fig 2b clearly shows that the 2016 upgrades positively impacted the stakeholder s ability to extract usable casn and chemicals names from the system the overall quality of our valid casn matching to ff ingredient rows is comparable with other research and adequate for systemic analysis of hf chemical trends our methodology and supporting materials enhance data accessibility for stakeholders and researchers addressing claims that more hf chemical data is needed to better understand risks to drinking water resources caused by hf avidan et al 2019 shrestha et al 2017 however there remains an opportunity to improve and automate processing steps and conduct additional research to increase casn source quality matching and enrich accuracy we believe that the best solution to enhance data quality would be for oil and gas operators and service companies to ensure accurate information on disclosure forms and ff to incorporate additional data validation steps into the register in our opinion increased transparency and quality would positively impact policy decision making and further enhancement in our ability to analyze the wealth of existing data can contribute to this objective unique hf chemical trends with the resolved casn ff rows discussed above we explored the current state and trends in unique hf chemicals disclosure the selection of hf chemicals used in ouogd is a product of complex multi variable decision making our research takes the first step necessary to understand the variety and changes in hf chemicals impacting system risk and behavior the unique hf chemicals identified are compared with those chemicals reported in epa s 2016 study in this section we contrast the hf chemicals with epa s scil to determine if there are indications that the ouogd system is trending toward fewer and in general safer chemicals we acknowledge that the epa scil comparison is preliminary limited and inconclusive however the approach is a helpful initial scoping step toward more sophisticated comprehensive and conclusive research based on our analysis summarized in fig 3 a total of 1244 unique hf chemicals were identified and disclosed between 2014 and 2020 including all chemicals reported in epa s 2016 study the total count of disclosed unique hf chemicals rises to 1325 approximately 62 4 776 of the 1244 hf chemicals identified in our research were reported by the epa approximately 37 6 468 were not however when evaluated on an annual average basis approximately 75 7 of the unique hf chemicals identified in our research were included in epa s 2016 hf chemical list seventy two of the 1244 chemicals were consistently observed in 10 or more of the u s ff disclosure forms which is greater than the 35 of 1084 chemicals identified by epa for this criterion the range of chemical differences could be associated with various targeted product types or plays or basins targeted see 3 2 1 gas and oil well analysis and 3 2 2 state analysis for each study period for reference early modern u s ouogd focused on natural gas however oil has recently become the predominant hydrocarbon targeted in development yergin 2020 a 32 3 878 to 594 reduction in the number of unique hf chemicals was observed between 2014 and 2020 the root cause of this significant reduction in hf chemical variety is unknown and requires additional investigation we speculate that knowledge economics and social pressure regarding risk and sustainability have been influencing factors an examination of the effect of production type regulatory jurisdiction and play basin variety on hf chemicals is provided in subsections 3 2 1 gas and oil well analysis and 3 2 2 state analysis below epa s safer chemical ingredients list is a valuable resource for all industries and businesses striving to select safer products for the environment and public health the epa categorizes chemicals as verified to be of low concern based on experimental and modeled data green circle expected to be of low concern based on experimental and modeled data green half circle best in class chemical and among the safest available for a particular function yellow triangle and not be acceptable for use in products that are candidates for the safer choice label gray square the unique hf chemicals identified between 2014 and 2020 contained no chemicals labeled gray square fig 3 illustrates the percentage of hf chemicals in the green circle green half circle or yellow triangle groups approximately 21 6 269 of the 1244 hf chemicals are within these favorable scil categories there is a slightly increasing trend from 24 1 in 2014 to 30 3 in 2020 indicating a potential transition toward safer chemicals or away from more hazardous chemicals which we believe is an opportunity for further investigation gas and oil well analysis we analyzed the data from a production type i e oil or gas perspective to determine if the factor was significantly influencing hf chemicals between 2014 and 2020 production type metadata is not included in ff however recall that the ff chemical data was merged with enverus proprietary information using api numbers which allowed the association of production type with chemical level information some ff disclosures and chemicals were not included in the following analysis because ff and enverus api numbers did not match or api number was associated with an enverus production type that was not oil or gas our production type analysis is summarized in fig 4 most of the chemicals identified were used in both oil and gas wells however specific ingredients are unique to each product type oil wells consistently use more unique chemicals for well stimulation than gas wells this finding is expected because oil hydrocarbon molecules are more complex relative to natural gas fracturing tight oil formations requires adding chemicals to address potential production and integrity issues e g paraffin specific to this production type both production types have seen a reduction in hf chemical variety between 2014 and 2020 oil related chemicals dropped approximately 37 1 804 to 506 gas related chemicals were reduced by 34 4 657 to 431 over the same period based on this analysis the system factors e g knowledge economics social pressure influencing the range of hf chemicals in use appear to be impacting both oil and gas product type wells similarly and targeted well production types are not the root cause of the reduction in chemicals state analysis differences in regulatory jurisdiction can influence system behavior since states have primacy over most ouogd activities we choose to explore the current condition and trends in hf chemical diversity among states the eight states with the most ff hf chemical disclosure activity between 2014 and 2020 were selected as representative for our analysis texas tx oklahoma ok colorado co north dakota nd new mexico nm pennsylvania pa wyoming wy and ohio oh we found that the inclusion of all states artificially suppressed descriptive statistics e g mean median because some less active states had limited hf activity and data points in general states realized a reduction in hf chemical diversity between 2014 and 2020 the average annual number of unique chemicals used within the eight key states dropped approximately 46 6 382 to 204 based on this analysis other system factors e g knowledge economics social pressure influencing the range of hf chemicals disclosed appear to be impacting all states similarly however the general analysis of the eight representative states highlighted the relatively higher level of chemicals used in the state of texas which defined the upper statistical boundary this observation led us to investigate the correlation of play basin activity with hf chemical variety as shown in fig 5 the annual state active play basin and unique hf chemical count correlation were fitted r2 0 7064 with linear regression as shown in fig 5a a relatively strong relationship between variables at the state level indicates the number of active plays basins influences the variety of chemicals used and disclosed this finding is important because it supports that the oil and gas industry selects hf chemicals based on reservoir properties we attempted to perform the same analysis for all annual development activities across the u s to determine if the number of basins targeted in a given year was the cause of the trend in reduced hf chemicals between 2014 and 2020 shown in fig 5b this analysis illustrates an active play basin count between 26 and 27 has been maintained at a national level over the period of interest and a correlation between the variables is not apparent therefore the diversity in basin activity impacts the annual quantity of unique hf chemicals used within a state but it does not describe the national trend toward fewer chemicals there are fewer available national data points limited variability in national play basin count between years and the annual unique chemical count is a combination of all states all of which contribute to the lack of an apparent national trend hf and reference chemical list comparative analysis establishing context is an initial and critical step in risk management international organization for standardization 2018 there has been a significant amount of valuable research regarding the environmental and public health risks associated with hf chemicals us epa 2016a yost et al 2017 2016b however we could not identify peer reviewed comparisons between reference chemicals with more direct environmental and public exposure pathways and hf chemicals for a preliminary comparison we selected 12 354 readily available reference chemicals categorized as known or suspected to be in contact unrelated to hf with drinking water food or cosmetics see table 1 for list details using epa s comptox database this section describes and fig 6 illustrates the highlights from comparing the 12 354 reference and 1244 hf chemicals we believe that our analysis reinforces the usefulness and importance of epa s comptox echa s register and other chemical database investments representation of occurrence toxicological and physicochemical data availability for risk assessment data similarity captures the number of chemicals found in both lists 867 and the total percent of said chemicals in a given list toxicity estimation software tool test rat oral ld50 and open structure activity relations app opera water solubility 95 confidence intervals are reported drinking water resources are not intentionally subjected to hf chemicals however the risk of drinking water contamination caused by accidental surface spills subsurface migration or well blowouts exists us epa 2016a prudent operators and service companies utilize robust operating management systems standard operating procedures engineering designs and best management practices to reduce the risk of accidental breaches in primary e g pipe tank and secondary e g lined berms around the tank containments american petroleum institute 2012 ogp and ipieca 2014 state and federal regulations are in place to ensure compliance with minimum risk management standards related to chemical release mitigation reduction containment and remediation state review of oil natural gas environmental regulations inc 2000 in contrast known water food and other consumer product chemical additives and contaminants like those found in the reference chemical list are more certain to reach environmental and human receptors in these cases researchers and regulators focus on understanding exposure levels dose and associated risk of adverse outcomes response national research council 2009 our hypothesis was that when compared with hf chemicals reference chemicals would have a low level of chemical similarity more available toxicity fate and transport information and lower toxicity and mobility in the environment however from a chemical or dataset similarity perspective excluding withheld chemicals we found that hf chemicals made up approximately 7 0 of the reference chemicals and 70 0 of the hf chemicals were in the reference chemical list fig 7 the percentage of unique chemicals that are found on each list are not inclusive of withheld chemicals unfortunately unique withheld chemical names or casn are unavailable on fracfocus and therefore these similarity percentages could not be calculated also considering withheld chemicals it is important to note that if the numbers of withheld chemicals were included the percentages would be lower the relatively high similarity in chemicals was not expected given the risk perception surrounding hf chemicals chittick and srebotnjak 2017 elliott et al 2017 stringfellow et al 2017a and more direct human health exposure pathways of the reference chemicals other researchers have thoroughly identified and investigated water food and cosmetic chemical hazards separately pizzurro et al 2018 groh et al 2020 li and suh 2019 and we direct readers to these references for further discussion regarding these topics stringfellow et al 2017b compared chemical use between hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations but did not explore how these chemicals differed from known water food and cosmetic additives and contaminants the significance of our research is discovering the previously unexplored similarity between hf and reference chemical lists and an opportunity to investigate risk perception between these chemical sources we are not claiming the similarity between hf and reference chemicals indicates all hf chemicals have a low toxicity value for example benzyl chloride is a high toxicity chemical on both lists in table 2 we compare the reference and recently 2014 2020 disclosed hf chemicals with those hf chemicals previously identified by epa for having high oral slope factors osf yost et al 2016a six of the ten high osf chemicals determined by the epa were reported in hf fluids between 2014 and 2020 chromium vi was the only high osf chemical not specified in the reference chemical list and all nine of the overlapping chemicals were associated with food contact groh et al 2020 quinoline and 1 3 butadiene were also associated with cosmetics and drinking water pipes respectively pizzurro et al 2018 us epa 2021b it is crucial to note that association does not conclusively indicate human exposure or health risk which is valid for reference and hf chemicals however these findings do highlight research opportunities regarding holistic chemical risk information availability knowledge perception and decision making for example physicians for social responsibility horwitt 2021 investigated the use of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances in oil and gas operations between 2012 and 2020 related chemicals were found in more than 1200 wells in texas arkansas louisana oklahoma new mexico and wyoming but most frequent use occurred prior to 2016 maguire boyle and barron 2014 reported the detection of the following fluorinated compounds used as flow tracers in produced waters from shale gas wells in texas 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 heptafluorobutyl undecylate 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 hepta fluoro butanoic acid undecylate ester c3f7c o oc11h24 cis 4 ethyl 5 octyl 2 2 bis tri fluoromethyl 1 3 dioxolane iii and tri fluoromethy tetradecylate trifluoroacetic acid tetradecyl ester cf3c o oc14h29 limitation in available hf chemical toxicological information has been claimed by many researchers stringfellow et al 2017a trickey et al 2020 us epa 2016a waxman et al 2011 yost et al 2016a based on our research we agree there are gaps in hf chemical toxicological data however we sought to understand if these limitations were unique to hf chemical or a more general systemic issue the toxval database aggregates toxicity values from 18 separate public databases and as of august 2018 contained 772 721 toxicity values from 29 sources of data 21 507 sub sources 4585 journals and 69 833 literature citations us epa 2021b toxval provides a binary indicator whether or not toxicity values are available in 18 separate public databases the epa s integrated risk information system iris is included in the toxval database but iris is governed by a more rigorous process than other toxval resources and therefore we reported iris values independently as well the toxval and iris databases consist of many different toxicity dose measures captured at study or chemical levels based on various methodologies including measures such as epa regional screening levels reference dose rfd reference concentrations rfc slope factors sf point of departure pod lowest observed adverse effect levels loael no observed adverse effect levels noael no effect levels nel low effect levels lel cancer related quantities e g cancer slope factors inhalation unit risk and other derived quantities both toxval and iris specific metadata have been incorporated into the epa s comptox system making comptox an efficient and effective resource for conducting a preliminary comparative analysis of different chemical lists our research did not explore or compare methodologies used to develop toxicity values nor evaluate the quality of toxicity data included in those database when exporting a list of chemicals from epa s comptox system the toxval and iris fields register a y with a hyperlink to the values when toxicity data is available we used these binary comptox features to determine the percent of chemicals with toxval and iris toxicological information approximately 92 4 and 90 3 of the hf and reference chemicals respectively were indicated as having toxval values in comptox regarding iris values we found approximately 5 4 and 1 8 of the hf and reference chemicals respectively were reported in comptox the toxval and iris comparisons suggest that there was no significant difference in the availability of toxicological information between hf and reference chemicals therefore hf toxicological data limitations are potentially a product of a systemic issue and not unique to the oil and gas industry this specific hypothesis requires additional investigation however other shortcomings in toxicological information across all sectors have been acknowledged by others silbergeld et al 2015 wang et al 2020 2019 in addition researchers and regulatory agencies worldwide are investing heavily to continuously improve chemical information systems and content evans et al 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2017 westphal et al 2017 williams et al 2017 chemical qsar modeling is one technology accelerating the availability of chemical property information that can be used in risk assessments and decision making lowe and williams 2021 qsar embodies various chemical property and activity prediction techniques based on their structural similarity to chemicals with established activities and properties based on qsar technology epa has developed test and opera test s primary purpose is predicting toxicological values opera focuses on calculating expected physicochemical properties and environmental fate both test and opera estimated values have been incorporated into the comptox dashboard it is worth noting that there are uncertainties and limitations of these estimation tools for example they cannot estimate properties for the inorganic chemicals or mixtures we selected the test rat oral lethal dose ld50 and opera water solubility parameters to conduct our preliminary comparison of the availability of osar toxicological and environmental fate property values for hf and reference chemicals the test rat oral ld50 toxicity parameter forecasts the amount of a chemical per body mass mol kg that will cause death in 50 of an animal test group the humane aspect of qsar is clearly another benefit of developing and using this technology the opera water solubility physicochemical property value calculates the maximum chemical quantity that can dissolve in water mol l reference chemicals were found to have a higher percentage of test rat oral ld50 and opera water solubility values in comptox a contributing factor to these results is the proportion of inorganic chemicals and chemical mixture in the hf chemical list however the research findings are clear reference chemicals have a higher percentage of available qsar toxicity and physicochemical property information an investigation of the test rat oral ld50 and opera water solubility value statistics provided additional insights worth noting for example assuming a normal distribution and using a 95 confidence interval there does not appear to be a significant difference between hf and reference chemical test rat oral ld50 values at 0 0215 0 0022 mol kg and 0 0193 0 0005 mol kg respectively a significant difference in opera water solubility values was observed as shown in fig 6 the u s epa generated qsar predicted oral toxicity values for 44 515 1173 of hf flowback and produced chemicals that they identified and investigated yost et al 2016b which is comparable to the proportions 30 2 found in our research fig 6 however we were unable to identify peer reviewed studies that contrasted the availability of hf chemical information with a list of non hf reference chemicals for reference existing research has focused primarily on the availability and characteristics of hf chemicals without the more holistic reference chemical perspective our investigation shows that there is value in expanding the scope of chemical evaluations to provide systemic context to stakeholders and understand sources of potential chemical contamination and exposures to drinking water resources conclusions risks to drinking water resources caused by ouogd are controlled by a complex and dynamic sociotechnical system comprised of interconnected functions it is critical that researchers policymakers and industry leaders investigate system dynamics to understand functional behaviors including current risk levels and trends our research explores the evolution of hf chemicals between 2014 and 2020 providing a temporal analysis of additives used and disclosed in fracfocus during ouogd in the u s it is important to note that there were data limitations including the withholding of 15 23 of hf chemical row data found in fracfocus however the provided updated list of hydraulic fracturing chemicals evaluation of influencing factors information availability assessment and comparison with known or suspected water food or cosmetic contaminants or ingredients have critical implications and enable the opportunity to explore the following recommended research topics identifying specific chemical variability between production types e g oil gas states years and other key factors performing and updating risk assessments fate and transport and toxicological studies related to hydraulic fracturing chemicals identifying greener and safer chemicals and supporting related product development and related decision support tools studying risk perception and management practices associated with hf and ouogd chemicals maturing and fostering the use of environmental social and governance key performance indicators related to industrial chemicals it should be noted that our results highlighted that the availability of information for reference chemicals with more direct human exposure pathways is similar to hf chemicals they do not imply that these chemicals are safe the safety of chemical is dependent on multiple factors especially concentration dose all chemical databases have limitations for example generally regarded as safe chemicals defined under u s 21 cfr parts 182 and 184 are not approved by the u s food and drug administration and are not publicly evaluated the availability of physicochemical and toxicological data on these chemicals is highly unlikely we believe that our foundational research indicates past progress and future opportunities for improvement related to hydraulic fracturing

16469,wastewater treatment plants wwtps receive sewage water from a variety of sources including livestock farms hospitals industries and households that contain antimicrobial resistant bacteria arb and antimicrobial resistant genes args current treatment technologies are unable to completely remove arb and args which are eventually released into the aquatic environment this study focused on the core resistome of urban wwtps that are persistent through wastewater treatment processes we adopted the hiseq based metagenomic sequencing approach to identify the core resistome their genetic context and pathogenic potential of core args in the influent in and effluent ef samples of 12 urban wwtps in south korea in this study the abundance of args ranged from 0 32 to 3 5 copies of args per copy of the 16s rrna gene where the in samples were relatively higher than the ef samples especially for the macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls and tetracycline resistant genes on the other hand there were 43 core args sharing up to 90 of the total among which the relative abundance of sul1 aph 3ʹʹ lb and rbpa was higher in ef than in in p 0 05 moreover tetracycline and sulfonamide related core args in both ef and in were significantly more abundant on plasmids than on chromosomes p 0 05 we also found that the majority of core args were carried by opportunistic pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in both in and ef in addition phages were the only mobile elements whose abundance correlated with that of core args in ef suggesting that transduction may play a major role in disseminating args in the receiving water environment of the urban wwtp the persistent release of core args with pathogenic potential into

reduction or removal of args is significant because treated water is used for human activities to avoid global water scarcity threats guo et al 2020 wwtps generally decrease the overall abundance of args therefore the chances of dissemination of args to the environment are low ben et al 2017 hultman et al 2018b however some studies have reported that wwtps may cause args to proliferate in the

influent in and effluent ef samples of twelve urban wwtps from major cities in south korea we also conducted a five year longitudinal analysis of resistome and core resistome of two of the twelve wwtps located in seoul south korea we adopted the metagenomic sequencing approach using the illumina hiseq 4000 platform to characterize resistome profiles identify the genetic context of core args and investigate the possible host of core args among potentially pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecium staphylococcus aureus klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas

bengtsson palme et al 2015 whereas metaphlan2 was used for metagenomic taxonomic profiling truong et al 2015 the abundance of args was normalized to the copy number of 16s rrna genes as previously described ma et al 2016 in addition human origin fecal pollution was estimated by mapping all the clean metagenomic reads against the crassphage genome accession number nc 024711 1 using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 and its coverage was calculated using samtools li et al 2009 metagenomic assembly for each sample was performed with megahit using default parameters li et al 2015 and contigs less than 1 kb were excluded from further analysis to calculate the coverage of contigs metagenomic reads were mapped to each contig using bwa mem li and durbin 2010 while samtools li et al 2009 was used to calculate the coverage depth of each contig the relative abundance of contigs was calculated as hits per million hpm using an in house perl script provided by edge li et al 2017 prior to annotation open reading frames orfs were predicted with prodigal hyatt et al 2010 using p and c options and blastp was used to annotate the contigs against the curated arg database the orfs were also queried to bacmet pal et al 2014 vfgs chen et al 2005 and mges https github com katariinaparnanen mobilegeneticelementdatabase databases to annotate metal resistant genes virulence factor genes vfgs and mges respectively we used the filtering criteria of more than 80 identity e value of 1e 10 and minimum alignment length of 35 aa the plasmid or chromosomal origin of each contig was identified using plasflow v1 2 krawczyk et al 2018 with default parameters kaiju menzel et al 2016 was used in the greedy mode for taxonomic assignment of each contig the metacompare computational framework oh et al 2018 was used to characterize the resistome risk in each sample and vibrant kieft et al 2020 was used to identify the phage contigs 2 4 statistical analysis the differential abundance analysis of arg classes between ef and in was performed using stamp parks et al 2014 software and linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used for differential abundance analysis of arg types principal component analysis pca for the relative abundance of args was created using an online shiny app clustvis metsalu and vilo 2015 correlation between args and taxonomic abundance was determined with pearson s correlation test in r using the corrplot and hmisc packages briefly metaphlan2 based microbial community was taken and a correlation matrix for core args and major genera was constructed to avoid ambiguous correlations we did not include genera that were present in less than 90 of the samples moreover seaborn and statannot libraries were used in python to create a heatmap of core args bacterial genera carrying args and microbial taxonomy structure box plots were constructed in python based on seaborn and statannot libraries for args carrying plasmids or chromosomal contigs and alpha diversity analysis of both the microbiome and resistome the co occurrence network for core args with bacterial host or the eskape pathogens was performed using spearman s relation coefficient and the networks were visualized using gephi software bastian et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of args and microbial community structure in treated wastewater the resistome analysis of all wwtp samples showed that in generally had a higher abundance of args than did ef the abundance of args in in ranges from 0 43 to 3 5 copies of args per copy of 16s rrna genes while it ranges from 0 32 to 1 4 copy for en with an exception we observed that ef from sn 18 nk nj jr 19 and gj 1 showed a relatively higher abundance of args compared to in suggesting that these wwtps enriched args during the treatment process in showed a higher diversity of args than ef except at sn 18 sn 16 and nj wwtps we detected 165 725 different args in the in and 124 548 in the ef principal component analysis pca with the relative abundance of args revealed that arg diversity was similar between ef and in though in showed slightly greater diversity fig 1 a the args of aminoglycoside bacitracin betalactam and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls were highly abundant in all the sampling sites fig 1 b baca aph 3ʹʹ ib sul1 and qach were the most abundant genes in both in and ef the higher abundance of bacitracin and baca has been reported to be due to prophylactic use and growth promoter use in swine farms mackie et al 2006 this gene has also been reported to be abundant in wastewater christgen et al 2015 activated sludge yoo et al 2020a and drinking water jia et al 2015 the ability of the baca gene is known to be persistent through the wwtp process as it produces peptidoglycan and other cellular components to enhance resistance to external stress chen et al 2016 christgen et al 2015 aminoglycosides sulfonamides betalactam and fluoroquinolones are commonly used antibiotics in both humans and veterinary clinics thus their higher abundance in in could be linked to their wider use concentrations of sulfonamide antibiotics in wwtps were found to be correlated with the abundance of the sul1 gene in wwtps gao et al 2012 their chemical stability and solubility help them survive high external stress gao et al 2012 yoo et al 2020b sludge is considered to be the reservoir of fluoroquinolone antibiotics during treatment and these antibiotics are reported to be barely degradable due to their chemical structure osińska et al 2016 certain opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria are often found in wwtp systems and their active outer membrane proteins with the help of beta lactam genes aid these bacteria in surviving external stress during wastewater treatment kim et al 2018 these results suggest that wwtps are unable to remove major args which are released into the aquatic environment the abundance of args was significantly and positively correlated with tn and tp p 0 05 while other physiochemical parameters including the population coverage number of medical and pharmaceutical facilities and sewage water treatment capacity of the wwtps did not show significant correlation with the arg abundance on the other hand arg diversity was negatively correlated with the temperature and ph p 0 05 fig s1 both the tn and tp are associated with the raw sewage water which contains huge amount of organic nutrients and could provide selection pressure on persistence of args and arbs rizzo et al 2013 differential abundance analysis of the arg classes revealed that only mls and tetracycline related args were significantly higher in in than in ef p 0 05 the args of phenicol aminoglycoside sulfonamide and fluoroquinolones were more abundant than other args in ef but not in in fig 1 c suggesting that the current treatment strategies are able to remove a significant portion of only mls and tetracycline genes differential abundance analysis lefse of arg types showed that six args sul1 acc 6ʹ 31 aada5 aada22 rbpa and qnrb40 were significantly more abundant in ef and nine args were more abundant in in mdtg aac 6ʹ tet 39 emra mphg aaca4 cpxa mupa and maca p 0 05 fig 1 d these args released by wwtps are frequently detected in clinical settings indicating that ef contains more clinically related args than environmental args as described in a study of european wwtps that indicates that wwtps may mirror the clinical resistome pärnänen et al 2019 analysis of the microbial community showed that proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum followed by actinobacteria bacteroidetes and viruses as well as abundant genera pseudomonas followed by acinetobacter and deinococcus in in and ef fig s2 we did not observe a significant microbial community difference between the in and ef groups we found t4 like and t7 like viruses in both in and ef for whom specific gram negative bacteria such as members of the family enterobacteriaceae serve as natural hosts these phage like viruses can act as carriers in arg transfer lu et al 2020 3 2 resistome and microbiome analysis based on treatment strategies twelve wwtps were selected for this study five of them used a chlorine based treatment strategy four used uv and the rest used ozone based treatment procedures among the uv and chlorine operating wwtps we did not find any differentially abundant arg classes between in and ef fig s3 for the wwtps working on ozone based treatment strategies we found only mls based args that were differentially abundant in in relative to ef samples we observed an increased abundance of sulfonamide based args in the ef of both uv and ozone based wwtps while aminoglycoside was found in increased abundance in the ef of chlorine based wwtps although these results were non significant in in and ef but their persistent release into the environmental waters means that wwtps either facilitate the propagation of args or add the pre existing args moreover uv based treatments have been reported to enrich sulfadiazine tetracycline and chloramphenicol args guo et al 2013 while betalactam args have been reported to be increased by uv chlorine and ozone based treatment strategies alexander et al 2016 ferro et al 2017 liu et al 2018a sulfonamide based args have been reported to be enriched during the chlorination process liu et al 2018a furthermore we investigated how the wwtp treatment process affects the alpha diversity of the resistome and microbiome the results in fig s4 show that none of the treatment processes affected the diversity of the resistome or the microbiome while ozone and uv decreased microbiome species richness p 0 05 mann whitney u test and ozone alone decreased resistome species richness p 0 001 mann whitney u test these results suggest that ozone is most effective in removing minor species of bacteria and types of args but the majority of genera and args persist regardless of the type of treatment process previously it was suggested that chlorine could enrich args during the treatment process liu et al 2018a but we observed that chlorine treatment did not affect the resistome or microbiome 3 3 identification of core resistome and determination of their genetic context in this study we defined the core resistome as persistent args that were identified in all sites irrespective of the treatment process or location we identified 48 different args that were detected in all sampling sites where aminoglycoside bacitracin and betalactam were the most abundant fig 2 a the proportion of core args in each sample ranged between 30 and 94 fig s5 indicating that a relatively large portion of args was persistent and abundant irrespective of the treatment method antibiotic residues and args have been reported in treated water al riyami et al 2018 providing a persistent selection pressure and possibly resulting in the occurrence or emergence of novel antimicrobial determinants an et al 2018 therefore a high proportion of core args in ef suggest that these args are regularly disseminated into the environment raising serious public health concerns certain anthropogenic parameters like population coverage medical and pharmaceutical facilities capacity of wwtps and the tn of sewage water was significantly correlated with the core args fig s1 suggesting that anthropogenic activities may result in increasing the abundance of persistent args moreover the relative abundance of individual core resistomes revealed that the abundance of aph 3ʹʹ ib sul1 and rbpa was significantly higher in ef than in in while only arna was higher in in than in ef p 0 05 mann whitney u test figs 2 b s6 the increased abundance in ef suggests that wwtps provide favorable conditions for either the proliferation of these args or the addition of pre existing args in the treated water for instance activated sludge has been reported to be the main source of sul1 munir et al 2011 and uv can enrich the abundance of rifampicin resistant genes in final effluents guo et al 2013 arg richness in treated water has also been reported to be strongly influenced by the biomass composition of influents ju et al 2019 taken together these observations indicate that wwtps make the receiving environment more vulnerable to identify the genetic makeup of core args in the ef samples we checked their presence on plasmid or chromosomal contigs as well as co occurrence with mges vfgs and metal resistant genes we observed that a significantly higher abundance of core args against aminoglycoside and bacitracin was found on the chromosome while significantly more core args against sulfonamide and tetracycline were on plasmids p 0 01 mann whitney u test fig 3 in the in samples we observed that sulfonamide tetracycline and mls were significantly more abundant on plasmid contigs p 0 01 mann whitney u test fig s7 chromosomal args related to aminoglycoside and bacitracin are reported to increase the minimum inhibitory concentration mic by expressing more than those on plasmids and these chromosomal drug modifying enzymes are transmissible among other genera islam et al 2009 in addition a higher mic may often lead to the persistence of these args in environmental settings moreover chromosomal args have the ability to easily undergo mutations due to their involvement with impermeability type resistance or efflux mediated resistance westbrock wadman et al 1999 the uptake of args by hgt may also end up in chromosomes and the free dna released by chromosomes can also be taken up by neighboring bacteria croucher et al 2016 the dissemination mechanisms for chromosomal args need to be clarified through further investigations on the other hand args carried by plasmids are of great clinical concern due to their association with pathogenic bacteria and their ability to undergo hgt more readily carattoli 2013 san millan 2018 in line with our results it has been reported that sulfonamide and tetracycline resistant genes were the most ubiquitous args in environmental waters due to their presence on plasmids stange et al 2019 furthermore the association of core args with mges metal resistant genes phages vfgs and resistome risk score was evaluated our results showed that mges plasmid based args chromosomal args and resistome score were significantly correlated with the abundance of core args in in while only the abundance of phages was correlated with the abundance of core args in ef p 0 05 fig 4 interestingly metal resistant genes and vfgs were correlated with the abundance of chromosomal args only which indicates that these are not as transmissible as mges although we did not find any correlation between core args and mges or plasmids we detected mges and plasmids in ef suggesting that their persistent release into the environment would be problematic lysogenic phages have the ability to transfer bacterial genetic information through transduction these phages are ubiquitous and abundant in aquatic environments thus they are potential carriers of core args jebri et al 2021 the mges of the family enterobacteriaceae have the ability to hijack the dna packing ability of phages for the transfer of args fillol salom et al 2019 our results suggest that the role of these args should be carefully evaluated to better understand the factors involved in their persistence 3 4 correlation and co occurrence analysis of core resistome and microbiome possible bacterial hosts of the core args were identified by spearman correlation analysis from which we observed a different correlation network for in and ef the correlation pattern shown for in revealed that oxa 233 aac 6ʹ ib and aada2 were the major args that were associated with at least 10 different bacterial genera while alicycliphilus and rhodopseudomonas were the major bacterial genera correlated with at least six different args fig s8a alicycliphilus denitrificans and rhodopseudomonas palustris are quinolone degrading bacteria but have also been reported to be carrying args in wwtps mutharasaiah et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 in ef aac 6ʹ 31 and ges 3 were correlated with a minimum of seven different bacterial genera while arcobacter desulfovibrio and tolumonas were associated with at least four different args fig s8b arcobacter and tolumonas have been reported to be associated with arg transmission in effluents and influents of wwtps hultman et al 2018a millar and raghavan 2017 while desulfovibrio has also been reported to be associated with mobile args in wwtps wang et al 2013 the abundance of contigs carrying args was summarized according to the taxonomy assigned to each contig fig s9 the results showed that in in and ef pseudomonas acinetobacter rahnella and enterobacter were the major arg carrying genera some of these are known opportunistic pathogens and are also reported to carry multiple args yuan et al 2019 acinetobacter pseudomonas rahnella and janthinobacterium were the major bacterial genera carrying core args while similar genera were identified as potential hosts carrying core args in in and ef massilia was found to be relatively higher in ef than in in massilia spp have been reported in diverse habitats but mainly among the root colonizing bacteria in the soil microbiome ofek et al 2012 these opportunistic bacteria especially acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp can easily develop multidrug resistance properties additionally owing to their ability to adapt to various aquatic environments they can even exploit wwtps as a possible microbial niche bonomo and szabo 2006 trautmann et al 2005 warskow and juni 1972 correlation analysis between eskape pathogens and core arg abundance indicated that acinetobacter baumannii enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the major species carrying core args in both in and ef fig 5 these results suggest that the core args in correlation with eskape pathogens are of immediate concern for public health and environmental protection eskape pathogens are difficult to treat because of their outer membranes and they can migrate easily in different environmental compartments bairán et al 2020 moreover these pathogens have been detected during all phases of the treatment process in wwtps che et al 2019 3 5 five year longitudinal analysis among the 12 wwtps we monitored the jr and sn wwtps for five years to investigate temporal differences in antibiotic resistance these wwtps are located in seoul the capital of south korea with high anthropogenic activity the abundance of args in in was generally higher than in ef with a few exceptions the trend was almost identical in all five years in which aminoglycoside bacitracin and beta lactam were the major arg classes fig 1 b during these five years the abundance of sul1 was always significantly higher in ef in both wwtps p 0 05 we observed a slightly different pattern of resistome in the 2017 and 2019 samples in the pca analysis fig 6 b in the core resistome analysis of both wwtps 48 different args were identified to be persistent throughout the five years the abundance of core args was consistently more than 55 of the total arg abundance in the ef of jr while for sn it was always more than 65 throughout the five years bacitracin was the most abundant arg class observed in both wwtps followed by aminoglycosides and sulfonamides fig 6 a pca analysis revealed that these wwtps were more similar in the core resistome profile than in the total resistome the treated water of these two wwtps is often mixed with the han river which is prone to anthropogenic activities the geographical location of the han river shows an increased population density downstream lee et al 2020 making the persistent release of args a major public health concern 4 conclusion in conclusion we analyzed the core resistome profiles of urban wwtp in and ef by adopting a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach the results of our study indicate that clinically important args are not properly treated using current strategies aminoglycoside bacitracin and betalactam are continuously released into the environment which could result in the development of extreme drug resistance xdr pathogens wwtps operating with different treatment strategies including uv ozone and chlorine based treatment methods were not found to reduce arg richness in the final efs pseudomonas and acinetobacter were the major genera found to carry the core args when attempting to describe the pathogenic potential of core args and eskape pathogens we did not find any significant difference between the co occurrence patterns of in and ef samples moreover most of the core args were located on chromosomal contigs but we found that sulfonamide and tetracycline args were significantly abundant in plasmid contigs which further implicates the mobility of these args in the environment although neither mges plasmids nor eskape pathogens in ef were correlated with core args their consistent presence in the treated water could make them readily available for uptake by environmental bacteria

16469,wastewater treatment plants wwtps receive sewage water from a variety of sources including livestock farms hospitals industries and households that contain antimicrobial resistant bacteria arb and antimicrobial resistant genes args current treatment technologies are unable to completely remove arb and args which are eventually released into the aquatic environment this study focused on the core resistome of urban wwtps that are persistent through wastewater treatment processes we adopted the hiseq based metagenomic sequencing approach to identify the core resistome their genetic context and pathogenic potential of core args in the influent in and effluent ef samples of 12 urban wwtps in south korea in this study the abundance of args ranged from 0 32 to 3 5 copies of args per copy of the 16s rrna gene where the in samples were relatively higher than the ef samples especially for the macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls and tetracycline resistant genes on the other hand there were 43 core args sharing up to 90 of the total among which the relative abundance of sul1 aph 3ʹʹ lb and rbpa was higher in ef than in in p 0 05 moreover tetracycline and sulfonamide related core args in both ef and in were significantly more abundant on plasmids than on chromosomes p 0 05 we also found that the majority of core args were carried by opportunistic pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in both in and ef in addition phages were the only mobile elements whose abundance correlated with that of core args in ef suggesting that transduction may play a major role in disseminating args in the receiving water environment of the urban wwtp the persistent release of core args with pathogenic potential into environmental water is of immediate concern the mobility of args and arbs in the environment is a major public health concern these results should be taken into consideration when developing policy to

in lower middle income countries clinical and domestic sewage waters are released into aquatic environments without proper treatment and may contain args of immediate concern recently the role of amr in environmental water has been emphasized by who and the united nation s un food and agriculture organization fao in the context of safe water and better sanitation un 2016 who 2020 args had become an emerging environmental pollutant which have expected to cause up to 10 million deaths by 2050 o neill 2016 args have been widely identified in diverse environmental settings such as the surface

2014 jo et al 2021 and even the pristine environments van goethem et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps act as an interface between environmental bacteria fecal bacteria and clinically pathogenic bacteria because wwtps receive tons of sewage water daily from various sources they may contain enriched chemicals nutrients heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria chait et al 2016 rizzo et al 2013 bacteria originating from various sources also contain a diverse range of args but current sewage water treatment processes are not fully equipped to remove all args from sewage water pazda et al 2019 these args persist during the treatment process and are eventually released with reclaimed water which is used either for recreational purposes or as drinking water source guo et al 2020

communities gupta et al 2018 once arg transmission starts it becomes very difficult to efficiently eliminate arb owing to their mobilization ability alexander et al 2020 the persistence and mobility of clinically relevant args in complex environments exhibit a risk to human health in the post antibiotic era carvalho and santos 2016 liu et al 2018b the role of sewage water treatment in the reduction or removal of args is significant because treated water is used for human activities to avoid global water scarcity threats guo et al 2020 wwtps generally decrease the overall abundance of args therefore the chances of dissemination of args to the environment are low ben et al 2017 hultman et al 2018b however some studies have reported that wwtps may cause args to proliferate in the environment guo et al 2017 hultman et al 2018b kumar et al 2020 lira et al 2020 raza et al 2021 the relative proportion of args in downstream water environment have also been reported to increase significantly as compared to the upstream aquatic environment mukherjee et al 2021 raza et al 2021 therefore the purpose of the present study was to investigate the core antibiotic resistome between influent in and effluent ef samples of twelve urban wwtps from major cities in south korea we also conducted a five year longitudinal analysis of resistome and core resistome of two of the twelve wwtps located in seoul south korea we adopted the metagenomic sequencing approach using the illumina hiseq 4000 platform to characterize resistome profiles identify the genetic context of core args and investigate the possible host of core args among potentially pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecium staphylococcus aureus klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp eskape to provide a more detailed understanding of their roles in treated water 2 material and methods 2 1 water sampling and processing in and ef were collected from 12 wwtps youngcheon yc suyeong sy gangbyeon gb namak nk naju nj jangseong js hwasun hs gwangju gj1 and gj2 daegu dg jungrang jr and seonam sn jr and sn were sampled once a year for five years from

different strategies for wastewater treatment physiochemical parameters of water samples including temperature and ph were measured using pro2030 geotech denver co usa while total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total soluble solids tss were measured in accordance with the korea environment water works institute http www kewi re kr all physiochemical parameters sampling date population served medical facilities coverage treatment capacity and treatment method followed by each wwtp are summarized in table s1 all samples were collected in 4 l sterile sampling bottles and were transported to the laboratory under refrigerated conditions 4 c within 6 h of sampling samples were pre filtered through a 10 μm membrane to remove eukaryotic cells especially algae then filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size membrane advantec dublin ca usa to capture bacterial cells the filter membranes were stored at 20 c until further processing 2 2 metagenomic dna extraction and sequencing membrane filters were used for the extraction of metagenomic dna we used a powerwater dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions and the dna concentration and quality were measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop nd 2000 thermo scientific usa the extracted dna was sent to macrogen inc seoul south korea for high throughput sequencing using an illumina hiseq 4000 platform 2 150 bp on average 20 gb of metagenomic reads were generated for each sample raw sequencing data for each sample used in this study was deposited at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database in the fastq format and is available under the bioproject accession number prjna506137 raw sequencing data for each sample used in this study was deposited at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database in the fastq format and is available under the bioproject accession number prjna506137 2 3 shotgun metagenomic data analysis prior to resistome analysis pre processing of metagenomic reads was performed by removing adapter sequences and low quality reads using fastq quality control software faqcs lo and chain 2014 we manually curated an arg reference gene database for resistome analysis briefly we selected six commonly used arg databases card mcarthur et al 2013 sarg yin et al 2018 resfam gibson et al 2015 argminer arango argoty et al 2020 argannot gupta et al 2014 and refseq arg proteins https www ncbi nlm nih gov pathogens refgene and retrieved 35 430 arg sequences by concatenating all downloaded protein sequences we used the cd hit clustering algorithm li and godzik 2006 to remove duplicated sequences with 100 identity and retrieved 16 209 unique arg protein sequences we also removed intrinsic args annotated as multidrug resistant efflux pumps from downstream analysis quality trimmed metagenomic reads were annotated against the curated arg database using diamond blastx buchfink et al 2015 using the previously described filtering criteria raza et al 2021 the number of 16s rrna genes was identified using default parameters of metaxa2 bengtsson palme et al 2015 whereas metaphlan2 was used for metagenomic taxonomic profiling truong et al 2015 the abundance of args was normalized to the copy number of 16s rrna genes as previously described ma et al 2016 in addition human origin fecal pollution was estimated by mapping all the clean metagenomic reads against the crassphage genome accession number nc 024711 1 using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 and its coverage was calculated using samtools li et al 2009 metagenomic assembly for each sample was performed with megahit using default parameters li et al 2015 and contigs less than 1 kb were excluded from further analysis to calculate the coverage of contigs metagenomic reads were mapped to each contig using bwa mem li and durbin 2010 while samtools li et al 2009 was used to calculate the coverage depth of each contig the relative abundance of contigs was calculated as hits per million hpm using an in house perl script provided by edge li et al 2017 prior to annotation open reading frames orfs were predicted with prodigal hyatt et al 2010 using p and c options and blastp was used to annotate the contigs against the curated arg database the orfs were also queried to bacmet pal et al 2014 vfgs chen et al 2005 and mges https github com katariinaparnanen mobilegeneticelementdatabase databases to annotate metal resistant genes virulence factor genes vfgs and mges respectively we used the filtering criteria of more than 80 identity e value of 1e 10 and minimum alignment length of 35 aa the plasmid or chromosomal origin of each contig was identified using plasflow v1 2 krawczyk et al 2018 with default parameters kaiju menzel et al 2016 was used in the greedy mode for taxonomic assignment of each contig the metacompare computational framework oh et al 2018 was used to characterize the resistome risk in each sample and vibrant kieft et al 2020 was used to identify the phage contigs 2 4 statistical analysis the differential abundance analysis of arg classes between ef and in was performed using stamp parks et al 2014 software and linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used for differential abundance analysis of arg types principal component analysis pca for the relative abundance of args was created using an online shiny app clustvis metsalu and vilo 2015 correlation between args and taxonomic abundance was determined with pearson s correlation test in r using the corrplot and hmisc packages briefly metaphlan2 based microbial community was taken and a correlation matrix for core args and major genera was constructed to avoid ambiguous correlations we did not include genera that were present in less than 90 of the samples moreover seaborn and statannot libraries were used in python to create a heatmap of core args bacterial genera carrying args and microbial taxonomy structure box plots were constructed in python based on seaborn and statannot libraries for args carrying plasmids or chromosomal contigs and alpha diversity analysis of both the microbiome and resistome the co occurrence network for core args with bacterial host or the eskape pathogens was performed using spearman s relation coefficient and the networks were visualized using gephi software bastian et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of args and microbial community structure in treated wastewater the resistome analysis of all wwtp samples showed that in generally had a higher abundance of args than did ef the abundance of args in in ranges from 0 43 to 3 5 copies of args per copy of 16s rrna genes while it ranges from 0 32 to 1 4 copy for en with an exception we observed that ef from sn 18 nk nj jr 19 and gj 1 showed a relatively higher abundance of args compared to in suggesting that these wwtps enriched args during the treatment process in showed a higher diversity of args than ef except at sn 18 sn 16 and nj wwtps we detected 165 725 different args in the in and 124 548 in the ef principal component analysis pca with the relative abundance of args revealed that arg diversity was similar between ef and in though in showed slightly greater diversity fig 1 a the args of aminoglycoside bacitracin betalactam and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls were highly abundant in all the sampling sites fig 1 b baca aph 3ʹʹ ib sul1 and qach were the most abundant genes in both in and ef the higher abundance of bacitracin and baca has been reported to be due to prophylactic use and growth promoter use in swine farms mackie et al 2006 this gene has also been reported to be abundant in wastewater christgen et al 2015 activated sludge yoo et al 2020a and drinking water jia et al 2015 the ability of the baca gene is known to be persistent through the wwtp process as it produces peptidoglycan and other cellular components to enhance resistance to external stress chen et al 2016 christgen et al 2015 aminoglycosides sulfonamides betalactam and fluoroquinolones are commonly used antibiotics in both humans and veterinary clinics thus their higher abundance in in could be linked to their wider use concentrations of sulfonamide antibiotics in wwtps were found to be correlated with the abundance of the sul1 gene in wwtps gao et al 2012 their chemical stability and solubility help them survive high external stress gao et al 2012 yoo et al 2020b sludge is considered to be the reservoir of fluoroquinolone antibiotics during treatment and these antibiotics are reported to be barely degradable due to their chemical structure osińska et al 2016 certain opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria are often found in wwtp systems and their active outer membrane proteins with the help of beta lactam genes aid these bacteria in surviving external stress during wastewater treatment kim et al 2018 these results suggest that wwtps are unable to remove major args which are released into the aquatic environment the abundance of args was significantly and positively correlated with tn and tp p 0 05 while other physiochemical parameters including the population coverage number of medical and pharmaceutical facilities and sewage water treatment capacity of the wwtps did not show significant correlation with the arg abundance on the other hand arg diversity was negatively correlated with the temperature and ph p 0 05 fig s1 both the tn and tp are associated with the raw sewage water which contains huge amount of organic nutrients and could provide selection pressure on persistence of args and arbs rizzo et al 2013 differential abundance analysis of the arg classes revealed that only mls and tetracycline related args were significantly higher in in than in ef p 0 05 the args of phenicol aminoglycoside sulfonamide and fluoroquinolones were more abundant than other args in ef but not in in fig 1 c suggesting that the current treatment strategies are able to remove a significant portion of only mls and tetracycline genes differential abundance analysis lefse of arg types showed that six args sul1 acc 6ʹ 31 aada5 aada22 rbpa and qnrb40 were significantly more abundant in ef and nine args were more abundant in in mdtg aac 6ʹ tet 39 emra mphg aaca4 cpxa mupa and maca p 0 05 fig 1 d these args released by wwtps are frequently detected in clinical settings indicating that ef contains more clinically related args than environmental args as described in a study of european wwtps that indicates that wwtps may mirror the clinical resistome pärnänen et al 2019 analysis of the microbial community showed that proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum followed by actinobacteria bacteroidetes and viruses as well as abundant genera pseudomonas followed by acinetobacter and deinococcus in in and ef fig s2 we did not observe a significant microbial community difference between the in and ef groups we found t4 like and t7 like viruses in both in and ef for whom specific gram negative bacteria such as members of the family enterobacteriaceae serve as natural hosts these phage like viruses can act as carriers in arg transfer lu et al 2020 3 2 resistome and microbiome analysis based on treatment strategies twelve wwtps were selected for this study five of them used a chlorine based treatment strategy four used uv and the rest used ozone based treatment procedures among the uv and chlorine operating wwtps we did not find any differentially abundant arg classes between in and ef fig s3 for the wwtps working on ozone based treatment strategies we found only mls based args that were differentially abundant in in relative to ef samples we observed an increased abundance of sulfonamide based args in the ef of both uv and ozone based wwtps while aminoglycoside was found in increased abundance in the ef of chlorine based wwtps although these results were non significant in in and ef but their persistent release into the environmental waters means that wwtps either facilitate the propagation of args or add the pre existing args moreover uv based treatments have been reported to enrich sulfadiazine tetracycline and chloramphenicol args guo et al 2013 while betalactam args have been reported to be increased by uv chlorine and ozone based treatment strategies alexander et al 2016 ferro et al 2017 liu et al 2018a sulfonamide based args have been reported to be enriched during the chlorination process liu et al 2018a furthermore we investigated how the wwtp treatment process affects the alpha diversity of the resistome and microbiome the results in fig s4 show that none of the treatment processes affected the diversity of the resistome or the microbiome while ozone and uv decreased microbiome species richness p 0 05 mann whitney u test and ozone alone decreased resistome species richness p 0 001 mann whitney u test these results suggest that ozone is most effective in removing minor species of bacteria and types of args but the majority of genera and args persist regardless of the type of treatment process previously it was suggested that chlorine could enrich args during the treatment process liu et al 2018a but we observed that chlorine treatment did not affect the resistome or microbiome 3 3 identification of core resistome and determination of their genetic context in this study we defined the core resistome as persistent args that were identified in all sites irrespective of the treatment process or location we identified 48 different args that were detected in all sampling sites where aminoglycoside bacitracin and betalactam were the most abundant fig 2 a the proportion of core args in each sample ranged between 30 and 94 fig s5 indicating that a relatively large portion of args was persistent and abundant irrespective of the treatment method antibiotic residues and args have been reported in treated water al riyami et al 2018 providing a persistent selection pressure and possibly resulting in the occurrence or emergence of novel antimicrobial determinants an et al 2018 therefore a high proportion of core args in ef suggest that these args are regularly disseminated into the environment raising serious public health concerns certain anthropogenic parameters like population coverage medical and pharmaceutical facilities capacity of wwtps and the tn of sewage water was significantly correlated with the core args fig s1 suggesting that anthropogenic activities may result in increasing the abundance of persistent args moreover the relative abundance of individual core resistomes revealed that the abundance of aph 3ʹʹ ib sul1 and rbpa was significantly higher in ef than in in while only arna was higher in in than in ef p 0 05 mann whitney u test figs 2 b s6 the increased abundance in ef suggests that wwtps provide favorable conditions for either the proliferation of these args or the addition of pre existing args in the treated water for instance activated sludge has been reported to be the main source of sul1 munir et al 2011 and uv can enrich the abundance of rifampicin resistant genes in final effluents guo et al 2013 arg richness in treated water has also been reported to be strongly influenced by the biomass composition of influents ju et al 2019 taken together these observations indicate that wwtps make the receiving environment more vulnerable to identify the genetic makeup of core args in the ef samples we checked their presence on plasmid or chromosomal contigs as well as co occurrence with mges vfgs and metal resistant genes we observed that a significantly higher abundance of core args against aminoglycoside and bacitracin was found on the chromosome while significantly more core args against sulfonamide and tetracycline were on plasmids p 0 01 mann whitney u test fig 3 in the in samples we observed that sulfonamide tetracycline and mls were significantly more abundant on plasmid contigs p 0 01 mann whitney u test fig s7 chromosomal args related to aminoglycoside and bacitracin are reported to increase the minimum inhibitory concentration mic by expressing more than those on plasmids and these chromosomal drug modifying enzymes are transmissible among other genera islam et al 2009 in addition a higher mic may often lead to the persistence of these args in environmental settings moreover chromosomal args have the ability to easily undergo mutations due to their involvement with impermeability type resistance or efflux mediated resistance westbrock wadman et al 1999 the uptake of args by hgt may also end up in chromosomes and the free dna released by chromosomes can also be taken up by neighboring bacteria croucher et al 2016 the dissemination mechanisms for chromosomal args need to be clarified through further investigations on the other hand args carried by plasmids are of great clinical concern due to their association with pathogenic bacteria and their ability to undergo hgt more readily carattoli 2013 san millan 2018 in line with our results it has been reported that sulfonamide and tetracycline resistant genes were the most ubiquitous args in environmental waters due to their presence on plasmids stange et al 2019 furthermore the association of core args with mges metal resistant genes phages vfgs and resistome risk score was evaluated our results showed that mges plasmid based args chromosomal args and resistome score were significantly correlated with the abundance of core args in in while only the abundance of phages was correlated with the abundance of core args in ef p 0 05 fig 4 interestingly metal resistant genes and vfgs were correlated with the abundance of chromosomal args only which indicates that these are not as transmissible as mges although we did not find any correlation between core args and mges or plasmids we detected mges and plasmids in ef suggesting that their persistent release into the environment would be problematic lysogenic phages have the ability to transfer bacterial genetic information through transduction these phages are ubiquitous and abundant in aquatic environments thus they are potential carriers of core args jebri et al 2021 the mges of the family enterobacteriaceae have the ability to hijack the dna packing ability of phages for the transfer of args fillol salom et al 2019 our results suggest that the role of these args should be carefully evaluated to better understand the factors involved in their persistence 3 4 correlation and co occurrence analysis of core resistome and microbiome possible bacterial hosts of the core args were identified by spearman correlation analysis from which we observed a different correlation network for in and ef the correlation pattern shown for in revealed that oxa 233 aac 6ʹ ib and aada2 were the major args that were associated with at least 10 different bacterial genera while alicycliphilus and rhodopseudomonas were the major bacterial genera correlated with at least six different args fig s8a alicycliphilus denitrificans and rhodopseudomonas palustris are quinolone degrading bacteria but have also been reported to be carrying args in wwtps mutharasaiah et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 in ef aac 6ʹ 31 and ges 3 were correlated with a minimum of seven different bacterial genera while arcobacter desulfovibrio and tolumonas were associated with at least four different args fig s8b arcobacter and tolumonas have been reported to be associated with arg transmission in effluents and influents of wwtps hultman et al 2018a millar and raghavan 2017 while desulfovibrio has also been reported to be associated with mobile args in wwtps wang et al 2013 the abundance of contigs carrying args was summarized according to the taxonomy assigned to each contig fig s9 the results showed that in in and ef pseudomonas acinetobacter rahnella and enterobacter were the major arg carrying genera some of these are known opportunistic pathogens and are also reported to carry multiple args yuan et al 2019 acinetobacter pseudomonas rahnella and janthinobacterium were the major bacterial genera carrying core args while similar genera were identified as potential hosts carrying core args in in and ef massilia was found to be relatively higher in ef than in in massilia spp have been reported in diverse habitats but mainly among the root colonizing bacteria in the soil microbiome ofek et al 2012 these opportunistic bacteria especially acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp can easily develop multidrug resistance properties additionally owing to their ability to adapt to various aquatic environments they can even exploit wwtps as a possible microbial niche bonomo and szabo 2006 trautmann et al 2005 warskow and juni 1972 correlation analysis between eskape pathogens and core arg abundance indicated that acinetobacter baumannii enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the major species carrying core args in both in and ef fig 5 these results suggest that the core args in correlation with eskape pathogens are of immediate concern for public health and environmental protection eskape pathogens are difficult to treat because of their outer membranes and they can migrate easily in different environmental compartments bairán et al 2020 moreover these pathogens have been detected during all phases of the treatment process in wwtps che et al 2019 3 5 five year longitudinal analysis among the 12 wwtps we monitored the jr and sn wwtps for five years to investigate temporal differences in antibiotic resistance these wwtps are located in seoul the capital of south korea with high anthropogenic activity the abundance of args in in was generally higher than in ef with a few exceptions the trend was almost identical in all five years in which aminoglycoside bacitracin and beta lactam were the major arg classes fig 1 b during these five years the abundance of sul1 was always significantly higher in ef in both wwtps p 0 05 we observed a slightly different pattern of resistome in the 2017 and 2019 samples in the pca analysis fig 6 b in the core resistome analysis of both wwtps 48 different args were identified to be persistent throughout the five years the abundance of core args was consistently more than 55 of the total arg abundance in the ef of jr while for sn it was always more than 65 throughout the five years bacitracin was the most abundant arg class observed in both wwtps followed by aminoglycosides and sulfonamides fig 6 a pca analysis revealed that these wwtps were more similar in the core resistome profile than in the total resistome the treated water of these two wwtps is often mixed with the han river which is prone to anthropogenic activities the geographical location of the han river shows an increased population density downstream lee et al 2020 making the persistent release of args a major public health concern 4 conclusion in conclusion we analyzed the core resistome profiles of urban wwtp in and ef by adopting a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach the results of our study indicate that clinically important args are not properly treated using current strategies aminoglycoside bacitracin and betalactam are continuously released into the environment which could result in the development of extreme drug resistance xdr pathogens wwtps operating with different treatment strategies including uv ozone and chlorine based treatment methods were not found to reduce arg richness in the final efs pseudomonas and acinetobacter were the major genera found to carry the core args when attempting to describe the pathogenic potential of core args and eskape pathogens we did not find any significant difference between the co occurrence patterns of in and ef samples moreover most of the core args were located on chromosomal contigs but we found that sulfonamide and tetracycline args were significantly abundant in plasmid contigs which further implicates the mobility of these args in the environment although neither mges plasmids nor eskape pathogens in ef were correlated with core args their consistent presence in the treated water could make them readily available for uptake by environmental bacteria
